            <li>Amazing clippers!</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are amazing!</li>
            <li>, I was just more impressed with the toenail clippers.</li>
            <li>Great quality - maybe too good?  </li>
            <li>The weight and blade on these are superb and I could not ask for anything more.</li>
            <li>Given how often and how many times you will use nail clippers over your lifetime, don&#x27;t you deserve to use the best?  </li>
            <li>Great quality, good price and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The most awesome nail clippers ever.</li>
            <li>These are excellent, I keep them in the shower on a semi-dry shelf, they have been there for 6 months or more, and no sign of rust.</li>
            <li>These clippers are spectacular!</li>
            <li>the most wonderful thing ever!!</li>
            <li>These cut perfectly every time with the satisfying clip noise.</li>
            <li>For the cost, everyone should own a pair!</li>
            <li>These clippers are remarkably well-made, both in design and execution.</li>
            <li>Best I have ever found and I have had dozens in many price ranges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned many clippers over the years, and this is hands-down the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>The best is that you don&#x27;t have to struggle trying to align the top after spinning it around since it&#x27;s locked in place.</li>
            <li>What a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is an excellent nail clipper the best I have ever used and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to cut; I was quite impressed.  </li>
            <li>These are easily the best clippers I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>Although it does not have a file, it is otherwise easily the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>arrived very quickly and was the best price I could find on the internet.</li>
            <li>THis is a  fine piece of  perfectly machined perfection.</li>
            <li>Buying the best frying pan doesn&#x27;t make you a master chef, buying the best dSLR doesn&#x27;t make you a professional photographer, and buying this nail clipper doesn&#x27;t make you a manicurist.</li>
            <li>Good to know some products are still built with quality in mind.</li>
            <li>Fantastic -- best my husband</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t imagine how good</li>
            <li>I set out to buy a &#x27;good&#x27; pair of nail clippers, and stumbled across all the glowing reviews of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and she did and loved them, so she&#x27;s ordering herself one too.</li>
            <li>I bought it for the pleasure of using a superior tool.</li>
            <li>And it is superior.</li>
            <li>In fact, I don&#x27;t have to get out of the shower and immediately trim my nails for a good result.  </li>
            <li>I saw good reviews on this product and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li>so I thought I would order a good pair.  </li>
            <li>If you are anything like me, spend the bucks and buy a good set of nail clippers and then guard them from getting up and walking away.</li>
            <li>The clipper cuts good</li>
            <li>They are so good.</li>
            <li>Superb product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the cheap Trimz nail clippers all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts that smoothly and perfectly!!    </li>
            <li>This thing really is as good as everyone else says.</li>
            <li>Then I saw an ad in BMWs roundel magazine for a superior clipper called Klhip.  </li>
            <li>Good quality steel construction.</li>
            <li>GIve me a quite good experience</li>
            <li>I started my search again and was delighted to find the Seki clipper.</li>
            <li>What a good set of nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Good quality steel though.</li>
            <li>You owe it to yourself to have a good pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li>Good service.  </li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good look and feel.</li>
            <li>So, probably as good as a nail clipper gets?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vastly overpriced, and not that good.</li>
            <li>I made a good choice.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s like 95% just as good.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a good nail clipper for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned my Seki fingernail clippers for years now, and they still work as good as the 1st day</li>
            <li>I wanted a good pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>But like a good knife, you keep it in a good sheath or block til you need it.</li>
            <li>Never knew what good clippers were like until I tried these.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>This is a good buy</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>Good vendor.</li>
            <li>Good quality clippers.  </li>
            <li>These have a good feel in the hand, no rust,</li>
            <li>I have always wanted some good nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>This is a good fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li>I bought a set of these nail clippers for my husband a good year or two ago, and they still work just as well as the day we got them.</li>
            <li>Good job.</li>
            <li>I also own the toe nail clipper and it works great too.  </li>
            <li>good product  and service</li>
            <li>I have never used good clipper before apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>Good choice</li>
            <li>Never had anything this good.</li>
            <li>A good purchase.</li>
            <li>Good weight and well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pleasure to use good tools.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, they are the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I let my wife try them out, and she loved them.</li>
            <li>Without doubt the best nail clipper available anywhere.  </li>
            <li>So superior, there is no contest.</li>
            <li>So this is good product</li>
            <li>Good quality nail clippers.</li>
            <li>I bought these based on the reviews here and must agree with what others say, these are good quality for the price.</li>
            <li>Thoroughly perturbed, I looked online for the best pair available, price be damned, and found the Seki Edge.</li>
            <li>good quality clippers</li>
            <li>good design and materials.</li>
            <li>good for nails of all kinds.</li>
            <li>I feel like I am just pinching off the nail, not getting a good cut.</li>
            <li>This is really a good quality product</li>
            <li>The quality seems superior to any others I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li>I started thinking, if the toenail clippers are as good as everyone says, I&#x27;ll regret it if I don&#x27;t get some fingernail clippers to go with the toenail clippers.  </li>
            <li>I never thought that nail clippers could be this good.</li>
            <li>The metal quality is good.  </li>
            <li>and just feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>It feels good in your hand and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>Buy a good metal file from the drug store.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use and great results!</li>
            <li>but it is as good as I have had.</li>
            <li>Really good clipper....</li>
            <li>This fingernail clipper is every bit as good as the toenail model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good size for finger nails.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, yes.</li>
            <li>Feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re that good.  </li>
            <li>So good</li>
            <li>Good news:</li>
            <li>you found it, and everyone is saying that in these reviews for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a perfect stainless steel!!!  </li>
            <li>Cuts through nails like butter, feels great, perfectly ergonomic, just the right size, etc.</li>
            <li>It gives you a perfect clean cut.</li>
            <li>These go through in one quick cut - awesome.</li>
            <li>They make a very satisfying noise when the metal blades close together.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I have not used very many pairs of nail clippers throughout my life.</li>
            <li>I bought this for myself (after buying a fancy case with lots of tools for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day) and I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Easily worth the price, best clipper ive ever used.  </li>

            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely, I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>The Seki  clipper is strong and elegant, leaving a flawless nail end.</li>
            <li>These are very nice clippers, much better than Revlon.</li>
            <li>They are still very good clippers, but I think would be best for adults nails (especially men).</li>
            <li>Also, these are truly a fine example of beautiful industrial design.</li>
            <li>I would love to say it has a great heat treat to temper the steel, but I honestly don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I have never used better clippers!</li>
            <li>So pleased with these!</li>

            <li>or you could lose more than nail!</li>
            <li>Excellent Item and Fast Shipping!</li>

            <li>It is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Now he&#x27;s fine though, and happy too.</li>
            <li>Besides that, it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>the price, these are an amazing value.  </li>
            <li>Clipping your toenails with those are just as amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>I ordered a pair from Solingen and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>These are amazing.  </li>

            <li>I have to agree the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Nail Clippers are the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>These stainless steel clippers are the best.  </li>
            <li>This is a nicely constructed clipper.  </li>
            <li>This clipper is probably the best that I have seen and feels like a surgical instrument in your hand since it is made of stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>They cut easily and cleanly and are the best clippers we&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, they look good :)</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>- Features: It would have been nice if these nail clippers came with a file.  </li>
            <li>The build quality is like a tank and yet it feels nice to hold in the hand.  </li>
            <li>The angles and curvatures throughout the design also contribute to a nice looking clipper.  </li>
            <li>These are so nice</li>
            <li>Your friends, family, loved ones may never know a better way exists until you show them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled beyond belief that I have found this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>a superior product for hygiene - never buy  a cheap clipper again!</li>
            <li>It feels nice in hand.</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s kind of like comparing a Honda to a Ferrari, the difference in quality and performance is just that</li>
            <li>This seki is really nice.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m betting this thing will end up costing me a dollar a year after all the years I&#x27;ll own it.</li>
            <li>kind</li>
            <li>Nice, high-quality product.  </li>
            <li>very well made clippers, probable the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>no breakages of any kind, no rust, no peeling of any surface parts</li>
            <li>and I had to file the edges because it was catching on everything.  </li>
            <li>Really loving the feel, and quality of these.  </li>
            <li>I kind of wish the leaver were thinner and the length of the clipper though.</li>
            <li>Nice design, IMO&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clips nicely, cuts nicely, and leaves your nails looking nice.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if it had a hole to put it on a chain or keyring.</li>
            <li>Very well built and work great!</li>
            <li>Superb quality and easily cuts the finger nails without using any force, or having to twist it upside-down to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>Would have liked a file to be part of this.</li>
            <li>One way to break that habit is to have a nail clipper handy when you get the urge to chomp away.</li>
            <li>this thing slices through my nails like a warm knife through butter.</li>
            <li>really nice clippers,</li>
            <li>I would have liked a stud or mechanism to keep the clipper handle from sliding around.  </li>
            <li>I would also have liked the clipper to have a keyrig hole instead of slits.</li>
            <li>They leave your nails kind of rigid.  </li>
            <li>As a child the best personal tools were from Japan &amp; they are still great.  </li>
            <li>They also have a nice weight to them, don&#x27;t rust</li>
            <li>Absolute best quality nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this nail clipper, I used to own Zwilling Ultra Slim clipper.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>cuts so nicely....</li>
            <li>It is compact, gives good cut, and a satisfying click.  </li>
            <li>My own nails were damaged by acrylics</li>
            <li>All were the inexpensive variety, the kind you find in supermarkets or drugstores.  </li>
            <li>The Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper does an excellent job!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of OCD about my fingernails</li>
            <li>These are the absolute best nail clippers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, no, this does not cut hangnails effectively, it does not have an integrated file.</li>
            <li>I own both finger and toe nail versions.</li>
            <li>Yes absolutely the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Nicely designed, too.</li>
            <li>his own pair bc mine kept disappearing.</li>
            <li>Leave a nice cut, no tearing of nails.  </li>
            <li>Own three pairs, so I am never without.</li>
            <li>While they seem of excellent build quality the lever should be stainless steel, and not die cast metal.</li>
            <li>and they remarked how nice it is and asked where they could get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the storage position there is not a detent or lock of any kind to keep the thumb lever from rotating.</li>
            <li>Nice weight.  </li>
            <li>My philosophy in life is buy it nice or buy it twice.</li>
            <li>honestly don’t think I will ever have to buy another pair of finger nail clippers in my life.</li>
            <li>These are really nice nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many clippers over the years, but none as good as these.  </li>
            <li>So nice to have reliable clippers</li>
            <li>I really liked it.</li>
            <li>These clippers are quite nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;re here because, like me, you&#x27;re done with chopped-up hack jobs, and you&#x27;re ready to spend what it takes to feel awesome about what just happened at your finger tips.  </li>
            <li>As good or better than all that filing I was doing to correct what my clippers should have been accomplishing themselves.&lt;br /&gt;-The steel.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think so.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and worth the money - they are so good my wife stole mine</li>
            <li>Both are excellent clippers and deserving of their high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great clipper, very accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It clips really cleanly, with great feel, but that&#x27;s all it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First blades, then hair wax (look up UNO &amp; Gatsby wax), now nail clippers, lol, Japan makes good stuff.  </li>
            <li>The construction is top notch, the metal used exceptional.</li>
            <li>EXCELLENT HIGH QUALITY ITEM</li>
            <li>I wish all clippers were so nice and easy to handle!</li>
            <li>and im deff happy with the purchase its sharp and has a great feel to it great size.</li>
            <li>Best nail clippers available - stays sharp and works perfectly!</li>
            <li>best nail clippers I own so far, and you can tell it&#x27;s made with quality material</li>
            <li>The weight feels nice in the hand and the spring action is wonderful.</li>
            <li>A quality clip, feels strong, they&#x27;re good clippers, what else is there to say?</li>
            <li>It also has a good edge and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT GOOD PRICE FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li>There are an incredible amount of positive comments about this product that are well deserved.  </li>
            <li>However, their design makes them very easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li>I have very strong finger nails</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>These work very smooth and effectively.  </li>
            <li>I imagine I will get more adept at using them over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are by far the best!  </li>
            <li>I thought for the price it would be more handy.  </li>
            <li>As far as fingernail clippers go, this is one of the best.</li>
            <li>I am ordering a deluxe Seki nail clipper that will hold the nail in one place, after it is clipped, just like the my antique Hello Kitty nail clipper :)</li>
            <li>Unlike the cheap units, I&#x27;m guessing that Seki has good quality control that results in each unit being just like all the others that roll off the line.  </li>
            <li>bought two more for my husbands toiletry case and one for my own that we travel with.</li>
            <li>The revlon deluxe clippers have a better edge.  </li>
            <li>These are by far the best clippers I have ever used in my life, and I&#x27;m over 40.</li>
            <li>Since I didn&#x27;t do any research, I just decided to buy the most popular nail clipper on Amazon and ended up with this.</li>
            <li>and they are by far the best nail clippers I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Best nail clippers I have found so far.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best nail clipper that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>By far the best.  </li>
            <li>I bought these for my mom, as she has arthritis and has not been able to cut her own nails.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best fingernail clipper I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>However, the quality and sharpness is excellent and far surpasses anything you can buy in a drugstore.</li>
            <li>never really thought about how wonderful it could be to have nice clippers until i bought these!</li>
            <li>they, in turn, pass on to theirs at which time its value as a beautifully functioning antique will  be such that they will have the joy of living in luxury.</li>
            <li>The edge is great and the right size for a woman&#x27;s fingernails.  </li>
            <li>, they are very nice, easy to grip and fairly light.</li>
            <li>So many years of using a cheap one made my first experience with this clipper quite a happy one!  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless it is very good product, and highly recomended.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as great as my old Hoffritz, but still good.</li>
            <li>I think the product appears to be higher quality and packaging was great.  </li>
            <li>I decided to order this and was pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>True to form, they are vastly superior to anything else either of us</li>
            <li>These are certainly the best that and most comfortable clippers that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li>My family has been using J.A. Henckle Nail clipper for 8 years (works great even now), and I love it very much.</li>
            <li>Very precise clipper, will show you how well you trim your nails.</li>
            <li>The edge is very smooth.  </li>
            <li>Leaves nail very smooth after the cut.</li>
            <li>Very precise.</li>
            <li>Very smooth operation</li>
            <li>no falling apart, good quick cut.</li>
            <li>I used to dump out the new can of clippers and sort out the good ones and then do it again till I got a good pair .</li>
            <li>Just a quick review - this really is the best clipper ever.</li>
            <li>makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li>Love the Seki line...</li>
            <li>These look nicer than most.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Same with the Seki Edge Toenail clippers, these are the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re better than the Tweezerman clippers, because they&#x27;re sharper, and because of the molded grip on them.</li>
            <li>Son-in-law was pleased.</li>
            <li>He says he had never used a better set of clippers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as though they admitted that these are better than what they could</li>
            <li>so you feel like you have much more power.</li>
            <li>so you feel like you have much more power.</li>
            <li>Another top of the line product.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor, though, and buy more than one.</li>
            <li>I bought and lost many years ago....</li>
            <li>these simply perform perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this set of clippers</li>
            <li>My friend has $50 nail clippers which are her favorite</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I listened to the reviews.</li>
            <li>and I will never buy a cheap drugstore pair again!  </li>
            <li>I love this thing and am assured I will never have to purchase another finger nail clipper again.  </li>
            <li>The Seki doesn&#x27;t have one, and I find I miss it more than I thought.  </li>
            <li>I find the Seki Edge Finger Nail clipper ok.</li>
            <li>Simply put, these are the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many crappy $1 finger nail clippers are there in the world?</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>Is it that much better that</li>
            <li>Ok for nails</li>
            <li>As with many of my Amazon purchases, this was based on the highest ratings.</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;ll try it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m just being picky, but for $15</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands and styles and this one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li>I bought one to try and have bought a couple more since because they work so well.  </li>
            <li>Many more out there</li>
            <li>that has a better grip...</li>
            <li>I bought several of these and gave some to relatives - they were similarly impressed.</li>
            <li>However, they are WAY better than any chrome plated cheapo clippers from the store.</li>
            <li>Better than any &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; junk.</li>
            <li>I think I prefer the ones from Sephora, which felt more substantial and</li>
            <li>I also felt like I had a better grip with the Sephora clippers.  </li>
            <li>I just hope these hold up better than the ones from Sephora.</li>
            <li>The Seki are much better.</li>
            <li>Sharper blade, cleaner cut, more durable.</li>
            <li>To have a backup in case something ever happens to my amazing cheap unit.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li>In conclusion, the Seki fingernail clipper is an okay unit.  </li>
            <li>This fingernail clipper is a flawlessly engineered piece of Japanese steelwork.</li>
            <li>they work ok on my toe nails but still leave the nail jagged</li>
            <li>And I always thought I couldn&#x27;t do any better.</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>They have a satisfying \\&quot;clip\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that I bought the fingernail clipper.  </li>
            <li>It is always better to buy in person I guess?</li>
            <li>, what can i say more about it.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t hold off go ahead and buy them, you will be so glad you did.</li>
            <li>The quality of this item is outstanding.</li>
            <li>but the cutter is more blunt-nosed than the cheapies.  </li>
            <li>These are not inexpensive but they are excellent quality and something that you regularly use.  </li>
            <li>and I’m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>We love our Seki&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>want to thank Seki for making an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>These quality-made clippers are outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more money than I&#x27;ve ever paid for one in the drug store.  </li>
            <li>So glad I found Seki&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find anything better.  </li>
            <li>Now I make sure I don&#x27;t lose these like my others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed they tear my nails more than rip</li>
            <li>The steel used is top notch and it clips my nails easier than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>They are barely better than the cheapest ones you would find at walmart.  </li>
            <li>They go through nails better then el cheapo clippers</li>
            <li>yes, I still primarily use a santoku &amp; pairing knife!</li>
            <li>Japanese fingernail clippers are just awesome.</li>
            <li>Make sure you are positioned correctly on the nail because it will cut through any part of the nail you put in between the blades.</li>
            <li>but I rationalized if it worked well and lasted many years</li>
            <li>Outstanding fingernail clips.</li>
            <li>We also brought the toe nail cutter, and it was much much better, and it work well for finger nails too.</li>
            <li>is that gross--and most people are like, &amp;#34;they are clippers,</li>
            <li>The Seki has a longer handle than most to provide better leverage.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure, continue to serve me through the end of my life.</li>
            <li>(one is enough to do all job), but since Seki nail clipper is so wonderful, I&#x27;m kinda tempted to buy a Toe nail clipper as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased that I just purchased Seki&#x27;s toenail clippers and nostril scissors.</li>
            <li>It would be much better if it was made to also collect the nails as they are cut..</li>
            <li>Love em.</li>
            <li>I look forward to seeing how many years it lasts.  </li>
            <li>a bonus, the look and feel is top notch.</li>
            <li>also don&#x27;t like that the top bar is shorter than the bottom one.  </li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>When I needed an extra pair of clippers, I decided to search Amazon to see what the best pair I could find was.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy looking for sheer practicality in a nail clipper, then a toenail clipper is probably the best thing you can get.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a hand pinky nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Pleased.</li>
            <li>How many cheaper clippers can you say that about?</li>
            <li>We love it.</li>
            <li>I tried based on so many reviews</li>
            <li>but you sure can with this one.</li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have had cheaper brands of nail clippers, but these are definitely the best we&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t lose it, you will love it.</li>
            <li>I got this more than 2 years ago and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are really good and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant about the money but the quality sure makes up for any doubts.  </li>
            <li>Very solid works great!</li>
            <li>Glad I went with the Seki for sure.  </li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t do better...</li>
            <li>Glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li>yay :)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more, for my purse and for stocking stuffers for my sisters.</li>
            <li>They love them.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if there was more texture on the metal parts to prevent it from slipping/moving when using it to cut nails.</li>
            <li>I have never used a clipper better than this one.</li>
            <li>Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li>But nevertheless, you should feel more than confident adding these clippers to your shopping cart.  </li>
            <li>I love this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>When you clip your fingernails, the device should be more rounded where it does the clipping.  </li>
            <li>One of the better nail clippers I have.  </li>
            <li>* Swivels nicely without breaking apart like the cheap Walmart, Dollar store, pharmacy type of</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice smooth edge.</li>
            <li>Glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Trimming nails is always a nuisance, this makes the process much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li>Love these nail clippers.</li>
            <li>I love this brand</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>I guess I will have to find a better hiding place.</li>
            <li>Then I decided to look up a better solution.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Compared to the clippers I&#x27;ve used before, these are magical.</li>
            <li>The clippers you buy at the drugstore or discount stores tear nails more than clip them.  </li>
            <li>In fact, your nails end up being much more neatly trimmed with these.</li>
            <li>and I love the size of these clippers.</li>
            <li>It was just something that was important to me because I like having nice nails</li>

            <li>We ordeed,r (2) will be ordering more</li>
            <li>Well, that is how I&#x27;ve been doing it :)</li>
            <li>Before this, I never used a clipper any better than the ones you find hanging from a pegboard at the Dairy Mart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen tons of better and cheaper nail clippers in Walmart.</li>
            <li>These clipper are well made that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>

            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>This is a a top tier nail clipper.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>The Zwilling Ultra Slim clipper looks great and slim, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nails very well like this Seki Edge.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying any more of those 99 cent clippers at the drug store than mangle my nails.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>So much better than a dollar store clipper.</li>
            <li>so I can grip my strings better (</li>
            <li>the longer my nails, the more they would dig into my fretboard and \\&quot;push\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Outstanding quality</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve EVER used</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO glad I got it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply the best fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve EVER used</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m SO glad I got it.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not used any that are better than Seki.</li>
            <li>There must be a better clipper out there</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are top quality.  </li>
            <li>I do have to say that I&#x27;ve used better ones.  </li>
            <li>and I have owned many.  </li>
            <li>These nail clippers work as well or better than nail clippers should.  </li>
            <li>Upon unpacking it and trying it out, I immediately was OK with the price paid.</li>
            <li>However, this is a quality tool and does an infinitely better job than any clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>My husband is quite picky and the product pleased him.  </li>
            <li>I had piece of nail on the top of my nail and this cutter went through both layers of nails like a knife trough butter.</li>
            <li>Amazing how much better this is than the cheap one I was using.</li>
            <li>These are way better than the pieces of junk from the drug store.</li>
            <li>Works much better than clippers found in drug stores.</li>
            <li>ok dude</li>
            <li>Some Japanese masters on the top of a mountain are making it their life&#x27;s work to bring us the best in nail clipping technologies.</li>
            <li>name intentionally blurred)for $4 that should work OK,</li>
            <li>These are 100 times better than the ehem...</li>
            <li>Maybe it is made more for women&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li>and these simply said are perfect.  </li>
            <li>These are so much better.</li>
            <li>The Seki fingernail clipper works better then</li>
            <li>cut a lot better.</li>
            <li>best and only cosmetic buy for this guy in a while.</li>
            <li>But that may be more perception than reality, because they do cut my nails well.    </li>
            <li>If they came in some sort of male manicure set with a metal file, that would be ideal!</li>
            <li>I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d hoped they&#x27;d be a bit more &amp;#34;stainless.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They are so much better than the ones I was buying at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found them.</li>
            <li>Not all nail clippers are created equal and this one is probably the best.</li>
            <li>Very impressed and relieved to finally be able to cut my nails properly!</li>
            <li>I was also able to reduce the time needed to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li>I just used them once on my toe nails though, but they are at the present moment the best clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li>So I decided to shop for a better quality clipper and got these Seki fingernail and also some Seki toenail clippers.</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>So glad I found them</li>
            <li>They work better than the Seki TOE clippers which I bought a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li>So many things just keep getting cheaper and cheaper.  </li>
            <li>We bought 3 more to keep in suitcases and around the house</li>
            <li>I have the Seki Edge toenail clipper and love it, so I bought this product.  </li>
            <li>I should have known better.</li>
            <li>Way better then $0.99 clippers from the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>I have so many pairs of these I lost count.  </li>
            <li>I am no expert on these things but this surely beats the lightweight cheapies that my wife has bought at drug stores,  </li>
            <li>This clipper is better than the one in that set.</li>
            <li>How many people can say they tore up their house looking for their favorite nail clippers?</li>
            <li>Much better the others I have purchased in the store.  </li>
            <li>Who knew there were better clippers.</li>
            <li>You will wish your nails  grew faster so you ccan cut them more often.</li>
            <li>I would buy them again for sure.</li>
            <li>These clippers remind me more of surgical equipment than nail clippers.</li>
            <li>He says I found it :-)  </li>
            <li>and I would readily be able to find my clippers.  </li>
            <li>I considered purchasing, and I am completely pleased.</li>
            <li>Works effortlessly, like magic.</li>
            <li>I thought they must make something better?</li>
            <li>Could be consider a bit slippery for gripping on the bottom piece.</li>
            <li>After several months of usage...these clippers are the best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li>Much better than the $.99 one at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Who knew you could love a nail clipper?</li>
            <li>I have ordered more of them to give to members of my family.</li>
            <li>I better not lose them.</li>
            <li>I wish it included the cleaner that most have.</li>
            <li>I tried these clippers and they cut better than any I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li>The edge is actually lovely to look at.  </li>
            <li>Nice design, and good stainless steel feel to it.  </li>
            <li>They cut very smooth and clean, like the difference between a cheap knife and a really good one.  </li>
            <li>When I first used these clippers, I literally giggled with joy with how easily they cut through everything.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These clippers work perfectly to make nice clean cuts but that&#x27;s a bonus to actually being able to hold and squeeze them.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend makes fun of me for getting so excited about a pair of nail clipped, but my god, these guys provide the sharpest clip I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li>The edges are still nice and clean but it seems to require more effort.  </li>
            <li>High Quality product !!!!!</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed, these are amazing.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re a good quality metal and the mechanism seems pretty sturdy, but they don&#x27;t seem to cut any better than the many cheaper clippers I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li>These give a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li>just feel great, particularly when typing and playing instruments etc.</li>
            <li>Nice clean cut.</li>
            <li>They go through water-softened nails like butter, and do a nice clean cut no matter the condition.  </li>
            <li>they leave a nice clean edge, no tearing...  </li>
            <li>Nice clean cuts.</li>
            <li>After tossing those, we were willing to pay top dollar for a good clipper.  </li>
            <li>Clips very easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it - great gift idea.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend-works great</li>
            <li>They cut the nail so easy and a leave a nice smooth edge.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, the cut:  The Edge cuts very cleanly, even with the tougher or thicker nails.  </li>
            <li>Very clean cut nails.</li>
            <li>My daughter noticed their superior quality on the first try.</li>
            <li>but since I was on vacation and in a pretty good mood, I examined it and tested it in the shop.</li>
            <li>Since it would be good to connect these to a keychain of sorts, I first thought the slits were for this reason, but I could not figure out how to get them on my keychain.</li>
            <li>Best clippers I have found for a long time .</li>
            <li>Pretty good set of nail clippers.</li>
            <li>These clippers are exactly as described; they feel good in your hand, they don&#x27;t slip around.</li>
            <li>Made entirely of stainless steel (and not the cheapo kind), it feels like these are the superman of nail clippers!</li>
            <li>All the clippers purchased are excellent products I would highly recommend to anyone who wants great clippers at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The best clippers ive ever purchased, very sharp and very easy to hold to</li>
            <li>I was thrown off by the price but being able to hear that my mom can cut her own nails with ease is completely worth it.</li>
            <li>Safe and it easily snips the line.</li>
            <li>The reviews looked good and although the price was a bit more than what I thought reasonable, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>a bonus, it is also more comfortable to hold and better looking than the el-cheapos out there...</li>
            <li>These cost more than the cheap made-in-China stuff, but substantially better.</li>
            <li>These are great; far better than the grocery store, made in China</li>
            <li>Cuts a clean and very easy on thicker nails.</li>
            <li>They cut the nail cleanly every time!</li>
            <li>He was so excited about having located the &amp;#34;worlds best nail clippers&amp;#34; which were these specific nail clippers.</li>
            <li>But never again these are amazing they leave a smooth clean edge and don&#x27;t send the clippings flying.</li>
            <li>really nicely made and super easy to use.</li>
            <li>He keeps it in a special place so as not to misplace the greatest personal tool he has ever owned.</li>
            <li>Amazing and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I had not been happy with old clippers</li>
            <li>They work so much better than the cheap fingernail clippers that you buy everywhere else</li>
            <li>I thoroughly endorse the Seki products, and can&#x27;t imagine there being anything better available.  </li>
            <li>Works much better than the cheap versions you can pick up in any drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Great level of manufacturing and finishing</li>
            <li>Trust me, this clipper is a much, much better gift, and will be around for years after those cheap kits have fallen apart.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are 1000x better than the cheap $1 clippers you might find at Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I needed a bit more in the cart to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li>Happy so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thousand times better than those cheap made-in-china ones that are sold everywhere.  </li>
            <li>- I am not planning to become a clipper test mule - it is more than safe to say that this clips nails easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for and for me these are such awesome clippers</li>
            <li>It has a smooth surface and looks stylish too.</li>
            <li>No really, these are the best freaking nail clippers your ever gonna buy ever.</li>
            <li>fact that they&#x27;re made of real steel instead of the chrome covered pig iron of most cheap clippers is a good sign of their durability.</li>
            <li>I found a cheap pair of all-stainless steel clippers at the big-box superstore for about $3.00 that seem to do a better job.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is a metal on metal sound that irks me but might not bother most people.</li>
            <li>I needed a bit more in the cart to qualify for free shipping. .</li>
            <li>I bought this the Seki clipper and WOW, it is great.  </li>
            <li>Not much to be said here except they are the best nail trimmers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I like the cheap ones I&#x27;ve used for years much better.</li>
            <li>Some of my old clippers had it and it&#x27;s great for trimming side of the nail.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate good steel and these must use it.</li>
            <li>but, the stainless steel cutter is good.</li>
            <li>These really are good clippers.</li>
            <li>Proportionately speaking Revlon is almost as good but so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Great action, sharp edge on the best nail trimmers ever bought.</li>
            <li>very smooth and clean.</li>

            <li>Awesome product, money well spent!  </li>
            <li>SO SHARP, the best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>Now if they would add the plastic sleeve around these to catch the nail clippings, and the built in emery board that some of the other brands have integrated, this would be the perfect set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are the best clippers I have ever used, Blade is sharp and cuts through nails like butter.</li>
            <li>They look cool too!</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS NAILCLIPPER - WORTH THE PRICE!</li>

            <li>Really sharp, excellent precision engineering.</li>
            <li>these are awesome, was surprised it didn&#x27;t come with the little sharp blade that most nail clippers come with under the handle, but still, awesome product, arrived on time, and was packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
            <li>The handle can easily just slide off to the side.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t cut yourself, it&#x27;s just going to do the business it set out to do very quickly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>Easy to use.</li>

            <li>It seems like the drugstore brand of nail clippers used to work fine.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t just use &#x27;fine&#x27; grit and remove a lot of material without ruining the temper.  </li>
            <li>Makes quick work of clipping nails!</li>
            <li>I like to keep my clippers separate, but this fingernail clipper is more than adequate to act as a toenail clipper.  </li>
            <li>Takes some getting used to because it is very sharp and precise, but this is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>These cut crisp and clean!!  </li>
            <li>I found this one and thought kind of funny how people gave excited reviews about it.</li>
            <li>seki is great, cuts smoothly and clean, no sharp edges.</li>
            <li>Seki City, Japan is where some of the world&#x27;s best steels are made, and this little clipper did them justice.</li>
            <li>Awesome little tool for men&#x27;s grooming.</li>
            <li>, these things are super sharp and the feel of the handle is superb.  </li>
            <li>Best nail clipper ever, super sharp and keeps the edge.</li>
            <li>The blades themselves line up perfectly, and are super sharp.</li>
            <li>Super sharp, like the best knives from Japan.</li>
            <li>The Seki clipper cuts cleanly and easily, leaving a smooth edge on the nail.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a huge difference in performance.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t strip the nail and always cuts fully and accurately.</li>
            <li>lot of design work went in to making these feel comfortable and perform well.</li>
            <li>These are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Light weight yet</li>
            <li>The Seki Edge does NOT rip the nail - it cuts it cleanly and easily.  </li>
            <li>We liked them so much we bought another pair for use in our home.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I ordered a pair for a family member.</li>
            <li>Never again will I buy the cheap version of something I use so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make neat, smooth cuts -- never leaves jagged nails.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much, I bought the toenail clipper.</li>
            <li>My dad always had the cheap $1 store ones that broke in a week.</li>
            <li>the cheap ones at the drug store?  </li>
            <li>the material felt cheap.</li>
            <li>One just needs to take a file or emery board and lightly round-off</li>
            <li>All stainless steel and a nice finish are icing on the cake.</li>
            <li>I liked them so much</li>
            <li>these clippers are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Light years ahead of the cheap fingernail clippers sold in drug stores and supermarkets.  </li>
            <li>The cut is not as smooth as it should be.</li>
            <li>the cast metal pusher could be nicer fit and finish</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I put up with crummy cheap nail clippers for 20 years without looking for an alternative like these.</li>
            <li>plus (to me), they are not at all comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They aren&#x27;t cheap, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li>The ergonomics on this are fantastic.</li>
            <li>there was anything but cheap junk nail clippers from Walgreens.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never buy a cheap set of nail clippers again.</li>
            <li>Makes a clean, easy cut every time.  </li>
            <li>These clippers actually make it a joy to cut finger nails.</li>
            <li>I have always purchased the cheap stuff at the drugstore and my nails always seemed to break off instead of being \\&quot;clipped\\&quot; off.</li>
            <li>This is a great set of clippers made in Japan very solid.</li>
            <li>so cheap</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are made out of some sturdy, stainless steel and have a nice weight to them.</li>
            <li>Cut with smooth edges.  </li>
            <li>It cuts nails like butter and leaves smooth edges.  </li>
            <li>They were cheaply made and we gave up in frustration from doing our nails.</li>
            <li>My husband said that they were cheap and we should find ones that weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you, like me, have always used cheap nail clippers from the drug store or convenience store, you owe it to yourself to start using Seki clippers.</li>
            <li>Wasnt sure about these when I ordered them, but they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no file-cleaner blade and nothing to catch the clipped nails from falling on the floor, but if you want the sharpest cut available, this is the one...</li>
            <li>Well you know those cheap ones you buy in the cosmetic aisle at your Wal-Mart or Target?</li>
            <li>I was looking for another cheap nail cutter after mine broke, but saw this one and had to try it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I liked this one so much</li>
            <li>Of course you can always use a nail file (not included with this clipper, you need to buy it separately) to smooth out your nails or let them be smoothed out \\&quot;naturally\\&quot; over some time.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it, I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of nail clippers in my life, but I haven&#x27;t found any that swings as smoothly or feels as high-quality as this pair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I finally pulled the trigger and bought these.  </li>
            <li>Buddy cut me free with his knife with a lot of hacking.</li>
            <li>It is  made of stainless steel and has a nice weight instead of flimsy lightweight steel.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t wobble.  </li>
            <li>but still great product and will definitely use it..</li>
            <li>Any nail clippers I bought from the store were extremely cheap.</li>
            <li>I always end up having to file my nails afterward to get a smooth edge.  </li>
            <li>It matched the toenail clipper and its a &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; so I bought them at the same time worked out great</li>
            <li>This prevents cracking and things that cheap clippers can cause.</li>
            <li>This happened each time I tried them, so I grabbed my magnifying glass and my fear was confirmed.</li>
            <li>They take almost zero pressure to clip through the nail and are fairly comfortable to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li>The clipper moves smoothly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are nicely textured and very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Everything works smoothly and efficiently, and is easuly held and used by the weaker hand.  </li>
            <li>they aren&#x27;t cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>great clippers , they are easy to use, steady and cut really well</li>
            <li>I let a few of my friends try this out, and they were so impressed.  </li>
            <li>These are absolutely fantastic nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>and they are light-years ahead of those cheap generics.</li>
            <li>Incredibly smooth operation, you don&#x27;t get the &#x27;click&#x27; or &#x27;snap&#x27; like the cheaper models of clippers.</li>
            <li>Miles ahead of the the cheap drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li>This is one fantastic nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold, cuts effortlessly, and leaves a clean edge.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight in the hand, and feels like it&#x27;s built really well.</li>
            <li>There is no comparison between this one and the cheap drugstore nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>Makes trimming fun, wish my nails would grow faster so i could use more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing made in USA available there.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Seriouisly, I CANNOT stand cheap crappy nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>The Seki ones are a HUGE improvement and I will never buy the cheap ones again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how smoothly and effortlessly these trim nails.</li>
            <li>Its so precise and effortless when using</li>
            <li>Leaves smooth cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the cheap one&#x27;s rust up.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending these to everyone I know, and will be trying to convince everyone to trash their cheap clippers.</li>
            <li>The cheap clippers don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve been using the cheap models sold at the drugstore, treat yourself to one of these.</li>
            <li>liked it so much that I order another</li>
            <li>sound</li>
            <li>THIS IS HOW THE CHEAP CLIPPERS WORK.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I actually decided to go ahead and spend the money on these clippers.</li>
            <li>Nice clipper, works very well</li>
            <li>This is one of those &amp;#34;buy it for life&amp;#34; purchases that makes you happy to do something as simple as clipping your nails.</li>
            <li>so cheap cutters suck for me.</li>
            <li>One day, I was using a 99 cent pair of finger nail clippers and they broke because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li>The clipping lever is formed so your thumb meets it comfortably and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>The blade edges are usefully sharp--no more cheapies for</li>
            <li>/&gt;The order was filled and sent in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>They cut cleanly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Regardless of how well they cut, you still need a file to smooth things out.  </li>
            <li>These really work nice.</li>
            <li>So I went and bought a replacement at a local pharmacy paying good price thinking it will be better than those cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomics are important, but the quality of the cut and the quality of the steel to hold the edge is everything.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as my old pair at nipping my hangnails.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it was as good as my old $1.98 unit...</li>
            <li>These clippers feel good in my hand and they actually cut my nails better than anything I have used before.</li>
            <li>Nice solid design with a satin finish looks nice but all I care about is</li>
            <li>The last good nail clipper that I purchased at a retail store was many years ago, it was Korean made.  </li>
            <li>I love that they feel very sturdy with a ridge on top for your thumb or finger.</li>
            <li>High quality, nice weight and feel, easy to use.</li>
            <li>clippers just go right through with that satisfying click</li>
            <li>clippers just go right through with that satisfying click</li>
            <li>and it clipped my nails very cleanly and with a distinct &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; sound each time.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great product that&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I know that is a strong reaction to nail clippers, but it is a true statement.</li>
            <li>Nice, slightly larger size makes it very easy to use and comfortable in the hand too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li>Made very well!!!</li>
            <li>Worth every cent, these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had by a very wide margin.</li>
            <li>This thing cuts super precise and it&#x27;s easy peasy.</li>
            <li>This is vitally important for anyone with a significant loss of dexterity or hand/grip strength.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more pricy than most brands, but it is the sharpest clipper I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it is high quality.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent, high quality nail clipper from Japan that I can see lasting for years and years.</li>
            <li>These are nice strong clippers with a solid edge, and they give the satisfying &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; sound when they blast through the fingernail with the tenacity of a samurai sword.</li>
            <li>The metal is very nice and refined, and the pieces do not grind against each other like many others do.  </li>
            <li>These will clip smoothly and cleanly, with no ripping.</li>
            <li>They do the job cleanly without leaving ragged nails like the cheap ones do.</li>
            <li>The cut is clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>The Seki produces a smooth, clean cut.</li>
            <li>nail cutter trims throw nails effortlessly and leaves a clean smooth edge.</li>
            <li>, delivering a clean, smooth cut every time ...</li>
            <li>The Seki have kept their edge and work smoothly unlike others that seem to catch and not cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>This item is to normal nail clippers like a nice set of flatware is to a cheap set of flatware.  </li>
            <li>Quality product, makes trimming nails quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Its also nice to have an improved finger grip as I always used to slip and twist my nail with the older style nail clippers.</li>
            <li>My wife loved them so much she bought two more pairs and threw all our old ones out!</li>
            <li>Kind of high in price,</li>
            <li>Its great because it was way better then the previous clippers I had because this one was way faster and sharper.</li>
            <li>Great clippers, but toe nail clippers are even better and require less effort.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s worth noting that though Seki sells a toe-nail clipper, for me these fingernail clippers are more than adequate for my toes as well.</li>

            <li>Felco Classic Manual Hand Pruner #F-2]] (for gardening purposes which I highly recommend) when using it and yielding great results.  </li>
            <li>clean cut，nice design，I love it very much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if I&#x27;m still using these clippers when I&#x27;m 85, I&#x27;ll feel like I got my $ worth out of them!</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>That may sound hyperbolic but I am telling it, it is 100% literally true.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I decided to trust the reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I read the first review that is listed as most helpful and</li>
            <li>I originally bought the Clyppi Fingernail Clipper and returned it because&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li>Buying another one, lost my original during a move.</li>
            <li>worth the money!</li>
            <li>I originally bought these two years ago.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price!</li>
            <li>My husband and I ordered this awhile ago and at first, we were in love.</li>
            <li>First let me say that I have had 99 cent clippers do a better job than these.</li>
            <li>Even though my finger nails weren&#x27;t exactly getting out of control, I was so pleased with the results on my toenails, I went ahead and worked my fingers over with these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>Get excited about nail clippers?</li>
            <li>Very sharp and very good quality.</li>
            <li>Cuts very good, hard to hold, needs a better grip..</li>
            <li>and you end up with a nail more akin to a stop sign than a smooth arc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going into the trash, and getting replaced with the el cheapo Revlon clippers that you can find in the drugstore (and certainly here at Amazon too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So most people probably view fingernail clippers as a pretty basic drug store staple, but this is far and away the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>excellent design and leverage means that you don&#x27;t have to squeeze them as hard as you do with a cheap pair.  </li>
            <li>Great, sharp and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>well, I wish it had a nail file on it to clean up after the trim</li>
            <li>The cut is so clean that you can get away with not having to touch up with a file.</li>
            <li>It gives your nails a clean cut..</li>
            <li>I figured the cost would be worth it if they did as good a job as my old unit.    </li>
            <li>I had a cheap Trim brand clipper that I had for years and loved - but recently lost.  </li>
            <li>No file, but no need with a clean cut.</li>
            <li>It cuts the nail cleanly.  </li>
            <li>clips cleanly thru the nail.</li>
            <li>Precision cuts and clean edges.</li>
            <li>These cleanly and effortlessly cut nails.</li>
            <li>They clip cleanly with virtually no effort to exert pressure.</li>
            <li>Nice, smooth action.  </li>
            <li>Requires minimum pressure to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li>Effortlessly get a clean snip each time.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly and without the crush.  </li>
            <li>The cuts are so clean I never needed to file in conjunction with my cut.  </li>
            <li>These Seki clippers cut quickly and precisely - I&#x27;d make the analogy that they are the Formula One version of clippers.  </li>
            <li>Bought on a whim, I figured I&#x27;d try a quality clipper for once rather than the super cheap ones.</li>
            <li>They cleanly clip, and do not tear, your nail.  </li>
            <li>I pulled out my trusty $3 clippers that always cut cleanly and looked at them under the magnifying glass to verify what I already knew...</li>
            <li>and they just don&#x27;t cut clean.  </li>
            <li>Cuts nails so cleanly</li>
            <li>They clip cleanly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>These clippers clean them up.</li>
            <li>that tells you it&#x27;s cut cleanly through the nail.  </li>
            <li>that tells you it&#x27;s cut cleanly through the nail.  </li>
            <li>The sharpest and clean cut fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li>There are so many cheap clippers out there, how do you find the one that really works?  </li>
            <li>It gives your nails a clean cut..</li>
            <li>The difference between the cheap concenience store nail clippers and this professional grade clipper is astounding.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly with no effort.  </li>
            <li>Clean cuts.</li>
            <li>They cut my fingernails clean and neat.  </li>
            <li>Well made and cuts clean.</li>
            <li>so must actually be a good grade of stainless, and appear to be made very well.  </li>
            <li>Until you buy it and use it you will have had no idea that clipping your nails could be such a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality nail clipper that is worthy of the high price and great reviews.</li>
            <li>Very precise and clean, so much nicer that even the $8.00 - $10.00 clippers that you find in stores.</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far with how quick the product came and the product itself.</li>
            <li>The material is very durable, and very light.</li>
            <li>And it cuts nails so superbly that I think I got a little too excited the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>It was great to find the edges so sharp and precise in shaping my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>Now I clip, and do a quick filing of the top of the edge, done - smooth, not scratchy or jagged, and very time efficient.</li>
            <li>But here I am, sharing my love for a certain set of nail clippers on the internet, for everyone and their mother to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is nothing special at all about the function of these Seki Edge (model SS-106) fingernail clippers.  </li>
            <li>Nope, he was right!  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, great feel, easy to grip, dont know what else to say - I did tell my wife she can check it out</li>
            <li>They work perfectly, but for the price, I would have wanted a nail file or at least a nail file tip to clean under the nail.</li>
            <li>love em, they are nice and sharp and easy to hang on to.</li>
            <li>I really like these nail clippers, they are very high end, yet reliable, definitely the best bang for your buck</li>
            <li>Very smooth action, easy to control.  </li>
            <li>We purchased the infant Seki edge clippers and liked them SO much that we just bought the Seki Edge Stainless Steel clippers for me and my husband!</li>
            <li>Worth the extra bucks for a nice job!</li>
            <li>These clippers do cut with great ease but leave a rough cut on the nail.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I don&#x27;t really drive an Aston Martin or wear a Panerai</li>
            <li>Overall a good look and feel to the clippers themselves</li>
            <li>So now, I buy really good quality grooming tools such as these and keep them where my kids don&#x27;t know where they are at.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li>because if I see jam, I&#x27;d rather just cut my nails short and give them a good washing.  </li>
            <li>but the build quality is just superior to any American fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li>The construction of these clippers seems very solid and in good style.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>A true tool for grooming.</li>
            <li>This clipper is very well made and I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>What everyone says is true...</li>
            <li>and I have found this to be true.</li>
            <li>I bought at least five clippers to determine which was best and none even approached this one for quality of construction and sharpness.</li>
            <li>They clip quickly, without hesitation, and do it cleanly.  </li>
            <li>It did such a good job that I bought one.</li>
            <li>Ive used this for about a year now and really have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item because I needed a fingernail clipper, and I have had mostly good experiences with Japanese made products.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s cool.&#x27;</li>
            <li>Sometimes spending two or three times more can really improve your quality of life.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t really care, they do look better too.  </li>
            <li>and it does cut thick toenails nicely, but it kind of blunts out the edges more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>Good weight and solid construction.</li>
            <li>I love that it is stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>Only once in my life have I had a pair of nail clippers this good.</li>
            <li>Finally something made of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Solid design for a good grip, and</li>
            <li>This clipper is much sharper and has more leverage.  </li>
            <li>I was really surprised to be honest.</li>
            <li>So my strategy has been to buy lots of clippers and eventually all the spots where clippers go will eventually be full</li>
            <li>Good enough?  </li>
            <li>Still not a bad product</li>
            <li>(this is not a bad thing, in my opinion, just a caution for using such good clippers).</li>
            <li>This means a great deal for a clean, sharp edge, and for the manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li>In this day of utter junk, merchandise that somewhat resembles that which it purports to be, but affords mediocre performance, at best, and breaks unavailingly within months, if not days, it&#x27;s wonderful to encounter a product that begins with sound engineering design, is constructed of the correct materials and is manufactured to high standards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have always used the cheap clippers from fleet farm or the ones you find in the bins right at the check out.</li>
            <li>Just a smooth cut that drops the trimmed peice right in front of the fingertip.</li>
            <li>Handle at a bit of an odd angle but cuts beautifully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used very cheap nail clippers, but having lost my last one I decided to get a better one.  </li>
            <li>The fit and finish is fine stainless steel, not chrome on metal.</li>
            <li>None better, first quality, top notch professional clippers.</li>
            <li>clippers are great, the blades are so sharp it takes no effort to cut through any nail needing cut.</li>
            <li>i am happy to say that these clippers are just as sharp as the day i got them.</li>
            <li>Great fingernail clipper, so sharp it cuts so</li>
            <li>The experience of clipping nails is so good with these clippers that I apparently do this more frequently ( :</li>
            <li>This thing is sharp and feels great in my hand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp and feels great in my hands.</li>
            <li>This one does a great job, and other string players have ordered this one after trying mine.</li>
            <li>This product is not as great as all the other reviews make it out to be.</li>
            <li>Build quality feels great and they are really sharp.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like buying a great sharp knife after using crappy ones you&#x27;ve had since college.....</li>
            <li>It cuts with twice the ease of my other clippers and feels like great quality.</li>
            <li>: they are great, they are SHARP...</li>
            <li>Great leverage, very sharp, clean cuts...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review for a nail clipper, but this is seriously the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Cuts quickly with no mechanism flex.</li>
            <li>&amp; I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s no such thing as an enjoyable nail clipper.</li>
            <li>and I have no doubt that their quality construction will last me for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and performed as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I was just lucky</li>
            <li>Quick delivery of purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This one is larger than most and I like it better for toes too.</li>
            <li>The manicurists tried the glues, the wraps, the oils, and the super polish, but none of them had any effect on the split.  </li>
            <li>Super strong&lt;br</li>
            <li>Super sharp&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li>They are substantial clippers, with an attractive stainless steel finish, and feel like they&#x27;ll last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Therefore, I can quickly file my nails into the shape I want.</li>
            <li>but you&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>But they do it super well with almost no pressure required.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would be worth the money that there could be that much difference in nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>The clipper is soundly make, nice to hold and feels like it will last forever.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s super expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>much better than cheap old clippers....</li>
            <li>I have three different models of Seki nail clippers and they are simply the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but it makes a metal-on-metal sliding noise when you open/close the clippers, and this noise is SUPER grating for me.</li>
            <li>and if I&#x27;m lucky, while I&#x27;m doing that, just maybe it won&#x27;t split in another place.</li>
            <li>on each clipper, all the details quickly unfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also leave a nice finish that&#x27;s not sharp like some of the reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li>Right from the package, it looks and feels significant.</li>
            <li>this was a phenomenally designed and precision engineered product made of high quality materials.  </li>
            <li>I love the high quality material and build of it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t recommend these any more highly.</li>
            <li>High quality, ergonomically satisfying.  </li>
            <li>There is obvious work to make this a good fit in the hand, and I do have large hands, but I&#x27;m not blown away.  </li>
            <li>Extremely sharp and very effective.</li>
            <li>They cut right through the nails leaving a clean cut.</li>
            <li>I also contacted Seki Edge through e-mail and confirmed that they are made in Japan which also probably contributes to the higher price.  </li>
            <li>These are so much better than normal fingernail clippers.  </li>
            <li>First clipper I&#x27;ve had that makes no &#x27;click&#x27; sound.  </li>
            <li>The cuts are exact and precise.</li>
            <li>The entire mechanism operates very smoothly!</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get a really nice sharp clipper but this seems to just be OK.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I got it out of the box and looked it over it seemed that the jaws were not as precisely aligned as the first one.  </li>
            <li>I have never spent this kind of money on clippers, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>An ah ha moment, why I wasn&#x27;t using something this good for so long.</li>
            <li>and I I expect to ;pass it down to my great grandchildren and</li>
            <li>Most of them are cheap and not sharp.</li>
            <li>I suspect that I am a lot more interested in a quality nail clipper than the average person who&#x27;s sufficiently satisfied with the chrome plated items we find in most drugstores and grocery stores.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, and great quality of materials.</li>
            <li>Very sharp, works great.  </li>
            <li>I love this new clipper.</li>
            <li>I love my new clippers.</li>
            <li>These are nice and sharp, and cut very cleanly.</li>
            <li>After using a number of different fingernail clippers over the years (e.g., Trim, Revlon, Dovo, Victorinox), I&#x27;ve found the Seki Edge to be the best so far for two main reasons.  </li>
            <li>Great product, exactly what I have searched for to avoid rough cuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll give you an update if I become less happy with these.</li>
            <li>Found some $45 German engineered choppers that looked good, but decided to try these &#x27;cheapos&#x27; first.</li>
            <li>If there is any fault, it is that it cuts almost too easily, making it very tempting to overtrim.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recommend it, even if it&#x27;s good for what it is or better than your ordinary clipper.  </li>
            <li>In the past I had paid much more for Solingen steel clippers that were no where as good as these.  </li>
            <li>I really like that they have an extended bottom easy to get all my fingers on it.</li>
            <li>is my second purchase, just as good as the first and now $10 cheaper.</li>
            <li>Clipper is very well made and easily clips finger nails and toe nails as well.</li>
            <li>These are the best set of nail clippers that I have ever had, I keep finding the mini mart cheap ones hiding in different places and throw them out, they&#x27;re never as sharp as these clippers and no where near as comfortable or strong.</li>
            <li>Build quality is top notch, metal looks nice and finished, and it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li>I easily went through three or more cheap clippers in a year, and even brand new they never performed anywhere near the Seki level.  </li>
            <li>This is a really good quality nail clipper, but the nails are thrown far away so you need to vacuum clean after each use!</li>
            <li>It cuts through nails like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li>I received these two days after ordering and they do exactly what I want!</li>
            <li>I really do like these after my dog chewed my other good pair, my wife lost a good pair and we were left with a cheap set -</li>
            <li>It would have been so peaceful and quiet!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!  </li>
            <li>I lost the first!)</li>
            <li>cuts like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li>even cuts the first time on the edges of the nails without having to do significant cleanup</li>
            <li>exactly what nail clippers are supposed to do!</li>
            <li>I suppose if you&#x27;re looking at this product, you&#x27;re probably more interested in getting a good quality nail clipper than you are in saving a few bucks.</li>
            <li>I actually gave these as gifts this Christmas and the recipients LOVE them too!</li>
            <li>Based on all the great reviews, I thought this was a no brainer decision, but I found my nails are too thick to easily insert into the clipper.</li>
            <li>I especially like to use it on my toenails as it slices them just as easily as fingernails unlike many</li>
            <li>It is the best I have ever used and is so practical for people who have very hard nails.</li>
            <li>sharp, works well, feels strong, otherwise excellent product that does what it advertises, no new features though</li>
            <li>These things clip VERY cleanly and with pretty much no effort at all.</li>
            <li>Cuts consistently and cleanly.</li>
            <li>Every time my husband uses it he comments on what a fine clipper it is and thanks me for ordering it for him.</li>
            <li>Effortlessly makes crisp clean cuts every time, no mashing or tearing of the nail.  </li>
            <li>This was the only brand that cut my nails better than the super cheap ones you buy at any drugstore.</li>
            <li>The action is smooth and quick and precise.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty sharp and work great for my fingernails.</li>
            <li>For such an awesome pair of cutters, for being the best, for being so expensive, for being (hopefully) the last pair I&#x27;ll ever need....they aren&#x27;t that cool looking.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp and extremely fine quality steel make this a deluxe trimmer for nails.  </li>
            <li>A little too tall or stacked for maneuverability, but a great clipper.</li>
            <li>OK, when it comes to certain things, I am really picky.</li>
            <li>In some cases, special alloys with a higher proportion of chromium or molybdenum are used.</li>
            <li>In some cases, special alloys with a higher proportion of chromium or molybdenum are used.</li>
            <li>They are heavier than the cheap clippers and are very sharp which makes for a nice clean cut every time.  </li>
            <li>They are stainless steel where the cheap ones are plated steel(big difference).</li>
            <li>After a lifetime of using cheap, flimsy nail clippers, these are a real revelation.</li>
            <li>It has a very ergonomic design which is comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>These are much nicer than the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>Cuts really well, but no file to smooth out the edges.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying these clippers after going through about 10 cheap clippers that required brute force to use.    </li>
            <li>These clippers are worth the money.</li>
            <li>The next best clippers I have are Tweezerman, also in brushed stainless.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but once you use it, you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking these probably aren&#x27;t worth the price, given the ragged edges,</li>
            <li>, well worth the money.</li>
            <li>but they are worth it.</li>
            <li>because you use them so often, it&#x27;s worth it to spend more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the purchase price, you get what you pay for with these.</li>
            <li>well worth the difference in price</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Powerful finger nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>They are so precise that I felt comfortable using them on my two year old.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, but I expected better</li>
            <li>Finally, after buying some $20 tweezers and marveling at the difference between them and the cheap stuff, I decided to buy some better nail</li>
            <li>but I promise you it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>These are great clippers, they feel great in your hands and have a smooth action when cutting nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not inexpensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>This clipper is much heavier with a smoother finish than the standard clipper and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Take the investment on something you use a lot, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m even considering getting these as stocking stuffers for some of the family next year, (yes, they are THAT nice).</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I decided to treat myself  and find out if these are really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These clippers are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re well worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth ever penny.</li>
            <li>it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are worth the price.</li>
            <li>These are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This fingernail clipper is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Using cheaper clippers, I noticed that after a couple of months or so, it takes a considerable amount more force to clip the nails.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>The clippers are certainly powerful, but they leave a ragged edge.  </li>
            <li>So far love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>They are so worth it.  </li>
            <li>it worth its price?</li>
            <li>it worth its price?</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I always knew there must be a better set of nail clippers out there, but it was never really at the top of my list of things to find.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>A bit pricy compared to drug store clippers, but definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth it.  </li>
            <li>the price, it&#x27;s worth trying them out, I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ll like using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but this one is worth writing about.</li>
            <li>It is not a drugstore clipper for which one has to wonder whether nails might need to be made of something else or shaped differently for the clipper to work effectively.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>but it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Is does not have a piece for cleaning under the nail, but is still well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>These were well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>They also would make nice stocking stuffers for the holidays next year.</li>
            <li>Easily worth the money.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>But frankly speaking did not find it worth 14 us$.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is worth the price</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fingernail clipping used to be fun.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>but I think worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It is a long-term investment, so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>But, worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>worth the price.</li>
            <li>They are worth it.</li>
            <li>Even got my father his own set last Christmas.</li>
            <li>a quality product well worth</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny to me.  </li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a massage therapist and so getting my nails nice and short is a must.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price to have clippers that work as they should.</li>
            <li>worth the price?</li>
            <li>Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li>These are worth every penny.</li>
            <li>if so, they&#x27;re worth the hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it never to have raggedy, t--short fingernails again.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally a clipper worth owning.</li>
            <li>oh so worth it.</li>
            <li>These clippers are definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price of admission if you ask me.</li>
            <li>Some thing very much worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth buying,</li>
            <li>I was wondering if they could possibly be worth it.  </li>
            <li>The verdict is in - WORTH EVERY</li>
            <li>the quality is worth the price.</li>
            <li>but this was totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I have a drawer of various clippers that are use to clip my own nails and the nails of my pets.  </li>
            <li>Whatever it is, it&#x27;s worth the $.</li>
            <li>well-crafted, well worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>; well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Before you try and burn the people who paid that let me tell you that they&#x27;re not crazy.</li>
            <li>Wow, I didn&#x27;t realize how crappy most drugstore nail clippers were until I got this.</li>
            <li>Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>It is time for all humanity to demand BETTER results from such important tools.  </li>
            <li>It seems likely to me that it&#x27;s good steel, and I notice the lever is different from the blade, which says to me they used a better steel where it counts.  </li>
            <li>That would be a very big deal to me, and honestly what I would expect that for a $20 pair (they&#x27;re $17 for me on Amazon, March 2015).  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend, good japanese quality&lt;br /&gt;Was a little reluctant to spend such amount, however certainly dont regret it, these would be best clippers i have ever had, better than tweezerman....</li>
            <li>the first cut with my new Seki clippers, I was in love.</li>
            <li>I can even use them with my gimpy left hand, so that even though I kind if feel like an uncoordinated slob with the nerve damage, my fingernails on my right hand won’t look that way.  </li>
            <li>great product, a bit expensive but impressive sharp</li>
            <li>clipper really is an order of magnitude better than all other clippers I own.</li>
            <li>they had a file/nail cleaner like most clippers but other than that I love them.</li>
            <li>Once again, as in many other areas of my purchasing life, I am learning to look for quality and pay a bit more for it.  </li>
            <li>These cost more than many other, similar-looking clippers.  </li>
            <li>The Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is a solid feeling fingernail clipper that provides a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>Solid, substantial, sharp, not flimsy or flexible - it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Better than most SHARP</li>
            <li>In fact they are so quick and crisp when they cut</li>
            <li>As a side note I feel like these nail clippers give the similar unexplainable good feeling that is produced by Felco Classic Pruners [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>so I was familiar with SEKI quality and was very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Tweezerman&#x27;s are darn good from other brands</li>
            <li>GOOD QUALITY AND SHARP</li>
            <li>One would think clippers are just clippers, but having used so many cheap clippers in the past, I am beyond pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
            <li>Superior to any other clippers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Clipped it right off like it was nothing.</li>
            <li>These just cut right through the nail</li>
            <li>Just the right size</li>
            <li>have a tweezerman, but it just doesn&#x27;t quite grip right.</li>
            <li>and these will cut right through them without tearing the nail.  </li>
            <li>he uses this right away.  </li>
            <li>The problem with them is they just don&#x27;t cut your fingernail right.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are like using a razor to slice right through my nails.  </li>
            <li>You can tell right away it is well made.  </li>
            <li>CUts  right thru nail with no resistance.</li>
            <li>5 stars for quality and getting it right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky when I cut my fingernails and this clipper really gives you precise control over your cuts.</li>
            <li>But the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper cuts your nails cleanly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>They cut consistently well and are made of a nice, solid material.</li>
            <li>but I believe the rounded countour is also what makes these the first clippers I&#x27;ve ever used where I don&#x27;t tend to accidentally \\&quot;overcut\\&quot; my nails and expose the more sensitive flesh at the tip of my finger.</li>
            <li>It cuts neatly and cleanly and feels very durable.</li>
            <li>The cut is clean and fast.  </li>
            <li>The clip is fast and clean.  </li>
            <li>I used to wash my hands with hot water to prepare my nails for clipping, I used to file underneath, on the flat edge, and on top of the nail to avoid drawing blood when scratching an itch after clipping my nails!  </li>
            <li>This is hands down the best clipper I have ever used in my entire life.</li>
            <li>High quality, precise cut.</li>
            <li>They feel high quality in your hands, they fit well in your fingers and they cut effortlessly.</li>
            <li>Even for someone without those physical disabilities, these clippers are far superior to and much easier to use than the cheap ones you get at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I was skeptical about the companies claims and description, but I was pleased to find these the sharpest and most comfortable clippers to use ever.</li>
            <li>Great set of clippers, very sharp, and very sturdy feeling.</li>
            <li>nice quality, cuts nails like I have never seen before, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the metal produces this &amp;#34;nails on chalkboard&amp;#34; effect/sound when twisting the top part to engage when ready to use, maybe it needs a better design to avoid this; maybe like a washer or other plastic or</li>
            <li>This clippers are truly sharp and more importantly, leave a clean, crisp edge on the cut nail.</li>
            <li>The cutter handle pops open easily and smoothly, and the execution of the cut is practically effortless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Yes the body of the clipper is smooth, so make sure your hands are dry and get a grip.</li>
            <li>The Seki clipper is truly a fine instrument and the company has made this new customer a believer.  </li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp, they cut easily and smoothly, and the lever handle is designed for easy use.</li>
            <li>Sure, they both do the same thing, but the nice set lasts longer and you can actually get ice-cream out of the container without bending the spoon.</li>
            <li>A tad bit small IMO for home use, but great for travel.</li>
            <li>This line of implements is worth every penny of it higher price.</li>
            <li>I used them too (even on those pesky thick toenails) and they work so beautifully.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I hopped on Amazon, and as is my usual path ended up spending a good amount of time reading reviews and up-selling myself to 5 times my original budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>build quality is superb, hopefully the edge stays sharp for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The part that you press down to cut the nail moves around no matter where you put the clippers, so some sort of cover or case would be good to have</li>
            <li>This item is heavier and a little more challenging to slide under the nail before clipping.</li>
            <li>It has a little more width than most fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a little bit pricey but its worth every penny, its that good.</li>
            <li>This tiny little thing is superb.</li>
            <li>Strong, clean, sharp, smooth.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp, never had fingernail clippers as good as these.</li>
            <li>Forth, the mechanism is designed to work smoothly with no ill fitting, loose or wobbly parts.  </li>
            <li>Forth, the mechanism is designed to work smoothly with no ill fitting, loose or wobbly parts.   </li>
            <li>Also, I do not feel like to buying a cheap new nail clipper every year, so</li>
            <li>Very sharp with great leverage and spring action to quickly cut your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wow, I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li>So great I ended up coming back to buy a second one (and a toenail version) - with 5 people in our house, someone was always hoarding it!</li>
            <li>I previously reviewed this item and loved it.  </li>
            <li>This is a very nice-looking clipper, super well-made.  </li>
            <li>For such a frequent task you deserve a good tool - this is it.  </li>
            <li>I have hidden them from the rest of my family because if anyone else used them, they are so good</li>
            <li>The long handle offers nice control!</li>
            <li>Easy to use even though my thumb injury will keep me using my old drugstore clippers for along time.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s a lot more difficult to get good clean</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money and will steer clear of the cheap ones from the dollar store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male that doesn&#x27;t care too much about this kind of thing.  </li>
            <li>We stopped using this nail clipper and started using our old clippers and our nails stopped breaking so easily.</li>
            <li>It is strong enough for even the toughest nails, hand or feet, and it cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li>This pair is made in Seki Japan - they are so proud of this fact (and its relation to traditional Japanese swords) that it is their brand name.  </li>
            <li>Small but very effective.  </li>
            <li>You can really feel that the perfectly aligned sharp blades actually grip your nails before proceeding to clip off the nail crisply and assuredly.  </li>
            <li>The basic fingernail and toenail clippers have specially formed ends and holding grooves on both the top and bottom ends to make them much easier to hold when your arm is extended, even with hand tremors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using these to clip my nails is quickly and effortless -- you need to apply very little pressure to get a nice, clean cut.</li>
            <li>They are great for thick nails like mine, and they are worth the higher price because they don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li>These are outstanding clippers, far superior to the usual &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; variety.  </li>
            <li>I bought this clipper based mostly upon the reviews, and I must say the vast majority of the reviews were right on target.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and definitely durable and always gives you a sharp, clean cut.</li>
            <li>Very, very well made.</li>
            <li>The net result is that your nails will be cut in an effortless manner with a very smooth edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this less than 5 times so far, but they were probably my best nail clipping experiences so far.  </li>
            <li>It is amazingly sharp, so I can cut my nails faster and more accurately.</li>
            <li>These are a good compromise; a little pricey, but they do work well.  </li>
            <li>Does not provide a clean cut, cuts similar to cheap Trim clippers.  </li>
            <li>Very very sturdy and consistent with the cuts.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp, have a slight bevel to keep the edges smooth, they’re sized right for my hands, and have a nice indent making them very easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sharp and cut easily and cleanly every time.</li>
            <li>The difference between these clippers and my old standbys that are made by TRIM is huge.  </li>
            <li>again...and out of frustration i purchased these Seki Edge stainless steel nail clippers and i must say, they were worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have had mine for almost 4 years and ran into the first drawback...</li>
            <li>But then again, these clippers are clearly better and built to last and will serve me well for decades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sorry I bought them</li>
            <li>I bought four pair and lost one to my wife after she used mine for the first time.</li>
            <li>What I notice the most is that the entire mechanism is rigid, which gives a feeling of control.</li>
            <li>Well designed and pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li>, I just want a more precision cut outside the nail itself.</li>
            <li>The handle on this one is like 5x the thickness of normal clippers, probably cast metal, and lets you apply full pressure without breaking a sweat.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely buy more of these, though.</li>
            <li>clippers\\&quot; in your head, what&#x27;s the first thing you think about?</li>
            <li>I had always purchased the drug store variety of nail clippers but decided that I would go the extra price and buy something better.  </li>
            <li>First, the background.  </li>
            <li>So why do I still prefer my old cheap unit?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li>the quality and feel seems to be first class.</li>
            <li>only thing that would make them better is if they could cut hang nails as well as they cut finger nails.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only 3 times the cost of the cheap ones that tear your nails!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s THAT much easier!)</li>
            <li>Do not waste money on cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>Overall, quite pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>So much better than drug store China clippers - will last a lifetime</li>
            <li>These are so much better than the ones that you can get at the big box stores.  </li>
            <li>but I am finding myself consistently avoiding to use it.</li>
            <li>that is a nice feature to keep it from slipping off</li>
            <li>It works exactly as it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t about to drop $60 on nail clippers, but the ad was enough to get me researching for better clippers.  </li>
            <li>that is exactly what you should do here.</li>
            <li>Maybe they&#x27;re better suited to nails that are set back from the ends of our digits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had these for a while, and they&#x27;ve never failed to disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is a bit intimidating at first.  </li>
            <li>3/8s - 1/2 &amp;#34;) and</li>
            <li>Leaves kind of a rough edge</li>
            <li>Having been using cheap clippers all the time, I am quite surprised by the quality of this.</li>
            <li>Much better than a generic fingernail clipper from the department store.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Japan can gladly have my money when American companies fall so woefully</li>
            <li>The fingernail clipper might be better suited for smaller hands - like for children.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered another because someone else took a liking to my first one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And since they are stainless, you can even WASH or sanitize them and they won&#x27;t rust!</li>
            <li>Have the larger toenail clippers bought from sharper image years ago, love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to be extremely careful when using them as they are professional quality and you better be sure you want to cut that before you commit.</li>
            <li>Much better than the vast majority of nail clippers you will find.</li>
            <li>Also, it is so sharp that it leaves the nails perfectly squared off, thus leaving a sharp edge like |_|.</li>
            <li>Upon first use, I was amazed at the quality and build of the product.</li>
            <li>Nobody offered anything better (aside from a \\&quot;mysterious\\&quot; german brand purchased eons ago).  </li>
            <li>A handful said \\&quot;cheaper ones\\&quot; are the same or better.  </li>
            <li>It always clips off on the first try.</li>
            <li>OK, I would not have thought that nail clippers are that different.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Japan!</li>
            <li>Wow I know i&#x27;m going to sound like a parrot here</li>
            <li>These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;m 62, I&#x27;ve used plenty including expensive ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well machined and hand sharpened &#x3D; better than ones that are for sale in your local drug store.</li>
            <li>Expensive, yes, but wonderful.</li>
            <li>I will take many back to Kazakhstan.</li>
            <li>After using these once my wife changed from \\&quot;That&#x27;s too expensive\\&quot; to \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you get the toenail clippers at the same time?\\&quot; :-).  </li>
            <li>These are first rate clippers.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last longer than any of the cheaper ones you can find in the drugstore, but</li>
            <li>okay, nail clippers are not all the same</li>
            <li>and yes you can clip your nails with the drug store brands or even some higher end brands</li>
            <li>I lost the first one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You won&#x27;t go wrong with either, but if are looking for the best, go for the Seki.</li>
            <li>I was worried this wasn&#x27;t going to be better than the generic nail clipper</li>
            <li>Works better than any clippers I&#x27;ve used before, and feels like they&#x27;re built to last.</li>
            <li>I have purchased so many clippers recently over the counter</li>
            <li>My whole family loves them, including my kids!</li>
            <li>The ones sold at Wally world don&#x27;t even work, but these are exactly what you need</li>
            <li>From the first time taken out of the container, I could feel the quality.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not sorry.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s obvious which is the top side of the clipper,</li>
            <li>starts, these clippers definitely clip much better than my Tweezerman&#x27;s did out-of-the-box</li>
            <li>Way better than the last 5 I&#x27;ve purchased at walmart or a gas station, etc.</li>
            <li>These things cut nails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>most likely TRIM</li>
            <li>We need to get a 2nd paid since my hubby is always accusing me of hiding these from him :)</li>
            <li>Makes a crisp cut.</li>
            <li>These were a replacement for an identical product with a different brand that I got more than 10 years ago from Brookstone.</li>
            <li>So I was first introduced to these things while visiting my geeky friend Carlos in Texas.</li>
            <li>The clipping action is solid, no creaks, no flex, just a confident &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; sound.</li>
            <li>Will buy more for travel since they aren&#x27;t too big to take with me in my bag.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many cheaper ones in local drugstores and they either don&#x27;t work well or fall apart within months.  </li>
            <li>My guess is all these stellar reviews are from paid reviewers.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I was impressed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I know what I&#x27;ll use for entire forcible future.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Cuts through my nails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>: sometimes you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I love these clippers and will never buy a different brand again.</li>
            <li>This is not a complaint, but simply an observation and a reason that a nail file would have been a nice addition.</li>
            <li>One has to marvel at their stellar quality control.</li>
            <li>They cut through nails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to keep them for several months all to myself!  </li>
            <li>Very durable and worth the money.</li>
            <li>I never thought I could really like a nail clippers!</li>
            <li>I bought the Victorinox pocket clippers because I am obsessed with finding the best</li>
            <li>Yet they take the time to polish out any bumps on the top, opposite of the detent.  </li>
            <li>extra steps &#x3D; a lot more cost for the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Heavy, balanced and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>I have had the Green Bell nail clipper for about 15 years &amp; it still works as good as the day I received it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I can add anything new to the rest of the positive reviews, except to say they ARE worth the price!  </li>
            <li>It also helps that the lever is designed at a very sharp angle unlike cheap clippers where it is more of a bend.</li>
            <li>Very sharp like razor and comportable,high quality stainless steel and price is Good</li>
            <li>Consequently, these are probably the first clippers I&#x27;ve used where I don&#x27;t feel an all-consuming urge to file my nails right after clipping them; the clippers are able to produce a smooth enough cut free of sharp points that I am okay with not filing my nails down to smooth them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You nails will be cut noticeably more precisely and with less effort.</li>
            <li>This nail clipper is quite expensive, but it&#x27;s great quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I decided to get something better, and these are so fast, smooth, and sharp.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and do an accurate cut quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>I am only writing this review because there are way too many overly positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the Seki Toenail Clippers for the cats and am sure the blades will cut sharp and true.</li>
            <li>Most were adequate but became less useful as arthritis set in.</li>
            <li>These are amazing in that they take very little pressure to use and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>These are amazing in that they take very little pressure to use and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>Makes nice, clean cuts with very little effort.</li>
            <li>This clipper is excellent, high quality, heavy metal that seems as if it will last for ages!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain these will last for many years to come.</li>
            <li>Yes they cost a little more than the cheap drug store clippers</li>
            <li>stainless steel nail clipper is a true precision cutting instrument, and it works GREAT!  </li>
            <li>Will cut any nails with minima pressure and nice sharp blades.</li>
            <li>and they are still as sharp and effective as the day I opened them.</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sharp, the blade is nicely rounded for the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li>Nice sharp cuts.  </li>
            <li>Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>I own this nail clipper for over two years now and it is still sharp.</li>
            <li>Nice sharp clipper.</li>
            <li>Nice, sharp edges.  </li>
            <li>I read other reviews saying they cut so nice</li>
            <li>However, the best way I know to find out is whether the metal &#x27;rings&#x27; or not - and this pair doesn&#x27;t &#x27;clunk,&#x27; it has a very sharp sound quality when on a hard surface.  </li>
            <li>The rounded contour of these clippers is perfect for progressively clipping nails while keeping the nail itself more-or-less rounded; all my previous clippers have been \\&quot;straight\\&quot; in comparison, and would always produce annoyingly sharp points and \\&quot;polygonal\\&quot; nails.</li>
            <li>They are sharp, and fit in you hand easily.  </li>
            <li>Love these clippers and boy ARE they super sharp compared to others I have owned.</li>
            <li>I got a dull kind of thud sound.  </li>
            <li>Very solid and sharp, cuts clean and good steel quality.</li>
            <li>I bought a pair of Twizzerman clippers and wasnt satisfied with cutting so just got the Seki Edge today and worked great.</li>
            <li>Third, the cutting edge is masterful, delivering a clean, smooth cut every time ...</li>
            <li>I went with others reccommendations and found these nail clippers to have a smoth action and clean cut.</li>
            <li>Spend the extra $10 over a cheap one, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>After a while these tend to lose the sharpness and the lever action requires significantly more pressure to complete</li>
            <li>Solid cast metal top piece, very ergonomic feel.  </li>
            <li>We called around and no one carried the more expensive and good ones.</li>
            <li>They really are strikingly better than the junk for sale at the local Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li>There are few products that incite more unrestricted, fiery rage in me than cheap fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li>These probably are a BIT nicer than your standard clippers, if that is what you are looking for, but not that much better, so don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>, this one is made to last.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend buying together w toe-nail clippers - which is a larger clipper and has a more straight edge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No actual danger, and the outside edges are rounded (which indicates good thought).  </li>
            <li>Made from pure stainless steel!</li>
            <li>However, I think my use case represents a pretty large portion of the population who needs nail</li>
            <li>They are super high quality nail clippers that do what they&#x27;re supposed to do really well.</li>
            <li>First and most important, the cutting edges of the Seki are sharper and cut my nails more cleanly than others and much easier</li>
            <li>Far superior to any  other similar product available and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>In fact he threw away all his old nail clippers and made a special box just for this nail clipper.</li>
            <li>I bought this on a whim mostly because I was wondering if someone could really make a more precise and clean cutting nail clipper</li>
            <li>Very different, very cool.  </li>
            <li>Very good at cutting nail, for a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>After suffering unknowingly for years with cheap fingernail clippers that mostly sheared off nails and required two hands to use, my husband bought this for me as a romantic birthday present.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp, precise, and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>For a few bucks more, I consider this to be a significant upgrade.  </li>
            <li>Well, I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d spend this much on a nail clipper, but this is some pretty fancy stuff.</li>
            <li>The result is a smooth cut with no rough spots.</li>
            <li>that was one of the reasons I was ready to pay a higher price for this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>When I first used them, they would cut really well with a snap.  </li>
            <li>It cuts easily and cleanly with sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>Well made, ships fast and has a crisp matte finish.</li>
            <li>First of all this thing is like a piece of artwork, and looks very sleek.</li>
            <li>But like a summer hookup with that cute boy / girl at the snack shack, things never lasted that long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve lived in Asia for over 25 years and have many fond memories of the bathhouse ladies cutting my nails with such precision.. perfect every time.  </li>
            <li>After reading these reviews I was really hoping for a nice, sharp clipper.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s samurai sword-level of sharpness (seemingly, at least, if not actually), requires one to use it with great care, or one&#x27;s nails will be filled with scratches.</li>
            <li>That way you can throw out those clippers you&#x27;ve had forever (but nobody can remember where they came from) and not be tempted to use the old ones just because these good ones are in the other bathroom.</li>
            <li>However, I guess the old adage is still true</li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly and easily with less pressure than cheaper cutters.</li>
            <li>crunchers\\&quot;, leaving a rough edge instead of a smooth, clean edge.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several clippers quickly because my fingernails grow quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still very sharp and you get that crisp click sound when clipping the nail.&lt;br /&gt;While not as cheap as pharmacy or dept store sold clippers</li>
            <li>Exceptional nail clipper .,Received product when promised and the clippers are high quality and very sharp.</li>
            <li>But for the price I expected, as mentioned, something more solid, and with at least a bonus file, even if that wasn&#x27;t the best built-in file in the world.</li>
            <li>I resorted to buying nail clippers on Amazon after one cheap set of clippers completely fell apart and couldn&#x27;t be put back together, and the cheap set I replaced it with really just bent my nails until they gave in.</li>
            <li>Alas, the quality is about as good as a $3 clipper I recently bought and no where near as good a give-away clipper I keep in the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Still sharp, very very easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and cut very easily.</li>
            <li>The blade is very sharp and durable and cuts effectively.</li>
            <li>It feels FAR more precise than ANY other clipper I have used.  </li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s easy to hold onto as opposed to the generic shaped ones that sometimes slip out of your grip.</li>
            <li>The entire thing fits in your hand easily.  </li>
            <li>I was searching for something better than what is available in my small town.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t let you cut nails extremely short easily, but then again, its trying to stop you from taking a chunk of your fingertips out.</li>
            <li>Nice weight with a slight texture on the anodized/painted surface so that it&#x27;s not as slippery as the chromed ones.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for nail clippers that would actually work and was easy to use.</li>
            <li>The grip is very adequate, and actually has some grooves for traction....</li>
            <li>These will last for a long time if you take good care of them.</li>
            <li>While they are nice, I&#x27;m not sure they are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It is ergonomic and far, far better to use than the classic clippers.  </li>
            <li>They cut precisely and easily with little effort.</li>
            <li>These are easy to use, comfortable in your hands, and sharp enough to make clean cuts.</li>
            <li>Probably because of its size it has certain flimsy feel to it.</li>
            <li>Smart looking &amp; works well.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and make the smart investment.</li>
            <li>The blade is too large to clip corners without grabbing a piece of skin.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp and cut cleanly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and leave a clean, precise cut.</li>
            <li>The blade is sharp, the hinge is smooth and doesn&#x27;t shift, all leading to a clean, decisive cut.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and cuts easily with precision&lt;</li>
            <li>But after my last two pairs of cheap nail clippers that I bought from the grocery store kept breaking on me, I decided it would be a smart investment to get something that would be a lot more durable and reliable and thus save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very sharp edges making for a clean cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really not passionate about nail clippers and don&#x27;t give 5 stars lightly, but this is a well made product that deserves it.</li>
            <li>The first clipper was worth $13, but this one is only worth about $3!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will be buyer a few more to have around just in case we lose this one!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t loose it your going to have a clipper for many years.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These clippers lack a nail-catcher which is perfectly okay for me as I would rarely use nail-catchers on my previous clippers anyways.</li>
            <li>I lost my pair and bought a new one right away.</li>
            <li>Sharp, easy to grip, no whammies!</li>
            <li>Does a fine job and appears built to last.    </li>
            <li>These nail clippers are made like a fine Swiss watch and are super sharp.</li>
            <li>Clean cut- barely need filing.</li>
            <li>Does a fine job and appears built to last.</li>
            <li>Another fine Seki clipper to go along with the two different Sekis I already had.</li>
            <li>These clippers have finely honed blades that cut nails effortlessly, continuing to uphold the reputation of Japanese blade makers as the finest in the world.</li>
            <li>Very high quality.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the package, I could tell these were very high quality clippers.</li>
            <li>Its stainless steel, but holding it you can&#x27;t help but feel there&#x27;s a certain energy pulsating within.</li>
            <li>They may be a little over kill because they are almost too nice.</li>
            <li>Nice little snip.</li>
            <li>As nail clippers, they work great - even for tough toenails.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to pay a high price, I don&#x27;t think you can do batter than this.</li>
            <li>It is superior to the cheaper models I have been using, and it provides a pretty clean (but not perfect) cut.</li>
            <li>These clippers cut very well, and are very high quality.</li>
            <li>* Very high grade of stainless steel&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product along with the [[ASIN:B000F37UNM Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper]] are simple tools that help make life a little more enjoyable and easier.  </li>

            <li>Super sharp and so comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable to work with and super sharp.</li>
            <li>It is made of stainless steel, instead of other cheap materials which break quickly.  </li>
            <li>good product, good material, well built, looks solid, sharp enough but its ends are somewhat thick to easily manipulate under nail.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>These are great smooth cutting clippers.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re smooth enough straight from the clippers.</li>
            <li>This sound assures you that the clipper did its job and is ready for the next \\&quot;bite\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s precise enough that you don&#x27;t really need a nail file.</li>
            <li>It is well built and should last much longer than the cheap ones at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>Something you may not have known (before now) is that instrumentalists -- especially string players -- must keep their nails trimmed neatly and accurately.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why with our modern technology we can&#x27;t make nail clippers that really work well.</li>
            <li>, they are solid, accurate, clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cutting jaws don&#x27;t meet perfectly.</li>
            <li>Straight through.</li>
            <li>It appears these are stainless steel EXCEPT for the bolt part that holds the assembly together...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Here is the issue:  the clippers cut like butter, much easier than anything I have ever used</li>
            <li>Any help would be appreciated.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>These are very well made and work well.</li>
            <li>Having bought plenty of cheap-o nail clippers, this thing really blew me away.</li>
            <li>A fantastic product overall, but quite pricey compared to a $1 clipper.</li>
            <li>The clipper is much easier to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the straight ones to do my toe nails.</li>
            <li>The handles fit my big hands and don&#x27;t slip out while trying to use them.</li>
            <li>An absolute pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li>Really.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this much of an improvement over a $3 one.</li>
            <li>The weight of the tool is perfect and the cutting quality is perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like them so much that I sent a pair to my father</li>
            <li>As soon as you clip one nail you will notice the difference like I did and never go back to cheap brands.</li>
            <li>So much for the $2 pairs that wear out every 3 months.</li>
            <li>I debated for about a month on whether I would spend this much on nail clippers.</li>
            <li>I go through nail clippers faster than any person really should.  </li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>Smooth, simple and effortless operation.</li>
            <li>You can absolutely feel the craftsmanship.</li>
            <li>The lever mechanism operates so smoothly compared to my $3 clippers from the local pharmacies.  </li>
            <li>Also when you open and twist the handles, it flows smoothly and it does not feel like it will fall off or disconnect like the cheaper ones often do.  </li>
            <li>I also appreciate the stainless steel material.  </li>
            <li>The blades are what really set itself apart from the competition.  </li>
            <li>and I cut off too much nail.  </li>
            <li>It grips really well</li>
            <li>If I ever lose them I can&#x27;t revert back to using cheap junk clippers.</li>
            <li>Simply put these do not cut smooth.  </li>
            <li>Edit - After having this for 2 years, I&#x27;ve really grown fond of it.</li>
            <li>When you get these, you know immediately they are different from the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>very well made.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that if you get these, you won&#x27;t want to use cheap clippers ever again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Function: The hinge seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li>you spent a lot more on.  </li>
            <li>I think you can buy one from WalMart much cheaper...</li>
            <li>it was a real chore and time consuming before the purchase but almost a pleasent chore now</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>These actually cut the nail, instead of crushing their way through.  </li>
            <li>The blade opening is also very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The feel is very sturdy and has an even weight distribution.</li>
            <li>but I really appreciate the easep with which the CT does the job.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend!</li>
            <li>and they haven&#x27;t been flying off as much as I&#x27;ve been used to.</li>
            <li>They cut very well and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Seki, feels very balanced in my hands, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to slip out between my fingers.</li>
            <li>but they work VERY well.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t really care then</li>
            <li>Fit and finish are a step above the dime store variety.</li>
            <li>I really like these clippers</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is labeled &#x27;stainless steel,&#x27; however, the lever contains no steel, and as another reviewer posted, that&#x27;s where it breaks..</li>
            <li>This is not a poor clipper.  </li>
            <li>The price included free shipping when I ordered it last May--</li>
            <li>Binge order haha.</li>
            <li>it comfortable enough to use?</li>
            <li>it a 100% stainless steel?</li>
            <li>They really do cut, rather than tear through, your nails.</li>
            <li>Very convenient/</li>
            <li>and they cut my toenails very well</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I never realized that sharpness was so critical to comfortable nail clipping.</li>
            <li>Tried diagonal pliers, which worked, but are straight cut, so the nail edges had to be trimmed and rounded.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>HaHa; for defense from sharks?</li>
            <li>They are butter smooth and appear as if they will last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>Well constructed and very durable.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a set of nail clippers and don&#x27;t want to spend to much</li>
            <li>I like these so much I buy them as gifts.</li>
            <li>but if I had to buy again, I would probably try a different product because this one doesn&#x27;t seem to fit me well.</li>
            <li>thanks alot</li>
            <li>I can never go back to the cheap clippers again</li>
            <li>Also, I&#x27;m male, though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s important for this item.</li>
            <li>But the Seki Edge stainless steel fingernail clipper changed all that.  </li>
            <li>They are also very ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>34;too much information&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>because I&#x27;d never spend this much on a pair of clippers.</li>
            <li>B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clippers]]</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t have to really put pressure against the nail at all.</li>
            <li>I am OCD about my nails and was really looking forward to getting these.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are very well made.</li>
            <li>i even bought the pair of stainless steel finger and toe nail clippers carried by Amazon, that is cheaper.</li>
            <li>And very well made, unlike the clippers I&#x27;ve been using my whole life.</li>
            <li>Really well crafted.</li>
            <li>This stainless steel nail clipper hails from Japan, straight from the forge of Hattori Hanzo.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t even have a nail filer, although you won&#x27;t really need one.</li>
            <li>yes, it is stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>I never thought I&#x27;d pay this much for a pair, but now that I have them you&#x27;ll never find me buying the .99 ones at the drug stores ever again.  </li>
            <li>My nails don&#x27;t split as much trimming with this clipper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never go back to buying cheap nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>The nail clipper works really well.</li>
            <li>Thanks for fast delivery</li>
            <li>My husband loves them so much he refuses to carry them in his pocket for fear of losing them.  </li>
            <li>so much so that you may skip to file the nail.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, it&#x27;s stainless steel, not chrome plated ...</li>
            <li>Lastly, this item is made of substantial stainless steel, so it&#x27;s considerably heavier than most clippers.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, this item is made of substantial stainless steel, so it&#x27;s considerably heavier than most clippers.  </li>
            <li>So, I bought the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper for him.  </li>
            <li>I am very please with them.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, I paid too much for this clipper.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever used cheap ones before.</li>
            <li>: B002ULRVJA)  Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper (ASIN: B000F35R00)    </li>
            <li>These stainless clippers are sharper than the cheaper ones and hold their edge a lot longer.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see going back to the cheap ones.</li>
            <li>Very well-built, sturdy&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like these clippers.  </li>
            <li>Very well made, I plan on keeping it the rest of my life assuming I don&#x27;t lose them moving/traveling.  </li>
            <li>Bought a pair for parents as well as they only ever had the cheap clippers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>For the money spent on this I consider it the most value for the money.</li>
            <li>With this, don&#x27;t have to worry about filing as much after trimming.</li>
            <li>and it os very ergonomic to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really like this fingernail clipper-sharp, and does its job</li>
            <li>Fast forward two years</li>
            <li>This very one,</li>
            <li>The clippers cut really well, but the texture really bothers me.  </li>
            <li>All of them were capable of clipping my nails.  </li>
            <li>Clips quietly and smoothly through the nails.</li>
            <li>I have much cheaper nail clippers that I started using because they get closer.</li>
            <li>I really wanted a premium nail clipper and didn&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li>Fits very well in your hand.</li>
            <li>and I am afraid I may lose them to her as she was quite impressed.     </li>
            <li>very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hinge is smooth and the body construction looks to last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>Not that it matters much</li>
            <li>It cuts through nails with ease without much effort and doesn&#x27;t split or crack the nail at all.  </li>
            <li>I never though I would spend this much on a set of nail clippers, but after using them -</li>
            <li>Absolute precision in cutting...lived up to the accolades.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a luxury, I even felt reluctant as I clicked order, wondering if I could really justify spending this much money on a fingernail clipper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely the Rolls Royce of trimmers.</li>
            <li>After much research, we chose this clipper.  </li>
            <li>They are everything you expect a fingernail clipper to be at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Someone wants to borrow them....</li>
            <li>I believe these must be made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li>like these so much ,i bought another..</li>
            <li>This one is very well made and does the job with any problems, will recommend.</li>
            <li>your hands.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is much sharper</li>
            <li>spring action is much stronger so each cut is more purposeful, it should last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>bought a Brookstone clipper set that cost about four times as much.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before buying this product, I thought to myself, &amp;#34;How much difference could one nailclipper make?&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very well made so</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t imagine you would have to replace them very often.</li>
            <li>:  They aren&#x27;t stainless.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>fantastic trimmers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the quality every time I use them.</li>
            <li>They clip the nail without any real effort required.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>After all, nail clippers are really just a tool, and I&#x27;ve been around tools all of my life.</li>
            <li>You could by 6 pairs at Walmart for the same price, but you still would have a cheap, inferior tool.</li>
            <li>Really??</li>
            <li>Also, the blades do not meet to the very edge which sometimes leaves a &amp;#34;thread&amp;#34; of nail remaining.  </li>
            <li>The thumb pad is indented to hold the thumb better, but isn&#x27;t wide or shaped like a thumb.  </li>
            <li>I put my order in for this about 2 days ago, and received it at the end of the 2nd day (I did not do expedited shipping of any kind, just standard.)</li>
            <li>Worth the extra few bucks to get a good one now instead of buying a bunch ones over the years.</li>
            <li>Better than my old nail clippers I purchased from my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>I rotated through my entire stock of TRIM brand clippers, looking for one that I could actually use effectively.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, heavy nailclipper</li>
            <li>Overall I still highly recommend these nail clippers, although I might suggest buying a couple, as we all know how easy it is to misplace clippers.</li>
            <li>Very precise &amp; sharp .</li>
            <li>It cuts clean, no jagged edges, but the grip could be better, it&#x27;s a little slippery and takes a few seconds to get a good, solid grip.</li>
            <li>Similar to the toe clipper ~ very sharp and they do the job nicely!  </li>
            <li>Sharp as can be, and nice and heavy, while also being comfortable to use, with a nice, wide, ergonomic lever.</li>
            <li>While I am sure it is possible to live without a great clipper - having done so for decades - and there may be less expensive clippers that are as effective</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>These are pretty darn sharp and cut the nails pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li>If you are a person who has scoured the market both local and online for a sharp, good looking, and reasonably priced fingernail (not toenail) clipper, this is it.  </li>
            <li>These also make nice gifts for family and friends as they will be pleasantly surprised by the build quality, design, and sharp blades.    </li>
            <li>I love these so much that I make other people try them--</li>
            <li>It is very solidly built, good materials, sharp, and</li>
            <li>This clipper is super sharp providing clean cuts and no tearing.</li>
            <li>The clippers tend to fall apart WAY too fast, with the thumb lever becoming loose and wobbly in no time.  </li>
            <li>Thats a problem I have with most other clippers</li>
            <li>Another first impression was that these clippers are not small or travel sized.  </li>
            <li>No more cheap clippers for us!!</li>
            <li>Sharp, precise, sturdy!</li>
            <li>this Fingernail clipper is significantly better than any other Clipper I have used.  </li>
            <li>So, I also bought the Seki Curved file and it works better than any other nail file.  </li>
            <li>Purchased along with the matching jumbo-sized neanderthal toe-nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade is sharp, and build quality is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The width and curvature of the blade does not seem to be appropriate for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size hands.</li>
            <li>These clippers are razor sharp, was able to cut through my toughest nails</li>
            <li>Scary good!</li>
            <li>They work better than any other pair of clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I consider these clippers to just be ok, and probably not really worth the premium charged when you could buy 8 or 10 of the cheap ones for the same price.  </li>
            <li>the semi nail clipper is great super tough with a sharp edge that continues to be my favorite after 1 year of constant use</li>
            <li>The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars is because they don&#x27;t have the nail file thingy that you can clean under nails</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always felt like nail-clippers are made from tin cans, they&#x27;re just normally designed to be as absolutely cheap as possible and</li>
            <li>Cuts so cleanly that the edges of the nail are left sharper than you may expect.</li>
            <li>But I just took a small file and with a quick light swipe dulled those corners enough that they would easily glide along as I progressed through each cut.  </li>
            <li>When I first pulled these out, the heft and general build quality were the first things of note.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended, cuts cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave the jagged edges left by cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>Only wish that there was a file attached to clean under the nail.</li>
            <li>But I was lucky enough to find a really good one at least 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I tried them out and they certainly cut better than my previous Revlons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is very well made, high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Going</li>
            <li>A very we&#x27;ll made, high quality product.</li>
            <li>I like these clippers because all the cheap ones I purchased in the local stores are not sharp enough to cut easily and without tearing (I always clip my nails just after the shower</li>
            <li>Okay, maybe that is an exaggeration but being a male with thick, healthy fingernails, many other products caused me to need to clip twice to get it to work.</li>
            <li>and then vacuum the spot afterwards to clean up any clippings that might have gone flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and then vacuum the spot afterwards to clean up any clippings that might have gone flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is a whole new experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very sharp, smooth action and ergonomically friendly.</li>
            <li>None of the wavering bending or forcing an odd angle to get a good cut that you have to do with standard clippers.</li>
            <li>Finally, I have found finger nail clippers that easily do the job for my old fingers.</li>
            <li>I wanted better fingernail trimmers and this one was more expensive, but very highly rated.  </li>
            <li>Very clean cuts, extremely sharp.</li>
            <li>They make cutting nails effortless and they do an amazing job withy clean and quick cuts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been putting up with cheap fingernail clippers for too long.</li>
            <li>I assume for the average person this clipper will found to be more than satisfactory.  </li>
            <li>It is nice to have one tool that can do both (which I have had in the past).</li>
            <li>Build quality is outstanding; will not rust; will outlive you most likely  Cuts through thick nails with ease  </li>
            <li>Personally, when I need a file (which isn&#x27;t often with this true edged clipper), I use the one in my smallest Swiss Army Knife.  </li>
            <li>Personally, when I need a file (which isn&#x27;t often with this true edged clipper), I use the one in my smallest Swiss Army Knife.  </li>
            <li>in Japan, supposedly by the same folks that used to craft samurai swords, how cool is that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>The 9 dots on the back of the lever are just there to look cool...</li>
            <li>Ive looked for a good pair clippers for a long time, these are built like a tank and sharp.</li>
            <li>Due to my healthly strong nails, I have broke several nail clippers that I purchased at local stores, this one is very strong and does well trimming my nails.</li>
            <li>My previous $2 clippers from South Korea, which I lost, were far superior in finish, even if much less comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>The clipping part is made of steel and the top part that you press down with your thumb is made of cast aluminum.</li>
            <li>I love how sharp this nail clipper is!  </li>
            <li>If I could change one thing, I would put a rubber grip on the bottom to help prevent the smooth metal from slipping, but this certainly does not warrant a reduced rating.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to spend so much for a pair of clippers, but I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I never realized that paying a little more for tweezers and nail clippers would make so much difference.  </li>
            <li>Also, the part that you press down to cut should be able to be secured to the main part of the clipper.</li>
            <li>These nail clippers are made in Japan (not China) and are made of high grade steel with sharper edges and better leverage than an average nail clipper.</li>
            <li>so normally I don&#x27;t put much thought and effort into high quality hygiene products.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and cuts smooth!  </li>
            <li>It has a very sharp clip and should function well for many years.</li>
            <li>Probably so good at being sharp that I have to be careful not to cut too much of my fingernails,</li>
            <li>I barely have to use any pressure to cut right through them.</li>
            <li>These are a little heavier than the normal clippers, but they work much better, mostly because they are so sharp.</li>
            <li>These are by far the sharpest best cutting clippers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li>I still choose to file with an emery board, but because of the nice cut I spend less than half the time with the file compared to cheap clippers.</li>
            <li>I thought this nail clipper was going to be much better quality than the typical clippers you can buy in the drug store.  </li>
            <li>Since minimal pressure is required, they are easy on my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li>The more you pay, the less they do.</li>
            <li>More cut, less pinch.&lt;br /&gt;-Finish.  </li>
            <li>However, if you are mainly using it for manicure or pedicure purposes at home, then you can always buy a separate file for the job.  </li>
            <li>After using regular drug store, wal-mart quality fingernail clippers for several years, I decided to look for something better online and came across these.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had decent nail clippers.</li>
            <li>I anticipate getting many solid years of service with my weekly nail trimmings with the Seki and am deeply appreciate that Amazon allowed me to find this gem.</li>
            <li>I will keep this review short, after all, you are only buying a nail clipper :)</li>
            <li>I decided to give them a go and see how they compared to my classic Trim clippers that I bought for a couple bucks at CVS.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m leaving a review for both this fingernail clipper and the matching toenail clipper from the same company, SEKI EDGE, as many people will likely want to purchase both products for their nail-cutting needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper of course is much sharper than your standard clipper, but where it wins, is ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>I have no complaints against the company--just may be that as an older man, I&#x27;m not as flexible at using this item as others may be.  </li>
            <li>Compared to the Tweezerman clippers -- which set me back $12 -- these clippers are way better despite being about the same price.</li>
            <li>solidly made , work nice , but seem to slip sideways while in the closed position.</li>
            <li>I am glad I did not order the even more expensive one.</li>
            <li>Worth at least twice more than the 12 bucks I paid for them.</li>
            <li>These are a classic example of &amp;</li>
            <li>Back of clipper that fits into ball of hand isn&#x27;t super ergonomic.  </li>
            <li>It means good things about the manufacture of the product, but the inside sides of the two blade plates are such a harsh 90 degrees that it feels like it could cut me.  </li>
            <li>Also, the blade has a good shape and natural curve, the mouth opens wide, and is big enough to do large fingers and BIG toes just fine.  </li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to cut with and it cuts real sharp.</li>
            <li>They are larger and heavier than the normal clippers you might find, and a little pricey, but definitely do a good job.</li>
            <li>WIth most other clippers, the lever handle hits the keyring attachment and so the lever is always shifted to the left or right.  </li>
            <li>However, There is evident attention to grinding down these edges to make them smooth; they are.&lt;br /&gt;-Ergonomics.  </li>
            <li>Seki&#x27;s fingernail clipper is a fine precision instrument that makes accurate cutting easy and pleasurable.&lt;br /&gt;Quality feel and finish.</li>
            <li>The cheaper ones I&#x27;ve seen have this feature and can be pretty handy to help smooth out the nail after cutting.  </li>
            <li>Have a few around the house now :) with the first one being over 10 years old and still working well.</li>
            <li>I was curious how the best selling nail clippers on Amazon handled, and I could not be more disappointed.</li>
            <li>These cut cleanly through my nails with very little effort, they are very comfortable to hold and seem very solid.</li>
            <li>would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these Seki Edge clippers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>However, these are not to the point of out-of-reach high luxury items with gold plating and studded with diamonds.  </li>
            <li>The heft and precision of this highly engineered product will change your opinion that all fingernail clippers are alike.  </li>
            <li>I like the high quality of these clippers.  </li>
            <li>High quality.</li>

            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving this product a try regardless of what people say.</li>
            <li>These are pricy but the build quality backs up that high price.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend purchasing Seki.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>

            <li>They are &amp;#34;GREAT.&amp;#34;  I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I can highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I can highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them....</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended by a number of people I know.</li>
            <li>Recomend highly.</li>
            <li>It is definitely high quality product.</li>
            <li>high quality</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>This is a precision nail clipper of high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and don&#x27;t stick during use.</li>
            <li>Steel is high quality stuff too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned other Green Bell products, and I always thought they were great.  </li>
            <li>Very rigid, sharp, and jaws meet precisely.  </li>
            <li>The clippers seem sharp, but surprisingly often leave torn and partially attached fragments at the ends of my nails.  </li>
            <li>curved grip design is much more ergonomic and easier to use than traditional flat nail clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The clipper is very sharp (easy press to clip) and its Stainless Steel (impervious to salt water.)</li>
            <li>These were purchased to replace the best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever had (the old Brookstone clippers which have been changed several years ago with a less than average pair) after buying drug store selections for over a year.  </li>
            <li>And, my favorite part, they put a little &amp;#34;ramp&amp;#34; on the handle to keep your thumb from sliding off.</li>
            <li>Love these little clippers.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is the intended nature of the blades of the Seki Edge, and only what I received has this small defect, because other nail clippers I purchased before have their blades match perfectly.</li>
            <li>Wish that the head expanded a little more</li>
            <li>was expecting a little better based on reviews</li>
            <li>It does cut better then any other clipper especially on the first cut.</li>
            <li>This costs a little more</li>
            <li>I love this little thing.</li>
            <li>These cut fingernails with very little applied force and cut much more cleanly than even my Korean TRIMs, which were my standard for quality clippers before trying these.  </li>
            <li>They are expensive, but if you want quality nail clippers that leave a nice, clean edge</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try not to repeat all the other reviews (solid stainless instead of chrome plated pot-metal, made in Japan, intentionally made to be good rather than &#x27;enough&#x27;, does improve on the job, etc.)</li>
            <li>If you enjoy the feel of quality and are willing to pay for it, I recommend these as one of life&#x27;s little and affordable joys.</li>
            <li>Cuts are clean and consistent, &#x27;feel&#x27; is very solid, and overall is just a quality product.  </li>
            <li>Insanely sharp and easy to cut your nails with.</li>
            <li>They are easy to hold due to the shape of the handle.  </li>
            <li>It is so sharp it makes that job easy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Very sharp and cuts nails easily</li>
            <li>they are sharp and easy to use with one hand.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and high quality, these actually cut the nail and don&#x27;t break it like the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li>I sometimes wish they came with a mini-file, but by and large, the clip is smooth enough that no file is necessary.</li>
            <li>I used a TRIM nail clipper before these and that lasted me many years.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size (bigger than trim) I find it hard to grip it securely and have control over it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very surprised how much of a difference that sharp clippers make over a cheap pair.</li>
            <li>cut smoothly without rough spots.&lt;br /&gt;Their</li>
            <li>Also, a great and affordable quality item to gift to those people that are difficult to buy presents for.</li>
            <li>These clippers are expensive but they work great.</li>
            <li>It sounds weird to say, but these clippers are a joy to use.</li>
            <li>I have an old set of nail clippers (made in USA) that work really well, but I needed something for work.</li>
            <li>rough edges to smooth out,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sort of obsessed with my fingernails (which doesn&#x27;t result in them always looking great, as a guy, but they&#x27;re trimmed well)</li>
            <li>Really like it but wish it had a small pointed file attached as many fingernail clippers do.</li>
            <li>OK, so these are only nail clippers, and no need to get too excited, but it is difficult not to be excited about a product this good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Normal clippers flex</li>
            <li>The price is totally worth it since they last forever.</li>
            <li>Nor will I ever curse it for not cutting properly.  </li>
            <li>In particular, the end of the top (moving) part of the clipper is slightly curved with a raised \\&quot;ledge\\&quot; that you thumb rests against and prevents your thumb from repeatedly slipping off or (compared to clippers with a more pointed end) digging in to your thumb and starting to hurt.  </li>
            <li>The cheaper drug store clippers may not last as long, but do a better job.</li>
            <li>They are probably more expensive because of quality build, carefully thought out design, and the use of good materials and processes.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve owned the Seki/GreenBell toenail clippers for several years, and they are far better than anything else we&#x27;ve used in the last 6 decades.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing.&amp;#34;  I just sit back and smile because I know my job here is done.</li>
            <li>a few more dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth the extra cost...</li>
            <li>Very much worth the extra money you pay for it.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny I paid for this and the regular clippers.</li>
            <li>I plan to buy a few more to gift to family members.</li>
            <li>It looks so simple but man is it worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so worth the extra expense up front.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money; they will last for years.</li>
            <li>I pretty much only use these because they&#x27;re stainless steel</li>
            <li>i keep my nails short and this is worth ever penny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of those rare purchases that is inexpensive enough that you should do it where you can see the product in person before deciding to buy.</li>
            <li>I will probably purchase a few more for friends and family.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always seemed more reasonable to cut my nails over a small garbage can</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s always seemed more reasonable to cut my nails over a small garbage can</li>
            <li>I bought a few months ago that cut better.  </li>
            <li>At first I found the top handle a bit thick and clunky, but have found that I got used to it and appreciate its design and build.</li>
            <li>Others who post here and care to write more about it than me have said it all, I just advise you to buy them if you are the least interested in a quality nail clipper.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It functions properly, and I am sure I will have it for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It is far more solid than the cheaper clippers that you&#x27;ll find at the big box retail and drug store chains.</li>
            <li>I had a nail clipper that I bought in Japan for many years but got misplaced when I took it on a trip.  </li>
            <li>worth your money if you care enough to even be reading this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful not to trim too short because these clippers make it easy!</li>
            <li>This clipper really helps, it gives sharp and clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cut is sharp, fast, and clean.  </li>
            <li>However until using the Seki Stainless, I had never realized how much the old ones squeezed the nail (mild discomfort), then cut it, leaving a rough edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The long handle is very effective in removing hard to get toe nails</li>
            <li>The stainless steel is very sharp and cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li>It leaves a nice 90 degree angle on the nail, which actually makes it very sharp.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m confident that these will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I was getting tired of drugstore nail clippers, they always seemed so cheap, rusted easily, and never stood the test of time.</li>
            <li>Size is great,  not to small or too large,  just like the three little bears.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so sharp I love cutting my nails LOL</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but I believe it could have been made larger (my other clippers are all larger-</li>
            <li>If you own one you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>On top of that (at least on the ones I recieved) these leave the top edge of my nails EXTREMELY SHARP.</li>
            <li>This was just right without taking out a second mortgage.</li>
            <li>From the moderate knowledge and familiarity I have with Japanese culture, I know that when they set out to be the best, it can be a very serious venture.  </li>
            <li>If I loose these I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>The lever sits a little higher than I&#x27;m used to, but that might actually contribute to better control.</li>
            <li>On the Seki, the lever is connected to the the axle shaft by a real rivet that is sealed on both ends with a tight fit and NO wobble.  </li>
            <li>I had been having problems with nail clippers, never finding the right ones that would do a good job clipping my nails cleanly and evenly, not leaving spurs, could clip fingernails and toenails, could handle the corners on ingrown nails or problem areas, could handle small clean-up spots without making matters worse, and so forth.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed theses are very high quality and very sharp</li>
            <li>The nail is left clean with no rough edges.</li>
            <li>They are all fine products, but the only one I use on a regular basis is the Seki Edge.</li>
            <li>Very high quality, super sharp nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey, but cuts so much more cleanly than any other clipper I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>The nail clippers are actually sharp, thus not snagging your nail and breaking off the ends like the cheap grocery store brands.</li>
            <li>The blades are so precise and sharp it is unreal.</li>
            <li>None of the other brands of cheap clippers I had worked well at all</li>
            <li>It leaves a smooth edge, unlike any other clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>, you&#x27;ll have to file your nails to smooth out the sharp edges after using it.</li>
            <li>Cuts sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>Sharp, comfortable, feels durable.</li>
            <li>The offset clipping keeps the blade edge sharp, and precise.</li>
            <li>Extremely neat and smooth cut.</li>
            <li>Stays sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>I used to fight with the cheaper ones to get the job done, but these clippers are so sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li>Sharp and feels comfortable</li>
            <li>The way nails are cut seems cleaner and sharper than other cheap unit I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I still enjoy the smoke screen of all those other clippers in the house to confuse my clipper competitors.  </li>
            <li>I normally would not pay this much for some nail clippers but my old ones were about 10 years old</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how good the more expensive ones are over this one, but for the average person, just get this.  </li>
            <li>If the average nail clipper you find in the local store is good enough for you, then there&#x27;s no reason to read this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those cheap grocery store ones are not worth it, highly recommend using these clippers.</li>
            <li>so here I am buying a new pair.</li>
            <li>These are the new favorites in the house.</li>
            <li>These are my new go-to gift to get the people who have seemingly everything.</li>
            <li>the job.&lt;br /&gt;But not these new clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not want to live it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s Made\\&quot;  Needed a new nail clipper and thought what the heck.  </li>
            <li>My husband was always breaking other brands of clippers or they really just wore out quickly.  </li>
            <li>But if you look at the lesser clippers compared to this, their &#x27;mouth&#x27; almost seems to jut outward while the Seki come more straight down and seem to have &#x27;deeper teeth.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>Well made, very sharp, easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy too use, sturdy and very sharp.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-The blades are very sharp, and cut easily and cleanly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;These trim your nails easily, but leave you with a very sharp nail edge\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sharp and easy to handle.</li>
            <li>It just neatly and precisely slices the nail off, exactly where you place the cutters, with very little pressure required.  </li>
            <li>I never really thought I&#x27;d ever pay 15 bucks for a pair of clippers, but these are heavy, seem very sturdy, and cut both smoothly and cleanly.</li>
            <li>The Seki does not cut the nail as cleanly &amp; leaves the nails with a rough edge.</li>
            <li>I expected something more solid.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t go wrong and they are reasonably priced, if you&#x27;re used to buying good quality.</li>
            <li>I notice a hint of metal to metal sound when turning the handles, which probably will produce scratch marks over time, but this is not such a big issue to me.  </li>
            <li>Overall I found these two tools to be a nice and helpful addition to my everyday life.  </li>
            <li>You definitely want to be a bit more careful with it.  </li>
            <li>I tried to find another one just like it and had been searching for many years (spent over $30 on numerous nail clippers made in Germany, China, even Japan.)</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Enough heft to let you know this is solidly made with a comfortable feel&lt;</li>
            <li>So far I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra 10 bucks.</li>
            <li>This is redundant but not so; many clippers available at CVS and Walgreen do not work well leaving a less than coveted result.</li>
            <li>As someone who takes their nail clipping seriously, you&#x27;re doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t own these guys.</li>
            <li>Not only do the clippers have the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of quality, they perform excellent in cutting fingernails.  </li>
            <li>if I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d order a model with a nail file, but other than that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with these Samurai sharp clippers.</li>
            <li>I will NEVER go back to using the cheap clippers from the big box store.  </li>
            <li>but it does the job extremely well, feels good in the hand, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li>They are clearly made of high quality material.</li>
            <li>Each of us has certain tools or accessories in which we are more or less interested than the average person.  </li>
            <li>It is sharp, strong and the blades are slightly wider and farther apart to accommodate larger or more curved nails.  </li>
            <li>It makes cutting nails very clean, fast, and easy.</li>
            <li>The spring is strong and tight.  </li>
            <li>Now, after several months I am not so sure (and would like a reply or two from other purchasers).  </li>
            <li>I bought these clippers after my trusty 20+ year old German-made clippers finally succumbed to metal fatigue, and the cheap China-made replacements I initially bought just didn&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li>I am not sure if it works that much better to justify the price, but then again this is not a review of pricing.</li>
            <li>This of course is not a big issue but my first impression was that this sticker somewhat cheapened the look.  </li>
            <li>For a man especially, the textured handles make grip and control a much better experience than with any other brand.  </li>
            <li>it cuts through finger nails like a hot knife through butter, is solid in the hand, and feels like it will never break.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll never need another pair, except with your significant other keeps stealing them from you.</li>
            <li>to keep them in my travel kit, they are small and OK in an emergency.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male, so filing my nails isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve done before or am willing to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No more carpal tunnel from struggling with cheap clippers!</li>
            <li>Consequently, my fingernails and toenails are also pretty big.</li>
            <li>- wow!  </li>
            <li>Bomb proof, epic clipper!</li>
            <li>I spent FAR MORE for the same results.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll get back to you in 15 years, or when it breaks, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li>I purchased one of these at a much higher price from Brookstone 6 or so years back.</li>
            <li>in fact, this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever left on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>There is a higher grit used on the final grinding of the blade edges than on any of my clippers.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps this results in greater flexibility - I wouldn&#x27;t put it past the makers to have thought this through.&lt;br /&gt;-Flair.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp and nice, but wish they would not slide right or left when they are closed.  </li>
            <li>So, the new ones are still new in the package and I&#x27;m still using my old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first went down the road of purchasing a cheap pair of nail clippers at a local retailer.</li>
            <li>And for all you good ole Americans too dumb to consider anything made outside of your safe little country, these are from the far east.</li>
            <li>They cut cleanly and, while expensive, I expect to get many years of use out of these fingernail clippers.  </li>
            <li>These are a huge improvement over any other clipper that I have ever used!</li>
            <li>Sharp and clean cuts.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly and maintains sharp edge.  </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp, and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li>Edge is sharp and cut is clean.</li>
            <li>The blade is really sharp and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li>The Seki Edge is sharp and cuts clean every time.  </li>
            <li>It is sharp, and cuts nails cleanly.</li>
            <li>This thing will go right through thick nails with easy, leaving a very clean cut that hardly requires filing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this nail clipper if you&#x27;ve ever been aggravated with the uneven or torn cut that you get from cheap clippers.</li>
            <li>They feel quite substancial in your hand, have a smooth mechanism, and are very sharp.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li>Very sharp and goes through nails smoothly.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re very sharp and work smoothly.  </li>
            <li>These are very sharp and mechanically precise.</li>
            <li>Very well made with an excellent sharp cutting edge.  </li>
            <li>I actually tossed all the other ones in the house and will be ordering another pair of these for a back up, they are that nice.  </li>
            <li>I always bought the old cheap-o and just bought new ones every two to three months.</li>
            <li>He showed me his identical 4 year old split thumb nail and told me to live with it.  </li>
            <li>my old finger nail clippers were, let alone my relatively new toe nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>The Seki shows me just how far new technology has come.  </li>
            <li>Very precise, and easy cutting.  </li>
            <li>Hands down better than the little cheap things hanging in most stores, where the quality you get it just luck of the draw; where the best are half decent and the worst can&#x27;t even handle a hangnail.</li>
            <li>Since heat treat is likely, that would mean needing to use coarse, medium, and fine grits to remove metal smoothly but without causing too much friction heat.  </li>
            <li>From the ever so slightly curved blades, to the ergonomic styled handle with groves and indentations to ensure a comfortable and stable grip.</li>
            <li>The lever is longer than typical cheap clippers, with a recessed indent for the thumb.  </li>
            <li>Seems genuine and long lasting.</li>
            <li>After owning these you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever bothered with the typical stuff available in the drug stores like Revlon or LaCross.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly, easy for the thickest nails, and has held up well to heavy use by a bunch of us.</li>
            <li>my 8 year old cut his nails a bit short the first time because he wasn&#x27;t used to them.  </li>
            <li>This Seki version costs a little more than average, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>but most are not very good.</li>
            <li>sister was right; pay a few more bucks at the start to avoid replacing every other year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also because of the weight of the extra metal in the bar you press down on, it feels more effortless when you are clipping.</li>
            <li>Despite this bulkiness, I can see this clipper being ergonomically friendly for those with large or small hands.  </li>
            <li>I am careful when using them because they are so sharp I could shear through skin very easily</li>
            <li>If I buy two pair of a given brand, I find one clips just fine while the second gets about half way through my nail and decides it&#x27;s just too much work</li>
            <li>Everything that other people have said is true.</li>
            <li>I found these to be better than the \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot;, but less necessary than the toe nail model.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe that this model works so well and is half the cost of the expensive one yet works flawlessly!.</li>
            <li>The top part bends before the fingernail is cut if you cut your fingernails while they are dry and the edge of the fingernail is rough, after the cut, and needs to be filed.    </li>
            <li>These are definitely the ones to get if you want an easy cut without any rough edges.</li>
            <li>these gripes about the common nail clipper ring a bell with you, then I strongly suggest you try the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Nail Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Before settling on this one, I tried a few others, which cost less, but the quality wasn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li>For all the rave reviews these clippers recieved, and the relatively high price of these seki vs other clippers, I expected much more.</li>
            <li>The brushed stainless steel found on the body and the smooth sandblasted surface look on the handle is nicer than the chrome plated or \\&quot;gold\\&quot; plated shiny ones typically found elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>I was tired of the drugstore type nail clippers and decided to purchase something that would last and would cut finger nails easily and leave a smooth cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent half as much and gotten much better quality</li>
            <li>It also has a large enough opening for toe nails.    </li>
            <li>: they&#x27;re shaped in a way that makes holding them much easier than older traditional (even high end traditional)</li>
            <li>The Seki Edge one cuts your nail cleanly and you don&#x27;t even have to file it after because it&#x27;s not sharp/jagged like other nail clippers!</li>
            <li>Ah, the simple and affordable luxuries that make the downturn in the economy a little more bearable.</li>
            <li>To this day, I&#x27;m still using the little steel nail file on my old cheap unit, even after I cut my nails with the Seki.  </li>
            <li>Yes you are going to pay a little more for these than regular clippers</li>
            <li>Slightly larger than most clippers so a little bulky feeling.</li>
            <li>They are SO sharp that that they cut through nails as if they were butter, but the truth is they do leave you with mildly raggedy nails.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re hard pressed to find anything better.  </li>
            <li>:  Super Sharp, Does not chip</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t as extraordinary as other reviewers have out, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>goes through a tomato better than a dull knife.  </li>
            <li>The cut is so quick and sharp, I almost worry.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li>These do seem like quality clippers and they arrived super sharp.</li>
            <li>they are super sharp, and never chip, fray, or tear your nails.</li>
            <li>These are super sharp and cut effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They are super sharp, and glide through fingernails with ease.  </li>
            <li>If you want a super sharp clipper, this is for you.</li>
            <li>These are super sharp and require amost no effort to use.  </li>
            <li>Cut was average, nothing special.</li>
            <li>Sharp, the curved blade is easy to work with and solidly built.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, strong, feels like it will last longer than me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are very sharp and the members are rigid, which means that they don&#x27;t yield when you hit the nail but shear cleanly though.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp and cut the nail clean.  </li>
            <li>Very sharp and cuts clean</li>
            <li>Very sharp, cuts nails cleanly.</li>
            <li>Great cutting for a finger nail clippers.  </li>
            <li>these cutters do a great job at cutting nails (d&#x27;uh).  </li>
            <li>Great leverage for ease of cutting.</li>
            <li>These are so much sharper, leaves my nails smooth, and are solid and heavy.  </li>
            <li>it was crystal clear</li>
            <li>and all I can say is WOW</li>
            <li>The blades are formed from polished stainless steel, the handle from a brushed metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are professional clippers if there are any.  </li>
            <li>My husband always complains about his cheap nail-clippers that break after a few months.</li>
            <li>This one did the trick he says that now he is the happiest man alive.</li>
            <li>Made from stainless steel is a big plus and won&#x27;t rust in the shower.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer these over the regular toenail clippers since these are smaller and can cut with more precision than regular toenail clippers.</li>
            <li>Have used old, worn out or key-ring versions for years...  after tearing up nails &amp; fighting w/inferior types I bought these out of frustration.  </li>
            <li>I am 66 years old and have gone through a lot of fingernail clippers over the years.  </li>
            <li>The Seki clipper closes smoothly and predictably as you squeeze it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want a complete manicure these are not for you.  </li>
            <li>like taking a precision tool to tree stumps (in the case of my old, gnarled toenails)</li>
            <li>You either have to get several clippers to place in your car, office and home, or you have to get used to using these and then changing to a much inferior clippers when you want to work on your nails somewhere else.</li>
            <li>and I still prefer my old cheapies.    </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no flex in the lever action.  </li>
            <li>works very well and a vast improvement over the cheaper ones out there.</li>
            <li>The thickness of the metal really make them feel like they were built to be your last pair of clippers ever.  </li>
            <li>but I find that to be common with most clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended; I suspect the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li>I thought wow, it never dawned on me</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re by far the sharpest</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an old fashioned clipper.</li>
            <li>It seems very well made and that it will last.</li>
            <li>far as the product does we have no issues.</li>
            <li>/&gt; old and arthritic</li>
            <li>Now can pitch all those old ones we have that don&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li>and wow...</li>
            <li>I have soft nails, so maybe don&#x27;t buy this if you have soft nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After using the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper, I realized all clippers were not made equal.</li>
            <li>At this price point for a nail clipper I find this completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Never using those old clippers again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought several $5 drug store clippers and now thanks to Seki Edge</li>
            <li>Much sharper than stuff you get at your local store.</li>
            <li>So far I don&#x27;t see any sign that it will lose its sharpness anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I clip my nails in the tub when they&#x27;re soft</li>
            <li>Took me nearly 50 years to find these.</li>
            <li>Will never waste money on another brand.</li>
            <li>I dont understand how the edge can be hand finished and be that far off.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve held up for a couple of years so far and work for both my fingernails and toenails.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the highest quality fingernail clipper I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>They cut very decisively and the oversized bottom grip helps immensely with precision.</li>
            <li>I suggest do not waste money on this.  </li>
            <li>Completely over rated.</li>
            <li>I keep my old clippers around just so I can use the file/scraper thing.</li>
            <li>I am still using my old clippers at times because of this.</li>
            <li>My husband uses clippers in the shower, and the rust marks left from cheaper, non-stainless steel clippers really annoy me.  </li>
            <li>(being what seems like 100% stainless steel), the way the clippers actually clip the nails off, the weight of the clippers, etc.</li>
            <li>It feels like a professional tool in the hand.</li>
            <li>but i would not say by far.</li>
            <li>Almost like it comes alive in your hands.</li>
            <li>It does this one thing and one thing only really well.</li>
            <li>Made in Japan, and they put my old Made in USA brand to shame, never mind the...</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough about how much easier and faster it is to trim my nails and our children&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Our kids used to complain that the old clippers hurt.  </li>
            <li>Blades are quite sharp and very exact.</li>
            <li>Before they arrived, she found my old ones.</li>
            <li>any I&#x27;ve had so far.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I actually cut myself with my nails by accident.</li>
            <li>STAY FAR AWAY from these.</li>
            <li>They are much, much sharper than the standard drugstore cheapies.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at personel item in my xmas stocking.</li>
            <li>Owned it for nearly two years now, I think,</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li>Not so much for my toenails, but I have a bigger nail clipper for that.</li>
            <li>They far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I had just bought some drug store ones to replace the old ones I couldn&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li>Reminds me of old phonograph players.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>Wow...  </li>
            <li>The brand sticker is really uninspiring and is just an open sticker.  </li>
            <li>They give you good control over what you are doing and the cutting edges seem to cut really well.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are more expensive, but hands-down worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely designed for a smaller hand, for what it&#x27;s worth...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect these (or any nail clippers) to last more than a few years.</li>
            <li>The actual steel it is made of appears to be good but the cut is poor.  </li>
            <li>My nail was broken to the point that I had to trim it shorter than I liked</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a good nail clipper</li>
            <li>cast level has a nice feel and adds extra leverage to power through even thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;-Made</li>
            <li>(if anyone will be claiming otherwise - most likely they are paid shills for certain company, and unfortunately Amazon attracts many of these).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it sharp?</li>
            <li>These are very sharp, quality steel, nice finish and will last as long as you have nails.</li>
            <li>With this clipper you get a nice, sharp cut and often you don&#x27;t need to do any filing at all, except for a little touch up.</li>
            <li>Great - this thing is sharp and cutts tough nails like a snap.  </li>
            <li>They are stainless steel, not chrome plated with very sturdy construction with a great cutting edge that seems to stay sharp.  </li>
            <li>Good, sharp clippers, but they don&#x27;t open wide enough.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re sharp, the rod that holds the pivot for the lever is solid (as opposed to being notched to accept the pivot), and the action of the lever is precise.</li>
            <li>For me - yes, BUT the shape of your hands and fingers (and other stuff like thickness and hardness of your nails) is most likely different</li>
            <li>Only criticism is the same one in many other reviews.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m a little excited about this,</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re rather large (larger than the little cheapy ones you can buy in the store), which makes for a better gripping surface, but kind of big to be cutting nails on little kids.  </li>
            <li>Definitely not, but neither are clippers by any other brand, including hugely overpriced models which are \\&quot;made in Solingen, Germany\\&quot; or the ones with \\&quot;creative\\&quot; names like \\&quot;Clyppi\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My only solution is clippers that clip cleanly, leaving edges as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wasting my time with all those cheap 50c clippers which needed twice the effort to cut or even left sharp raggedy edges on my nails.</li>
            <li>Not the fault of the clipper, just try out other models with different shapes, you might find the one that will fit YOU the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is extremely sharp, and the cutting edges are perfectly aligned.  </li>
            <li>Although it is sharp enough to cut your nails smoothly, it is too small to use easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to tell the difference in the inexpensive clippers one usually finds in the drug store.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s not pointy like the back of lesser clippers, but the way it flares out at the back and is slightly thin (metal is thinner because of higher quality - it&#x27;s a good thing)</li>
            <li>Has a very nice cutting edge.</li>
            <li>The idea behind the chefs advice was that instead of buying an entire set of marginally effective knives, just purchase two high quality, versatile knives and master them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The connection in the rear is the usual stamp-press to fuse the metals, but the stamp is especially large and you can see plenty of material has been shifted in the process.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp!</li>
            <li>First, probably the function they give you (chopping off your nails)... and second... that they&#x27;re a cheap and common</li>
            <li>I was wrong, it turned out to be like those cheap ones you can buy that has a keychain; pretty much forcing to cut rather than clipping it.  </li>
            <li>I have no experience with other quality nail clippers to compare to, but these are certainly worth owning a pair of.</li>
            <li>Makes cutting your nails very smooth and quick.</li>
            <li>It works fine, not much more to say.</li>
            <li>This is actually the second clippers I have bought because when I moved, somehow I lost/misplaced my first set.  </li>
            <li>bought several different brands of these higher priced clippers to run a &amp;#34;taste test&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how many different fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve owned in the past 60 years.  </li>
            <li>actually ordered these to replace the exact same ones I&#x27;ve had for well over a decade.</li>
            <li>I purchased a second one recently and the build quality appears to be identical to my first one.</li>
            <li>, I found that Green Bell makes a ton of other models of nail clippers under a different Japanese packaging (it&#x27;s available at the Narita/Haneda airports, Tokyo Hands, and many of the local stores in Tokyo).</li>
            <li>These are two of the few times that I feel let down with an apparently popular purchase based on Amazon community reviews.</li>
            <li>The clippers make such a clean cut that the edge is sharp.  </li>
            <li>Razor sharp, instant no effort cut and clean as a whistle</li>
            <li>Sharp and size is just right.</li>
            <li>It is essential that the corners of the cutting jaws meet perfectly, which is why most cheapies fail this task.  </li>
            <li>High quality, very solid.</li>
            <li>High quality, Japanese steel and grinding.</li>
            <li>High quality nail clippers that vastly exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>I find the cutting action to be quite smooth, rather than the sudden snap of many others.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li>High quality; should be the last I ever buy if I don&#x27;t lose it.</li>
            <li>The high price is the only reason I deducted a star.</li>
            <li>Super sharp (Japanese), these things clip right throw with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;m a shipfitter/welder, not some GQ type, and my hands take a beating at work; I needed a real tool keep my claws trimmed, not some chintzy little fru-fru device, and this does just fits the bill - and, just like any quality tool, it&#x27;s well worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li>Last year, I decided that I would buy quality products that worked well instead of cheap products that would cost me less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; clippers give a great cut with the sharp blades, but I find them a little too heavy and smooth/slippery to grip well when clipping my young kids nails.  </li>
            <li>we were having nothing but trouble with the junky clippers made for infants, I went to Amazon and purchased every infant nail clippers listed: literally every single one (there weren&#x27;t that many).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of curiousity I have asked the US distributor to find out what steel is being used in these and will report back if I find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who may be searching, I&#x27;ve discovered that Seki does in fact manufacture a baby nail clippers, not available on Amazon but available directly from Seki.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Out of curiousity I have asked the US distributor to find out what steel is being used in these and will report back if I find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who may be searching, I&#x27;ve discovered that Seki does in fact manufacture a baby nail clippers, not available on Amazon but available directly from Seki.</li>
            <li>And, the price is reasonable, when you consider that you will have these 10x as long as the drug store clippers.  </li>
            <li>I waited a long time to get them because of the cost--and replaced 6 other cheap ones that kept breaking or dulling to non-use status in the meantime.  </li>
            <li>Took a really long time to choose because I really did not want to have to return it.  </li>
            <li>This has been a sound strategy for me in the past with ball point pens</li>
            <li>It should hold it edge for a long time if the quality of the stainless steel is any indication.</li>
            <li>Using normal clippers, I always find myself fumbling with them because of my big hands.</li>
            <li>see no reason these clippers would not last a life time of normal use.</li>
            <li>Not much to say except these function exactly as they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li>Really sharp, really works, compared to the normal drug store clippers</li>
            <li>Smooth edges left on your fingernails because of the sharp cutters on the clipper and, since the lever is twice as thick as the cheap fingernail clippers, there&#x27;s no bending of the lever.</li>
            <li>It should last through years of normal use.</li>
            <li>From the first few uses, these will be exactly the same.</li>
            <li>A bit expensive for a nail clipper, but worth so much more than the throw-away clippers you get in sets, or simply have laying around.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I wish I would have paid the few extra dollars and bought the better quality clipper.</li>
            <li>I have wide nails, so if the clipper was a little wider would be even better.  </li>
            <li>The clippers are a little on the curved side, meaning that they don&#x27;t cut across your nail in a straight line very well.  </li>
            <li>I expect these clippers to last for several years, but even if they only last a few years, they&#x27;ll still have been a better investment than the crummy five-dollar clippers I&#x27;ll never use again!</li>
            <li>As mentioned in most other reviews, they are very sharp and cut effortlessly.  </li>
            <li>They cut effortlessly leaving a clean edge, and I&#x27;ve been using it for all my nail-cutting needs (along with the occasional price tag removal) for six months with no slowing down.  </li>
            <li>They seem to stay super sharp and actually cut instead of tear.  </li>
            <li>Also, I would have liked a straight cutting edge</li>
            <li>it comes to cutting nails, it does so cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li>Keep them dry even though they are advertised as stainless steel.</li>
            <li>Yesterday it slipped straight out of my hand into the bathtub (my hands were dry).</li>
            <li>then I would stick to the regular nail clippers that cost only 1/3 as much.</li>
            <li>After trying a slew of alternatives, I purchased a Seki Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper several months back.  </li>
            <li>(Just be careful to only swipe the very tips of the corners and not the main part of the blade.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note:</li>
            <li>It seems strange to be writing a review about a nail clipper, but this is the first example I&#x27;ve owned that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to with zero fuss.</li>
            <li>but for me suffice it to say that these are really the only clippers I want to use into the future.</li>
            <li>The action is far smoother than your standard 99 cent</li>
            <li>When the product is less than $15, this is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>This one is truly different and makes it much easier to use, especially with kids!</li>
            <li>After buying what I thought was good clippers at a beauty store to have them fail about 9-12 months later I called the customer service</li>
            <li>Easily cut my husband&#x27;s thick nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally possible that I&#x27;m just very sensitive.</li>
            <li>This cuts both ways I guess, we love that these are sharp, don&#x27;t leave little bits, don&#x27;t take a ton of pressure... but</li>
            <li>Title says it all - these are way more expensive than your standard clippers, but from the moment you hold them you know they are much higher quality.  </li>
            <li>For me - yes, especially compared to the junky \\&quot;no-name\\&quot; clippers you can get at your local pharmacy or any store which sells grooming items and which usually require much more effort to operate then</li>

            <li>No other clipper I&#x27;ve had has compared.</li>
            <li>They cut extremely well, are sturdy, and look pretty sleek too.</li>
            <li>Majorly bummed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since January and it still cuts just as sharp as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li>There are no other attached utilities, like cheaper trimmers have.</li>
            <li>Well, first, they don&#x27;t seem to be all that sharp.  </li>
            <li>They seem pretty sharp, but 75% of the time, they split my nail.</li>
            <li>The curve of the blades is a little more extreme than I&#x27;m used to but everything else makes up for it.</li>
            <li>Well built, sharp, and gets the job done the first time without splintering nails.</li>
            <li>A little pricey especially when you are used to buying clippers for 4-5 dollars, but if you think you might want this, I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>It is the strangest feeling to touch your own fingernails and wonder why they feel so.... sharp and hard.</li>
            <li>Very sharp clean cutting clippers, good quality, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Not only do that cut cleanly and with precision, but they require little hand/finger pressure to make the cut.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;The materials used in their manufacture include the tried-and-tested carbon steel categories C45 and C60; however, more than half of them are manufactured from non-corrosive stainless steel including at least 13% chromium and 0.46% carbon.</li>
            <li>I will be placing my order once I&#x27;ve decided what else to purchase along with it.ude the tried-and-tested carbon steel categories C45 and C60; however, more than half of them are manufactured from non-corrosive stainless steel including at least 13% chromium and 0.46% carbon.</li>
            <li>The design makes them comfortable to hold and provides extra leverage for easy cutting.  </li>
            <li>These are fairly small and clip cleanly.  </li>
            <li>but seriously when you go on interviews or talking to superiors or working with your hands, you would be surprised how important it is to have well kept nails.</li>
            <li>As I get older it is getting more difficult to trim my finger nails.  </li>
            <li>however, the handle is angled up high and is long.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item because the cheap nail clippers I got at home would no longer cut my hard fingernails.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was tired of the cheaply made clippers that never worked well, so although $13 is quite high for a clipper I decided to give it a chance.  </li>
            <li>It would be better if the cutting edge opened a little more.  </li>
            <li>Takes very little effort to cut through nails and they are very sharp providing a crisp clean cut.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a sharp edge to the cut, but it isn&#x27;t burred or rough like how less effective dime-store cutters leave the edge of the nail.    </li>
            <li>With cheapo clippers, I&#x27;ve generally used an emery board anyway.</li>
            <li>Oh well, files are available at least.</li>
            <li>For the first time ever, I actually enjoyed cutting my nails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used such a high-quality pair of nail clippers before, usually opting to purchase those cheap $2 department store brand clippers.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve worked your way through a bunch of ordinary nail clippers that eventually lose sharpness or make unclean cuts, you might feel like you&#x27;re ready for the real deal.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first, but looking at everyone&#x27;s review I took a chance and what a difference they make over the cheap ones you buy at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>No rough jaggies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had 2 old RED Hello Kitty nail clippers (discontinued) for 18+ years</li>
            <li>They simply don&#x27;t work as well as my old pair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not careful, I could slice a chunk of finger off.  </li>
            <li>The seven year old split is finally healed.  </li>
            <li>I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li>and I could probably get away without filing because they leave no rough edge.</li>
            <li>It feels like I&#x27;m forcing my toe far back in there and am bound to lop off a toe tip.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a lot of different nail clippers over the course of my life, and this is the sharpest one I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>you clip a fingernail with these, there is NO rough edge to file or remove.</li>
            <li>But no recent department or drug store clipper I&#x27;ve used has worked nearly as well as the 30</li>
            <li>noticeably for me was how i barely had had to file my nails after using this clipper.</li>
            <li>, you barely have to file them.</li>
            <li>Given that nail-catchers don&#x27;t catch all the nails, and I have a tendency to tip my cutter downwards which would always result in caught clippings falling out, the inconveniences of all the nail-catchers I&#x27;ve used over the years far outweigh the actual convenience of having one.</li>

            <li>I recently had to use an old clipper of my mom&#x27;s and immediately regretted not waiting until I got home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a smaller version of the toe clipper and has no functionality as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t extend far out enough or something.</li>
            <li>Also, if you are one to cut your nails really short be cautious because this will cut through the sensitive part under the nail with ease.</li>
            <li>and I doubt I’ll ever go back to TRIM, even when my hand gets back to normal.</li>
            <li>Good standard curve on the cutting edge to make adult cuts.</li>
            <li>Since a clipper is used every few days, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>However, the clip is where it counts most, and on that front: the finishing is quite poor quality.</li>
            <li>Then when I saw the Seki name, I recalled that my very expensive and rare folding knife is made in Seki Japan, where some of the sharpest knives in the world are made using exotic steels.  </li>
            <li>and they cut smoothly through even the thick thumb nails.</li>
            <li>Most nail clippers do a poor job.</li>
            <li>Out of the box it worked extremely well as cutting nails and did so leaving clean edges that really don&#x27;t require filing to smooth out.  </li>
            <li>Whether dry or moist and softened, these super sharp clippers will have you tossing all the drug-store brands in the trash.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old dull clippers because they leave my nail edges softer, more natural and not as sharp.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind it because the benefit of the sharper jaws (you do not need to squeeze the lever as hard as on most other clippers) really outweighs this minor drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now days, most of the clippers have a little storage area on it to gather all of your clipped off fingernails, so it won&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li>This nail clipper is sharp, and it keeps sharp, I have had it for 1 yr and a half and its holding its own.</li>
            <li>They may be a little more expensive than more common clippers, even after shopping around online, but for products that give a lifetime of frustration and problem-free service, the extra outlay is well worth it.</li>
            <li>The resulting satisfaction from such a mundane activity as clipping my nails is completely worth</li>
            <li>The edges are very sharp and cut nails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li>First, they are very sharp, high-quality clippers - and sharpness</li>
            <li>I actually have to hide these from other family members to make sure they don&#x27;t go missing.</li>
            <li>you clip down, this will not struggle, it will simply cut right through.  </li>
            <li>Green Bell (makers of Seki) got it right.</li>
            <li>The cut from the Seki is so smooth and clean, I actually don&#x27;t have to file them afterward, and they make me look forward to cutting my nails.</li>
            <li>The construction is very high quality, blades are sharp, and the shape is ergonomic.</li>
            <li>Short of a tiny lightsaber, I cannot imagine a more powerful tool for nail cutting.</li>
            <li>These are precise, sharp, and cut down on time to cut nails.</li>
            <li>Personally I don&#x27;t mind it because the benefit of the sharper jaws (you do not need to squeeze the lever as hard as on most other clippers) really outweighs this minor drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are no loose or wobbly</li>
            <li>In particular, the blade is quite sharp and the clipping mechanism works pretty well that you only have to exert minimal force to clip your nails.</li>
            <li>I have smaller fingers and fingernails, so it might harder for a person with large nails to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp and can cut my nail sharply and accurately.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than some other upscale clippers.</li>
            <li>Still was pricey though, you shouldnt have to spend so much just to get sharp clippers.</li>
            <li>The nail clipper works very well &amp; cuts sharply.</li>
            <li>/&gt;PS, the emery board on a couple of the other brands worked really well.</li>
            <li>The fact that they are sharp makes for cuts that I don&#x27;t really have to use a file on.</li>
            <li>Very well made and sharp.  </li>
            <li>They cut so clean and effortlessly, even hard nails.</li>
            <li>Perhaps that opinion is due to our possession of some really crappy clippers he used for comparison.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and work really well on even thicker nails.</li>
            <li>Unlike any other stainless steel, its forged in Seki, Japan.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a few uses to become completely comfortable with them however as the metal is quite slick to hold on to but feels very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li>It feels really sturdy, and is extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li>When you use it, you really feel the difference from any other nail clipper</li>
            <li>They are sharp and don&#x27;t require much pressure to cut.</li>
            <li>These absolutely blow away every other clipper I have used.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the little premium over regular clippers.</li>
            <li>I got tired of those dull, easy to break cheap ones that you find at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>These clippers work really nice , really sharp , smooth cutting with minimal effort even with thickest nails.</li>
            <li>These are sharp and work very smoothly but (it&#x27;s hard to explain)</li>
            <li>The cutting edges are so much sharper and it just works better.</li>
            <li>Once used, they passed that quality on to the actual physical action.  </li>
            <li>The only criticism is the blade surface isn&#x27;t quite long enough and requires several cuts on each nail (more than usual).  </li>
            <li>Comfortable thick lever makes this easier to use than standard clippers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li>I went through TRIM clippers that were made in the USA, Korea, and the latest Chinese TRIM clippers, and there was no joy whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>Superior cutting edges, lasting for years, in my experience.</li>
            <li>When I use other nail clippers, they generally require too much pressure to properly work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are better for fingernais, but they are sharp sharp sharp.  </li>
            <li>The first couple times I used it I cut a little too close to the skin</li>
            <li>In other words, although the blade seems very sharp, it often doesn&#x27;t give me a clean</li>
            <li>Granted, they&#x27;re at least double the price of the cheapo brands, but I&#x27;ve gone through enough of the cheap ones to make up the cost difference.</li>
            <li>It really shouldn&#x27;t be hard to buy a decent nail clipper.</li>
            <li>how about that, they really built something that is does a better job at something as simple as cutting nails</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting the cheaper ones that work pretty well for a few years and then just replace them...</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>a couple times the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li>As a man, I carry clippers everyday in either my work pants or casual clothing(clippers can be used in many useful ways).</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with it is that it feels kind of big and is a little harder to maneuver than my previous clippers.</li>
            <li>The reason they leave such a noticeable edge is because they ARE sharper than other clippers and make such a clean cut across one&#x27;s fingernails that there is a sharp 90-degree-angle edge where the cut was made.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for 5½ years now and it is still as sharp as new!  </li>
            <li>And there is no way I&#x27;m getting intimate with my wife until I&#x27;ve filed these nails down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve very picky, and found that most I&#x27;ve used are either poorly designed, flimsy, or just plain dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been wanting clippers like this for a long time, and I finally got &#x27;em!I would rarely use nail-catchers on my previous clippers anyways.</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the few extra dollars which you pay initially as it will probably last for years!</li>
            <li>These are very well made clippers and very sharp.</li>
            <li>Yea, it does - like I mentioned before the clipper is VERY sharp straight from the factory</li>
            <li>and although you can&#x27;t do detail work due to the width and size of this clipper, it is incredibly high quality for the money.</li>
            <li>These fingernail clippers are made extremely durable, and feel like a high quality product.  </li>
            <li>the typical &#x27;made in China&#x27; stainless steel nail clipper.  </li>
            <li>After a day of handling items, opening doors, and typing on the computer, I noticed my nail was slightly separated from the finger on the very tip causing it to be sore</li>
            <li>Its just odd because really they seem well made</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t seem like much to ask but i went thru half a dozen clippers and they were all garbage.</li>
            <li>action handle / lever is a bit long and causes me to lose a bit of dexterity over the smaller ones.  </li>
            <li>How long can I expect the old clippers and file to last?    </li>
            <li>I was skeptical on spending the money on these since they cost a pretty penny, but boy was it worth it.  </li>
            <li>My fingers don&#x27;t open that wide normally when I am using a clipper.  </li>
            <li>But I was pretty skeptical that they&#x27;d be worth the price.</li>
            <li>It certainly seems to be very well constructed and precise... just not for me:-(</li>
            <li>had such high hopes for these based on the reviews, but they left a rough edge on my fingernails.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and require much less force than the cheapo ones.</li>
            <li>These clippers are very sharp and cut the nails without requiring much pressure, but I have found that to be a bit of a problem with trying to keep my nails short.</li>
            <li>And the personal grooming tools I use have got to be high quality and sharp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d expensive for a clipper, but I&#x27;ve never owned one that clips half way as good as this.</li>
            <li>The whole body curves down, and I think that increases grip, and the flair-out at the back actually improves grip too.  </li>
            <li>I have big hands and therefore pretty wide nails, with some clippers i have to hit each nail 3 times; but these are wide enough hat in 1 or 2 clips the nail is neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was putting up with until my clippers finally broke and forced me to get new ones.</li>
            <li>Green Bell is an outstanding Japanese company that is well known for making high precision cutting instruments and the very finest personal grooming tools.  </li>
            <li>so more sturdy, have a 50% taller opening (making nail positioning that much easier) and are a couple of dollars less expensive (at the time of this review</li>
            <li>Sometimes you need to clean under your nails, or grind down that little edge that you can&#x27;t reach with the clipper.  </li>
            <li>And then buy a few pair to gift to those who&#x27;d shirk at the cost, yet would certainly appreciate them.</li>
            <li>The clipper is a little larger than I had anticipated, but not so large that it is too big to be controlled.</li>
            <li>The only reason I am giving it a star less is because of the fact that it kind of leaves jagged edges behind, which is not really a big deal seeing as I am used to the drugstore clippers doing that.</li>
            <li>Sturdy little nail clipper that cuts very well.</li>
            <li>Thought I&#x27;d try some new clippers and these are incredibly sharp.  </li>
            <li>You can imagine my disappointment when they arrived and the first cut I made (on the skin around the cuticle), ripped the skin instead of making a clean cut.</li>
            <li>Super sharp and quality heavy duty construction.</li>
            <li>After spending untold dollars at department stores and pharmacies trying to find a trimmer capable of trimming my thick, tough nails caused by many years of manual labor, I lucked out and found this one.</li>
            <li>The old ones wouldn&#x27;t cut my thumbnails, which are kind of tough and thick.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase which was to replace the problematic (dull, difficult) nail clipper I bought at Target a couple of years ago, as well as the pair we bought at a pharmacy a few years before that.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a few months now; it is very sharp and makes clean cuts.</li>
            <li>but these days the quality got so bad I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore and have been looking for a good one for about a year.  </li>

            <li> amazing nail cutter!</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers!</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are amazing!</li>
            <li> , I was just more impressed with the toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> Great quality - maybe too good?  </li>
            <li> The weight and blade on these are superb and I could not ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> Given how often and how many times you will use nail clippers over your lifetime, don&#x27;t you deserve to use the best?  </li>
            <li> Great quality, good price and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The most awesome nail clippers ever.</li>
            <li> These are excellent, I keep them in the shower on a semi-dry shelf, they have been there for 6 months or more, and no sign of rust.</li>
            <li> These clippers are spectacular!</li>
            <li> the most wonderful thing ever!!</li>
            <li> These cut perfectly every time with the satisfying clip noise.</li>
            <li> For the cost, everyone should own a pair!</li>
            <li> These clippers are remarkably well-made, both in design and execution.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever found and I have had dozens in many price ranges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many clippers over the years, and this is hands-down the best I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> The best is that you don&#x27;t have to struggle trying to align the top after spinning it around since it&#x27;s locked in place.</li>
            <li> What a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nail clipper the best I have ever used and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to cut; I was quite impressed.  </li>
            <li> These are easily the best clippers I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> Although it does not have a file, it is otherwise easily the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> arrived very quickly and was the best price I could find on the internet.</li>
            <li> THis is a  fine piece of  perfectly machined perfection.</li>
            <li> Buying the best frying pan doesn&#x27;t make you a master chef, buying the best dSLR doesn&#x27;t make you a professional photographer, and buying this nail clipper doesn&#x27;t make you a manicurist.</li>
            <li> Good to know some products are still built with quality in mind.</li>
            <li> Fantastic -- best my husband</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t imagine how good</li>
            <li> I set out to buy a &#x27;good&#x27; pair of nail clippers, and stumbled across all the glowing reviews of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and she did and loved them, so she&#x27;s ordering herself one too.</li>
            <li> I bought it for the pleasure of using a superior tool.</li>
            <li> And it is superior.</li>
            <li> In fact, I don&#x27;t have to get out of the shower and immediately trim my nails for a good result.  </li>
            <li> I saw good reviews on this product and decided to give it a shot.</li>
            <li> so I thought I would order a good pair.  </li>
            <li> If you are anything like me, spend the bucks and buy a good set of nail clippers and then guard them from getting up and walking away.</li>
            <li> The clipper cuts good</li>
            <li> They are so good.</li>
            <li> Superb product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the cheap Trimz nail clippers all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts that smoothly and perfectly!!    </li>
            <li> This thing really is as good as everyone else says.</li>
            <li> Then I saw an ad in BMWs roundel magazine for a superior clipper called Klhip.  </li>
            <li> Good quality steel construction.</li>
            <li> GIve me a quite good experience</li>
            <li> I started my search again and was delighted to find the Seki clipper.</li>
            <li> What a good set of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Good quality steel though.</li>
            <li> You owe it to yourself to have a good pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Good service.  </li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good look and feel.</li>
            <li> So, probably as good as a nail clipper gets?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vastly overpriced, and not that good.</li>
            <li> I made a good choice.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s like 95% just as good.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good nail clipper for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Seki fingernail clippers for years now, and they still work as good as the 1st day</li>
            <li> I wanted a good pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> But like a good knife, you keep it in a good sheath or block til you need it.</li>
            <li> Never knew what good clippers were like until I tried these.</li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> Good vendor.</li>
            <li> Good quality clippers.  </li>
            <li> These have a good feel in the hand, no rust,</li>
            <li> I have always wanted some good nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> This is a good fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of these nail clippers for my husband a good year or two ago, and they still work just as well as the day we got them.</li>
            <li> Good job.</li>
            <li> I also own the toe nail clipper and it works great too.  </li>
            <li> good product  and service</li>
            <li> I have never used good clipper before apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> Good choice</li>
            <li> Never had anything this good.</li>
            <li> A good purchase.</li>
            <li> Good weight and well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pleasure to use good tools.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, they are the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let my wife try them out, and she loved them.</li>
            <li> Without doubt the best nail clipper available anywhere.  </li>
            <li> So superior, there is no contest.</li>
            <li> So this is good product</li>
            <li> Good quality nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought these based on the reviews here and must agree with what others say, these are good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> Thoroughly perturbed, I looked online for the best pair available, price be damned, and found the Seki Edge.</li>
            <li> good quality clippers</li>
            <li> good design and materials.</li>
            <li> good for nails of all kinds.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am just pinching off the nail, not getting a good cut.</li>
            <li> This is really a good quality product</li>
            <li> The quality seems superior to any others I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that good.  </li>
            <li> I started thinking, if the toenail clippers are as good as everyone says, I&#x27;ll regret it if I don&#x27;t get some fingernail clippers to go with the toenail clippers.  </li>
            <li> I never thought that nail clippers could be this good.</li>
            <li> The metal quality is good.  </li>
            <li> and just feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> It feels good in your hand and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Buy a good metal file from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use and great results!</li>
            <li> but it is as good as I have had.</li>
            <li> Really good clipper....</li>
            <li> This fingernail clipper is every bit as good as the toenail model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good size for finger nails.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, yes.</li>
            <li> Feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re that good.  </li>
            <li> So good</li>
            <li> Good news:</li>
            <li> you found it, and everyone is saying that in these reviews for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a perfect stainless steel!!!  </li>
            <li> Cuts through nails like butter, feels great, perfectly ergonomic, just the right size, etc.</li>
            <li> It gives you a perfect clean cut.</li>
            <li> These go through in one quick cut - awesome.</li>
            <li> They make a very satisfying noise when the metal blades close together.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>

            <li> Easily worth the price, best clipper ive ever used.  </li>

            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely, I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> The Seki  clipper is strong and elegant, leaving a flawless nail end.</li>
            <li> These are very nice clippers, much better than Revlon.</li>
            <li> They are still very good clippers, but I think would be best for adults nails (especially men).</li>
            <li> Also, these are truly a fine example of beautiful industrial design.</li>
            <li> I would love to say it has a great heat treat to temper the steel, but I honestly don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I have never used better clippers!</li>
            <li> So pleased with these!</li>

            <li> or you could lose more than nail!</li>
            <li> Excellent Item and Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I sprung for nicer clippers!</li>

            <li> It is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Now he&#x27;s fine though, and happy too.</li>
            <li> Besides that, it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> the price, these are an amazing value.  </li>
            <li> Clipping your toenails with those are just as amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I ordered a pair from Solingen and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that it does an amazing job clipping nails.</li>
            <li> The metal is amazing, just feeling it in your hand</li>
            <li> They slice through your finger nails nicely.</li>
            <li> I told them if they&#x27;re nice</li>
            <li> Nice clipper.</li>
            <li> Returned it and bought the Deluxe one.</li>
            <li> I have to agree the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Nail Clippers are the best I have ever used</li>
            <li> These stainless steel clippers are the best.  </li>
            <li> This is a nicely constructed clipper.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is probably the best that I have seen and feels like a surgical instrument in your hand since it is made of stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> They cut easily and cleanly and are the best clippers we&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, they look good :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> - Features: It would have been nice if these nail clippers came with a file.  </li>
            <li> The build quality is like a tank and yet it feels nice to hold in the hand.  </li>
            <li> The angles and curvatures throughout the design also contribute to a nice looking clipper.  </li>
            <li> These are so nice</li>
            <li> Your friends, family, loved ones may never know a better way exists until you show them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled beyond belief that I have found this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> a superior product for hygiene - never buy  a cheap clipper again!</li>
            <li> It feels nice in hand.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s kind of like comparing a Honda to a Ferrari, the difference in quality and performance is just that</li>
            <li> This seki is really nice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m betting this thing will end up costing me a dollar a year after all the years I&#x27;ll own it.</li>
            <li> kind</li>
            <li> Nice, high-quality product.  </li>
            <li> very well made clippers, probable the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> no breakages of any kind, no rust, no peeling of any surface parts</li>
            <li> and I had to file the edges because it was catching on everything.  </li>
            <li> Really loving the feel, and quality of these.  </li>
            <li> I kind of wish the leaver were thinner and the length of the clipper though.</li>
            <li> Nice design, IMO&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clips nicely, cuts nicely, and leaves your nails looking nice.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice if it had a hole to put it on a chain or keyring.</li>
            <li> Very well built and work great!</li>
            <li> Superb quality and easily cuts the finger nails without using any force, or having to twist it upside-down to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Would have liked a file to be part of this.</li>
            <li> One way to break that habit is to have a nail clipper handy when you get the urge to chomp away.</li>
            <li> this thing slices through my nails like a warm knife through butter.</li>
            <li> really nice clippers,</li>
            <li> I would have liked a stud or mechanism to keep the clipper handle from sliding around.  </li>
            <li> I would also have liked the clipper to have a keyrig hole instead of slits.</li>
            <li> They leave your nails kind of rigid.  </li>
            <li> As a child the best personal tools were from Japan &amp; they are still great.  </li>
            <li> They also have a nice weight to them, don&#x27;t rust</li>
            <li> Absolute best quality nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this nail clipper, I used to own Zwilling Ultra Slim clipper.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> cuts so nicely....</li>
            <li> It is compact, gives good cut, and a satisfying click.  </li>
            <li> My own nails were damaged by acrylics</li>
            <li> All were the inexpensive variety, the kind you find in supermarkets or drugstores.  </li>
            <li> The Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper does an excellent job!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of OCD about my fingernails</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best nail clippers I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally, no, this does not cut hangnails effectively, it does not have an integrated file.</li>
            <li> I own both finger and toe nail versions.</li>
            <li> Yes absolutely the best I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Nicely designed, too.</li>
            <li> his own pair bc mine kept disappearing.</li>
            <li> Leave a nice cut, no tearing of nails.  </li>
            <li> Own three pairs, so I am never without.</li>
            <li> While they seem of excellent build quality the lever should be stainless steel, and not die cast metal.</li>
            <li> and they remarked how nice it is and asked where they could get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the storage position there is not a detent or lock of any kind to keep the thumb lever from rotating.</li>
            <li> Nice weight.  </li>
            <li> My philosophy in life is buy it nice or buy it twice.</li>
            <li> honestly don’t think I will ever have to buy another pair of finger nail clippers in my life.</li>
            <li> These are really nice nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many clippers over the years, but none as good as these.  </li>
            <li> So nice to have reliable clippers</li>
            <li> I really liked it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are quite nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You&#x27;re here because, like me, you&#x27;re done with chopped-up hack jobs, and you&#x27;re ready to spend what it takes to feel awesome about what just happened at your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> As good or better than all that filing I was doing to correct what my clippers should have been accomplishing themselves.&lt;br /&gt;-The steel.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t think so.  </li>
            <li> Very nice and worth the money - they are so good my wife stole mine</li>
            <li> Both are excellent clippers and deserving of their high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great clipper, very accurate and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It clips really cleanly, with great feel, but that&#x27;s all it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First blades, then hair wax (look up UNO &amp; Gatsby wax), now nail clippers, lol, Japan makes good stuff.  </li>
            <li> The construction is top notch, the metal used exceptional.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT HIGH QUALITY ITEM</li>
            <li> I wish all clippers were so nice and easy to handle!</li>
            <li> and im deff happy with the purchase its sharp and has a great feel to it great size.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers available - stays sharp and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> best nail clippers I own so far, and you can tell it&#x27;s made with quality material</li>
            <li> The weight feels nice in the hand and the spring action is wonderful.</li>
            <li> A quality clip, feels strong, they&#x27;re good clippers, what else is there to say?</li>
            <li> It also has a good edge and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT GOOD PRICE FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> There are an incredible amount of positive comments about this product that are well deserved.  </li>
            <li> However, their design makes them very easy to manipulate.</li>
            <li> I have very strong finger nails</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> These work very smooth and effectively.  </li>
            <li> I imagine I will get more adept at using them over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are by far the best!  </li>
            <li> I thought for the price it would be more handy.  </li>
            <li> As far as fingernail clippers go, this is one of the best.</li>
            <li> I am ordering a deluxe Seki nail clipper that will hold the nail in one place, after it is clipped, just like the my antique Hello Kitty nail clipper :)</li>
            <li> Unlike the cheap units, I&#x27;m guessing that Seki has good quality control that results in each unit being just like all the others that roll off the line.  </li>
            <li> bought two more for my husbands toiletry case and one for my own that we travel with.</li>
            <li> The revlon deluxe clippers have a better edge.  </li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I have ever used in my life, and I&#x27;m over 40.</li>
            <li> Since I didn&#x27;t do any research, I just decided to buy the most popular nail clipper on Amazon and ended up with this.</li>
            <li> and they are by far the best nail clippers I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I have found so far.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best nail clipper that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> By far the best.  </li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom, as she has arthritis and has not been able to cut her own nails.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fingernail clipper I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> However, the quality and sharpness is excellent and far surpasses anything you can buy in a drugstore.</li>
            <li> never really thought about how wonderful it could be to have nice clippers until i bought these!</li>
            <li> they, in turn, pass on to theirs at which time its value as a beautifully functioning antique will  be such that they will have the joy of living in luxury.</li>
            <li> The edge is great and the right size for a woman&#x27;s fingernails.  </li>
            <li> , they are very nice, easy to grip and fairly light.</li>
            <li> So many years of using a cheap one made my first experience with this clipper quite a happy one!  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless it is very good product, and highly recomended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as great as my old Hoffritz, but still good.</li>
            <li> I think the product appears to be higher quality and packaging was great.  </li>
            <li> I decided to order this and was pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> True to form, they are vastly superior to anything else either of us</li>
            <li> These are certainly the best that and most comfortable clippers that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  </li>
            <li> My family has been using J.A. Henckle Nail clipper for 8 years (works great even now), and I love it very much.</li>
            <li> Very precise clipper, will show you how well you trim your nails.</li>
            <li> The edge is very smooth.  </li>
            <li> Leaves nail very smooth after the cut.</li>
            <li> Very precise.</li>
            <li> Very smooth operation</li>
            <li> no falling apart, good quick cut.</li>
            <li> I used to dump out the new can of clippers and sort out the good ones and then do it again till I got a good pair .</li>
            <li> Just a quick review - this really is the best clipper ever.</li>
            <li> makes a huge difference!</li>
            <li> Love the Seki line...</li>
            <li> These look nicer than most.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Same with the Seki Edge Toenail clippers, these are the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re better than the Tweezerman clippers, because they&#x27;re sharper, and because of the molded grip on them.</li>
            <li> Son-in-law was pleased.</li>
            <li> He says he had never used a better set of clippers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as though they admitted that these are better than what they could</li>
            <li> so you feel like you have much more power.</li>
            <li> so you feel like you have much more power.</li>
            <li> Another top of the line product.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, though, and buy more than one.</li>
            <li> I bought and lost many years ago....</li>
            <li> these simply perform perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this set of clippers</li>
            <li> My friend has $50 nail clippers which are her favorite</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I listened to the reviews.</li>
            <li> and I will never buy a cheap drugstore pair again!  </li>
            <li> I love this thing and am assured I will never have to purchase another finger nail clipper again.  </li>
            <li> The Seki doesn&#x27;t have one, and I find I miss it more than I thought.  </li>
            <li> I find the Seki Edge Finger Nail clipper ok.</li>
            <li> Simply put, these are the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many crappy $1 finger nail clippers are there in the world?</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> Is it that much better that</li>
            <li> Ok for nails</li>
            <li> As with many of my Amazon purchases, this was based on the highest ratings.</li>
            <li> Sure, I&#x27;ll try it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m just being picky, but for $15</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands and styles and this one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> I bought one to try and have bought a couple more since because they work so well.  </li>
            <li> Many more out there</li>
            <li> that has a better grip...</li>
            <li> I bought several of these and gave some to relatives - they were similarly impressed.</li>
            <li> However, they are WAY better than any chrome plated cheapo clippers from the store.</li>
            <li> Better than any &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; junk.</li>
            <li> I think I prefer the ones from Sephora, which felt more substantial and</li>
            <li> I also felt like I had a better grip with the Sephora clippers.  </li>
            <li> I just hope these hold up better than the ones from Sephora.</li>
            <li> The Seki are much better.</li>
            <li> Sharper blade, cleaner cut, more durable.</li>
            <li> To have a backup in case something ever happens to my amazing cheap unit.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li> In conclusion, the Seki fingernail clipper is an okay unit.  </li>
            <li> This fingernail clipper is a flawlessly engineered piece of Japanese steelwork.</li>
            <li> they work ok on my toe nails but still leave the nail jagged</li>
            <li> And I always thought I couldn&#x27;t do any better.</li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> They have a satisfying \\&quot;clip\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was so pleased that I bought the fingernail clipper.  </li>
            <li> It is always better to buy in person I guess?</li>
            <li> , what can i say more about it.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t hold off go ahead and buy them, you will be so glad you did.</li>
            <li> The quality of this item is outstanding.</li>
            <li> but the cutter is more blunt-nosed than the cheapies.  </li>
            <li> These are not inexpensive but they are excellent quality and something that you regularly use.  </li>
            <li> and I’m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> We love our Seki&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> want to thank Seki for making an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> These quality-made clippers are outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way more money than I&#x27;ve ever paid for one in the drug store.  </li>
            <li> So glad I found Seki&#x27;s product.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find anything better.  </li>
            <li> Now I make sure I don&#x27;t lose these like my others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed they tear my nails more than rip</li>
            <li> The steel used is top notch and it clips my nails easier than anything else I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> They are barely better than the cheapest ones you would find at walmart.  </li>
            <li> They go through nails better then el cheapo clippers</li>
            <li> yes, I still primarily use a santoku &amp; pairing knife!</li>
            <li> Japanese fingernail clippers are just awesome.</li>
            <li> Make sure you are positioned correctly on the nail because it will cut through any part of the nail you put in between the blades.</li>
            <li> but I rationalized if it worked well and lasted many years</li>
            <li> Outstanding fingernail clips.</li>
            <li> We also brought the toe nail cutter, and it was much much better, and it work well for finger nails too.</li>
            <li> is that gross--and most people are like, &amp;#34;they are clippers,</li>
            <li> The Seki has a longer handle than most to provide better leverage.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure, continue to serve me through the end of my life.</li>
            <li> (one is enough to do all job), but since Seki nail clipper is so wonderful, I&#x27;m kinda tempted to buy a Toe nail clipper as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased that I just purchased Seki&#x27;s toenail clippers and nostril scissors.</li>
            <li> It would be much better if it was made to also collect the nails as they are cut..</li>
            <li> Love em.</li>
            <li> I look forward to seeing how many years it lasts.  </li>
            <li> a bonus, the look and feel is top notch.</li>
            <li> also don&#x27;t like that the top bar is shorter than the bottom one.  </li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> When I needed an extra pair of clippers, I decided to search Amazon to see what the best pair I could find was.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy looking for sheer practicality in a nail clipper, then a toenail clipper is probably the best thing you can get.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a hand pinky nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Pleased.</li>
            <li> How many cheaper clippers can you say that about?</li>
            <li> We love it.</li>
            <li> I tried based on so many reviews</li>
            <li> but you sure can with this one.</li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have had cheaper brands of nail clippers, but these are definitely the best we&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t lose it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> I got this more than 2 years ago and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are really good and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the money but the quality sure makes up for any doubts.  </li>
            <li> Very solid works great!</li>
            <li> Glad I went with the Seki for sure.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t do better...</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li> yay :)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more, for my purse and for stocking stuffers for my sisters.</li>
            <li> They love them.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if there was more texture on the metal parts to prevent it from slipping/moving when using it to cut nails.</li>
            <li> I have never used a clipper better than this one.</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality.</li>
            <li> But nevertheless, you should feel more than confident adding these clippers to your shopping cart.  </li>
            <li> I love this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> When you clip your fingernails, the device should be more rounded where it does the clipping.  </li>
            <li> One of the better nail clippers I have.  </li>
            <li> * Swivels nicely without breaking apart like the cheap Walmart, Dollar store, pharmacy type of</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice smooth edge.</li>
            <li> Glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Trimming nails is always a nuisance, this makes the process much more enjoyable.</li>
            <li> Love these nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I love this brand</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to find a better hiding place.</li>
            <li> Then I decided to look up a better solution.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Compared to the clippers I&#x27;ve used before, these are magical.</li>
            <li> The clippers you buy at the drugstore or discount stores tear nails more than clip them.  </li>
            <li> In fact, your nails end up being much more neatly trimmed with these.</li>
            <li> and I love the size of these clippers.</li>
            <li> It was just something that was important to me because I like having nice nails</li>
            <li> These are 3x the cheapo clippers but worlds better.  </li>
            <li> We ordeed,r (2) will be ordering more</li>
            <li> Well, that is how I&#x27;ve been doing it :)</li>
            <li> Before this, I never used a clipper any better than the ones you find hanging from a pegboard at the Dairy Mart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen tons of better and cheaper nail clippers in Walmart.</li>
            <li> These clipper are well made that&#x27;s for sure.  </li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> these clippers truly do work way better than anything else you&#x27;ve probably tried.</li>
            <li> Need to order more now...</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> This is a a top tier nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The Zwilling Ultra Slim clipper looks great and slim, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nails very well like this Seki Edge.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be buying any more of those 99 cent clippers at the drug store than mangle my nails.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> So much better than a dollar store clipper.</li>
            <li> so I can grip my strings better (</li>
            <li> the longer my nails, the more they would dig into my fretboard and \\&quot;push\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Outstanding quality</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve EVER used</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO glad I got it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply the best fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve EVER used</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m SO glad I got it.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not used any that are better than Seki.</li>
            <li> There must be a better clipper out there</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are top quality.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say that I&#x27;ve used better ones.  </li>
            <li> and I have owned many.  </li>
            <li> These nail clippers work as well or better than nail clippers should.  </li>
            <li> Upon unpacking it and trying it out, I immediately was OK with the price paid.</li>
            <li> However, this is a quality tool and does an infinitely better job than any clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> My husband is quite picky and the product pleased him.  </li>
            <li> I had piece of nail on the top of my nail and this cutter went through both layers of nails like a knife trough butter.</li>
            <li> Amazing how much better this is than the cheap one I was using.</li>
            <li> These are way better than the pieces of junk from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Works much better than clippers found in drug stores.</li>
            <li> ok dude</li>
            <li> Some Japanese masters on the top of a mountain are making it their life&#x27;s work to bring us the best in nail clipping technologies.</li>
            <li> name intentionally blurred)for $4 that should work OK,</li>
            <li> These are 100 times better than the ehem...</li>
            <li> Maybe it is made more for women&#x27;s hands.</li>
            <li> and these simply said are perfect.  </li>
            <li> These are so much better.</li>
            <li> The Seki fingernail clipper works better then</li>
            <li> cut a lot better.</li>
            <li> best and only cosmetic buy for this guy in a while.</li>
            <li> But that may be more perception than reality, because they do cut my nails well.    </li>
            <li> If they came in some sort of male manicure set with a metal file, that would be ideal!</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d hoped they&#x27;d be a bit more &amp;#34;stainless.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They are so much better than the ones I was buying at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found them.</li>
            <li> Not all nail clippers are created equal and this one is probably the best.</li>
            <li> Very impressed and relieved to finally be able to cut my nails properly!</li>
            <li> I was also able to reduce the time needed to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Glad I bought this item.</li>
            <li> I just used them once on my toe nails though, but they are at the present moment the best clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> So I decided to shop for a better quality clipper and got these Seki fingernail and also some Seki toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> So glad I found them</li>
            <li> They work better than the Seki TOE clippers which I bought a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li> So many things just keep getting cheaper and cheaper.  </li>
            <li> We bought 3 more to keep in suitcases and around the house</li>
            <li> I have the Seki Edge toenail clipper and love it, so I bought this product.  </li>
            <li> I should have known better.</li>
            <li> Way better then $0.99 clippers from the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> I have so many pairs of these I lost count.  </li>
            <li> I am no expert on these things but this surely beats the lightweight cheapies that my wife has bought at drug stores,  </li>
            <li> This clipper is better than the one in that set.</li>
            <li> How many people can say they tore up their house looking for their favorite nail clippers?</li>
            <li> Much better the others I have purchased in the store.  </li>
            <li> Who knew there were better clippers.</li>
            <li> You will wish your nails  grew faster so you ccan cut them more often.</li>
            <li> I would buy them again for sure.</li>
            <li> These clippers remind me more of surgical equipment than nail clippers.</li>
            <li> He says I found it :-)  </li>
            <li> and I would readily be able to find my clippers.  </li>
            <li> I considered purchasing, and I am completely pleased.</li>
            <li> Works effortlessly, like magic.</li>
            <li> I thought they must make something better?</li>
            <li> Could be consider a bit slippery for gripping on the bottom piece.</li>
            <li> After several months of usage...these clippers are the best I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> Much better than the $.99 one at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Who knew you could love a nail clipper?</li>
            <li> I have ordered more of them to give to members of my family.</li>
            <li> I better not lose them.</li>
            <li> I wish it included the cleaner that most have.</li>
            <li> I tried these clippers and they cut better than any I have ever tried.  </li>
            <li> The edge is actually lovely to look at.  </li>
            <li> Nice design, and good stainless steel feel to it.  </li>
            <li> They cut very smooth and clean, like the difference between a cheap knife and a really good one.  </li>
            <li> When I first used these clippers, I literally giggled with joy with how easily they cut through everything.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These clippers work perfectly to make nice clean cuts but that&#x27;s a bonus to actually being able to hold and squeeze them.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend makes fun of me for getting so excited about a pair of nail clipped, but my god, these guys provide the sharpest clip I&#x27;ve ever experienced.</li>
            <li> The edges are still nice and clean but it seems to require more effort.  </li>
            <li> High Quality product !!!!!</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed, these are amazing.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a good quality metal and the mechanism seems pretty sturdy, but they don&#x27;t seem to cut any better than the many cheaper clippers I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> These give a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li> just feel great, particularly when typing and playing instruments etc.</li>
            <li> Nice clean cut.</li>
            <li> They go through water-softened nails like butter, and do a nice clean cut no matter the condition.  </li>
            <li> they leave a nice clean edge, no tearing...  </li>
            <li> Nice clean cuts.</li>
            <li> After tossing those, we were willing to pay top dollar for a good clipper.  </li>
            <li> Clips very easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it - great gift idea.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend-works great</li>
            <li> They cut the nail so easy and a leave a nice smooth edge.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the cut:  The Edge cuts very cleanly, even with the tougher or thicker nails.  </li>
            <li> Very clean cut nails.</li>
            <li> My daughter noticed their superior quality on the first try.</li>
            <li> but since I was on vacation and in a pretty good mood, I examined it and tested it in the shop.</li>
            <li> Since it would be good to connect these to a keychain of sorts, I first thought the slits were for this reason, but I could not figure out how to get them on my keychain.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have found for a long time .</li>
            <li> Pretty good set of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> These clippers are exactly as described; they feel good in your hand, they don&#x27;t slip around.</li>
            <li> Made entirely of stainless steel (and not the cheapo kind), it feels like these are the superman of nail clippers!</li>
            <li> All the clippers purchased are excellent products I would highly recommend to anyone who wants great clippers at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The best clippers ive ever purchased, very sharp and very easy to hold to</li>
            <li> I was thrown off by the price but being able to hear that my mom can cut her own nails with ease is completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Safe and it easily snips the line.</li>
            <li> The reviews looked good and although the price was a bit more than what I thought reasonable, I decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> a bonus, it is also more comfortable to hold and better looking than the el-cheapos out there...</li>
            <li> These cost more than the cheap made-in-China stuff, but substantially better.</li>
            <li> These are great; far better than the grocery store, made in China</li>
            <li> Cuts a clean and very easy on thicker nails.</li>
            <li> They cut the nail cleanly every time!</li>
            <li> He was so excited about having located the &amp;#34;worlds best nail clippers&amp;#34; which were these specific nail clippers.</li>
            <li> But never again these are amazing they leave a smooth clean edge and don&#x27;t send the clippings flying.</li>
            <li> really nicely made and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> He keeps it in a special place so as not to misplace the greatest personal tool he has ever owned.</li>
            <li> Amazing and well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I had not been happy with old clippers</li>
            <li> They work so much better than the cheap fingernail clippers that you buy everywhere else</li>
            <li> I thoroughly endorse the Seki products, and can&#x27;t imagine there being anything better available.  </li>
            <li> Works much better than the cheap versions you can pick up in any drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Great level of manufacturing and finishing</li>
            <li> Trust me, this clipper is a much, much better gift, and will be around for years after those cheap kits have fallen apart.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are 1000x better than the cheap $1 clippers you might find at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I needed a bit more in the cart to qualify for free shipping.</li>
            <li> Happy so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thousand times better than those cheap made-in-china ones that are sold everywhere.  </li>
            <li> - I am not planning to become a clipper test mule - it is more than safe to say that this clips nails easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for and for me these are such awesome clippers</li>
            <li> It has a smooth surface and looks stylish too.</li>
            <li> No really, these are the best freaking nail clippers your ever gonna buy ever.</li>
            <li> fact that they&#x27;re made of real steel instead of the chrome covered pig iron of most cheap clippers is a good sign of their durability.</li>
            <li> I found a cheap pair of all-stainless steel clippers at the big-box superstore for about $3.00 that seem to do a better job.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is a metal on metal sound that irks me but might not bother most people.</li>
            <li> I needed a bit more in the cart to qualify for free shipping. .</li>
            <li> I bought this the Seki clipper and WOW, it is great.  </li>
            <li> Not much to be said here except they are the best nail trimmers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I like the cheap ones I&#x27;ve used for years much better.</li>
            <li> Some of my old clippers had it and it&#x27;s great for trimming side of the nail.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate good steel and these must use it.</li>
            <li> but, the stainless steel cutter is good.</li>
            <li> These really are good clippers.</li>
            <li> Proportionately speaking Revlon is almost as good but so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great action, sharp edge on the best nail trimmers ever bought.</li>
            <li> very smooth and clean.</li>

            <li> Awesome product, money well spent!  </li>
            <li> SO SHARP, the best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Now if they would add the plastic sleeve around these to catch the nail clippings, and the built in emery board that some of the other brands have integrated, this would be the perfect set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I have ever used, Blade is sharp and cuts through nails like butter.</li>
            <li> They look cool too!</li>

            <li> Very impressed, sharp, quality feel, etc...</li>
            <li> Really sharp, excellent precision engineering.</li>
            <li> these are awesome, was surprised it didn&#x27;t come with the little sharp blade that most nail clippers come with under the handle, but still, awesome product, arrived on time, and was packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
            <li> The handle can easily just slide off to the side.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t cut yourself, it&#x27;s just going to do the business it set out to do very quickly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just easy to use - your nails effortlessly clip off.</li>
            <li> But with a few uses I&#x27;m getting more comfortable--as I haven&#x27;t made anything but perfect cuts on my toes as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>

            <li> (i guess all these superb reviews due to lack of decent competition)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better off going with  Easy Press Clippers - 4.9 out of 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> Like the toenail clippers, these were comfortable to use, and made very clean, precise cuts on my nails.  </li>

            <li> but they do a fine job.</li>

            <li> Makes quick work of clipping nails!</li>
            <li> I like to keep my clippers separate, but this fingernail clipper is more than adequate to act as a toenail clipper.  </li>

            <li> Seki City, Japan is where some of the world&#x27;s best steels are made, and this little clipper did them justice.</li>
            <li> Awesome little tool for men&#x27;s grooming.</li>
            <li> , these things are super sharp and the feel of the handle is superb.  </li>
            <li> Best nail clipper ever, super sharp and keeps the edge.</li>
            <li> The blades themselves line up perfectly, and are super sharp.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, like the best knives from Japan.</li>
            <li> The Seki clipper cuts cleanly and easily, leaving a smooth edge on the nail.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a huge difference in performance.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip the nail and always cuts fully and accurately.</li>
            <li> lot of design work went in to making these feel comfortable and perform well.</li>
            <li> These are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Light weight yet</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge does NOT rip the nail - it cuts it cleanly and easily.  </li>

            <li> I liked it so much that I ordered a pair for a family member.</li>
            <li> Never again will I buy the cheap version of something I use so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make neat, smooth cuts -- never leaves jagged nails.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much, I bought the toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> My dad always had the cheap $1 store ones that broke in a week.</li>
            <li> the cheap ones at the drug store?  </li>
            <li> the material felt cheap.</li>
            <li> One just needs to take a file or emery board and lightly round-off</li>
            <li> All stainless steel and a nice finish are icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> I liked them so much</li>
            <li> these clippers are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Light years ahead of the cheap fingernail clippers sold in drug stores and supermarkets.  </li>
            <li> The cut is not as smooth as it should be.</li>
            <li> the cast metal pusher could be nicer fit and finish</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I put up with crummy cheap nail clippers for 20 years without looking for an alternative like these.</li>
            <li> plus (to me), they are not at all comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They aren&#x27;t cheap, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li> The ergonomics on this are fantastic.</li>
            <li> there was anything but cheap junk nail clippers from Walgreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never buy a cheap set of nail clippers again.</li>
            <li> Makes a clean, easy cut every time.  </li>
            <li> These clippers actually make it a joy to cut finger nails.</li>
            <li> I have always purchased the cheap stuff at the drugstore and my nails always seemed to break off instead of being \\&quot;clipped\\&quot; off.</li>
            <li> This is a great set of clippers made in Japan very solid.</li>
            <li> so cheap</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are made out of some sturdy, stainless steel and have a nice weight to them.</li>
            <li> Cut with smooth edges.  </li>
            <li> It cuts nails like butter and leaves smooth edges.  </li>
            <li> They were cheaply made and we gave up in frustration from doing our nails.</li>
            <li> My husband said that they were cheap and we should find ones that weren&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If you, like me, have always used cheap nail clippers from the drug store or convenience store, you owe it to yourself to start using Seki clippers.</li>
            <li> Wasnt sure about these when I ordered them, but they are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no file-cleaner blade and nothing to catch the clipped nails from falling on the floor, but if you want the sharpest cut available, this is the one...</li>
            <li> Well you know those cheap ones you buy in the cosmetic aisle at your Wal-Mart or Target?</li>
            <li> I was looking for another cheap nail cutter after mine broke, but saw this one and had to try it after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li> I liked this one so much</li>
            <li> Of course you can always use a nail file (not included with this clipper, you need to buy it separately) to smooth out your nails or let them be smoothed out \\&quot;naturally\\&quot; over some time.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it, I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of nail clippers in my life, but I haven&#x27;t found any that swings as smoothly or feels as high-quality as this pair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally pulled the trigger and bought these.  </li>
            <li> Buddy cut me free with his knife with a lot of hacking.</li>
            <li> It is  made of stainless steel and has a nice weight instead of flimsy lightweight steel.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t wobble.  </li>
            <li> but still great product and will definitely use it..</li>
            <li> Any nail clippers I bought from the store were extremely cheap.</li>
            <li> I always end up having to file my nails afterward to get a smooth edge.  </li>
            <li> It matched the toenail clipper and its a &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; so I bought them at the same time worked out great</li>
            <li> This prevents cracking and things that cheap clippers can cause.</li>
            <li> This happened each time I tried them, so I grabbed my magnifying glass and my fear was confirmed.</li>
            <li> They take almost zero pressure to clip through the nail and are fairly comfortable to hold in your hand.</li>
            <li> The clipper moves smoothly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are nicely textured and very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Everything works smoothly and efficiently, and is easuly held and used by the weaker hand.  </li>
            <li> they aren&#x27;t cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Fantastic.</li>
            <li> great clippers , they are easy to use, steady and cut really well</li>
            <li> I let a few of my friends try this out, and they were so impressed.  </li>
            <li> These are absolutely fantastic nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> and they are light-years ahead of those cheap generics.</li>
            <li> Incredibly smooth operation, you don&#x27;t get the &#x27;click&#x27; or &#x27;snap&#x27; like the cheaper models of clippers.</li>
            <li> Miles ahead of the the cheap drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li> This is one fantastic nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold, cuts effortlessly, and leaves a clean edge.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight in the hand, and feels like it&#x27;s built really well.</li>
            <li> There is no comparison between this one and the cheap drugstore nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> Makes trimming fun, wish my nails would grow faster so i could use more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing made in USA available there.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Seriouisly, I CANNOT stand cheap crappy nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> The Seki ones are a HUGE improvement and I will never buy the cheap ones again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how smoothly and effortlessly these trim nails.</li>
            <li> Its so precise and effortless when using</li>
            <li> Leaves smooth cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the cheap one&#x27;s rust up.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending these to everyone I know, and will be trying to convince everyone to trash their cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> The cheap clippers don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve been using the cheap models sold at the drugstore, treat yourself to one of these.</li>
            <li> liked it so much that I order another</li>
            <li> sound</li>
            <li> THIS IS HOW THE CHEAP CLIPPERS WORK.  </li>
            <li> I am so happy I actually decided to go ahead and spend the money on these clippers.</li>
            <li> Nice clipper, works very well</li>
            <li> This is one of those &amp;#34;buy it for life&amp;#34; purchases that makes you happy to do something as simple as clipping your nails.</li>
            <li> so cheap cutters suck for me.</li>
            <li> One day, I was using a 99 cent pair of finger nail clippers and they broke because they were so cheap.</li>
            <li> The clipping lever is formed so your thumb meets it comfortably and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> The blade edges are usefully sharp--no more cheapies for</li>
            <li> /&gt;The order was filled and sent in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> They cut cleanly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Regardless of how well they cut, you still need a file to smooth things out.  </li>
            <li> These really work nice.</li>
            <li> So I went and bought a replacement at a local pharmacy paying good price thinking it will be better than those cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomics are important, but the quality of the cut and the quality of the steel to hold the edge is everything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as my old pair at nipping my hangnails.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it was as good as my old $1.98 unit...</li>
            <li> These clippers feel good in my hand and they actually cut my nails better than anything I have used before.</li>
            <li> Nice solid design with a satin finish looks nice but all I care about is</li>
            <li> The last good nail clipper that I purchased at a retail store was many years ago, it was Korean made.  </li>
            <li> I love that they feel very sturdy with a ridge on top for your thumb or finger.</li>
            <li> High quality, nice weight and feel, easy to use.</li>
            <li> clippers just go right through with that satisfying click</li>
            <li> clippers just go right through with that satisfying click</li>
            <li> and it clipped my nails very cleanly and with a distinct &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; sound each time.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great product that&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I know that is a strong reaction to nail clippers, but it is a true statement.</li>
            <li> Nice, slightly larger size makes it very easy to use and comfortable in the hand too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Made very well!!!</li>
            <li> Worth every cent, these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had by a very wide margin.</li>
            <li> This thing cuts super precise and it&#x27;s easy peasy.</li>
            <li> This is vitally important for anyone with a significant loss of dexterity or hand/grip strength.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more pricy than most brands, but it is the sharpest clipper I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it is high quality.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent, high quality nail clipper from Japan that I can see lasting for years and years.</li>
            <li> These are nice strong clippers with a solid edge, and they give the satisfying &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; sound when they blast through the fingernail with the tenacity of a samurai sword.</li>
            <li> The metal is very nice and refined, and the pieces do not grind against each other like many others do.  </li>
            <li> These will clip smoothly and cleanly, with no ripping.</li>
            <li> They do the job cleanly without leaving ragged nails like the cheap ones do.</li>
            <li> The cut is clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> The Seki produces a smooth, clean cut.</li>
            <li> nail cutter trims throw nails effortlessly and leaves a clean smooth edge.</li>
            <li> , delivering a clean, smooth cut every time ...</li>
            <li> The Seki have kept their edge and work smoothly unlike others that seem to catch and not cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> This item is to normal nail clippers like a nice set of flatware is to a cheap set of flatware.  </li>
            <li> Quality product, makes trimming nails quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Its also nice to have an improved finger grip as I always used to slip and twist my nail with the older style nail clippers.</li>
            <li> My wife loved them so much she bought two more pairs and threw all our old ones out!</li>
            <li> Kind of high in price,</li>
            <li> Its great because it was way better then the previous clippers I had because this one was way faster and sharper.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, but toe nail clippers are even better and require less effort.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s worth noting that though Seki sells a toe-nail clipper, for me these fingernail clippers are more than adequate for my toes as well.</li>

            <li> Felco Classic Manual Hand Pruner #F-2]] (for gardening purposes which I highly recommend) when using it and yielding great results.  </li>
            <li> clean cut，nice design，I love it very much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if I&#x27;m still using these clippers when I&#x27;m 85, I&#x27;ll feel like I got my $ worth out of them!</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> That may sound hyperbolic but I am telling it, it is 100% literally true.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I decided to trust the reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I read the first review that is listed as most helpful and</li>
            <li> I originally bought the Clyppi Fingernail Clipper and returned it because&lt;br /&gt;(1)</li>
            <li> Buying another one, lost my original during a move.</li>
            <li> worth the money!</li>
            <li> I originally bought these two years ago.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> My husband and I ordered this awhile ago and at first, we were in love.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have had 99 cent clippers do a better job than these.</li>
            <li> Even though my finger nails weren&#x27;t exactly getting out of control, I was so pleased with the results on my toenails, I went ahead and worked my fingers over with these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> Get excited about nail clippers?</li>
            <li> Very sharp and very good quality.</li>
            <li> Cuts very good, hard to hold, needs a better grip..</li>
            <li> and you end up with a nail more akin to a stop sign than a smooth arc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going into the trash, and getting replaced with the el cheapo Revlon clippers that you can find in the drugstore (and certainly here at Amazon too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So most people probably view fingernail clippers as a pretty basic drug store staple, but this is far and away the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> excellent design and leverage means that you don&#x27;t have to squeeze them as hard as you do with a cheap pair.  </li>
            <li> Great, sharp and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> well, I wish it had a nail file on it to clean up after the trim</li>
            <li> The cut is so clean that you can get away with not having to touch up with a file.</li>
            <li> It gives your nails a clean cut..</li>
            <li> I figured the cost would be worth it if they did as good a job as my old unit.    </li>
            <li> I had a cheap Trim brand clipper that I had for years and loved - but recently lost.  </li>
            <li> No file, but no need with a clean cut.</li>
            <li> It cuts the nail cleanly.  </li>
            <li> clips cleanly thru the nail.</li>
            <li> Precision cuts and clean edges.</li>
            <li> These cleanly and effortlessly cut nails.</li>
            <li> They clip cleanly with virtually no effort to exert pressure.</li>
            <li> Nice, smooth action.  </li>
            <li> Requires minimum pressure to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Effortlessly get a clean snip each time.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly and without the crush.  </li>
            <li> The cuts are so clean I never needed to file in conjunction with my cut.  </li>
            <li> These Seki clippers cut quickly and precisely - I&#x27;d make the analogy that they are the Formula One version of clippers.  </li>
            <li> Bought on a whim, I figured I&#x27;d try a quality clipper for once rather than the super cheap ones.</li>
            <li> They cleanly clip, and do not tear, your nail.  </li>
            <li> I pulled out my trusty $3 clippers that always cut cleanly and looked at them under the magnifying glass to verify what I already knew...</li>
            <li> and they just don&#x27;t cut clean.  </li>
            <li> Cuts nails so cleanly</li>
            <li> They clip cleanly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> These clippers clean them up.</li>
            <li> that tells you it&#x27;s cut cleanly through the nail.  </li>
            <li> that tells you it&#x27;s cut cleanly through the nail.  </li>
            <li> The sharpest and clean cut fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li> There are so many cheap clippers out there, how do you find the one that really works?  </li>
            <li> It gives your nails a clean cut..</li>
            <li> The difference between the cheap concenience store nail clippers and this professional grade clipper is astounding.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly with no effort.  </li>
            <li> Clean cuts.</li>
            <li> They cut my fingernails clean and neat.  </li>
            <li> Well made and cuts clean.</li>
            <li> so must actually be a good grade of stainless, and appear to be made very well.  </li>
            <li> Until you buy it and use it you will have had no idea that clipping your nails could be such a pleasant experience.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality nail clipper that is worthy of the high price and great reviews.</li>
            <li> Very precise and clean, so much nicer that even the $8.00 - $10.00 clippers that you find in stores.</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far with how quick the product came and the product itself.</li>
            <li> The material is very durable, and very light.</li>
            <li> And it cuts nails so superbly that I think I got a little too excited the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> It was great to find the edges so sharp and precise in shaping my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Now I clip, and do a quick filing of the top of the edge, done - smooth, not scratchy or jagged, and very time efficient.</li>
            <li> But here I am, sharing my love for a certain set of nail clippers on the internet, for everyone and their mother to read.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is nothing special at all about the function of these Seki Edge (model SS-106) fingernail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Nope, he was right!  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, great feel, easy to grip, dont know what else to say - I did tell my wife she can check it out</li>
            <li> They work perfectly, but for the price, I would have wanted a nail file or at least a nail file tip to clean under the nail.</li>
            <li> love em, they are nice and sharp and easy to hang on to.</li>
            <li> I really like these nail clippers, they are very high end, yet reliable, definitely the best bang for your buck</li>
            <li> Very smooth action, easy to control.  </li>
            <li> We purchased the infant Seki edge clippers and liked them SO much that we just bought the Seki Edge Stainless Steel clippers for me and my husband!</li>
            <li> Worth the extra bucks for a nice job!</li>
            <li> These clippers do cut with great ease but leave a rough cut on the nail.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t really drive an Aston Martin or wear a Panerai</li>
            <li> Overall a good look and feel to the clippers themselves</li>
            <li> So now, I buy really good quality grooming tools such as these and keep them where my kids don&#x27;t know where they are at.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
            <li> because if I see jam, I&#x27;d rather just cut my nails short and give them a good washing.  </li>
            <li> but the build quality is just superior to any American fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li> The construction of these clippers seems very solid and in good style.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> A true tool for grooming.</li>
            <li> This clipper is very well made and I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> What everyone says is true...</li>
            <li> and I have found this to be true.</li>
            <li> I bought at least five clippers to determine which was best and none even approached this one for quality of construction and sharpness.</li>
            <li> They clip quickly, without hesitation, and do it cleanly.  </li>
            <li> It did such a good job that I bought one.</li>
            <li> Ive used this for about a year now and really have enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I needed a fingernail clipper, and I have had mostly good experiences with Japanese made products.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s cool.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Sometimes spending two or three times more can really improve your quality of life.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t really care, they do look better too.  </li>
            <li> and it does cut thick toenails nicely, but it kind of blunts out the edges more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Good weight and solid construction.</li>
            <li> I love that it is stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> Only once in my life have I had a pair of nail clippers this good.</li>
            <li> Finally something made of good quality.  </li>
            <li> Solid design for a good grip, and</li>
            <li> This clipper is much sharper and has more leverage.  </li>
            <li> I was really surprised to be honest.</li>
            <li> So my strategy has been to buy lots of clippers and eventually all the spots where clippers go will eventually be full</li>
            <li> Good enough?  </li>
            <li> Still not a bad product</li>
            <li> (this is not a bad thing, in my opinion, just a caution for using such good clippers).</li>
            <li> This means a great deal for a clean, sharp edge, and for the manufacturing process.  </li>
            <li> In this day of utter junk, merchandise that somewhat resembles that which it purports to be, but affords mediocre performance, at best, and breaks unavailingly within months, if not days, it&#x27;s wonderful to encounter a product that begins with sound engineering design, is constructed of the correct materials and is manufactured to high standards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have always used the cheap clippers from fleet farm or the ones you find in the bins right at the check out.</li>
            <li> Just a smooth cut that drops the trimmed peice right in front of the fingertip.</li>
            <li> Handle at a bit of an odd angle but cuts beautifully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used very cheap nail clippers, but having lost my last one I decided to get a better one.  </li>
            <li> The fit and finish is fine stainless steel, not chrome on metal.</li>
            <li> None better, first quality, top notch professional clippers.</li>
            <li> clippers are great, the blades are so sharp it takes no effort to cut through any nail needing cut.</li>
            <li> i am happy to say that these clippers are just as sharp as the day i got them.</li>
            <li> Great fingernail clipper, so sharp it cuts so</li>
            <li> The experience of clipping nails is so good with these clippers that I apparently do this more frequently ( :</li>
            <li> This thing is sharp and feels great in my hand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and feels great in my hands.</li>
            <li> This one does a great job, and other string players have ordered this one after trying mine.</li>
            <li> This product is not as great as all the other reviews make it out to be.</li>
            <li> Build quality feels great and they are really sharp.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like buying a great sharp knife after using crappy ones you&#x27;ve had since college.....</li>
            <li> It cuts with twice the ease of my other clippers and feels like great quality.</li>
            <li> : they are great, they are SHARP...</li>
            <li> Great leverage, very sharp, clean cuts...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review for a nail clipper, but this is seriously the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Cuts quickly with no mechanism flex.</li>
            <li> &amp; I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s no such thing as an enjoyable nail clipper.</li>
            <li> and I have no doubt that their quality construction will last me for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and performed as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I was just lucky</li>
            <li> Quick delivery of purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This one is larger than most and I like it better for toes too.</li>
            <li> The manicurists tried the glues, the wraps, the oils, and the super polish, but none of them had any effect on the split.  </li>
            <li> Super strong&lt;br</li>
            <li> Super sharp&lt;br /&gt;+</li>
            <li> They are substantial clippers, with an attractive stainless steel finish, and feel like they&#x27;ll last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Therefore, I can quickly file my nails into the shape I want.</li>
            <li> but you&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> But they do it super well with almost no pressure required.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would be worth the money that there could be that much difference in nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> The clipper is soundly make, nice to hold and feels like it will last forever.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s super expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li> much better than cheap old clippers....</li>
            <li> I have three different models of Seki nail clippers and they are simply the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but it makes a metal-on-metal sliding noise when you open/close the clippers, and this noise is SUPER grating for me.</li>
            <li> and if I&#x27;m lucky, while I&#x27;m doing that, just maybe it won&#x27;t split in another place.</li>
            <li> on each clipper, all the details quickly unfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also leave a nice finish that&#x27;s not sharp like some of the reviews have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Right from the package, it looks and feels significant.</li>
            <li> this was a phenomenally designed and precision engineered product made of high quality materials.  </li>
            <li> I love the high quality material and build of it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t recommend these any more highly.</li>
            <li> High quality, ergonomically satisfying.  </li>
            <li> There is obvious work to make this a good fit in the hand, and I do have large hands, but I&#x27;m not blown away.  </li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and very effective.</li>
            <li> They cut right through the nails leaving a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I also contacted Seki Edge through e-mail and confirmed that they are made in Japan which also probably contributes to the higher price.  </li>
            <li> These are so much better than normal fingernail clippers.  </li>
            <li> First clipper I&#x27;ve had that makes no &#x27;click&#x27; sound.  </li>
            <li> The cuts are exact and precise.</li>
            <li> The entire mechanism operates very smoothly!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a really nice sharp clipper but this seems to just be OK.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I got it out of the box and looked it over it seemed that the jaws were not as precisely aligned as the first one.  </li>
            <li> I have never spent this kind of money on clippers, but I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> An ah ha moment, why I wasn&#x27;t using something this good for so long.</li>
            <li> and I I expect to ;pass it down to my great grandchildren and</li>
            <li> Most of them are cheap and not sharp.</li>
            <li> I suspect that I am a lot more interested in a quality nail clipper than the average person who&#x27;s sufficiently satisfied with the chrome plated items we find in most drugstores and grocery stores.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, and great quality of materials.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, works great.  </li>
            <li> I love this new clipper.</li>
            <li> I love my new clippers.</li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp, and cut very cleanly.</li>
            <li> After using a number of different fingernail clippers over the years (e.g., Trim, Revlon, Dovo, Victorinox), I&#x27;ve found the Seki Edge to be the best so far for two main reasons.  </li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what I have searched for to avoid rough cuts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll give you an update if I become less happy with these.</li>
            <li> Found some $45 German engineered choppers that looked good, but decided to try these &#x27;cheapos&#x27; first.</li>
            <li> If there is any fault, it is that it cuts almost too easily, making it very tempting to overtrim.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend it, even if it&#x27;s good for what it is or better than your ordinary clipper.  </li>
            <li> In the past I had paid much more for Solingen steel clippers that were no where as good as these.  </li>
            <li> I really like that they have an extended bottom easy to get all my fingers on it.</li>
            <li> is my second purchase, just as good as the first and now $10 cheaper.</li>
            <li> Clipper is very well made and easily clips finger nails and toe nails as well.</li>
            <li> These are the best set of nail clippers that I have ever had, I keep finding the mini mart cheap ones hiding in different places and throw them out, they&#x27;re never as sharp as these clippers and no where near as comfortable or strong.</li>
            <li> Build quality is top notch, metal looks nice and finished, and it&#x27;s sharp!</li>
            <li> I easily went through three or more cheap clippers in a year, and even brand new they never performed anywhere near the Seki level.  </li>
            <li> This is a really good quality nail clipper, but the nails are thrown far away so you need to vacuum clean after each use!</li>
            <li> It cuts through nails like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li> I received these two days after ordering and they do exactly what I want!</li>
            <li> I really do like these after my dog chewed my other good pair, my wife lost a good pair and we were left with a cheap set -</li>
            <li> It would have been so peaceful and quiet!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!  </li>
            <li> I lost the first!)</li>
            <li> cuts like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li> even cuts the first time on the edges of the nails without having to do significant cleanup</li>
            <li> exactly what nail clippers are supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I suppose if you&#x27;re looking at this product, you&#x27;re probably more interested in getting a good quality nail clipper than you are in saving a few bucks.</li>
            <li> I actually gave these as gifts this Christmas and the recipients LOVE them too!</li>
            <li> Based on all the great reviews, I thought this was a no brainer decision, but I found my nails are too thick to easily insert into the clipper.</li>
            <li> I especially like to use it on my toenails as it slices them just as easily as fingernails unlike many</li>
            <li> It is the best I have ever used and is so practical for people who have very hard nails.</li>
            <li> sharp, works well, feels strong, otherwise excellent product that does what it advertises, no new features though</li>
            <li> These things clip VERY cleanly and with pretty much no effort at all.</li>
            <li> Cuts consistently and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Every time my husband uses it he comments on what a fine clipper it is and thanks me for ordering it for him.</li>
            <li> Effortlessly makes crisp clean cuts every time, no mashing or tearing of the nail.  </li>
            <li> This was the only brand that cut my nails better than the super cheap ones you buy at any drugstore.</li>
            <li> The action is smooth and quick and precise.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty sharp and work great for my fingernails.</li>
            <li> For such an awesome pair of cutters, for being the best, for being so expensive, for being (hopefully) the last pair I&#x27;ll ever need....they aren&#x27;t that cool looking.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp and extremely fine quality steel make this a deluxe trimmer for nails.  </li>
            <li> A little too tall or stacked for maneuverability, but a great clipper.</li>
            <li> OK, when it comes to certain things, I am really picky.</li>
            <li> In some cases, special alloys with a higher proportion of chromium or molybdenum are used.</li>
            <li> In some cases, special alloys with a higher proportion of chromium or molybdenum are used.</li>
            <li> They are heavier than the cheap clippers and are very sharp which makes for a nice clean cut every time.  </li>
            <li> They are stainless steel where the cheap ones are plated steel(big difference).</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of using cheap, flimsy nail clippers, these are a real revelation.</li>
            <li> It has a very ergonomic design which is comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> These are much nicer than the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> Cuts really well, but no file to smooth out the edges.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying these clippers after going through about 10 cheap clippers that required brute force to use.    </li>
            <li> These clippers are worth the money.</li>
            <li> The next best clippers I have are Tweezerman, also in brushed stainless.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but once you use it, you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking these probably aren&#x27;t worth the price, given the ragged edges,</li>
            <li> , well worth the money.</li>
            <li> but they are worth it.</li>
            <li> because you use them so often, it&#x27;s worth it to spend more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the purchase price, you get what you pay for with these.</li>
            <li> well worth the difference in price</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice solid feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Powerful finger nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> They are so precise that I felt comfortable using them on my two year old.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, but I expected better</li>
            <li> Finally, after buying some $20 tweezers and marveling at the difference between them and the cheap stuff, I decided to buy some better nail</li>
            <li> but I promise you it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers, they feel great in your hands and have a smooth action when cutting nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not inexpensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> This clipper is much heavier with a smoother finish than the standard clipper and feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Take the investment on something you use a lot, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m even considering getting these as stocking stuffers for some of the family next year, (yes, they are THAT nice).</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I decided to treat myself  and find out if these are really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These clippers are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re well worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This fingernail clipper is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Using cheaper clippers, I noticed that after a couple of months or so, it takes a considerable amount more force to clip the nails.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> The clippers are certainly powerful, but they leave a ragged edge.  </li>
            <li> So far love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> They are so worth it.  </li>
            <li> it worth its price?</li>
            <li> it worth its price?</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I always knew there must be a better set of nail clippers out there, but it was never really at the top of my list of things to find.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> A bit pricy compared to drug store clippers, but definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth it.  </li>
            <li> the price, it&#x27;s worth trying them out, I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ll like using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but this one is worth writing about.</li>
            <li> It is not a drugstore clipper for which one has to wonder whether nails might need to be made of something else or shaped differently for the clipper to work effectively.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> but it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Is does not have a piece for cleaning under the nail, but is still well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> These were well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> They also would make nice stocking stuffers for the holidays next year.</li>
            <li> Easily worth the money.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> But frankly speaking did not find it worth 14 us$.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is worth the price</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fingernail clipping used to be fun.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> but I think worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is a long-term investment, so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> But, worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> worth the price.</li>
            <li> They are worth it.</li>
            <li> Even got my father his own set last Christmas.</li>
            <li> a quality product well worth</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny to me.  </li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and so getting my nails nice and short is a must.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price to have clippers that work as they should.</li>
            <li> worth the price?</li>
            <li> Totally worth every penny.</li>
            <li> These are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> if so, they&#x27;re worth the hefty price tag.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it never to have raggedy, t--short fingernails again.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally a clipper worth owning.</li>
            <li> oh so worth it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price of admission if you ask me.</li>
            <li> Some thing very much worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth buying,</li>
            <li> I was wondering if they could possibly be worth it.  </li>
            <li> The verdict is in - WORTH EVERY</li>
            <li> the quality is worth the price.</li>
            <li> but this was totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer of various clippers that are use to clip my own nails and the nails of my pets.  </li>
            <li> Whatever it is, it&#x27;s worth the $.</li>
            <li> well-crafted, well worth the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Before you try and burn the people who paid that let me tell you that they&#x27;re not crazy.</li>
            <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t realize how crappy most drugstore nail clippers were until I got this.</li>
            <li> Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> It is time for all humanity to demand BETTER results from such important tools.  </li>
            <li> It seems likely to me that it&#x27;s good steel, and I notice the lever is different from the blade, which says to me they used a better steel where it counts.  </li>
            <li> That would be a very big deal to me, and honestly what I would expect that for a $20 pair (they&#x27;re $17 for me on Amazon, March 2015).  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend, good japanese quality&lt;br /&gt;Was a little reluctant to spend such amount, however certainly dont regret it, these would be best clippers i have ever had, better than tweezerman....</li>
            <li> the first cut with my new Seki clippers, I was in love.</li>
            <li> I can even use them with my gimpy left hand, so that even though I kind if feel like an uncoordinated slob with the nerve damage, my fingernails on my right hand won’t look that way.  </li>
            <li> great product, a bit expensive but impressive sharp</li>
            <li> clipper really is an order of magnitude better than all other clippers I own.</li>
            <li> they had a file/nail cleaner like most clippers but other than that I love them.</li>
            <li> Once again, as in many other areas of my purchasing life, I am learning to look for quality and pay a bit more for it.  </li>
            <li> These cost more than many other, similar-looking clippers.  </li>
            <li> The Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is a solid feeling fingernail clipper that provides a nice clean cut.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp and comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Solid, substantial, sharp, not flimsy or flexible - it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Better than most SHARP</li>
            <li> In fact they are so quick and crisp when they cut</li>
            <li> As a side note I feel like these nail clippers give the similar unexplainable good feeling that is produced by Felco Classic Pruners [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> so I was familiar with SEKI quality and was very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tweezerman&#x27;s are darn good from other brands</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY AND SHARP</li>
            <li> One would think clippers are just clippers, but having used so many cheap clippers in the past, I am beyond pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
            <li> Superior to any other clippers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Clipped it right off like it was nothing.</li>
            <li> These just cut right through the nail</li>
            <li> Just the right size</li>
            <li> have a tweezerman, but it just doesn&#x27;t quite grip right.</li>
            <li> and these will cut right through them without tearing the nail.  </li>
            <li> he uses this right away.  </li>
            <li> The problem with them is they just don&#x27;t cut your fingernail right.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are like using a razor to slice right through my nails.  </li>
            <li> You can tell right away it is well made.  </li>
            <li> CUts  right thru nail with no resistance.</li>
            <li> 5 stars for quality and getting it right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when I cut my fingernails and this clipper really gives you precise control over your cuts.</li>
            <li> But the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper cuts your nails cleanly and effortlessly.</li>
            <li> They cut consistently well and are made of a nice, solid material.</li>
            <li> but I believe the rounded countour is also what makes these the first clippers I&#x27;ve ever used where I don&#x27;t tend to accidentally \\&quot;overcut\\&quot; my nails and expose the more sensitive flesh at the tip of my finger.</li>
            <li> It cuts neatly and cleanly and feels very durable.</li>
            <li> The cut is clean and fast.  </li>
            <li> The clip is fast and clean.  </li>
            <li> I used to wash my hands with hot water to prepare my nails for clipping, I used to file underneath, on the flat edge, and on top of the nail to avoid drawing blood when scratching an itch after clipping my nails!  </li>
            <li> This is hands down the best clipper I have ever used in my entire life.</li>
            <li> High quality, precise cut.</li>
            <li> They feel high quality in your hands, they fit well in your fingers and they cut effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Even for someone without those physical disabilities, these clippers are far superior to and much easier to use than the cheap ones you get at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I was skeptical about the companies claims and description, but I was pleased to find these the sharpest and most comfortable clippers to use ever.</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers, very sharp, and very sturdy feeling.</li>
            <li> nice quality, cuts nails like I have never seen before, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the metal produces this &amp;#34;nails on chalkboard&amp;#34; effect/sound when twisting the top part to engage when ready to use, maybe it needs a better design to avoid this; maybe like a washer or other plastic or</li>
            <li> This clippers are truly sharp and more importantly, leave a clean, crisp edge on the cut nail.</li>
            <li> The cutter handle pops open easily and smoothly, and the execution of the cut is practically effortless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yes the body of the clipper is smooth, so make sure your hands are dry and get a grip.</li>
            <li> The Seki clipper is truly a fine instrument and the company has made this new customer a believer.  </li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp, they cut easily and smoothly, and the lever handle is designed for easy use.</li>
            <li> Sure, they both do the same thing, but the nice set lasts longer and you can actually get ice-cream out of the container without bending the spoon.</li>
            <li> A tad bit small IMO for home use, but great for travel.</li>
            <li> This line of implements is worth every penny of it higher price.</li>
            <li> I used them too (even on those pesky thick toenails) and they work so beautifully.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I hopped on Amazon, and as is my usual path ended up spending a good amount of time reading reviews and up-selling myself to 5 times my original budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> build quality is superb, hopefully the edge stays sharp for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The part that you press down to cut the nail moves around no matter where you put the clippers, so some sort of cover or case would be good to have</li>
            <li> This item is heavier and a little more challenging to slide under the nail before clipping.</li>
            <li> It has a little more width than most fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a little bit pricey but its worth every penny, its that good.</li>
            <li> This tiny little thing is superb.</li>
            <li> Strong, clean, sharp, smooth.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, never had fingernail clippers as good as these.</li>
            <li> Forth, the mechanism is designed to work smoothly with no ill fitting, loose or wobbly parts.  </li>
            <li> Forth, the mechanism is designed to work smoothly with no ill fitting, loose or wobbly parts.   </li>
            <li> Also, I do not feel like to buying a cheap new nail clipper every year, so</li>
            <li> Very sharp with great leverage and spring action to quickly cut your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t say enough good things.</li>
            <li> So great I ended up coming back to buy a second one (and a toenail version) - with 5 people in our house, someone was always hoarding it!</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed this item and loved it.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice-looking clipper, super well-made.  </li>
            <li> For such a frequent task you deserve a good tool - this is it.  </li>
            <li> I have hidden them from the rest of my family because if anyone else used them, they are so good</li>
            <li> The long handle offers nice control!</li>
            <li> Easy to use even though my thumb injury will keep me using my old drugstore clippers for along time.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s a lot more difficult to get good clean</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money and will steer clear of the cheap ones from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male that doesn&#x27;t care too much about this kind of thing.  </li>
            <li> We stopped using this nail clipper and started using our old clippers and our nails stopped breaking so easily.</li>
            <li> It is strong enough for even the toughest nails, hand or feet, and it cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> This pair is made in Seki Japan - they are so proud of this fact (and its relation to traditional Japanese swords) that it is their brand name.  </li>
            <li> Small but very effective.  </li>
            <li> You can really feel that the perfectly aligned sharp blades actually grip your nails before proceeding to clip off the nail crisply and assuredly.  </li>
            <li> The basic fingernail and toenail clippers have specially formed ends and holding grooves on both the top and bottom ends to make them much easier to hold when your arm is extended, even with hand tremors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using these to clip my nails is quickly and effortless -- you need to apply very little pressure to get a nice, clean cut.</li>
            <li> They are great for thick nails like mine, and they are worth the higher price because they don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> These are outstanding clippers, far superior to the usual &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; variety.  </li>
            <li> I bought this clipper based mostly upon the reviews, and I must say the vast majority of the reviews were right on target.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and definitely durable and always gives you a sharp, clean cut.</li>
            <li> Very, very well made.</li>
            <li> The net result is that your nails will be cut in an effortless manner with a very smooth edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this less than 5 times so far, but they were probably my best nail clipping experiences so far.  </li>
            <li> It is amazingly sharp, so I can cut my nails faster and more accurately.</li>
            <li> These are a good compromise; a little pricey, but they do work well.  </li>
            <li> Does not provide a clean cut, cuts similar to cheap Trim clippers.  </li>
            <li> Very very sturdy and consistent with the cuts.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp, have a slight bevel to keep the edges smooth, they’re sized right for my hands, and have a nice indent making them very easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super sharp and cut easily and cleanly every time.</li>
            <li> The difference between these clippers and my old standbys that are made by TRIM is huge.  </li>
            <li> again...and out of frustration i purchased these Seki Edge stainless steel nail clippers and i must say, they were worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have had mine for almost 4 years and ran into the first drawback...</li>
            <li> But then again, these clippers are clearly better and built to last and will serve me well for decades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sorry I bought them</li>
            <li> I bought four pair and lost one to my wife after she used mine for the first time.</li>
            <li> What I notice the most is that the entire mechanism is rigid, which gives a feeling of control.</li>
            <li> Well designed and pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> , I just want a more precision cut outside the nail itself.</li>
            <li> The handle on this one is like 5x the thickness of normal clippers, probably cast metal, and lets you apply full pressure without breaking a sweat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely buy more of these, though.</li>
            <li> clippers\\&quot; in your head, what&#x27;s the first thing you think about?</li>
            <li> I had always purchased the drug store variety of nail clippers but decided that I would go the extra price and buy something better.  </li>
            <li> First, the background.  </li>
            <li> So why do I still prefer my old cheap unit?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> the quality and feel seems to be first class.</li>
            <li> only thing that would make them better is if they could cut hang nails as well as they cut finger nails.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only 3 times the cost of the cheap ones that tear your nails!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s THAT much easier!)</li>
            <li> Do not waste money on cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> Overall, quite pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> So much better than drug store China clippers - will last a lifetime</li>
            <li> These are so much better than the ones that you can get at the big box stores.  </li>
            <li> but I am finding myself consistently avoiding to use it.</li>
            <li> that is a nice feature to keep it from slipping off</li>
            <li> It works exactly as it did when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t about to drop $60 on nail clippers, but the ad was enough to get me researching for better clippers.  </li>
            <li> that is exactly what you should do here.</li>
            <li> Maybe they&#x27;re better suited to nails that are set back from the ends of our digits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these for a while, and they&#x27;ve never failed to disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is a bit intimidating at first.  </li>
            <li> 3/8s - 1/2 &amp;#34;) and</li>
            <li> Leaves kind of a rough edge</li>
            <li> Having been using cheap clippers all the time, I am quite surprised by the quality of this.</li>
            <li> Much better than a generic fingernail clipper from the department store.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Japan can gladly have my money when American companies fall so woefully</li>
            <li> The fingernail clipper might be better suited for smaller hands - like for children.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already ordered another because someone else took a liking to my first one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And since they are stainless, you can even WASH or sanitize them and they won&#x27;t rust!</li>
            <li> Have the larger toenail clippers bought from sharper image years ago, love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to be extremely careful when using them as they are professional quality and you better be sure you want to cut that before you commit.</li>
            <li> Much better than the vast majority of nail clippers you will find.</li>
            <li> Also, it is so sharp that it leaves the nails perfectly squared off, thus leaving a sharp edge like |_|.</li>
            <li> Upon first use, I was amazed at the quality and build of the product.</li>
            <li> Nobody offered anything better (aside from a \\&quot;mysterious\\&quot; german brand purchased eons ago).  </li>
            <li> A handful said \\&quot;cheaper ones\\&quot; are the same or better.  </li>
            <li> It always clips off on the first try.</li>
            <li> OK, I would not have thought that nail clippers are that different.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Japan!</li>
            <li> Wow I know i&#x27;m going to sound like a parrot here</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;m 62, I&#x27;ve used plenty including expensive ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well machined and hand sharpened &#x3D; better than ones that are for sale in your local drug store.</li>
            <li> Expensive, yes, but wonderful.</li>
            <li> I will take many back to Kazakhstan.</li>
            <li> After using these once my wife changed from \\&quot;That&#x27;s too expensive\\&quot; to \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you get the toenail clippers at the same time?\\&quot; :-).  </li>
            <li> These are first rate clippers.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last longer than any of the cheaper ones you can find in the drugstore, but</li>
            <li> okay, nail clippers are not all the same</li>
            <li> and yes you can clip your nails with the drug store brands or even some higher end brands</li>
            <li> I lost the first one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You won&#x27;t go wrong with either, but if are looking for the best, go for the Seki.</li>
            <li> I was worried this wasn&#x27;t going to be better than the generic nail clipper</li>
            <li> Works better than any clippers I&#x27;ve used before, and feels like they&#x27;re built to last.</li>
            <li> I have purchased so many clippers recently over the counter</li>
            <li> My whole family loves them, including my kids!</li>
            <li> The ones sold at Wally world don&#x27;t even work, but these are exactly what you need</li>
            <li> From the first time taken out of the container, I could feel the quality.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sorry.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s obvious which is the top side of the clipper,</li>
            <li> starts, these clippers definitely clip much better than my Tweezerman&#x27;s did out-of-the-box</li>
            <li> Way better than the last 5 I&#x27;ve purchased at walmart or a gas station, etc.</li>
            <li> These things cut nails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> most likely TRIM</li>
            <li> We need to get a 2nd paid since my hubby is always accusing me of hiding these from him :)</li>
            <li> Makes a crisp cut.</li>
            <li> These were a replacement for an identical product with a different brand that I got more than 10 years ago from Brookstone.</li>
            <li> So I was first introduced to these things while visiting my geeky friend Carlos in Texas.</li>
            <li> The clipping action is solid, no creaks, no flex, just a confident &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; sound.</li>
            <li> Will buy more for travel since they aren&#x27;t too big to take with me in my bag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many cheaper ones in local drugstores and they either don&#x27;t work well or fall apart within months.  </li>
            <li> My guess is all these stellar reviews are from paid reviewers.</li>
            <li> Haha!</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I was impressed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I know what I&#x27;ll use for entire forcible future.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Cuts through my nails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> : sometimes you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers and will never buy a different brand again.</li>
            <li> This is not a complaint, but simply an observation and a reason that a nail file would have been a nice addition.</li>
            <li> One has to marvel at their stellar quality control.</li>
            <li> They cut through nails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to keep them for several months all to myself!  </li>
            <li> Very durable and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I never thought I could really like a nail clippers!</li>
            <li> I bought the Victorinox pocket clippers because I am obsessed with finding the best</li>
            <li> Yet they take the time to polish out any bumps on the top, opposite of the detent.  </li>
            <li> extra steps &#x3D; a lot more cost for the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Heavy, balanced and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> I have had the Green Bell nail clipper for about 15 years &amp; it still works as good as the day I received it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I can add anything new to the rest of the positive reviews, except to say they ARE worth the price!  </li>
            <li> It also helps that the lever is designed at a very sharp angle unlike cheap clippers where it is more of a bend.</li>
            <li> Very sharp like razor and comportable,high quality stainless steel and price is Good</li>
            <li> Consequently, these are probably the first clippers I&#x27;ve used where I don&#x27;t feel an all-consuming urge to file my nails right after clipping them; the clippers are able to produce a smooth enough cut free of sharp points that I am okay with not filing my nails down to smooth them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You nails will be cut noticeably more precisely and with less effort.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is quite expensive, but it&#x27;s great quality and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I decided to get something better, and these are so fast, smooth, and sharp.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and do an accurate cut quickly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> I am only writing this review because there are way too many overly positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the Seki Toenail Clippers for the cats and am sure the blades will cut sharp and true.</li>
            <li> Most were adequate but became less useful as arthritis set in.</li>
            <li> These are amazing in that they take very little pressure to use and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> These are amazing in that they take very little pressure to use and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> Makes nice, clean cuts with very little effort.</li>
            <li> This clipper is excellent, high quality, heavy metal that seems as if it will last for ages!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain these will last for many years to come.</li>
            <li> Yes they cost a little more than the cheap drug store clippers</li>
            <li> stainless steel nail clipper is a true precision cutting instrument, and it works GREAT!  </li>
            <li> Will cut any nails with minima pressure and nice sharp blades.</li>
            <li> and they are still as sharp and effective as the day I opened them.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp, the blade is nicely rounded for the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.  </li>
            <li> Nice sharp cuts.  </li>
            <li> Nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> I own this nail clipper for over two years now and it is still sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp clipper.</li>
            <li> Nice, sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> I read other reviews saying they cut so nice</li>
            <li> However, the best way I know to find out is whether the metal &#x27;rings&#x27; or not - and this pair doesn&#x27;t &#x27;clunk,&#x27; it has a very sharp sound quality when on a hard surface.  </li>
            <li> The rounded contour of these clippers is perfect for progressively clipping nails while keeping the nail itself more-or-less rounded; all my previous clippers have been \\&quot;straight\\&quot; in comparison, and would always produce annoyingly sharp points and \\&quot;polygonal\\&quot; nails.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, and fit in you hand easily.  </li>
            <li> Love these clippers and boy ARE they super sharp compared to others I have owned.</li>
            <li> I got a dull kind of thud sound.  </li>
            <li> Very solid and sharp, cuts clean and good steel quality.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of Twizzerman clippers and wasnt satisfied with cutting so just got the Seki Edge today and worked great.</li>
            <li> Third, the cutting edge is masterful, delivering a clean, smooth cut every time ...</li>
            <li> I went with others reccommendations and found these nail clippers to have a smoth action and clean cut.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra $10 over a cheap one, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> After a while these tend to lose the sharpness and the lever action requires significantly more pressure to complete</li>
            <li> Solid cast metal top piece, very ergonomic feel.  </li>
            <li> We called around and no one carried the more expensive and good ones.</li>
            <li> They really are strikingly better than the junk for sale at the local Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> There are few products that incite more unrestricted, fiery rage in me than cheap fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> These probably are a BIT nicer than your standard clippers, if that is what you are looking for, but not that much better, so don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> , this one is made to last.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend buying together w toe-nail clippers - which is a larger clipper and has a more straight edge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No actual danger, and the outside edges are rounded (which indicates good thought).  </li>
            <li> Made from pure stainless steel!</li>
            <li> However, I think my use case represents a pretty large portion of the population who needs nail</li>
            <li> They are super high quality nail clippers that do what they&#x27;re supposed to do really well.</li>
            <li> First and most important, the cutting edges of the Seki are sharper and cut my nails more cleanly than others and much easier</li>
            <li> Far superior to any  other similar product available and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> In fact he threw away all his old nail clippers and made a special box just for this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim mostly because I was wondering if someone could really make a more precise and clean cutting nail clipper</li>
            <li> Very different, very cool.  </li>
            <li> Very good at cutting nail, for a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> After suffering unknowingly for years with cheap fingernail clippers that mostly sheared off nails and required two hands to use, my husband bought this for me as a romantic birthday present.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, precise, and comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> For a few bucks more, I consider this to be a significant upgrade.  </li>
            <li> Well, I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d spend this much on a nail clipper, but this is some pretty fancy stuff.</li>
            <li> The result is a smooth cut with no rough spots.</li>
            <li> that was one of the reasons I was ready to pay a higher price for this nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> When I first used them, they would cut really well with a snap.  </li>
            <li> It cuts easily and cleanly with sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> Well made, ships fast and has a crisp matte finish.</li>
            <li> First of all this thing is like a piece of artwork, and looks very sleek.</li>
            <li> But like a summer hookup with that cute boy / girl at the snack shack, things never lasted that long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived in Asia for over 25 years and have many fond memories of the bathhouse ladies cutting my nails with such precision.. perfect every time.  </li>
            <li> After reading these reviews I was really hoping for a nice, sharp clipper.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s samurai sword-level of sharpness (seemingly, at least, if not actually), requires one to use it with great care, or one&#x27;s nails will be filled with scratches.</li>
            <li> That way you can throw out those clippers you&#x27;ve had forever (but nobody can remember where they came from) and not be tempted to use the old ones just because these good ones are in the other bathroom.</li>
            <li> However, I guess the old adage is still true</li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly and easily with less pressure than cheaper cutters.</li>
            <li> crunchers\\&quot;, leaving a rough edge instead of a smooth, clean edge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several clippers quickly because my fingernails grow quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still very sharp and you get that crisp click sound when clipping the nail.&lt;br /&gt;While not as cheap as pharmacy or dept store sold clippers</li>
            <li> Exceptional nail clipper .,Received product when promised and the clippers are high quality and very sharp.</li>
            <li> But for the price I expected, as mentioned, something more solid, and with at least a bonus file, even if that wasn&#x27;t the best built-in file in the world.</li>
            <li> I resorted to buying nail clippers on Amazon after one cheap set of clippers completely fell apart and couldn&#x27;t be put back together, and the cheap set I replaced it with really just bent my nails until they gave in.</li>
            <li> Alas, the quality is about as good as a $3 clipper I recently bought and no where near as good a give-away clipper I keep in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Still sharp, very very easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and cut very easily.</li>
            <li> The blade is very sharp and durable and cuts effectively.</li>
            <li> It feels FAR more precise than ANY other clipper I have used.  </li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s easy to hold onto as opposed to the generic shaped ones that sometimes slip out of your grip.</li>
            <li> The entire thing fits in your hand easily.  </li>
            <li> I was searching for something better than what is available in my small town.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t let you cut nails extremely short easily, but then again, its trying to stop you from taking a chunk of your fingertips out.</li>
            <li> Nice weight with a slight texture on the anodized/painted surface so that it&#x27;s not as slippery as the chromed ones.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for nail clippers that would actually work and was easy to use.</li>
            <li> The grip is very adequate, and actually has some grooves for traction....</li>
            <li> These will last for a long time if you take good care of them.</li>
            <li> While they are nice, I&#x27;m not sure they are worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It is ergonomic and far, far better to use than the classic clippers.  </li>
            <li> They cut precisely and easily with little effort.</li>
            <li> These are easy to use, comfortable in your hands, and sharp enough to make clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Probably because of its size it has certain flimsy feel to it.</li>
            <li> Smart looking &amp; works well.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and make the smart investment.</li>
            <li> The blade is too large to clip corners without grabbing a piece of skin.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp and cut cleanly and smoothly.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and leave a clean, precise cut.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp, the hinge is smooth and doesn&#x27;t shift, all leading to a clean, decisive cut.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and cuts easily with precision&lt;</li>
            <li> But after my last two pairs of cheap nail clippers that I bought from the grocery store kept breaking on me, I decided it would be a smart investment to get something that would be a lot more durable and reliable and thus save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very sharp edges making for a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not passionate about nail clippers and don&#x27;t give 5 stars lightly, but this is a well made product that deserves it.</li>
            <li> The first clipper was worth $13, but this one is only worth about $3!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will be buyer a few more to have around just in case we lose this one!</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t loose it your going to have a clipper for many years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These clippers lack a nail-catcher which is perfectly okay for me as I would rarely use nail-catchers on my previous clippers anyways.</li>
            <li> I lost my pair and bought a new one right away.</li>
            <li> Sharp, easy to grip, no whammies!</li>
            <li> Does a fine job and appears built to last.    </li>
            <li> These nail clippers are made like a fine Swiss watch and are super sharp.</li>
            <li> Clean cut- barely need filing.</li>
            <li> Does a fine job and appears built to last.</li>
            <li> Another fine Seki clipper to go along with the two different Sekis I already had.</li>
            <li> These clippers have finely honed blades that cut nails effortlessly, continuing to uphold the reputation of Japanese blade makers as the finest in the world.</li>
            <li> Very high quality.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package, I could tell these were very high quality clippers.</li>
            <li> Its stainless steel, but holding it you can&#x27;t help but feel there&#x27;s a certain energy pulsating within.</li>
            <li> They may be a little over kill because they are almost too nice.</li>
            <li> Nice little snip.</li>
            <li> As nail clippers, they work great - even for tough toenails.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to pay a high price, I don&#x27;t think you can do batter than this.</li>
            <li> It is superior to the cheaper models I have been using, and it provides a pretty clean (but not perfect) cut.</li>
            <li> These clippers cut very well, and are very high quality.</li>
            <li> * Very high grade of stainless steel&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product along with the [[ASIN:B000F37UNM Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper]] are simple tools that help make life a little more enjoyable and easier.  </li>

            <li> Super sharp and so comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable to work with and super sharp.</li>
            <li> It is made of stainless steel, instead of other cheap materials which break quickly.  </li>
            <li> good product, good material, well built, looks solid, sharp enough but its ends are somewhat thick to easily manipulate under nail.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are great smooth cutting clippers.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re smooth enough straight from the clippers.</li>
            <li> This sound assures you that the clipper did its job and is ready for the next \\&quot;bite\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s precise enough that you don&#x27;t really need a nail file.</li>
            <li> It is well built and should last much longer than the cheap ones at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> Something you may not have known (before now) is that instrumentalists -- especially string players -- must keep their nails trimmed neatly and accurately.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why with our modern technology we can&#x27;t make nail clippers that really work well.</li>
            <li> , they are solid, accurate, clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cutting jaws don&#x27;t meet perfectly.</li>
            <li> Straight through.</li>
            <li> It appears these are stainless steel EXCEPT for the bolt part that holds the assembly together...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Here is the issue:  the clippers cut like butter, much easier than anything I have ever used</li>
            <li> Any help would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These are very well made and work well.</li>
            <li> Having bought plenty of cheap-o nail clippers, this thing really blew me away.</li>
            <li> A fantastic product overall, but quite pricey compared to a $1 clipper.</li>
            <li> The clipper is much easier to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the straight ones to do my toe nails.</li>
            <li> The handles fit my big hands and don&#x27;t slip out while trying to use them.</li>
            <li> An absolute pleasure to use.  </li>
            <li> Really.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this much of an improvement over a $3 one.</li>
            <li> The weight of the tool is perfect and the cutting quality is perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like them so much that I sent a pair to my father</li>
            <li> As soon as you clip one nail you will notice the difference like I did and never go back to cheap brands.</li>
            <li> So much for the $2 pairs that wear out every 3 months.</li>
            <li> I debated for about a month on whether I would spend this much on nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I go through nail clippers faster than any person really should.  </li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> Smooth, simple and effortless operation.</li>
            <li> You can absolutely feel the craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> The lever mechanism operates so smoothly compared to my $3 clippers from the local pharmacies.  </li>
            <li> Also when you open and twist the handles, it flows smoothly and it does not feel like it will fall off or disconnect like the cheaper ones often do.  </li>
            <li> I also appreciate the stainless steel material.  </li>
            <li> The blades are what really set itself apart from the competition.  </li>
            <li> and I cut off too much nail.  </li>
            <li> It grips really well</li>
            <li> If I ever lose them I can&#x27;t revert back to using cheap junk clippers.</li>
            <li> Simply put these do not cut smooth.  </li>
            <li> Edit - After having this for 2 years, I&#x27;ve really grown fond of it.</li>
            <li> When you get these, you know immediately they are different from the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> very well made.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that if you get these, you won&#x27;t want to use cheap clippers ever again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Function: The hinge seems to be very well made.  </li>
            <li> you spent a lot more on.  </li>
            <li> I think you can buy one from WalMart much cheaper...</li>
            <li> it was a real chore and time consuming before the purchase but almost a pleasent chore now</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> These actually cut the nail, instead of crushing their way through.  </li>
            <li> The blade opening is also very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The feel is very sturdy and has an even weight distribution.</li>
            <li> but I really appreciate the easep with which the CT does the job.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend!</li>
            <li> and they haven&#x27;t been flying off as much as I&#x27;ve been used to.</li>
            <li> They cut very well and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Seki, feels very balanced in my hands, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to slip out between my fingers.</li>
            <li> but they work VERY well.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t really care then</li>
            <li> Fit and finish are a step above the dime store variety.</li>
            <li> I really like these clippers</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is labeled &#x27;stainless steel,&#x27; however, the lever contains no steel, and as another reviewer posted, that&#x27;s where it breaks..</li>
            <li> This is not a poor clipper.  </li>
            <li> The price included free shipping when I ordered it last May--</li>
            <li> Binge order haha.</li>
            <li> it comfortable enough to use?</li>
            <li> it a 100% stainless steel?</li>
            <li> They really do cut, rather than tear through, your nails.</li>
            <li> Very convenient/</li>
            <li> and they cut my toenails very well</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> I never realized that sharpness was so critical to comfortable nail clipping.</li>
            <li> Tried diagonal pliers, which worked, but are straight cut, so the nail edges had to be trimmed and rounded.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> HaHa; for defense from sharks?</li>
            <li> They are butter smooth and appear as if they will last a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> Well constructed and very durable.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a set of nail clippers and don&#x27;t want to spend to much</li>
            <li> I like these so much I buy them as gifts.</li>
            <li> but if I had to buy again, I would probably try a different product because this one doesn&#x27;t seem to fit me well.</li>
            <li> thanks alot</li>
            <li> I can never go back to the cheap clippers again</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;m male, though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s important for this item.</li>
            <li> But the Seki Edge stainless steel fingernail clipper changed all that.  </li>
            <li> They are also very ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> 34;too much information&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> because I&#x27;d never spend this much on a pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clippers]]</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t have to really put pressure against the nail at all.</li>
            <li> I am OCD about my nails and was really looking forward to getting these.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are very well made.</li>
            <li> i even bought the pair of stainless steel finger and toe nail clippers carried by Amazon, that is cheaper.</li>
            <li> And very well made, unlike the clippers I&#x27;ve been using my whole life.</li>
            <li> Really well crafted.</li>
            <li> This stainless steel nail clipper hails from Japan, straight from the forge of Hattori Hanzo.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even have a nail filer, although you won&#x27;t really need one.</li>
            <li> yes, it is stainless steel.  </li>
            <li> I never thought I&#x27;d pay this much for a pair, but now that I have them you&#x27;ll never find me buying the .99 ones at the drug stores ever again.  </li>
            <li> My nails don&#x27;t split as much trimming with this clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to buying cheap nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> The nail clipper works really well.</li>
            <li> Thanks for fast delivery</li>
            <li> My husband loves them so much he refuses to carry them in his pocket for fear of losing them.  </li>
            <li> so much so that you may skip to file the nail.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s stainless steel, not chrome plated ...</li>
            <li> Lastly, this item is made of substantial stainless steel, so it&#x27;s considerably heavier than most clippers.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, this item is made of substantial stainless steel, so it&#x27;s considerably heavier than most clippers.  </li>
            <li> So, I bought the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper for him.  </li>
            <li> I am very please with them.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, I paid too much for this clipper.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used cheap ones before.</li>
            <li> : B002ULRVJA)  Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper (ASIN: B000F35R00)    </li>
            <li> These stainless clippers are sharper than the cheaper ones and hold their edge a lot longer.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see going back to the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Very well-built, sturdy&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like these clippers.  </li>
            <li> Very well made, I plan on keeping it the rest of my life assuming I don&#x27;t lose them moving/traveling.  </li>
            <li> Bought a pair for parents as well as they only ever had the cheap clippers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li> For the money spent on this I consider it the most value for the money.</li>
            <li> With this, don&#x27;t have to worry about filing as much after trimming.</li>
            <li> and it os very ergonomic to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really like this fingernail clipper-sharp, and does its job</li>
            <li> Fast forward two years</li>
            <li> This very one,</li>
            <li> The clippers cut really well, but the texture really bothers me.  </li>
            <li> All of them were capable of clipping my nails.  </li>
            <li> Clips quietly and smoothly through the nails.</li>
            <li> I have much cheaper nail clippers that I started using because they get closer.</li>
            <li> I really wanted a premium nail clipper and didn&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li> Fits very well in your hand.</li>
            <li> and I am afraid I may lose them to her as she was quite impressed.     </li>
            <li> very quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hinge is smooth and the body construction looks to last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Not that it matters much</li>
            <li> It cuts through nails with ease without much effort and doesn&#x27;t split or crack the nail at all.  </li>
            <li> I never though I would spend this much on a set of nail clippers, but after using them -</li>
            <li> Absolute precision in cutting...lived up to the accolades.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a luxury, I even felt reluctant as I clicked order, wondering if I could really justify spending this much money on a fingernail clipper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely the Rolls Royce of trimmers.</li>
            <li> After much research, we chose this clipper.  </li>
            <li> They are everything you expect a fingernail clipper to be at a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Someone wants to borrow them....</li>
            <li> I believe these must be made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> like these so much ,i bought another..</li>
            <li> This one is very well made and does the job with any problems, will recommend.</li>
            <li> your hands.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is much sharper</li>
            <li> spring action is much stronger so each cut is more purposeful, it should last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> bought a Brookstone clipper set that cost about four times as much.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I thought to myself, &amp;#34;How much difference could one nailclipper make?&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very well made so</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t imagine you would have to replace them very often.</li>
            <li> :  They aren&#x27;t stainless.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> fantastic trimmers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the quality every time I use them.</li>
            <li> They clip the nail without any real effort required.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> After all, nail clippers are really just a tool, and I&#x27;ve been around tools all of my life.</li>
            <li> You could by 6 pairs at Walmart for the same price, but you still would have a cheap, inferior tool.</li>
            <li> Really??</li>
            <li> Also, the blades do not meet to the very edge which sometimes leaves a &amp;#34;thread&amp;#34; of nail remaining.  </li>
            <li> The thumb pad is indented to hold the thumb better, but isn&#x27;t wide or shaped like a thumb.  </li>
            <li> I put my order in for this about 2 days ago, and received it at the end of the 2nd day (I did not do expedited shipping of any kind, just standard.)</li>
            <li> Worth the extra few bucks to get a good one now instead of buying a bunch ones over the years.</li>
            <li> Better than my old nail clippers I purchased from my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I rotated through my entire stock of TRIM brand clippers, looking for one that I could actually use effectively.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, heavy nailclipper</li>
            <li> Overall I still highly recommend these nail clippers, although I might suggest buying a couple, as we all know how easy it is to misplace clippers.</li>
            <li> Very precise &amp; sharp .</li>
            <li> It cuts clean, no jagged edges, but the grip could be better, it&#x27;s a little slippery and takes a few seconds to get a good, solid grip.</li>
            <li> Similar to the toe clipper ~ very sharp and they do the job nicely!  </li>
            <li> Sharp as can be, and nice and heavy, while also being comfortable to use, with a nice, wide, ergonomic lever.</li>
            <li> While I am sure it is possible to live without a great clipper - having done so for decades - and there may be less expensive clippers that are as effective</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> These are pretty darn sharp and cut the nails pretty smoothly.</li>
            <li> If you are a person who has scoured the market both local and online for a sharp, good looking, and reasonably priced fingernail (not toenail) clipper, this is it.  </li>
            <li> These also make nice gifts for family and friends as they will be pleasantly surprised by the build quality, design, and sharp blades.    </li>
            <li> I love these so much that I make other people try them--</li>
            <li> It is very solidly built, good materials, sharp, and</li>
            <li> This clipper is super sharp providing clean cuts and no tearing.</li>
            <li> The clippers tend to fall apart WAY too fast, with the thumb lever becoming loose and wobbly in no time.  </li>
            <li> Thats a problem I have with most other clippers</li>
            <li> Another first impression was that these clippers are not small or travel sized.  </li>
            <li> No more cheap clippers for us!!</li>
            <li> Sharp, precise, sturdy!</li>
            <li> this Fingernail clipper is significantly better than any other Clipper I have used.  </li>
            <li> So, I also bought the Seki Curved file and it works better than any other nail file.  </li>
            <li> Purchased along with the matching jumbo-sized neanderthal toe-nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade is sharp, and build quality is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The width and curvature of the blade does not seem to be appropriate for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size hands.</li>
            <li> These clippers are razor sharp, was able to cut through my toughest nails</li>
            <li> Scary good!</li>
            <li> They work better than any other pair of clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I consider these clippers to just be ok, and probably not really worth the premium charged when you could buy 8 or 10 of the cheap ones for the same price.  </li>
            <li> the semi nail clipper is great super tough with a sharp edge that continues to be my favorite after 1 year of constant use</li>
            <li> The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars is because they don&#x27;t have the nail file thingy that you can clean under nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt like nail-clippers are made from tin cans, they&#x27;re just normally designed to be as absolutely cheap as possible and</li>
            <li> Cuts so cleanly that the edges of the nail are left sharper than you may expect.</li>
            <li> But I just took a small file and with a quick light swipe dulled those corners enough that they would easily glide along as I progressed through each cut.  </li>
            <li> When I first pulled these out, the heft and general build quality were the first things of note.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended, cuts cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave the jagged edges left by cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> Only wish that there was a file attached to clean under the nail.</li>
            <li> But I was lucky enough to find a really good one at least 15 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I tried them out and they certainly cut better than my previous Revlons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is very well made, high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Going</li>
            <li> A very we&#x27;ll made, high quality product.</li>
            <li> I like these clippers because all the cheap ones I purchased in the local stores are not sharp enough to cut easily and without tearing (I always clip my nails just after the shower</li>
            <li> Okay, maybe that is an exaggeration but being a male with thick, healthy fingernails, many other products caused me to need to clip twice to get it to work.</li>
            <li> and then vacuum the spot afterwards to clean up any clippings that might have gone flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and then vacuum the spot afterwards to clean up any clippings that might have gone flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is a whole new experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very sharp, smooth action and ergonomically friendly.</li>
            <li> None of the wavering bending or forcing an odd angle to get a good cut that you have to do with standard clippers.</li>
            <li> Finally, I have found finger nail clippers that easily do the job for my old fingers.</li>
            <li> I wanted better fingernail trimmers and this one was more expensive, but very highly rated.  </li>
            <li> Very clean cuts, extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> They make cutting nails effortless and they do an amazing job withy clean and quick cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been putting up with cheap fingernail clippers for too long.</li>
            <li> I assume for the average person this clipper will found to be more than satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> It is nice to have one tool that can do both (which I have had in the past).</li>
            <li> Build quality is outstanding; will not rust; will outlive you most likely  Cuts through thick nails with ease  </li>
            <li> Personally, when I need a file (which isn&#x27;t often with this true edged clipper), I use the one in my smallest Swiss Army Knife.  </li>
            <li> Personally, when I need a file (which isn&#x27;t often with this true edged clipper), I use the one in my smallest Swiss Army Knife.  </li>
            <li> in Japan, supposedly by the same folks that used to craft samurai swords, how cool is that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> The 9 dots on the back of the lever are just there to look cool...</li>
            <li> Ive looked for a good pair clippers for a long time, these are built like a tank and sharp.</li>
            <li> Due to my healthly strong nails, I have broke several nail clippers that I purchased at local stores, this one is very strong and does well trimming my nails.</li>
            <li> My previous $2 clippers from South Korea, which I lost, were far superior in finish, even if much less comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> The clipping part is made of steel and the top part that you press down with your thumb is made of cast aluminum.</li>
            <li> I love how sharp this nail clipper is!  </li>
            <li> If I could change one thing, I would put a rubber grip on the bottom to help prevent the smooth metal from slipping, but this certainly does not warrant a reduced rating.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to spend so much for a pair of clippers, but I&#x27;m really glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I never realized that paying a little more for tweezers and nail clippers would make so much difference.  </li>
            <li> Also, the part that you press down to cut should be able to be secured to the main part of the clipper.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are made in Japan (not China) and are made of high grade steel with sharper edges and better leverage than an average nail clipper.</li>
            <li> so normally I don&#x27;t put much thought and effort into high quality hygiene products.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and cuts smooth!  </li>
            <li> It has a very sharp clip and should function well for many years.</li>
            <li> Probably so good at being sharp that I have to be careful not to cut too much of my fingernails,</li>
            <li> I barely have to use any pressure to cut right through them.</li>
            <li> These are a little heavier than the normal clippers, but they work much better, mostly because they are so sharp.</li>
            <li> These are by far the sharpest best cutting clippers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I still choose to file with an emery board, but because of the nice cut I spend less than half the time with the file compared to cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> I thought this nail clipper was going to be much better quality than the typical clippers you can buy in the drug store.  </li>
            <li> Since minimal pressure is required, they are easy on my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> The more you pay, the less they do.</li>
            <li> More cut, less pinch.&lt;br /&gt;-Finish.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are mainly using it for manicure or pedicure purposes at home, then you can always buy a separate file for the job.  </li>
            <li> After using regular drug store, wal-mart quality fingernail clippers for several years, I decided to look for something better online and came across these.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had decent nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I anticipate getting many solid years of service with my weekly nail trimmings with the Seki and am deeply appreciate that Amazon allowed me to find this gem.</li>
            <li> I will keep this review short, after all, you are only buying a nail clipper :)</li>
            <li> I decided to give them a go and see how they compared to my classic Trim clippers that I bought for a couple bucks at CVS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving a review for both this fingernail clipper and the matching toenail clipper from the same company, SEKI EDGE, as many people will likely want to purchase both products for their nail-cutting needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clipper of course is much sharper than your standard clipper, but where it wins, is ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li> I have no complaints against the company--just may be that as an older man, I&#x27;m not as flexible at using this item as others may be.  </li>
            <li> Compared to the Tweezerman clippers -- which set me back $12 -- these clippers are way better despite being about the same price.</li>
            <li> solidly made , work nice , but seem to slip sideways while in the closed position.</li>
            <li> I am glad I did not order the even more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Worth at least twice more than the 12 bucks I paid for them.</li>
            <li> These are a classic example of &amp;</li>
            <li> Back of clipper that fits into ball of hand isn&#x27;t super ergonomic.  </li>
            <li> It means good things about the manufacture of the product, but the inside sides of the two blade plates are such a harsh 90 degrees that it feels like it could cut me.  </li>
            <li> Also, the blade has a good shape and natural curve, the mouth opens wide, and is big enough to do large fingers and BIG toes just fine.  </li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to cut with and it cuts real sharp.</li>
            <li> They are larger and heavier than the normal clippers you might find, and a little pricey, but definitely do a good job.</li>
            <li> WIth most other clippers, the lever handle hits the keyring attachment and so the lever is always shifted to the left or right.  </li>
            <li> However, There is evident attention to grinding down these edges to make them smooth; they are.&lt;br /&gt;-Ergonomics.  </li>
            <li> Seki&#x27;s fingernail clipper is a fine precision instrument that makes accurate cutting easy and pleasurable.&lt;br /&gt;Quality feel and finish.</li>
            <li> The cheaper ones I&#x27;ve seen have this feature and can be pretty handy to help smooth out the nail after cutting.  </li>
            <li> Have a few around the house now :) with the first one being over 10 years old and still working well.</li>
            <li> I was curious how the best selling nail clippers on Amazon handled, and I could not be more disappointed.</li>
            <li> These cut cleanly through my nails with very little effort, they are very comfortable to hold and seem very solid.</li>
            <li> would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> highly recommend these Seki Edge clippers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this clipper.</li>

            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> However, these are not to the point of out-of-reach high luxury items with gold plating and studded with diamonds.  </li>
            <li> The heft and precision of this highly engineered product will change your opinion that all fingernail clippers are alike.  </li>
            <li> I like the high quality of these clippers.  </li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> fingernail clipper is just as high quality as the SEKI toenail</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving this product a try regardless of what people say.</li>
            <li> These are pricy but the build quality backs up that high price.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend purchasing Seki.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this clipper to others.  </li>
            <li> Really high quality and well-made.</li>
            <li> They are &amp;#34;GREAT.&amp;#34;  I highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I can highly recommend it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I can highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them....</li>
            <li> It was highly recommended by a number of people I know.</li>
            <li> Recomend highly.</li>
            <li> It is definitely high quality product.</li>
            <li> high quality</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is a precision nail clipper of high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and don&#x27;t stick during use.</li>
            <li> Steel is high quality stuff too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned other Green Bell products, and I always thought they were great.  </li>
            <li> Very rigid, sharp, and jaws meet precisely.  </li>
            <li> The clippers seem sharp, but surprisingly often leave torn and partially attached fragments at the ends of my nails.  </li>
            <li> curved grip design is much more ergonomic and easier to use than traditional flat nail clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clipper is very sharp (easy press to clip) and its Stainless Steel (impervious to salt water.)</li>
            <li> These were purchased to replace the best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever had (the old Brookstone clippers which have been changed several years ago with a less than average pair) after buying drug store selections for over a year.  </li>
            <li> And, my favorite part, they put a little &amp;#34;ramp&amp;#34; on the handle to keep your thumb from sliding off.</li>
            <li> Love these little clippers.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the intended nature of the blades of the Seki Edge, and only what I received has this small defect, because other nail clippers I purchased before have their blades match perfectly.</li>
            <li> Wish that the head expanded a little more</li>
            <li> was expecting a little better based on reviews</li>
            <li> It does cut better then any other clipper especially on the first cut.</li>
            <li> This costs a little more</li>
            <li> I love this little thing.</li>
            <li> These cut fingernails with very little applied force and cut much more cleanly than even my Korean TRIMs, which were my standard for quality clippers before trying these.  </li>
            <li> They are expensive, but if you want quality nail clippers that leave a nice, clean edge</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try not to repeat all the other reviews (solid stainless instead of chrome plated pot-metal, made in Japan, intentionally made to be good rather than &#x27;enough&#x27;, does improve on the job, etc.)</li>
            <li> If you enjoy the feel of quality and are willing to pay for it, I recommend these as one of life&#x27;s little and affordable joys.</li>
            <li> Cuts are clean and consistent, &#x27;feel&#x27; is very solid, and overall is just a quality product.  </li>
            <li> Insanely sharp and easy to cut your nails with.</li>
            <li> They are easy to hold due to the shape of the handle.  </li>
            <li> It is so sharp it makes that job easy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very sharp and cuts nails easily</li>
            <li> they are sharp and easy to use with one hand.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and high quality, these actually cut the nail and don&#x27;t break it like the cheap ones.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes wish they came with a mini-file, but by and large, the clip is smooth enough that no file is necessary.</li>
            <li> I used a TRIM nail clipper before these and that lasted me many years.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size (bigger than trim) I find it hard to grip it securely and have control over it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very surprised how much of a difference that sharp clippers make over a cheap pair.</li>
            <li> cut smoothly without rough spots.&lt;br /&gt;Their</li>
            <li> Also, a great and affordable quality item to gift to those people that are difficult to buy presents for.</li>
            <li> These clippers are expensive but they work great.</li>
            <li> It sounds weird to say, but these clippers are a joy to use.</li>
            <li> I have an old set of nail clippers (made in USA) that work really well, but I needed something for work.</li>
            <li> rough edges to smooth out,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of obsessed with my fingernails (which doesn&#x27;t result in them always looking great, as a guy, but they&#x27;re trimmed well)</li>
            <li> Really like it but wish it had a small pointed file attached as many fingernail clippers do.</li>
            <li> OK, so these are only nail clippers, and no need to get too excited, but it is difficult not to be excited about a product this good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Normal clippers flex</li>
            <li> The price is totally worth it since they last forever.</li>
            <li> Nor will I ever curse it for not cutting properly.  </li>
            <li> In particular, the end of the top (moving) part of the clipper is slightly curved with a raised \\&quot;ledge\\&quot; that you thumb rests against and prevents your thumb from repeatedly slipping off or (compared to clippers with a more pointed end) digging in to your thumb and starting to hurt.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper drug store clippers may not last as long, but do a better job.</li>
            <li> They are probably more expensive because of quality build, carefully thought out design, and the use of good materials and processes.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned the Seki/GreenBell toenail clippers for several years, and they are far better than anything else we&#x27;ve used in the last 6 decades.  </li>
            <li> These are amazing.&amp;#34;  I just sit back and smile because I know my job here is done.</li>
            <li> a few more dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth the extra cost...</li>
            <li> Very much worth the extra money you pay for it.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny I paid for this and the regular clippers.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy a few more to gift to family members.</li>
            <li> It looks so simple but man is it worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so worth the extra expense up front.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money; they will last for years.</li>
            <li> I pretty much only use these because they&#x27;re stainless steel</li>
            <li> i keep my nails short and this is worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of those rare purchases that is inexpensive enough that you should do it where you can see the product in person before deciding to buy.</li>
            <li> I will probably purchase a few more for friends and family.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always seemed more reasonable to cut my nails over a small garbage can</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always seemed more reasonable to cut my nails over a small garbage can</li>
            <li> I bought a few months ago that cut better.  </li>
            <li> At first I found the top handle a bit thick and clunky, but have found that I got used to it and appreciate its design and build.</li>
            <li> Others who post here and care to write more about it than me have said it all, I just advise you to buy them if you are the least interested in a quality nail clipper.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> It functions properly, and I am sure I will have it for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It is far more solid than the cheaper clippers that you&#x27;ll find at the big box retail and drug store chains.</li>
            <li> I had a nail clipper that I bought in Japan for many years but got misplaced when I took it on a trip.  </li>
            <li> worth your money if you care enough to even be reading this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be careful not to trim too short because these clippers make it easy!</li>
            <li> This clipper really helps, it gives sharp and clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cut is sharp, fast, and clean.  </li>
            <li> However until using the Seki Stainless, I had never realized how much the old ones squeezed the nail (mild discomfort), then cut it, leaving a rough edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The long handle is very effective in removing hard to get toe nails</li>
            <li> The stainless steel is very sharp and cuts smoothly.</li>
            <li> It leaves a nice 90 degree angle on the nail, which actually makes it very sharp.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m confident that these will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of drugstore nail clippers, they always seemed so cheap, rusted easily, and never stood the test of time.</li>
            <li> Size is great,  not to small or too large,  just like the three little bears.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so sharp I love cutting my nails LOL</li>
            <li> It does a good job, but I believe it could have been made larger (my other clippers are all larger-</li>
            <li> If you own one you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> On top of that (at least on the ones I recieved) these leave the top edge of my nails EXTREMELY SHARP.</li>
            <li> This was just right without taking out a second mortgage.</li>
            <li> From the moderate knowledge and familiarity I have with Japanese culture, I know that when they set out to be the best, it can be a very serious venture.  </li>
            <li> If I loose these I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> The lever sits a little higher than I&#x27;m used to, but that might actually contribute to better control.</li>
            <li> On the Seki, the lever is connected to the the axle shaft by a real rivet that is sealed on both ends with a tight fit and NO wobble.  </li>
            <li> I had been having problems with nail clippers, never finding the right ones that would do a good job clipping my nails cleanly and evenly, not leaving spurs, could clip fingernails and toenails, could handle the corners on ingrown nails or problem areas, could handle small clean-up spots without making matters worse, and so forth.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed theses are very high quality and very sharp</li>
            <li> The nail is left clean with no rough edges.</li>
            <li> They are all fine products, but the only one I use on a regular basis is the Seki Edge.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, super sharp nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> A little pricey, but cuts so much more cleanly than any other clipper I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> The nail clippers are actually sharp, thus not snagging your nail and breaking off the ends like the cheap grocery store brands.</li>
            <li> The blades are so precise and sharp it is unreal.</li>
            <li> None of the other brands of cheap clippers I had worked well at all</li>
            <li> It leaves a smooth edge, unlike any other clippers I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> , you&#x27;ll have to file your nails to smooth out the sharp edges after using it.</li>
            <li> Cuts sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> Sharp, comfortable, feels durable.</li>
            <li> The offset clipping keeps the blade edge sharp, and precise.</li>
            <li> Extremely neat and smooth cut.</li>
            <li> Stays sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> I used to fight with the cheaper ones to get the job done, but these clippers are so sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li> Sharp and feels comfortable</li>
            <li> The way nails are cut seems cleaner and sharper than other cheap unit I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I still enjoy the smoke screen of all those other clippers in the house to confuse my clipper competitors.  </li>
            <li> I normally would not pay this much for some nail clippers but my old ones were about 10 years old</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how good the more expensive ones are over this one, but for the average person, just get this.  </li>
            <li> If the average nail clipper you find in the local store is good enough for you, then there&#x27;s no reason to read this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Those cheap grocery store ones are not worth it, highly recommend using these clippers.</li>
            <li> so here I am buying a new pair.</li>
            <li> These are the new favorites in the house.</li>
            <li> These are my new go-to gift to get the people who have seemingly everything.</li>
            <li> the job.&lt;br /&gt;But not these new clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not want to live it.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Made\\&quot;  Needed a new nail clipper and thought what the heck.  </li>
            <li> My husband was always breaking other brands of clippers or they really just wore out quickly.  </li>
            <li> But if you look at the lesser clippers compared to this, their &#x27;mouth&#x27; almost seems to jut outward while the Seki come more straight down and seem to have &#x27;deeper teeth.&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Well made, very sharp, easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy too use, sturdy and very sharp.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-The blades are very sharp, and cut easily and cleanly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;These trim your nails easily, but leave you with a very sharp nail edge\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It just neatly and precisely slices the nail off, exactly where you place the cutters, with very little pressure required.  </li>
            <li> I never really thought I&#x27;d ever pay 15 bucks for a pair of clippers, but these are heavy, seem very sturdy, and cut both smoothly and cleanly.</li>
            <li> The Seki does not cut the nail as cleanly &amp; leaves the nails with a rough edge.</li>
            <li> I expected something more solid.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong and they are reasonably priced, if you&#x27;re used to buying good quality.</li>
            <li> I notice a hint of metal to metal sound when turning the handles, which probably will produce scratch marks over time, but this is not such a big issue to me.  </li>
            <li> Overall I found these two tools to be a nice and helpful addition to my everyday life.  </li>
            <li> You definitely want to be a bit more careful with it.  </li>
            <li> I tried to find another one just like it and had been searching for many years (spent over $30 on numerous nail clippers made in Germany, China, even Japan.)</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Enough heft to let you know this is solidly made with a comfortable feel&lt;</li>
            <li> So far I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra 10 bucks.</li>
            <li> This is redundant but not so; many clippers available at CVS and Walgreen do not work well leaving a less than coveted result.</li>
            <li> As someone who takes their nail clipping seriously, you&#x27;re doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t own these guys.</li>
            <li> Not only do the clippers have the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of quality, they perform excellent in cutting fingernails.  </li>
            <li> if I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d order a model with a nail file, but other than that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with these Samurai sharp clippers.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER go back to using the cheap clippers from the big box store.  </li>
            <li> but it does the job extremely well, feels good in the hand, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> They are clearly made of high quality material.</li>
            <li> Each of us has certain tools or accessories in which we are more or less interested than the average person.  </li>
            <li> It is sharp, strong and the blades are slightly wider and farther apart to accommodate larger or more curved nails.  </li>
            <li> It makes cutting nails very clean, fast, and easy.</li>
            <li> The spring is strong and tight.  </li>
            <li> Now, after several months I am not so sure (and would like a reply or two from other purchasers).  </li>
            <li> I bought these clippers after my trusty 20+ year old German-made clippers finally succumbed to metal fatigue, and the cheap China-made replacements I initially bought just didn&#x27;t cut it</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works that much better to justify the price, but then again this is not a review of pricing.</li>
            <li> This of course is not a big issue but my first impression was that this sticker somewhat cheapened the look.  </li>
            <li> For a man especially, the textured handles make grip and control a much better experience than with any other brand.  </li>
            <li> it cuts through finger nails like a hot knife through butter, is solid in the hand, and feels like it will never break.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll never need another pair, except with your significant other keeps stealing them from you.</li>
            <li> to keep them in my travel kit, they are small and OK in an emergency.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male, so filing my nails isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve done before or am willing to try.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No more carpal tunnel from struggling with cheap clippers!</li>
            <li> Consequently, my fingernails and toenails are also pretty big.</li>
            <li> - wow!  </li>
            <li> Bomb proof, epic clipper!</li>
            <li> I spent FAR MORE for the same results.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll get back to you in 15 years, or when it breaks, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these at a much higher price from Brookstone 6 or so years back.</li>
            <li> in fact, this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever left on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> There is a higher grit used on the final grinding of the blade edges than on any of my clippers.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this results in greater flexibility - I wouldn&#x27;t put it past the makers to have thought this through.&lt;br /&gt;-Flair.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and nice, but wish they would not slide right or left when they are closed.  </li>
            <li> So, the new ones are still new in the package and I&#x27;m still using my old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first went down the road of purchasing a cheap pair of nail clippers at a local retailer.</li>
            <li> And for all you good ole Americans too dumb to consider anything made outside of your safe little country, these are from the far east.</li>
            <li> They cut cleanly and, while expensive, I expect to get many years of use out of these fingernail clippers.  </li>
            <li> These are a huge improvement over any other clipper that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Sharp and clean cuts.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly and maintains sharp edge.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp, and cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> Edge is sharp and cut is clean.</li>
            <li> The blade is really sharp and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge is sharp and cuts clean every time.  </li>
            <li> It is sharp, and cuts nails cleanly.</li>
            <li> This thing will go right through thick nails with easy, leaving a very clean cut that hardly requires filing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this nail clipper if you&#x27;ve ever been aggravated with the uneven or torn cut that you get from cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> They feel quite substancial in your hand, have a smooth mechanism, and are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and goes through nails smoothly.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very sharp and work smoothly.  </li>
            <li> These are very sharp and mechanically precise.</li>
            <li> Very well made with an excellent sharp cutting edge.  </li>
            <li> I actually tossed all the other ones in the house and will be ordering another pair of these for a back up, they are that nice.  </li>
            <li> I always bought the old cheap-o and just bought new ones every two to three months.</li>
            <li> He showed me his identical 4 year old split thumb nail and told me to live with it.  </li>
            <li> my old finger nail clippers were, let alone my relatively new toe nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> The Seki shows me just how far new technology has come.  </li>
            <li> Very precise, and easy cutting.  </li>
            <li> Hands down better than the little cheap things hanging in most stores, where the quality you get it just luck of the draw; where the best are half decent and the worst can&#x27;t even handle a hangnail.</li>
            <li> Since heat treat is likely, that would mean needing to use coarse, medium, and fine grits to remove metal smoothly but without causing too much friction heat.  </li>
            <li> From the ever so slightly curved blades, to the ergonomic styled handle with groves and indentations to ensure a comfortable and stable grip.</li>
            <li> The lever is longer than typical cheap clippers, with a recessed indent for the thumb.  </li>
            <li> Seems genuine and long lasting.</li>
            <li> After owning these you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever bothered with the typical stuff available in the drug stores like Revlon or LaCross.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly, easy for the thickest nails, and has held up well to heavy use by a bunch of us.</li>
            <li> my 8 year old cut his nails a bit short the first time because he wasn&#x27;t used to them.  </li>
            <li> This Seki version costs a little more than average, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> but most are not very good.</li>
            <li> sister was right; pay a few more bucks at the start to avoid replacing every other year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also because of the weight of the extra metal in the bar you press down on, it feels more effortless when you are clipping.</li>
            <li> Despite this bulkiness, I can see this clipper being ergonomically friendly for those with large or small hands.  </li>
            <li> I am careful when using them because they are so sharp I could shear through skin very easily</li>
            <li> If I buy two pair of a given brand, I find one clips just fine while the second gets about half way through my nail and decides it&#x27;s just too much work</li>
            <li> Everything that other people have said is true.</li>
            <li> I found these to be better than the \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot;, but less necessary than the toe nail model.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that this model works so well and is half the cost of the expensive one yet works flawlessly!.</li>
            <li> The top part bends before the fingernail is cut if you cut your fingernails while they are dry and the edge of the fingernail is rough, after the cut, and needs to be filed.    </li>
            <li> These are definitely the ones to get if you want an easy cut without any rough edges.</li>
            <li> these gripes about the common nail clipper ring a bell with you, then I strongly suggest you try the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Nail Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before settling on this one, I tried a few others, which cost less, but the quality wasn&#x27;t nearly as good.</li>
            <li> For all the rave reviews these clippers recieved, and the relatively high price of these seki vs other clippers, I expected much more.</li>
            <li> The brushed stainless steel found on the body and the smooth sandblasted surface look on the handle is nicer than the chrome plated or \\&quot;gold\\&quot; plated shiny ones typically found elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of the drugstore type nail clippers and decided to purchase something that would last and would cut finger nails easily and leave a smooth cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent half as much and gotten much better quality</li>
            <li> It also has a large enough opening for toe nails.    </li>
            <li> : they&#x27;re shaped in a way that makes holding them much easier than older traditional (even high end traditional)</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge one cuts your nail cleanly and you don&#x27;t even have to file it after because it&#x27;s not sharp/jagged like other nail clippers!</li>
            <li> Ah, the simple and affordable luxuries that make the downturn in the economy a little more bearable.</li>
            <li> To this day, I&#x27;m still using the little steel nail file on my old cheap unit, even after I cut my nails with the Seki.  </li>
            <li> Yes you are going to pay a little more for these than regular clippers</li>
            <li> Slightly larger than most clippers so a little bulky feeling.</li>
            <li> They are SO sharp that that they cut through nails as if they were butter, but the truth is they do leave you with mildly raggedy nails.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re hard pressed to find anything better.  </li>
            <li> :  Super Sharp, Does not chip</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as extraordinary as other reviewers have out, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> goes through a tomato better than a dull knife.  </li>
            <li> The cut is so quick and sharp, I almost worry.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li> These do seem like quality clippers and they arrived super sharp.</li>
            <li> they are super sharp, and never chip, fray, or tear your nails.</li>
            <li> These are super sharp and cut effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are super sharp, and glide through fingernails with ease.  </li>
            <li> If you want a super sharp clipper, this is for you.</li>
            <li> These are super sharp and require amost no effort to use.  </li>
            <li> Cut was average, nothing special.</li>
            <li> Sharp, the curved blade is easy to work with and solidly built.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, strong, feels like it will last longer than me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are very sharp and the members are rigid, which means that they don&#x27;t yield when you hit the nail but shear cleanly though.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut the nail clean.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp and cuts clean</li>
            <li> Very sharp, cuts nails cleanly.</li>
            <li> Great cutting for a finger nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> these cutters do a great job at cutting nails (d&#x27;uh).  </li>
            <li> Great leverage for ease of cutting.</li>
            <li> These are so much sharper, leaves my nails smooth, and are solid and heavy.  </li>
            <li> it was crystal clear</li>
            <li> and all I can say is WOW</li>
            <li> The blades are formed from polished stainless steel, the handle from a brushed metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are professional clippers if there are any.  </li>
            <li> My husband always complains about his cheap nail-clippers that break after a few months.</li>
            <li> This one did the trick he says that now he is the happiest man alive.</li>
            <li> Made from stainless steel is a big plus and won&#x27;t rust in the shower.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer these over the regular toenail clippers since these are smaller and can cut with more precision than regular toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> Have used old, worn out or key-ring versions for years...  after tearing up nails &amp; fighting w/inferior types I bought these out of frustration.  </li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and have gone through a lot of fingernail clippers over the years.  </li>
            <li> The Seki clipper closes smoothly and predictably as you squeeze it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want a complete manicure these are not for you.  </li>
            <li> like taking a precision tool to tree stumps (in the case of my old, gnarled toenails)</li>
            <li> You either have to get several clippers to place in your car, office and home, or you have to get used to using these and then changing to a much inferior clippers when you want to work on your nails somewhere else.</li>
            <li> and I still prefer my old cheapies.    </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no flex in the lever action.  </li>
            <li> works very well and a vast improvement over the cheaper ones out there.</li>
            <li> The thickness of the metal really make them feel like they were built to be your last pair of clippers ever.  </li>
            <li> but I find that to be common with most clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended; I suspect the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> I thought wow, it never dawned on me</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re by far the sharpest</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an old fashioned clipper.</li>
            <li> It seems very well made and that it will last.</li>
            <li> far as the product does we have no issues.</li>
            <li> /&gt; old and arthritic</li>
            <li> Now can pitch all those old ones we have that don&#x27;t cut.  </li>
            <li> and wow...</li>
            <li> I have soft nails, so maybe don&#x27;t buy this if you have soft nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After using the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper, I realized all clippers were not made equal.</li>
            <li> At this price point for a nail clipper I find this completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Never using those old clippers again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought several $5 drug store clippers and now thanks to Seki Edge</li>
            <li> Much sharper than stuff you get at your local store.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t see any sign that it will lose its sharpness anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I clip my nails in the tub when they&#x27;re soft</li>
            <li> Took me nearly 50 years to find these.</li>
            <li> Will never waste money on another brand.</li>
            <li> I dont understand how the edge can be hand finished and be that far off.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve held up for a couple of years so far and work for both my fingernails and toenails.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the highest quality fingernail clipper I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> They cut very decisively and the oversized bottom grip helps immensely with precision.</li>
            <li> I suggest do not waste money on this.  </li>
            <li> Completely over rated.</li>
            <li> I keep my old clippers around just so I can use the file/scraper thing.</li>
            <li> I am still using my old clippers at times because of this.</li>
            <li> My husband uses clippers in the shower, and the rust marks left from cheaper, non-stainless steel clippers really annoy me.  </li>
            <li> (being what seems like 100% stainless steel), the way the clippers actually clip the nails off, the weight of the clippers, etc.</li>
            <li> It feels like a professional tool in the hand.</li>
            <li> but i would not say by far.</li>
            <li> Almost like it comes alive in your hands.</li>
            <li> It does this one thing and one thing only really well.</li>
            <li> Made in Japan, and they put my old Made in USA brand to shame, never mind the...</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about how much easier and faster it is to trim my nails and our children&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Our kids used to complain that the old clippers hurt.  </li>
            <li> Blades are quite sharp and very exact.</li>
            <li> Before they arrived, she found my old ones.</li>
            <li> any I&#x27;ve had so far.  </li>
            <li> So much so that I actually cut myself with my nails by accident.</li>
            <li> STAY FAR AWAY from these.</li>
            <li> They are much, much sharper than the standard drugstore cheapies.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at personel item in my xmas stocking.</li>
            <li> Owned it for nearly two years now, I think,</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say.</li>
            <li> Not so much for my toenails, but I have a bigger nail clipper for that.</li>
            <li> They far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I had just bought some drug store ones to replace the old ones I couldn&#x27;t find.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of old phonograph players.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> Wow...  </li>
            <li> The brand sticker is really uninspiring and is just an open sticker.  </li>
            <li> They give you good control over what you are doing and the cutting edges seem to cut really well.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are more expensive, but hands-down worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely designed for a smaller hand, for what it&#x27;s worth...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect these (or any nail clippers) to last more than a few years.</li>
            <li> The actual steel it is made of appears to be good but the cut is poor.  </li>
            <li> My nail was broken to the point that I had to trim it shorter than I liked</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a good nail clipper</li>
            <li> cast level has a nice feel and adds extra leverage to power through even thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;-Made</li>
            <li> (if anyone will be claiming otherwise - most likely they are paid shills for certain company, and unfortunately Amazon attracts many of these).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it sharp?</li>
            <li> These are very sharp, quality steel, nice finish and will last as long as you have nails.</li>
            <li> With this clipper you get a nice, sharp cut and often you don&#x27;t need to do any filing at all, except for a little touch up.</li>
            <li> Great - this thing is sharp and cutts tough nails like a snap.  </li>
            <li> They are stainless steel, not chrome plated with very sturdy construction with a great cutting edge that seems to stay sharp.  </li>
            <li> Good, sharp clippers, but they don&#x27;t open wide enough.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re sharp, the rod that holds the pivot for the lever is solid (as opposed to being notched to accept the pivot), and the action of the lever is precise.</li>
            <li> For me - yes, BUT the shape of your hands and fingers (and other stuff like thickness and hardness of your nails) is most likely different</li>
            <li> Only criticism is the same one in many other reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a little excited about this,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re rather large (larger than the little cheapy ones you can buy in the store), which makes for a better gripping surface, but kind of big to be cutting nails on little kids.  </li>
            <li> Definitely not, but neither are clippers by any other brand, including hugely overpriced models which are \\&quot;made in Solingen, Germany\\&quot; or the ones with \\&quot;creative\\&quot; names like \\&quot;Clyppi\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My only solution is clippers that clip cleanly, leaving edges as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wasting my time with all those cheap 50c clippers which needed twice the effort to cut or even left sharp raggedy edges on my nails.</li>
            <li> Not the fault of the clipper, just try out other models with different shapes, you might find the one that will fit YOU the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is extremely sharp, and the cutting edges are perfectly aligned.  </li>
            <li> Although it is sharp enough to cut your nails smoothly, it is too small to use easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to tell the difference in the inexpensive clippers one usually finds in the drug store.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s not pointy like the back of lesser clippers, but the way it flares out at the back and is slightly thin (metal is thinner because of higher quality - it&#x27;s a good thing)</li>
            <li> Has a very nice cutting edge.</li>
            <li> The idea behind the chefs advice was that instead of buying an entire set of marginally effective knives, just purchase two high quality, versatile knives and master them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The connection in the rear is the usual stamp-press to fuse the metals, but the stamp is especially large and you can see plenty of material has been shifted in the process.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp!</li>
            <li> First, probably the function they give you (chopping off your nails)... and second... that they&#x27;re a cheap and common</li>
            <li> I was wrong, it turned out to be like those cheap ones you can buy that has a keychain; pretty much forcing to cut rather than clipping it.  </li>
            <li> I have no experience with other quality nail clippers to compare to, but these are certainly worth owning a pair of.</li>
            <li> Makes cutting your nails very smooth and quick.</li>
            <li> It works fine, not much more to say.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second clippers I have bought because when I moved, somehow I lost/misplaced my first set.  </li>
            <li> bought several different brands of these higher priced clippers to run a &amp;#34;taste test&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how many different fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve owned in the past 60 years.  </li>
            <li> actually ordered these to replace the exact same ones I&#x27;ve had for well over a decade.</li>
            <li> I purchased a second one recently and the build quality appears to be identical to my first one.</li>
            <li> , I found that Green Bell makes a ton of other models of nail clippers under a different Japanese packaging (it&#x27;s available at the Narita/Haneda airports, Tokyo Hands, and many of the local stores in Tokyo).</li>
            <li> These are two of the few times that I feel let down with an apparently popular purchase based on Amazon community reviews.</li>
            <li> The clippers make such a clean cut that the edge is sharp.  </li>
            <li> Razor sharp, instant no effort cut and clean as a whistle</li>
            <li> Sharp and size is just right.</li>
            <li> It is essential that the corners of the cutting jaws meet perfectly, which is why most cheapies fail this task.  </li>
            <li> High quality, very solid.</li>
            <li> High quality, Japanese steel and grinding.</li>
            <li> High quality nail clippers that vastly exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I find the cutting action to be quite smooth, rather than the sudden snap of many others.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> High quality; should be the last I ever buy if I don&#x27;t lose it.</li>
            <li> The high price is the only reason I deducted a star.</li>
            <li> Super sharp (Japanese), these things clip right throw with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;m a shipfitter/welder, not some GQ type, and my hands take a beating at work; I needed a real tool keep my claws trimmed, not some chintzy little fru-fru device, and this does just fits the bill - and, just like any quality tool, it&#x27;s well worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> Last year, I decided that I would buy quality products that worked well instead of cheap products that would cost me less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; clippers give a great cut with the sharp blades, but I find them a little too heavy and smooth/slippery to grip well when clipping my young kids nails.  </li>
            <li> we were having nothing but trouble with the junky clippers made for infants, I went to Amazon and purchased every infant nail clippers listed: literally every single one (there weren&#x27;t that many).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of curiousity I have asked the US distributor to find out what steel is being used in these and will report back if I find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who may be searching, I&#x27;ve discovered that Seki does in fact manufacture a baby nail clippers, not available on Amazon but available directly from Seki.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Out of curiousity I have asked the US distributor to find out what steel is being used in these and will report back if I find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who may be searching, I&#x27;ve discovered that Seki does in fact manufacture a baby nail clippers, not available on Amazon but available directly from Seki.</li>
            <li> And, the price is reasonable, when you consider that you will have these 10x as long as the drug store clippers.  </li>
            <li> I waited a long time to get them because of the cost--and replaced 6 other cheap ones that kept breaking or dulling to non-use status in the meantime.  </li>
            <li> Took a really long time to choose because I really did not want to have to return it.  </li>
            <li> This has been a sound strategy for me in the past with ball point pens</li>
            <li> It should hold it edge for a long time if the quality of the stainless steel is any indication.</li>
            <li> Using normal clippers, I always find myself fumbling with them because of my big hands.</li>
            <li> see no reason these clippers would not last a life time of normal use.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except these function exactly as they are supposed to.  </li>
            <li> Really sharp, really works, compared to the normal drug store clippers</li>
            <li> Smooth edges left on your fingernails because of the sharp cutters on the clipper and, since the lever is twice as thick as the cheap fingernail clippers, there&#x27;s no bending of the lever.</li>
            <li> It should last through years of normal use.</li>
            <li> From the first few uses, these will be exactly the same.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive for a nail clipper, but worth so much more than the throw-away clippers you get in sets, or simply have laying around.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I wish I would have paid the few extra dollars and bought the better quality clipper.</li>
            <li> I have wide nails, so if the clipper was a little wider would be even better.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are a little on the curved side, meaning that they don&#x27;t cut across your nail in a straight line very well.  </li>
            <li> I expect these clippers to last for several years, but even if they only last a few years, they&#x27;ll still have been a better investment than the crummy five-dollar clippers I&#x27;ll never use again!</li>
            <li> As mentioned in most other reviews, they are very sharp and cut effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> They cut effortlessly leaving a clean edge, and I&#x27;ve been using it for all my nail-cutting needs (along with the occasional price tag removal) for six months with no slowing down.  </li>
            <li> They seem to stay super sharp and actually cut instead of tear.  </li>
            <li> Also, I would have liked a straight cutting edge</li>
            <li> it comes to cutting nails, it does so cleanly and easily.</li>
            <li> Keep them dry even though they are advertised as stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Yesterday it slipped straight out of my hand into the bathtub (my hands were dry).</li>
            <li> then I would stick to the regular nail clippers that cost only 1/3 as much.</li>
            <li> After trying a slew of alternatives, I purchased a Seki Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper several months back.  </li>
            <li> (Just be careful to only swipe the very tips of the corners and not the main part of the blade.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note:</li>
            <li> It seems strange to be writing a review about a nail clipper, but this is the first example I&#x27;ve owned that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to with zero fuss.</li>
            <li> but for me suffice it to say that these are really the only clippers I want to use into the future.</li>
            <li> The action is far smoother than your standard 99 cent</li>
            <li> When the product is less than $15, this is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> This one is truly different and makes it much easier to use, especially with kids!</li>
            <li> After buying what I thought was good clippers at a beauty store to have them fail about 9-12 months later I called the customer service</li>
            <li> Easily cut my husband&#x27;s thick nails.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally possible that I&#x27;m just very sensitive.</li>
            <li> This cuts both ways I guess, we love that these are sharp, don&#x27;t leave little bits, don&#x27;t take a ton of pressure... but</li>
            <li> Title says it all - these are way more expensive than your standard clippers, but from the moment you hold them you know they are much higher quality.  </li>
            <li> For me - yes, especially compared to the junky \\&quot;no-name\\&quot; clippers you can get at your local pharmacy or any store which sells grooming items and which usually require much more effort to operate then</li>

            <li> No other clipper I&#x27;ve had has compared.</li>
            <li> They cut extremely well, are sturdy, and look pretty sleek too.</li>
            <li> Majorly bummed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since January and it still cuts just as sharp as when I first bought it.</li>
            <li> There are no other attached utilities, like cheaper trimmers have.</li>
            <li> Well, first, they don&#x27;t seem to be all that sharp.  </li>
            <li> They seem pretty sharp, but 75% of the time, they split my nail.</li>
            <li> The curve of the blades is a little more extreme than I&#x27;m used to but everything else makes up for it.</li>
            <li> Well built, sharp, and gets the job done the first time without splintering nails.</li>
            <li> A little pricey especially when you are used to buying clippers for 4-5 dollars, but if you think you might want this, I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> It is the strangest feeling to touch your own fingernails and wonder why they feel so.... sharp and hard.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clean cutting clippers, good quality, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not only do that cut cleanly and with precision, but they require little hand/finger pressure to make the cut.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;The materials used in their manufacture include the tried-and-tested carbon steel categories C45 and C60; however, more than half of them are manufactured from non-corrosive stainless steel including at least 13% chromium and 0.46% carbon.</li>
            <li> I will be placing my order once I&#x27;ve decided what else to purchase along with it.ude the tried-and-tested carbon steel categories C45 and C60; however, more than half of them are manufactured from non-corrosive stainless steel including at least 13% chromium and 0.46% carbon.</li>
            <li> The design makes them comfortable to hold and provides extra leverage for easy cutting.  </li>
            <li> These are fairly small and clip cleanly.  </li>
            <li> but seriously when you go on interviews or talking to superiors or working with your hands, you would be surprised how important it is to have well kept nails.</li>
            <li> As I get older it is getting more difficult to trim my finger nails.  </li>
            <li> however, the handle is angled up high and is long.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item because the cheap nail clippers I got at home would no longer cut my hard fingernails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was tired of the cheaply made clippers that never worked well, so although $13 is quite high for a clipper I decided to give it a chance.  </li>
            <li> It would be better if the cutting edge opened a little more.  </li>
            <li> Takes very little effort to cut through nails and they are very sharp providing a crisp clean cut.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a sharp edge to the cut, but it isn&#x27;t burred or rough like how less effective dime-store cutters leave the edge of the nail.    </li>
            <li> With cheapo clippers, I&#x27;ve generally used an emery board anyway.</li>
            <li> Oh well, files are available at least.</li>
            <li> For the first time ever, I actually enjoyed cutting my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used such a high-quality pair of nail clippers before, usually opting to purchase those cheap $2 department store brand clippers.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve worked your way through a bunch of ordinary nail clippers that eventually lose sharpness or make unclean cuts, you might feel like you&#x27;re ready for the real deal.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but looking at everyone&#x27;s review I took a chance and what a difference they make over the cheap ones you buy at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> No rough jaggies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had 2 old RED Hello Kitty nail clippers (discontinued) for 18+ years</li>
            <li> They simply don&#x27;t work as well as my old pair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not careful, I could slice a chunk of finger off.  </li>
            <li> The seven year old split is finally healed.  </li>
            <li> I have no regrets.  </li>
            <li> and I could probably get away without filing because they leave no rough edge.</li>
            <li> It feels like I&#x27;m forcing my toe far back in there and am bound to lop off a toe tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different nail clippers over the course of my life, and this is the sharpest one I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li> you clip a fingernail with these, there is NO rough edge to file or remove.</li>
            <li> But no recent department or drug store clipper I&#x27;ve used has worked nearly as well as the 30</li>
            <li> noticeably for me was how i barely had had to file my nails after using this clipper.</li>
            <li> , you barely have to file them.</li>
            <li> Given that nail-catchers don&#x27;t catch all the nails, and I have a tendency to tip my cutter downwards which would always result in caught clippings falling out, the inconveniences of all the nail-catchers I&#x27;ve used over the years far outweigh the actual convenience of having one.</li>

            <li> I recently had to use an old clipper of my mom&#x27;s and immediately regretted not waiting until I got home.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a smaller version of the toe clipper and has no functionality as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t extend far out enough or something.</li>
            <li> Also, if you are one to cut your nails really short be cautious because this will cut through the sensitive part under the nail with ease.</li>
            <li> and I doubt I’ll ever go back to TRIM, even when my hand gets back to normal.</li>
            <li> Good standard curve on the cutting edge to make adult cuts.</li>
            <li> Since a clipper is used every few days, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> However, the clip is where it counts most, and on that front: the finishing is quite poor quality.</li>
            <li> Then when I saw the Seki name, I recalled that my very expensive and rare folding knife is made in Seki Japan, where some of the sharpest knives in the world are made using exotic steels.  </li>
            <li> and they cut smoothly through even the thick thumb nails.</li>
            <li> Most nail clippers do a poor job.</li>
            <li> Out of the box it worked extremely well as cutting nails and did so leaving clean edges that really don&#x27;t require filing to smooth out.  </li>
            <li> Whether dry or moist and softened, these super sharp clippers will have you tossing all the drug-store brands in the trash.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old dull clippers because they leave my nail edges softer, more natural and not as sharp.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it because the benefit of the sharper jaws (you do not need to squeeze the lever as hard as on most other clippers) really outweighs this minor drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now days, most of the clippers have a little storage area on it to gather all of your clipped off fingernails, so it won&#x27;t make a mess.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is sharp, and it keeps sharp, I have had it for 1 yr and a half and its holding its own.</li>
            <li> They may be a little more expensive than more common clippers, even after shopping around online, but for products that give a lifetime of frustration and problem-free service, the extra outlay is well worth it.</li>
            <li> The resulting satisfaction from such a mundane activity as clipping my nails is completely worth</li>
            <li> The edges are very sharp and cut nails like a hot knife through butter.</li>
            <li> First, they are very sharp, high-quality clippers - and sharpness</li>
            <li> I actually have to hide these from other family members to make sure they don&#x27;t go missing.</li>
            <li> you clip down, this will not struggle, it will simply cut right through.  </li>
            <li> Green Bell (makers of Seki) got it right.</li>
            <li> The cut from the Seki is so smooth and clean, I actually don&#x27;t have to file them afterward, and they make me look forward to cutting my nails.</li>
            <li> The construction is very high quality, blades are sharp, and the shape is ergonomic.</li>
            <li> Short of a tiny lightsaber, I cannot imagine a more powerful tool for nail cutting.</li>
            <li> These are precise, sharp, and cut down on time to cut nails.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t mind it because the benefit of the sharper jaws (you do not need to squeeze the lever as hard as on most other clippers) really outweighs this minor drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are no loose or wobbly</li>
            <li> In particular, the blade is quite sharp and the clipping mechanism works pretty well that you only have to exert minimal force to clip your nails.</li>
            <li> I have smaller fingers and fingernails, so it might harder for a person with large nails to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and can cut my nail sharply and accurately.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than some other upscale clippers.</li>
            <li> Still was pricey though, you shouldnt have to spend so much just to get sharp clippers.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper works very well &amp; cuts sharply.</li>
            <li> /&gt;PS, the emery board on a couple of the other brands worked really well.</li>
            <li> The fact that they are sharp makes for cuts that I don&#x27;t really have to use a file on.</li>
            <li> Very well made and sharp.  </li>
            <li> They cut so clean and effortlessly, even hard nails.</li>
            <li> Perhaps that opinion is due to our possession of some really crappy clippers he used for comparison.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and work really well on even thicker nails.</li>
            <li> Unlike any other stainless steel, its forged in Seki, Japan.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a few uses to become completely comfortable with them however as the metal is quite slick to hold on to but feels very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Would</li>
            <li> It feels really sturdy, and is extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> When you use it, you really feel the difference from any other nail clipper</li>
            <li> They are sharp and don&#x27;t require much pressure to cut.</li>
            <li> These absolutely blow away every other clipper I have used.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the little premium over regular clippers.</li>
            <li> I got tired of those dull, easy to break cheap ones that you find at the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> These clippers work really nice , really sharp , smooth cutting with minimal effort even with thickest nails.</li>
            <li> These are sharp and work very smoothly but (it&#x27;s hard to explain)</li>
            <li> The cutting edges are so much sharper and it just works better.</li>
            <li> Once used, they passed that quality on to the actual physical action.  </li>
            <li> The only criticism is the blade surface isn&#x27;t quite long enough and requires several cuts on each nail (more than usual).  </li>
            <li> Comfortable thick lever makes this easier to use than standard clippers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> I went through TRIM clippers that were made in the USA, Korea, and the latest Chinese TRIM clippers, and there was no joy whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> Superior cutting edges, lasting for years, in my experience.</li>
            <li> When I use other nail clippers, they generally require too much pressure to properly work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are better for fingernais, but they are sharp sharp sharp.  </li>
            <li> The first couple times I used it I cut a little too close to the skin</li>
            <li> In other words, although the blade seems very sharp, it often doesn&#x27;t give me a clean</li>
            <li> Granted, they&#x27;re at least double the price of the cheapo brands, but I&#x27;ve gone through enough of the cheap ones to make up the cost difference.</li>
            <li> It really shouldn&#x27;t be hard to buy a decent nail clipper.</li>
            <li> how about that, they really built something that is does a better job at something as simple as cutting nails</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting the cheaper ones that work pretty well for a few years and then just replace them...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> a couple times the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li> As a man, I carry clippers everyday in either my work pants or casual clothing(clippers can be used in many useful ways).</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with it is that it feels kind of big and is a little harder to maneuver than my previous clippers.</li>
            <li> The reason they leave such a noticeable edge is because they ARE sharper than other clippers and make such a clean cut across one&#x27;s fingernails that there is a sharp 90-degree-angle edge where the cut was made.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 5½ years now and it is still as sharp as new!  </li>
            <li> And there is no way I&#x27;m getting intimate with my wife until I&#x27;ve filed these nails down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve very picky, and found that most I&#x27;ve used are either poorly designed, flimsy, or just plain dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting clippers like this for a long time, and I finally got &#x27;em!I would rarely use nail-catchers on my previous clippers anyways.</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the few extra dollars which you pay initially as it will probably last for years!</li>
            <li> These are very well made clippers and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Yea, it does - like I mentioned before the clipper is VERY sharp straight from the factory</li>
            <li> and although you can&#x27;t do detail work due to the width and size of this clipper, it is incredibly high quality for the money.</li>
            <li> These fingernail clippers are made extremely durable, and feel like a high quality product.  </li>
            <li> the typical &#x27;made in China&#x27; stainless steel nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> After a day of handling items, opening doors, and typing on the computer, I noticed my nail was slightly separated from the finger on the very tip causing it to be sore</li>
            <li> Its just odd because really they seem well made</li>
            <li> That doesn&#x27;t seem like much to ask but i went thru half a dozen clippers and they were all garbage.</li>
            <li> action handle / lever is a bit long and causes me to lose a bit of dexterity over the smaller ones.  </li>
            <li> How long can I expect the old clippers and file to last?    </li>
            <li> I was skeptical on spending the money on these since they cost a pretty penny, but boy was it worth it.  </li>
            <li> My fingers don&#x27;t open that wide normally when I am using a clipper.  </li>
            <li> But I was pretty skeptical that they&#x27;d be worth the price.</li>
            <li> It certainly seems to be very well constructed and precise... just not for me:-(</li>
            <li> had such high hopes for these based on the reviews, but they left a rough edge on my fingernails.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and require much less force than the cheapo ones.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut the nails without requiring much pressure, but I have found that to be a bit of a problem with trying to keep my nails short.</li>
            <li> And the personal grooming tools I use have got to be high quality and sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d expensive for a clipper, but I&#x27;ve never owned one that clips half way as good as this.</li>
            <li> The whole body curves down, and I think that increases grip, and the flair-out at the back actually improves grip too.  </li>
            <li> I have big hands and therefore pretty wide nails, with some clippers i have to hit each nail 3 times; but these are wide enough hat in 1 or 2 clips the nail is neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was putting up with until my clippers finally broke and forced me to get new ones.</li>
            <li> Green Bell is an outstanding Japanese company that is well known for making high precision cutting instruments and the very finest personal grooming tools.  </li>
            <li> so more sturdy, have a 50% taller opening (making nail positioning that much easier) and are a couple of dollars less expensive (at the time of this review</li>
            <li> Sometimes you need to clean under your nails, or grind down that little edge that you can&#x27;t reach with the clipper.  </li>
            <li> And then buy a few pair to gift to those who&#x27;d shirk at the cost, yet would certainly appreciate them.</li>
            <li> The clipper is a little larger than I had anticipated, but not so large that it is too big to be controlled.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it a star less is because of the fact that it kind of leaves jagged edges behind, which is not really a big deal seeing as I am used to the drugstore clippers doing that.</li>
            <li> Sturdy little nail clipper that cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Thought I&#x27;d try some new clippers and these are incredibly sharp.  </li>
            <li> You can imagine my disappointment when they arrived and the first cut I made (on the skin around the cuticle), ripped the skin instead of making a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and quality heavy duty construction.</li>
            <li> After spending untold dollars at department stores and pharmacies trying to find a trimmer capable of trimming my thick, tough nails caused by many years of manual labor, I lucked out and found this one.</li>
            <li> The old ones wouldn&#x27;t cut my thumbnails, which are kind of tough and thick.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase which was to replace the problematic (dull, difficult) nail clipper I bought at Target a couple of years ago, as well as the pair we bought at a pharmacy a few years before that.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few months now; it is very sharp and makes clean cuts.</li>
            <li> but these days the quality got so bad I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore and have been looking for a good one for about a year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of the most pickiest people about nail clippers because I cut the dead thick skin too.</li>
            <li> The shape and edge of the base and the handle are also nicely curved and very ergonomic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: Very sharp, high quality clipper.</li>
            <li> High quality, very sharp.</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and high quality.</li>
            <li> i had either didn&#x27;t line up quite right or were dull.  </li>
            <li> Maybe a little expensive for a nail clipper, but a great product and surprisingly sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid stainless steel as opposed to chrome-plated whatever, and it has a sharp, precise cutting action, and a solid, high-quality feel.</li>
            <li> i purchased this nail clipper because i was sick of the cheap ones becoming super dull after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers mentioned, this is a well made and solid tool, feels good to hold and gives a solid snap when cutting.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers mentioned, this is a well made and solid tool, feels good to hold and gives a solid snap when cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I am just use to them now, or if it truly has dulled, but after a few weeks it seems as though it does not cut as easily.  </li>
            <li> that are either never sharp to begin with or are made of such cheap materials that they are dull within a few uses.</li>
            <li> Their only negative is they lack a little tool to clean any debris from under the nail like the cheap clippers usually have, but that is a small annoyance for such a high quality clipper.  </li>
            <li> This is a sturdy little fellow that takes a firm clean bite</li>
            <li> Have had for a few months now -- still super sharp!</li>
            <li> At first it can be hard to notice just how substantially different these are from lesser clippers -</li>
            <li> Throw away those old plastic-metal hybrids, the rusting steel clamps that pinch &amp; tear, the expensive boutique clippers that never get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt the sharp blades will far outlast the throw-away</li>
            <li> other clippers there is a loud click as it snaps through the nail and send it flying.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> It may seem silly to pay over ten dollars for nail clippers when you can get one at a gas station, or pretty much anywhere, for 79 cents.</li>
            <li> Blades are very sharp and exactly meet each other.  </li>
            <li> And because I have thick nails, I have to struggle with normal clippers while trying to apply the considerable force necessary to get the clipper to cut through my nails.    </li>
            <li> ONLY complaint is that they are too small I think for most guys (maybe not woman).</li>
            <li> High quality, smooth action, sharp cutting edges.</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and sharp but my main criticism is that it does not open up as wide as I would like it to.  </li>
            <li> You hardly have to press down to clip the nail, and it&#x27;s smooth..</li>
            <li> I wanted a solid, stainless steel clipper for long term use, which is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m just a guy who ordinarily wouldn&#x27;t pay much attention to such things.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to use generic toenail clippers on my fingers to get them to clip, so this is very welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They work, but holy cow, they don&#x27;t work nearly as well as this.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re solid and will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple of months, so I am waiting to see how long they last.</li>
            <li> I am a male and have really thick fingernails that grow at a pretty rapid rate.  </li>
            <li> Before, I would put off clipping my nails, and I developed a habit of biting my fingernails to avoid having to sit down and actually maintain them.</li>
            <li> I typically do not have to file after clipping with other (cheaper) clippers.</li>
            <li> First time I have ever felt that nail clippers were hard to hold in my hand.  </li>
            <li> While this feels a bit small in my hands, it is very high quality and cuts with ease and precision.</li>
            <li> Maybe my fingernails are just odd (28 year old Male).</li>
            <li> Whether product quality or change in nail structure, it has been difficult, over the past few years (maybe more) to find a pair that doesn&#x27;t leave edges ragged or require tremendous pressure to work.</li>
            <li> returning the second one and although I&#x27;ve only sampled 2 units one was good and the other bad.  </li>
            <li> My wife thought I was crazy to pay this much for clippers, but one day she tried them and said, \\&quot;Wow, you really can tell the difference!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Small things like this can make your life so much easier.  </li>
            <li> As usual fast and prompt service.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t ever have paid much attention to nail clippers in the past.</li>
            <li> I feel that not only does it cut well, that it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll probably last a long time.  </li>
            <li> I wonder though how long the blades will last over time.  </li>
            <li> It feels sturdy and seems like it&#x27;ll last long.</li>
            <li> I thought they would last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Take care of your tools and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to say how well they will hold up.  </li>
            <li> Bullet proof clippers that seem like they will last a long time....</li>
            <li> Looks like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> The handle lever clears the slots so it does not rest on the split ring and the lever closes all the way flat.  </li>
            <li> I wonder if cheaper clippers use a sharper angle that cut hangnails easier, but then lose their edge and don&#x27;t work as well after a time, whereas I expect these to last as long as I can keep track of them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting clippers like this for a long time, and I finally got &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> I expect these to last forever, so long as I don&#x27;t lose them.</li>
            <li> Finally, after a long search found Seki Edge nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> I think they will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> If they really do last as long as others have said, I&#x27;ll rate 5 star.  </li>
            <li> I am a strange dude who obsesses over high-quality finger nail clippers and has to keep my nails and cuticles short and neatly-trimmed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the two long holes in the very back are for...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy duty with the right amount of leverage and it&#x27;s very sharp.</li>
            <li> The width of the blades is a little less than standard clippers that  you&#x27;d buy in the drugstore, even though the quality is much higher.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are heavy duty and have not dull yet.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try, my nails are not smooth and I feel like I&#x27;d have to file them to smooth them out.  </li>
            <li> but it makes cutting your nails not as much of a chore as other cheap clippers do..</li>
            <li> and these should last a very long time.</li>
            <li> It smoothly clips your nail like cutting cheese, not the snap tearing action from the others.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd feeling, as though your muscle memory is off from decades of using \\&quot;old school\\&quot; clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd feeling, as though your muscle memory is off from decades of using \\&quot;old school\\&quot; clippers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - normally this is an arduous affair as my old standby Revlon clippers take forever to cut the zip ties.  </li>
            <li> These are really great for cutting through thick dude nails, too.</li>
            <li> and it begins to fall off even faster when you begin using the clippers; B) the cutting edge on most brands is utterly inconsistent.  </li>
            <li> But since that&#x27;s not a good enough range of samples I&#x27;m willing to give it a try again</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t open wide enough.</li>
            <li> Cuts so well and looks like it&#x27;ll last a long long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I expected, but does the job well enough.  </li>
            <li> However, the Japanese company that actually manufactured this nail clipper is a very well established Japanese firm known as Green Bell, which is located in Seki City, Japan.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s design is clearly calculated for those with no time to waste, where one second could spell the difference between life and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> It should last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t open wide enough.</li>
            <li> It is expensive, but to use an old cliche; &amp;#34;expensive, but, worth every penny&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It is simple, effective; it tells people that you mean business, and that you&#x27;re not afraid to do a little cutting to get where you want in life.</li>
            <li> We lost the good pair of clippers and the crap pair we had left were driving me batty.</li>
            <li> These are expensive (for nail clippers) but they are very precise, sharp work like a champ.  </li>
            <li> It is effortless in clipping nail, similar to how I can split a grown man in two with a single swing of my sword.</li>
            <li> Downside: Because it is very sharp, and not very wide and round (compared to the exact shape of an average human fingertip)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been using cuticle trimmers for nails for a long time, and i still like those better because it&#x27;s a smaller cutting edge and easier to maneuver.  </li>
            <li> I first noticed the size of this clipper is slightly larger than an average clipper, but the advantages include a sharper clip, slick handle turning mechanism, and the aesthetically pleasing design.  </li>
            <li> I have a pair of tweezerman nail clippers that when I use leaves my nails so sharp I&#x27;ve literally cut my face by barely brushing my finger over my neck.  </li>
            <li> In fact, all of the ones I have used were almost certainly way too dull.</li>
            <li> I had this split running down a ridge in the middle of my left thumb nail for several years.  </li>
            <li> Just like my old clippers, I had to work to cut through the nail, and I was left with rough edges that I had to file down.</li>
            <li> It will last for a long time!!</li>
            <li> Very precise cutting of nails</li>
            <li> Cutting is very precise and responsive.</li>
            <li> At least 13x better than the $.99 nail clippers from the drug store, which is convenient considering they&#x27;re approximately 13x more expensive.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s worth the extra few dollars if you were considering any of the commonly found clippers such as the Revlon.</li>
            <li> This works much better than the less expensive regular clippers.</li>
            <li> - White Sticker: The white rectangular shaped sticker with \\&quot;Seki Edge\\&quot; logo in red and black looks like it might come off over time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seemed like an enormous amount to pay relative to other nail clippers</li>
            <li> It cuts extremely well and seems like it will last for a while compared to my prior clipper that lost its cut</li>
            <li> Super sharp and seriously, it will change your life.</li>
            <li> The only reason that I give a 4 out of 5 is because after trimming my nails are left with a sharp edge.  </li>
            <li> My older clippers have a small file with a way that the end of the clipper fits into this and does not move around.</li>
            <li> It seems like it will last a lifetime … as long as I don&#x27;t loose it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m VERY used to doing the \\&quot;double clip\\&quot; on a single clipping because the clippers I&#x27;m using wouldn&#x27;t clip through my thick nail.</li>
            <li> Mind you, my nails are very thin and they tear easy.</li>
            <li> These are a lot sharper than other nail clippers we have purchased in the past and do a great job of cutting the nail.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised (and knocked a star off because of it) that these clippers didn&#x27;t have a little flip-out nail file.</li>
            <li> Other clippers tend to already be dull on one side forcing you to use the other to perform a clean clipping.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend these, especially for those of you out there like me with unusually hard nails.</li>
            <li> As advertised, this clipper is very sharp but is larger than most clippers, does not open as wide as some clippers and therefore is abit clumsy &amp; less maneuverable than some other clippers.</li>
            <li> I always hated cutting my nails since clipping my nails meant me struggling with cutting down perfectly to the right length while trying to put as much pressure as possible to make a clean cut.</li>
            <li> leaves my nails sharp and rough, difficult to use, went back to the $2.00 drug store clippers, way better and cheaper</li>
            <li> Their also sharp as hell, I mean so sharp that you&#x27;ve got to be careful not to cut yourself or your cuticles cause it would be really easy to do.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to describe, really.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s hard to describe, really.</li>
            <li> Then you realize how much those cheapo clippers flex, how they cut leaving a jagged edge, and how dull there blades are.  </li>
            <li> The edges on this clipper are so sharp, it takes about half the “normal” pressure to trim your nails.</li>
            <li> Regular clippers would really have a tough time with my nails and often leave me unsatisfied with how they left my fingernails.  </li>
            <li> Eventually they got dull but they had lasted a long time and done very well.</li>
            <li> Sharp, crisp cutting right through the nail.</li>
            <li> silicone based buffer were the top lever and the cutting element meet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be better off cutting my nails with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one feels sturdy and doesn&#x27;t have the shiny slippery coat that makes those cheap ones useless.</li>
            <li> I bought it for Scuba diving, instead of carrying a knife (dangerous and many dive boats don’t allow knives.)</li>
            <li> It does provide more leverage when cutting.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong, well, the strategy is sound, but virtually all the clippers I would buy were pieces of</li>
            <li> The fingernail clipper is at least five times more expensive than others, maybe ten times more expensive.  </li>
            <li> A few types: 420 series, 440, AUS-6, 8, 10 (Japanese), ATS-34 (Japanese), 154-CM (American), and so on.</li>
            <li> I mentioned in a review I did for Seki Edge Toenail clippers that I had looked for a long time for a product that didn&#x27;t feel like junk to me.  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s the long version:  </li>
            <li> No tugging, no uneven cuts unless you cut them unevenly.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t have to buy another pair for a long time.  </li>
            <li> the one relatively minor annoyance is that they squeak because of the metal rubbing on metal at the hinge.</li>
            <li> I recognized this for a long time and sought a workaround by purchasing a fifty dollar, yes you read correctly, a fifty dollar nail</li>
            <li> This was a mistake as they did not cut well and left my nails rough.</li>
            <li> They are a bit smaller than I expected though.</li>
            <li> No built-in file is really strange, too -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange gift</li>
            <li> + year old, made-in-USA one we lost a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent $14 on a fingernail clipper, but you definitely get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it is harder to manipulate and to get under the nail for those who keep their nails short.  </li>
            <li> a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I wish I had ordered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> I wish I had ordered it a long time age.</li>
            <li> These minor setbacks still don&#x27;t keep this from a 5 star rating though.</li>
            <li> And your finger/toenails aren&#x27;t going to stop growing any time soon, so it&#x27;s an investment that will pay off for a long time to come.&lt;br</li>
            <li> long woed being unable to clip my nails and play guitar comfortably immediately afterwards.</li>
            <li> Cut straight through my thick man nails.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp compared to the simple/cheap convenient store type clippers so be careful the first few times using these.</li>
            <li> One of the regular mundane personal hygiene chores that we all face is to keep our nails trimmed.</li>
            <li> I have previously owned some higher end nail clippers in the past which to compare it to.  </li>
            <li> The metal is such low quality that any significant encounter with water gets them rusting like crazy.  </li>
            <li> The cutting edge is sharp, the tool is weighty and bigger than regular clippers so it is easy to hold and ergonomic&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last as long as some of the other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
            <li> Sharp points but not sharp enough blade for cutting cuticles cleanly.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the lever moves so smoothly that it takes a few tries to get the correct grip down, to keep the lever centered, especially when using your non-dominant hand.</li>
            <li> Time will tell, though on the other hand as mentioned you could simply buy multiple cheaper clippers for the same price, and have them stashed all over and move on to the next pair when they got loose or seemed less sharp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;They are a little more expensive that I&#x27;m used to paying, but based on the reviews I thought I would give them a try.</li>
            <li> when I left them on my bathroom counter the other day.</li>
            <li> This clipper is sharp and so well made that it is a completely different experience to cut your nails.</li>
            <li> The only problem is I need to file my nails afterwards because it leaves a lot of sharp edges, but I do that all the time, so I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> , the blades must be sharp and properly aligned.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so sharp and its such a difference to what I&#x27;m use to with the $1 clippers you can buy at walmart/target.  </li>
            <li> the blades are sharp enough to require some care while clipping.</li>
            <li> The only catch is that it&#x27;s so sharp</li>
            <li> The blades are so sharp, they quietly glide through..</li>
            <li> You also have an equal chance of getting a defective (or improperly sharpened) unit from ANY other brand, that&#x27;s what the warranty is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If my nails leave marks, they are too long!)  </li>
            <li> It is sharp and sturdy and I have recommended it to several people (who&#x27;da thunk?).</li>
            <li> They are only open a little bit</li>
            <li> The edges are so sharp that you could actually clip your nails without needing to file them afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had maybe ten pairs in my life by other brands...</li>
            <li> It actually cuts the nail with sharp edges instead of smashing through it with blunt edges like the rest.  </li>
            <li> You will eventually get used to it but is somewhat different then all other types of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really weird getting so excited about a fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li> If there&#x27;s a problem, its that the blade is too sharp, but nobody buys a Corvette and complains its too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, actually using it.</li>
            <li> Seki Edge makes a range of cuticle cutter and other hardware that each does a specific job.</li>
            <li> Sharp enough that you should file your nails after.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get the same sharp edge on my nails after clipping like I do with these.</li>
            <li> These seem to be made extremely well, although I only just received them.  </li>
            <li> I understand it’s just a pair of finger clippers and its sounds lame that I get excited about these, but</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t like these because they make my nails too sharp.</li>
            <li> Probably sharp enough to do toenails but not recommended.</li>
            <li> I have not had my pair very long.  </li>
            <li> When you try to buy nail clippers in a store, you find either really expensive sets, which I never buy, because I am cheap, or modestly priced, but very shoddy, and not sharp at all ones.</li>
            <li> Very sharp which makes cutting your nails very easy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like cutting toenails anyway, but when I have to do it, I want my clipper to be comfortable in my hand and above all</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone who finds the cheap stuff just isn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> If my previous nail clippers have lasted as long as they have, I expect this one to last as long or longer.  </li>
            <li> They are very sharp and well made, and you know they will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> , I can&#x27;t point to a single downside.  </li>
            <li> thought about deducting a single star since these do not seem to trim hangnails as effortlessly.</li>
            <li> (my prior clippers would occasionally have a hard time clipping my nail entirely</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of using cheap, dull clippers.  </li>
            <li> You might think the lowly task of clipping your nails (or your cat&#x27;s nails, believe it or not) is not worth thinking about.  </li>
            <li> They are definitely sharp and cut with ease, but they don&#x27;t leave my nails smooth unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 starts because it does the job BUT not worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> Is not as sharp as my old one and has an uneven edge.</li>
            <li> It is so sharp that you have to be careful it is properly positioned before you pinch</li>
            <li> A bit small for adult finger nails.</li>
            <li> I would suggest going with the toenail cutter even for your hands if you have average or larger hands.</li>
            <li> Upon closer inspection it seems the sharpened jaw of the clippers top and bottom edge are not aligned properly which is either just poor quality control or poor craftmanship,</li>
            <li> This item appears to cut very, very sharply and probably very long lasting.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t loose the Seki Edge.</li>
            <li> just don&#x27;t loose them</li>
            <li> was almost as much fun throwing out the old nasty cheap clippers as using this little masterpiece.  </li>
            <li> My thumb slips down the lever of lesser clippers, and I notice I don&#x27;t slip at ALL when using these.  </li>
            <li> ... actually too sharp for my taste!</li>
            <li> These are high quality clippers that will be appreciated by anyone who appreciates quality cutting tools.  </li>
            <li> I have long finger nail beds (and hard, as opposed to soft nibble nails).</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and actually \\&quot;cuts\\</li>
            <li> Makes very sharp cuts, even if they&#x27;re tiny.  </li>
            <li> It is still very sharp, though not as balanced as the bigger one, probably it has to with physics.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re plenty big, they are very sharp and they can handle tougher nails like mine.</li>
            <li> Seem to be very sharp and would recommend to anyone looking for such things!</li>
            <li> They are also very sharp so it doesn&#x27;t take any pressure to actually clip a nail.</li>
            <li> We bought some other clippers at the grocery store or drug store and they were awful - not as good as the old ones.</li>
            <li> This is like cutting butter - easy.</li>
            <li> It make cutting my grandson&#x27;s nails an easy process.</li>
            <li> I actually found them easier to use than the typical clippers.</li>
            <li> Possibly the ergonomic design and leverage needed to cut with ease contributes to a slightly bulkier product design compared to the cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li> And I have less peeling and breakage later</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hurt myself plenty of times in the past because of all the effort I&#x27;d put into the second and third tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Personally, I find the typical chrome plated, \\&quot;inexpensive\\&quot; nail clipper to be utterly maddening.  </li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations as it was smaller than my previous one which was a Trim.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It will surely last a while, but probably mainly due to the fact that I&#x27;d rather use my other clippers with a built in file. .</li>
            <li> However, surface rust spots after only having them for about four months or less.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased nail clippers for $.99 at one of the big retail discount stores.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was $10 less than the German pair</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised by the small size, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is sharp like a razor and it stays sharp for a long long time.</li>
            <li> Hope they stay this sharp for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Have had a pair of these a long time, still quite sharp.  </li>
            <li> That would mean I would have to order a new pair.  </li>
            <li> Since then my nails have been both very hard and very brittle.</li>
            <li> There are two narrow slots through which a small diameter chord could be fitted, but nothing big enough to support a chain or key ring.  </li>
            <li> There are two narrow slots through which a small diameter chord could be fitted, but nothing big enough to support a chain or key ring.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I miss from my .99 cent clippers is the little nail file.  </li>
            <li> I paid a little extra for these</li>
            <li> Their only weakness is they are a little slippery to hold.</li>
            <li> Wish the end was a little wider since is smaller clipper and the lever would be easier to control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other people&#x27;s toenails are like, but all my toes -- with the exception of my big toes -- have nails that are smaller than my fingernails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what other people&#x27;s toenails are like, but all my toes -- with the exception of my big toes -- have nails that are smaller than my fingernails.</li>
            <li> clipper works effortlessly, and because it&#x27;s made in Japan, I like to think this little nail clipper is the the culmination of thousands of years of Japanese sword making technology.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Tweezerman brand I have had in the past, these are not nearly as sharp.  </li>
            <li> Fits well into hand and cuts my tough nails very well.</li>
            <li> My nails are tough - and grow fast  -</li>
            <li> I hope they stay this sharp for a very long time.</li>
            <li> There are literally dozens of steel types and they differ in how they sharpen, hold an edge, rust, break and every other characteristic under the sun based on the alloys used.</li>
            <li> Even if they work well at first, eventually they do a poor job of cutting nails cleanly.  </li>
            <li> If I were to wish any improvement it would be to taper out the ends of the cutting edge just a bit to better reach those pesky little crevasses.</li>
            <li> You have to work a little harder to get short nails into the opening.  </li>
            <li> downside is that it&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> They have a little to wide of a span for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> I always had these dull old nail clippers and always ended up with split nails,after using that for a while my nais are healthier than ever.</li>
            <li> Cutting is easy and edges are sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t last forever as any cutting blade will dull with use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a bad habit like most people and I bite my nails.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve all used the cheap clippers from the drugstore and almost always find them disappointing.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;d broken at least 3 cheap drugstore nail clippers before i bought the Seki.  </li>
            <li> I was truly shocked to discover that there is a better way.  </li>
            <li> Cheap clippers crush the nails before eventually cutting and that makes a rough edge.</li>
            <li> I could see cutting too far with these as you wouldnt have time to stop when you feel pain because they are so damn fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they could stand to be a smidgen wider, but that&#x27;s not enough of an issue to take off a star.</li>
            <li> But even more disappointing is that the opening is so narrow that I have to fumble around just to get my nails into the slot.  </li>
            <li> That meant that I was unable to apply much squeezing force with my left hand.  </li>
            <li> Tired of the performance of the more common, less expensive fingernail and toenail clippers, we decided to buy a serious, top of the line sort of product.  </li>
            <li> So set your cut carefully.</li>
            <li> I bent and broke a few sets of nail clippers over the last few months, and finally sprung for these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle does not have a file and will not stay in place when closed.</li>
            <li> I have been looking forever for one that is closed to this one for years.  </li>
            <li> My Clyppi broke under abnormal circumstances, which was no great loss because they didn&#x27;t cut fingernails very well.</li>
            <li> not what i expected they leave my nails rough and jagged</li>
            <li> Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Finally, I found the Green Ball Seki Edge based on reviews.</li>
            <li> When it dawned on me that I was spending roughly 12 to 15 dollars a year on clippers.</li>
            <li> I spent a lot of money on manicures, but nothing seemed to help.  </li>
            <li> A bit expensive but very much worth it.  </li>
            <li> (in case you&#x27;re trimming your nails with wet hands, perhaps).</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> Money well spent, for a lifetime of use.</li>
            <li> They are heavy duty and seem reliable overall.</li>
            <li> Only thing to keep in mind is I used the cheapos to cut away dead skin around the nails every now and then.</li>
            <li> Between the products cost and the shipping I spent around $30 on this..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with my fingers slipping on them as some have stated here.</li>
            <li> I bought this item last May (2013) and am still having trouble adjusting to using it.  </li>
            <li> Careful you can cut your cuticles closer than you might want.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Clippers we tried would leave chipped edges, require too much pressure, have poor accuracy, etc.  </li>
            <li> Heavy and solid material.</li>
            <li> With this clipper I just make 2-3 cuts and finish off the rough edges.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback is the missing file/nail pick.</li>
            <li> The cutter is not contoured enough and the clip is too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used these a few times</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is not completely stainless.  </li>
            <li> Not really understanding what was happening.</li>
            <li> clipper is small (not tiny but smaller than average:</li>
            <li> It cuts when you tell it to cut...not slipping off the nail.</li>
            <li> My wife was pissed I spent $15 on finger nail clippers</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with regular nail clippers, you won&#x27;t have any problem with these.  </li>
            <li> Since it looked the same, I figured Seki had purchased Green Bell, so I ordered the fingernail clipper.</li>
            <li> Nails need to be clipped so they don&#x27;t have rough edges.</li>
            <li> its the size of a finger nail clipper but has a big enough jaw opening to bite thick toe nails.</li>
            <li> Regarding the sharpness of the clippers, another reviewer complained about them not being that sharp because they left such a rough edge on his fingernails.  </li>
            <li> My main complaint about these clippers is that they don&#x27;t have the little metal attachment for scraping the crud out from under your fingernails.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews are accurate in that it makes cutting any nail a breeze, but it cuts the nail so well that it needs to be filed afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was tired of having clippers that either crush and tear my nails or clip so straight that they leave sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not hooked on, it&#x27;s an actual rivet - and the play is very slight.  </li>
            <li> I gave it four stars only because it is a little small for my big fingers.  </li>
            <li> Really sharp and probably will stay sharp for a very long time!</li>
            <li> The cutting is easy, the amount of force needed to clip is so much less.  </li>
            <li> I originally found that the corners at the ends of the cutter blades were so super-sharp that they would snag my nail as I moved it along the nail while cutting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not a curved blade so that can be tricky to not have sharp edges</li>
            <li> These are sharp but they crack the nail leaving a rough edge.</li>
            <li> Hopefully lasts longer for the money spent and remains sharp.</li>
            <li> When they clamp down, the blade don&#x27;t match entirely, so when I clip my nails, it&#x27;s not a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I decided on the  Seki based on previous reviews, and being made in Japan vs. some other asian country with less dedication to quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are two things I often find problematic with nail clippers: (1) they get dull pretty quickly and (2) the mechanism to clip the nails doesn&#x27;t work too well.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the blades are set back a tiny bit, which makes it hard to cut my toe nails.</li>
            <li> You need to watch out because your nails will be sharp for the next few days if you don&#x27;t file them down.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise cutting surfaces.  </li>
            <li> The cutting edge did not fit under the nail easily.  </li>
            <li> you combine these two features it very difficult to get an accurate cut.</li>
            <li> Sharp, well balanced, and ergonomically formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The clippers are so sharp it leaves a sharp 90 degree angle at the end which bothers me.</li>
            <li> substantial, sharp as a razor and exact...used them twice</li>
            <li> I looked under a microscope and there is no burr or rise in the nail, but the 90 degree edge is sharp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pricier than other nail clippers</li>
            <li> My other clippers would sometimes break/crack the nail.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what they did different than the other manufactures</li>
            <li> These clippers out perform every other clipper I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> These stay sharp and get the job done.</li>
            <li> sharp works</li>
            <li> this sharp 90-degree edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2)</li>
            <li> it too fits well on your other finger(s) and stays put.  </li>
            <li> I could not believe how sharp they were .</li>
            <li> Extremely well made.  </li>

            <li> Well made and sharp.</li>
            <li> I spent the money on these!</li>
            <li> I purchased a pair about 2 years ago and they are just as sharp today as the day I bought them.  </li>
            <li> I know the $15 price tag is steep, but we&#x27;ve used them for quite a while now without any issues and they are as sharp as when I bought them.  </li>
            <li> over two years now I own/use this nail clipper and it&#x27;s still sharp</li>
            <li> Have been looking for a sharp pair for years.  </li>

            <li> I bought this item on the advice of some of my friends and after reading other reviews about this product.</li>
            <li> I would consider buying another pair to go in the other bathroom.</li>
            <li> After using this clipper, I didn&#x27;t have to file any sharp points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other nail clippers literally don&#x27;t always quite cut it.</li>
            <li> I THINK WE HAVE 3-4 OTHER NAIL CLIPPERS ACQUIRED OVEER</li>

            <li> If you are looking for a nail clipper that is sharp and sleek, then get this one.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could post this somewhere other than on the Seki Edge page, because by now you too have fortuitously stumbled apon this gem.  </li>
            <li> Nail clippers are sharp and stay sharp.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to trim your cuticles with these as they&#x27;re so sharp, you can cut yourself without even noticing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL</li>
            <li> This nail clipper leaves my nails jagged and sharp.  </li>
            <li> They are definitely a &amp;#34;cut above&amp;#34; the ordinary drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp.</li>
            <li> The blades are amazingly sharp and cut through my nails with ease.</li>
            <li> Well they do not come with a metal file that I usually see on generic clippers.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try the Seki&#x27;s based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp and durable feeling.</li>
            <li> A sharp improvement over run of the mill clippers.</li>
            <li> It blows all other nail clippers out the water...</li>
            <li> and I bought some other stuff from them.</li>
            <li> They come extremely sharp from the factory.  </li>
            <li> You will soon get use to them though and will never want to use any other type.</li>
            <li> In other  words it works as designed.</li>
            <li> But they aren&#x27;t sharp.. at all.</li>
            <li> no comparison to even other higher-end clippers.</li>
            <li> As an anecdote for how sharp it is, samurai use it to cut their toe nails.</li>
            <li> They are slightly larger than your usual drugstore type nail clipper.</li>
            <li> The edge is so sharp that it cuts without any burrs.</li>
            <li> these cutters are Sharp.</li>

            <li> am going back to small size nail clipper</li>
            <li> The other J.A. Henckels clipper is designed to catch nail clippings, and it works well,</li>

            <li> Sharp, cut well&lt;</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t imaging buying anything other than Seki going forward.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll also check out their other products.</li>
            <li> and it is still sharp.</li>
            <li> This is sharp and well made.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always wanted clippers that were actually sharp and the blades aligned and level.</li>
            <li> I keep my nails trimmed to reduce scratching and tearing up my skin due to eczema.  </li>
            <li> In other words, the Seki Edge Fingernail Clippers communicate thoughtfulness to the receiver.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve both gotten so used to them, we get made when the other sneaks them on business trips.</li>
            <li> The blades on this thing is REALLY sharp, and its designed that way to stop you from dismembering yourself.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and shaped to be easier to hold.</li>
            <li> However, this clipper leaves my nail too sharp.</li>
            <li> As in: dangerously sharp in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Even scratching an itch is a problem with nails this sharp.</li>
            <li> When you cut anything with a sharp tool, it leaves a sharp edge.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and seem to be of quality construction.</li>
            <li> I wish it had something to keep the cuttings from flying across the room, but other than that, this is probably the finest clipper you can buy at this price.</li>
            <li> Sharp with well aligned blades.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> Compared to other clippers I have used this one cuts easier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and it works well.</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I&#x27;m not a clipper connoisseur, but these things are as sharp as the samurai swords they claim to be associated with.</li>
            <li> They are so sharp.</li>
            <li> sharp, Not too curved.</li>
            <li> and yet they continue to hold up and stay sharp.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> it is extremely sharp.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the strength to squeez other clipper&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> This is because the edge of the nail is cut at almost a 90 degree angle due to how well the clippers clip the nail.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still sharp as ever.</li>
            <li> These are well made and really sharp.  </li>
            <li> These are well built and sharp</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp.</li>
            <li> Sharp and well aligned.</li>
            <li> just due to how well they are made.</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said, this clipper takes a while to get used to.</li>
            <li> Also, if you inspect a lesser pair, you&#x27;ll find a small overbite where the blades meet, even on the Victorinox - not on these.</li>
            <li> But the sides of the blade edge are so sharp I&#x27;m not sure if I have the actual blade or just the tip curve against my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact that I know that I do not have to struggle with low quality clippers (easily dull and misaligned blades and small design that is hard to hold and slips when given too much pressure) when clipping my nails gives me peace of mind.  </li>
            <li> but be careful, it is extremely sharp!</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s not too bad, just requires a little more time.  </li>
            <li> I deducted a star due to absence of addl extension (not sure what it&#x27;s called) used for digging into nail bed to remove cuticle.</li>
            <li> I wish the actual cutting area was a little lower on the nail clipper because it&#x27;s higher up than I am used to with other nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I agree with what some other reviewers have said that they are a little awkward to hold at first, but I think it is just an impression that takes a bit of getting used to and doesn&#x27;t actually affect</li>
            <li> The rear of the bottom part is wide and curves slightly downward so that</li>
            <li> I still don&#x27;t care what my nails look like, but holy cow after I got these my finger tips</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful not to cut too low, or at least I do, as these are sharped than the ones I had been used to.</li>
            <li> While nail-catchers are somewhat effective, I&#x27;ve noticed they always get in the way of seeing what I&#x27;m actually cutting (leading to poor cuts or overcuts).</li>

            <li> The moment you pick it up, it is cold to touch but quickly warms to your finger.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about these clippers is, the overall size is small and petite, and when I use them to clip my cats&#x27; nails they sometimes slip out of my hand, and I have small female hands.</li>
            <li> These are really well made and a solid cutting instrument .</li>
            <li> I am very frugal and hate to spend too much for anything.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t have a clipper nearby - or worse, if the only clipper is one of those that leave the edges rough and ragged - I end up picking at them, nibbling at them, and leaving a bigger mess.</li>
            <li> Very clean cut on the toughest nails.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The clippers edge made from secret family techniques, passed down to each male successor, taking an entire lifetime to master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you imagine being the manufacturer wanting to save a single penny (or less!)</li>
            <li> It leaves a fairly sharp edge after clipping, and you will need to buff that down a bit to avoid scratching yourself.  </li>
            <li> They are easy to use, unlike others that are almost painful to press down, and the clippers feel like quality in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have large hands and it is difficult to hold on to while clipping my nails.</li>
            <li> Or they&#x27;re sharp but leave the cut edge very sharp.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp out of the box and stay sharp.</li>
            <li> Does leave the nail a little rough</li>
            <li> Dull blades and flexing handles lead to imprecise cutting - they&#x27;re like a car with sloppy springs and shocks that make it hard to drive precisely and quickly.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have the typical metal nail file you find on other nail clippers.</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp, and they require much less pressure to cut the nail than the Revlon ones ever.</li>
            <li> I found the clipper to be ergonomically correct, and it is a little larger than the usual fingernail clippers that you will find in a drug store.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard these days to find a product that gets regular use that lasts, does its job well, and doesn&#x27;t cause dread or remorse when needed.</li>
            <li> will buy another pair of these if they ever go dull, which is not likely since the company use to manufacture samurai swords in Japan.</li>
            <li> It is hard to grip and requires several clips to do a nail.</li>
            <li> but they could possibly add to connection since they are cut together, the seam line inside is hard to find, and there is indention from the cut on both sides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got so frustrated using those cheap $5 fingernail clippers sold in drugstores and grocery stores  </li>
            <li> When I received it, I was shocked how smooth it clipped my nails.  </li>
            <li> Amazon shipped it with BLAZING SPEED for free, I was shocked when it arrived in my mail box.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with the nail clean-out tool.</li>
            <li> got four stars instead of five because i&#x27;m just not enthusiastic enough about fingernail clippers to ever give them five stars.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the money...</li>
            <li> I have average sized finger nail width  (</li>
            <li> Yes, it is, at least mine was and still is, even after all that time of regular usage.</li>
            <li> Folks may think it&#x27;s silly to spend so much on this.  </li>
            <li> It is a sad situation when you have to pay this much money for a fingernail clipper.  </li>
            <li> I am appalled that I used cheap ones for so long.</li>
            <li> Yes, we all should feel weird spending this much on fingernail clippers.  </li>
            <li> At least if you are a big guy.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint is there is no file/pick.</li>
            <li> Wow, it is sad that I waited so long before buying this.</li>
            <li> Good grief!  </li>
            <li> And I don&#x27;t even necessarily have thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We bought the 3.99, with a famous name attached, and it is basically worthless.</li>
            <li> Better than any Made in China crap.</li>
            <li> for my toe nails, I have had several pairs of clippers break while trying to cut my thick nails.</li>
            <li> As for the Seki clippers, the nails are just cut and they fall down.</li>
            <li> Then I have to file the nails down</li>
            <li> hands down the sharpest easiest you will EVER use</li>
            <li> These are the answer hands down.  </li>
            <li> Try this: hold by lever in &#x27;up&#x27; position, run an edge of the body up and down your finger and hear the ring.  </li>
            <li> So effortless unlike other brands!</li>
            <li> So sharp, in fact, that you might remove a little bit of skin and not notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and takes so little effort to do the job.</li>
            <li> These clippers are extreme!</li>
            <li> So sharp!</li>
            <li> It is SHARP!</li>
            <li> Those clippers are sharp!</li>
            <li> These clippers are extreme!</li>
            <li> far, I haven&#x27;t found a single thing wrong with these clippers.</li>
            <li> I invested in these because I was sick of cheap quality chromed drug store clippers.</li>
            <li> Clippers were MUCH smaller than I expected, tough for my big clumsy hands to hold...and do not come with a filer built-</li>
            <li> Finally a decent pair of clippers instead of the chinese crap found locally.</li>
            <li> As a result, and being disgusted with each of several pairs of more common drugstore brands, such as Revlon or Bates, I started looking for a fingernail version of the Seki.  </li>
            <li> Someone who has worked with blades a lot can tell you when a metal sounds soft and hard, and this sounds hard.  </li>
            <li> The other day my wife misplaced my nail clippers...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply put, they are very sharp, but</li>
            <li> Very sharp and well made.</li>
            <li> Very sharp cut.</li>
            <li> My only beef is they are very small.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp, well made, (I&#x27;d even say ergonomic)</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and you can clip your fingernails effortless.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and well made</li>
            <li> These are well-made, substantial, and very sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well built and very sharp.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp.  </li>

            <li> They are very sharp and cut well.  </li>
            <li> This clipper is very sharp and well made.  </li>
            <li> very sharp and durable.</li>
            <li> I purchased two pair of these and both are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp indeed.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews, my nails did feel a little sharp but nothing out of the ordinary when using other clippers.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, sturdy, and reliable.</li>
            <li> Very sharp as described and reviewed by customer.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> VERY sharp and a definitive \\&quot;click\\&quot; as it cuts the nail.  </li>
            <li> The J.A. Henckels Ultra-slim is a very slick product and is extremely sharp (maybe even too sharp), but it&#x27;s a bit too small for regular use.</li>
            <li> Cuts clean and my nails don&#x27;t peel as badly as before I started using them.  </li>
            <li> It wasn’t until I tried these Japanese clippers that I realized how bad my TRIM clippers really were.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hidden them from the rest of my family so they won&#x27;t disappear.  </li>
            <li> (that is with less force or pressure required).  </li>
            <li> These cut so well, that half the time I don&#x27;t have to file my nails afterwards.</li>
            <li> The sharper edge allowed it to cut using less pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers have already mentioned, these fingernail clippers are the bee&#x27;s knees.  </li>
            <li> One less curse word per week..</li>
            <li> It makes for an odd grip.  </li>
            <li> Takes half the effort to use.</li>
            <li> I had previously</li>
            <li> Hence, I was EXTREMELY pleased when I saw the Green Bell logo stamped on the bottom base of this nail clipper.</li>
            <li> They are slightly heavier (32 grams vs. 25 grams)</li>
            <li> my fingers away from the strings slightly...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t try to buy any at Walgreens or typical retail store.</li>
            <li> They couldn&#x27;t even cut a fart much less a fingernail.</li>
            <li> Anyway, don&#x27;t settle for less.</li>
            <li> Also requires much less effort.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I didn&#x27;t even know this was possible.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine less than six months</li>
            <li> The cutting on the other hand (no pun intended), is a little sharp and straight.  </li>
            <li> The cutting surface makes very clean cuts and goes through tough nails like butter.  </li>
            <li> I agree with a few other reviewers that the angle of operation is a little too steep for no reason to be so.</li>
            <li> These trim your nails easily, but leave you with a very sharp nail edge AND sharp points where you adjusted the clippers and clipped around your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find them to be weirdly weighted and difficult to hold because the finish is slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am hoping they will keep their edge, they have very slightly staggered blades, to avoid the two edges blunting each other in use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They aren&#x27;t bad they just don&#x27;t seem that special for that price.</li>
            <li> I would not use Amazon to ship anything to me again since the last several times they have done a very poor job of protecting the items that they have shipped to me.</li>
            <li> I really like that the cutting edge isn&#x27;t curved quite as much as other clippers, and that allows me to flush off cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY sharp little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Ordinary nail clippers pinch through the nail, leaving a rough edge.  </li>
            <li> There nothing awkward, even during my first use with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is silly to sell a clipper with stainless steel cutting springs which does not also have a stainless steel pin to hold the handle...  </li>
            <li> No more rough edges after trimming your nails.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this instrument, it was like cutting butter instead of nails.</li>
            <li> Second, there is no round hole in the base of the clipper to which to attach a chain or key ring.  </li>
            <li> Second, there is no round hole in the base of the clipper to which to attach a chain or key ring.  </li>
            <li> The clippers are very expensive but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Some cutting edges are so poor they won&#x27;t even cut cleanly through loose skin around the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cut nails have very uneven rough edges.</li>
            <li> I had purchased probably six different drugstore nail clippers over past year alone, but they were all relatively dull.  </li>
            <li> The cutting head is not wide enough.  </li>
            <li> They work but not cleanly.</li>
            <li> I think cost a few bucks less.  </li>
            <li> After years of being disappointed by affordable nail clippers, I finally found one that does its job well, doesn&#x27;t cost too much.</li>
            <li> The Seki clipper being extremely sharp there was very little bending of the nail which avoided additional stress on the nail and split.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not at all heavy, but they have enough weight to them to help cut those thick nails with very little effort.</li>
            <li> To remove them cleanly requires sharp nippers that can be applied to the base of the hangnail.  </li>
            <li> It is a little pricey</li>
            <li> how little effort is required to cut my nails with this tool.  </li>
            <li> Wish it had a little chain to attach to my key-chain.</li>
            <li> For me I got a little carried away in the beginning</li>
            <li> It gives them a really rough uneven cut, and is difficult to hold (slippery as it&#x27;s bare metal).</li>
            <li> I cut my little girl&#x27;s nails.  </li>
            <li> NOT fun!    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since there are 160 (and counting) reviews praising this little clipper, I will provide you some insight on what I don&#x27;t like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Eventhough it&#x27;s a little bit pricy, it&#x27;s just what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> They work with little effort.</li>
            <li> the little handle that you push does not slide around as you press it.  </li>
            <li> That makes this fingernail clipper a little easier to hold and operate.  </li>
            <li> I gave them a 4 because they could be a little longer for easier handling.</li>
            <li> you might consider something with a little wider head.</li>
            <li> but I find it a little too bulky.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricy</li>
            <li> I found that I didn&#x27;t have to keep clipping a little at a time to get everything even, or to remove a jagged edge.  </li>
            <li> They would also be a little easier to hold.</li>
            <li> The slightly dulled corners have no effect on the cutting ability of the blade as a whole.  </li>
            <li> The fingernail clipper opening seems to be roughly half a centimeter, and the toenail clipper opening is very slightly wider</li>
            <li> This seems a bit small after using their other product for a few years.</li>
            <li> A bit large and awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> Sharp, very sharp,  hardly any pressure needed to cut.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always a little bit of the nail that&#x27;s not smooth.</li>
            <li> Even the finger nails clippers are tough enough to use for toe nails.</li>
            <li> They are sharp, but somehow hard to position correctly, and the angle of the clipper handle seems odd.</li>
            <li> the count down to losing them begins!</li>
            <li> Not that lesser clippers fail because they come apart (not usually), but on a simple machine like this, connection points are just under the cutting edge and the steel in importance.  </li>
            <li> so we will never use another set of dull clippers again.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived as expected, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> The relationship turned dull, bitter, and biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t getting dull either after roughly 6 months of weekly use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be curious if they maintain the sharpness or eventually go dull.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent more than what I paid for these buying horrible clippers that I toss in the recycle bin.  </li>
            <li> Cutting is faster and easier and gives a much smoother edge.  </li>
            <li> It really does feel like I&#x27;m cutting my nails with Samurai Swords.  </li>
            <li> I can imagine that there are finer clippers out there, but for cutting my finger nails these work very well.</li>
            <li> It has a lever arm mechanism that actually fits a man&#x27;s hand, does not slip or tip over, and exerts the proper cutting pressure.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait to get a few pair of these, buy them now.</li>
            <li> I always need to file the edge and the end result is not a smooth looking or feeling as I would like.  </li>
            <li> These nail clippers are made by a company called Green Bell.</li>
            <li> Uneven edge.</li>
            <li> Have had for a few years and has not dulled.  </li>
            <li> Sorry that I didn&#x27;t spring for this purchase far sooner.</li>
            <li> that was a waste.  </li>
            <li> And conversely, if I&#x27;ve temporarily misplaced these, my &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; clippers, I have an immediate sense of relief once I find and use these &amp;#34;A Team&amp;#34; ones again.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re made from heavy duty steel, and they feel it.  </li>
            <li> One reviewer commented they were heavy.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t speak for how well they&#x27;ll work in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stop trying to save a few bucks and get these clippers.</li>
            <li> It was not comfortable in our hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lastly, quality: When you feel these in hand, they feel heavy and like a quality tool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Seki fingernail clipper for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> We recently misplaced ours and are eagerly awaiting the replacement.</li>
            <li> Until you get a quality Nail Clipper you do not know what you&#x27;re missing.  </li>
            <li> These are not cheap at all</li>
            <li> /&gt;:::::::: updated&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that bother me about this</li>
            <li> I use these to cut my nails and those of my children (age 4 &amp; 7) and have always cut our nails with ease and without trouble.</li>
            <li> Thinking on getting a few of these, hide in a guitar case, chain to an amp.</li>
            <li> (I got snarled one time in old line wrapped around a coral head, scary</li>
            <li> ordered another for my wife, and I will probably gift a few of these to friends and relatives.  </li>
            <li> and then they are missing when I need one.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t realize how poorly those clippers you get in the big box stores are until you try something like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these a few times since I got them from Amazon</li>
            <li> The metal is not comfortable.  </li>
            <li> something I have trouble with.  </li>
            <li> no rusting after a few days in damp shower kit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Given that people&#x27;s priorities do vary, there are a few product details you should consider before purchasing ...</li>
            <li> that people&#x27;s priorities do vary, there are a few product details you should consider before purchasing ...</li>
            <li> You have no idea what you&#x27;re missing out on.</li>
            <li> Which sounds like I need a life, except who has time to waste filing your nails afterwards.  </li>
            <li> No jagged edges left behind.</li>
            <li> They are aligned well, which eliminates the spurs and uneven spots.</li>
            <li> However, after a few weeks we noticed that our nails kept breaking.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend had misplaced them, so, I ordered another.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Hasn&#x27;t dulled in the few months</li>
            <li> I bought then when my $2 pair kept giving me uneven cuts.  </li>
            <li> have always had a problem keeping my nails trimmed as I hate the feeling of cheap clippers trying to force their way through my nails.</li>
            <li> Heavy and feels well-made.</li>
            <li> Expensive clippers work much better, but I hate paying the extra money.  </li>
            <li> Granted, they are expensive as far as nail clippers are concerned, but you get what you pay for here.  </li>
            <li> When I Googled Green Bell to order a set for my grandson the name Seki came up instead.</li>
            <li> They are surprisingly heavy, but</li>
            <li> Once again though, not a huge deal, I just use a file to make them shorter and to get rid of the jagged edges.     </li>
            <li> These are not accurate measurements that I have taken, rather estimates.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clippers, very little effort required to use.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> Very sharp!</li>
            <li> Within the past two years, I lost one set due to rust (kept it in the bathroom), one set to the clipper breaking (the metal part snapped in two!), and one because I lost it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...</li>
            <li> It cuts well and it is very sharp !</li>
            <li> These clippers are weighty and very sharp!</li>
            <li> i other nail clipper was getting dull and had this annoying squeak sound to it.</li>
            <li> I was buying the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; and most expensive clippers I could find and disappointed every single time.</li>
            <li> However, the blade is just ever so slightly misaligned on one of the leading edges which causes it to leave a small burr with each snip that results in the need for a nail file after I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> So sharp and doesn&#x27;t get dull.</li>
            <li> They are dull, send nails flying all directions, and leave my nails with sharp edges.</li>
            <li> I had bought a couple of other nail cutters, all were either dull or break the nails.</li>
            <li> I bought these nail clippers after two or three different pairs of Revlon nail clippers got me mad enough to punch a baby.</li>
            <li> RMA date is past 3 months, so I am slightly disappointed that I won&#x27;t be using this product, as the lack of a clean cut hurts my nails.</li>
            <li> The base on these is significantly longer than the lever.  </li>
            <li> If it came with a leatherette case to tame the thumb lever I would have no problem giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> It is a little small for toe nails</li>
            <li> These are solid and well-made, yet their size and heft make them even less desirable given their mediocre performance.  </li>
            <li> so it is sometimes hard to get the tip down to clip.</li>
            <li> The clippers did not leave any jagged edges, and they did not become trapped between clippings that usually result in a tear.</li>
            <li> There are a few things that I am not sure about.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of trouble with hangnails, which are little torn pieces of hard skin along the corner of the nail.  </li>
            <li> It is very sharp, but the shape of my fingernails means that it is hard for me to cut close to the outer edges of the nail.  </li>
            <li> the blades were dull after LESS than one year.</li>
            <li> start to go dull or break after a year or less.</li>
            <li> start to go dull or break after a year or less.</li>
            <li> But the thickness of the cutting edges and the standard size of the edge make no real improvement over the inexpensive clippers that you can get anywhere.</li>
            <li> parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: there is NO fingernail file built into your clipper (which I never use anyway) and also NO round hole in the base of the clipper (to attach a chain or key ring - which again, I have never</li>
            <li> We were getting frustrated at the poor quality of nail clippers available out there.</li>
            <li> I got to go against the vox populi on these clippers, though my problem isn&#x27;t the same as the ones I see in some of the other bad reviews (my top/bottom match, the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; are plenty sharp, etc.)</li>
            <li> this can get a little bulky sometimes and hard to make finer cuts.  </li>
            <li> We have always used the clippers we got from Target or some local drug stores and after a few uses they become dull so instead of cutting the nails all the way through they leaves sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> Very little pressure was needed.  </li>
            <li> These clippers cut clean with no force, in a cold and eerie way.</li>
            <li> It is heavy and clips hard, and I cut into my skin/cuticle</li>
            <li> It took me a while to decide to buy such expensive clippers.  </li>
            <li> Obviously, this product is outrageously expensive for what it is.</li>
            <li> It is too small.</li>
            <li> I usually like all things Japanese-manufactured, so</li>
            <li> Comparable to an expensive clipper we had purchased in Japan but subsequently lost.</li>
            <li> It seems like every time I spend a small fortune on these types of tools, my daughters come over and when I need them, they have walked off all by themselves.</li>
            <li> The Seki makes it difficult to cut your nails very short.  </li>
            <li> The price is way overboard.</li>
            <li> The component that usually fails on cheaper clippers - the &amp;#34;pin&amp;#34; attaching the lever handle to the spring bottom - seems rock solid.</li>
            <li> I have collection of nail clippers acquired over the past 5 years.  </li>
            <li> The blades are not aligned well and poorly finished, leading to a rough cut.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what the two slots on the edge of the handle are for</li>
            <li> Having failed to locate one in a stick store, I finally found the product online and ordered two.  </li>
            <li> They were a bit on the expensive side, but the reviews had me intrigued enough to take the plunge.  </li>
            <li> No more tears</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re not sure what to get.</li>
            <li> While the Edge could cut them, I had to do it in small pieces and those can go flying without some preventative care to avoid getting shot in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are almost the size of the small travel size nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Too small for</li>
            <li> /&gt;Why is it that manufacturers today think they should make cheap, cruddy products instead of investing in quality materials and workmanship?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve cycled through in the past.</li>
            <li> Something so ordinary like nail clippers, why write a review?</li>
            <li> Wish they would add a small pouch to keep them in.  </li>
            <li> No more ripping, tearing or jagged nails.</li>
            <li> No more cheapo clippers from Revlon etc.  </li>
            <li> As far as clipping - I&#x27;m a guy so for me to say this means something - they are nail cutting nirvana.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what else can be said, its a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I did not return it as its too cumbersome and too small a product to return.  </li>
            <li> Unless you have particularly small fingernails</li>
            <li> This is an issue which, in the past, would leave me with sore tips for a day or two thereafter.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several clippers in the past year and they were either too difficult to maneuver or they just shredded my nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a number of \\&quot;premium\\&quot; nail clippers in the past.  </li>
            <li> Have been using it for the past year</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small size.  </li>
            <li> I have small hands</li>
            <li> If you hate nail clippers and just want them to work, these are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I was always buying and losing terrible drug store clippers and knew there had to be something better even though I know nothing about clippers</li>
            <li> After purchasing clippers at the local drugstore, we were disappointed that they left ragged edges and required a lot of pressure to cut the nail.  </li>
            <li> I was going to buy the small baby cliippers for my daughter&#x27;s nails but didn&#x27;t like that it had a catch for the nails.</li>
            <li> No more lttle  shards of nails after clipping.</li>
            <li> I did a search of the internet and was not able to beat the price I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical initially.</li>
            <li> Looks is all it has in common with the Green Bell clipper.</li>
            <li> It leaves small dents on the nail and doesn&#x27;t come with a file.</li>
            <li> The last 4-5 clippers we&#x27;ve owned have been dull, ripping rather than cutting the nail, and break quickly due to crummy manufacturing.</li>
            <li> The base is wide so that your other fingers have enough space to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are no better or worse than any other I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> Very few products that I buy exceed my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit that, after reading all the positive reviews, I&#x27;m fairly disappointed in these.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the cutting edge was a little bit wider.</li>
            <li> I came to the conclusion, the drugstore clippers and the manicurists professional nail nippers were dull and kept the split from healing by bending and contorting the nail during the cutting process.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is also pretty expensive!!</li>
            <li> The cutting edges are a bit narrow for toes or larger fingers</li>
            <li> Having to struggle to clip a nail or deal with a hangnail is second only to stubbing my toe on the chart of things that make me hate living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a result, its cuts are not very clean and it handles hangnails poorly.</li>
            <li> you want small clippers these would be hard to beat from a quality stand point.</li>
            <li> If you ever lose it and need to use a &#x27;normal&#x27; clipper you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time.</li>
            <li> A wide opening to accomodate thicker nails and a Sharp cutting edge.  </li>
            <li> These are expensive nail clippers and as soon as you pick up the product you can tell you will have them for a long time because of the quality materials.</li>
            <li> One of the nastier things in the world is a clipper that isn&#x27;t sharp enough; your nail suddenly bends and it&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I found a pair of very expensive nail clippers made by a German knife company, and they became my prized possession.  </li>
            <li> so they are not suitable for clipping my thick toenails, so I&#x27;ve ordered the toenail clippers also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will hardly need to press on the lever to cut your nails.</li>
            <li> His nails are so hard...  </li>
            <li> For years I settled for dull, hard to handle, cheap-o finger nail clippers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> No longer did I feel like I was \\&quot;tearing\\&quot; my fingernails as opposed to clipping as with dull drug-store clippers.  </li>
            <li> I could hardly believe the difference that these made.</li>
            <li> You hardly have to push at all</li>
            <li> Hard to beat that.  </li>
            <li> I have been buying and tossing fingernail clippers for years as they get dull and tear the nails.  </li>
            <li> - my problem is that they are hard to position over the nail.  </li>
            <li> I have rock hard finger nails.</li>
            <li> So what I had were a lot of clippers that were dull or the metal would eventually break from the fatigue of being dull and the extra stress of cutting the nail with a dull clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That led to it feeling a little awkward in my hands and made it feel like it was harder to cut with precision than clippers</li>
            <li> but at least I can splurge on this clipper.</li>
            <li> They end up essentially ripping the nail instead of cutting it.    </li>
            <li> complaint is that the clipper does not ship with a carrying case.</li>
            <li> I have just one complaint with this clipper.</li>
            <li> For some reason, premium finger nail clippers just isn&#x27;t something we think about in life (at least, not me).</li>
            <li> Considering that the unit is constructed from slippery stainless steel, it is difficult to get a grip and squeeze without having the cutting jaws slip out of position.  </li>
            <li> That is when I thought I would at least give these a try.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not at the point of tearing instead of cutting, but they&#x27;re noticeably different.</li>
            <li> Works well for delicate and stubborn nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used clippers where the lever was roughly the same size as the base.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it feels like the cutting edge isn&#x27;t curved enough.  </li>
            <li> I found these after my last $5 drugstore clippers started ripping my nails instead of cutting them</li>
            <li> I was curious as to what an expensive nail clipper could do.  </li>
            <li> After this I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s no turning back.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve owned at least 10 pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li> I am sad to report I have absolutely no need for it.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing negative I can say about these.</li>
            <li> read one or two negative reviews, i think maybe they received the one in a thousand defective</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve carried a fingernail clipper in my pocket every day for at least 20 years.</li>
            <li> These are no different than cutting your fingers with a pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> and they honestly do not cut as well.  </li>
            <li> The cut through thick nails with almost NO effort, seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> and my nail is now thick.</li>
            <li> Buy the (cheaper) nailclippers to cut your thick toenails..</li>
            <li> These cut through thick, brittle toe nails in snap....</li>
            <li> I have thick nails</li>
            <li> I have thick nails and these cut through them like butter.</li>
            <li> I mean come on, at the end of the day</li>
            <li> If I have to use any other nail clippers besides these, they&#x27;re just sad by comparison.</li>
            <li> I mean steeper.</li>
            <li> No more filing after clipping, yeah!</li>
            <li> I recommend cutting a little less nail in the beginning until you get the hang of it (no pun intended).  </li>
            <li> It got really annoying as every several weeks I&#x27;d be filing them down with my glass nail file which took forever.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate cutting your nails then having to FILE them, because your nail clipper left them sharp, and worse, left them with jagged edges that catch on everything?</li>
            <li> This gives them a really rough uneven cut and makes it impossible to get the edges close.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the clipper model here is very small.</li>
            <li> No more disappointing trial &amp; error with other brands.</li>
            <li> I have quite thick nails, so nail clippers are always hard to press on, but with these it&#x27;s like my nails are made of thin paper.</li>
            <li> and I seriously have never used clippers that even come close to these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy another cheapo fingernail clippers, seriously.</li>
            <li> though they were admittedly all less expensive.</li>
            <li> May seem ridiculous</li>
            <li> It may well fail mechanically after a year, but that has not been my previous experience.  </li>
            <li> The cutting edges are very sharp, so clipping requires very little pressure.</li>
            <li> I am tired of clippers that are dull, dull, dull!  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no tearing, no raggedy edge due to dull cutting surfaces, no squeezing with all of your might just to get all the way through the nail ...</li>
            <li> have very thick thumb nails, and I&#x27;ve always struggled when clipping these tough nails in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to bang up those expensive little edges.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical of this product, but I had some money to burn.  </li>
            <li> Feeling a little guilty, when I saw the Seki clipper at a tempting price, I pounced.</li>
            <li> I essentially paid 5x the amount of a cheaper clippers for the same problem, and am very disappointed in the false advertizing.</li>
            <li> I was tired of dull clippers</li>
            <li> Dont let that be confused with dull clippers that squish your nail and leave it all ruined.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this a 5 but the cutting surface is a little small.</li>
            <li> They always left bad jagged edges.</li>
            <li> this cutter created bad cuts leaving big burrs everywhere</li>
            <li> Be careful though, if you are just going crazy with your clippings, you might get some skin.</li>
            <li> Not a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly as good</li>
            <li> These clippers are not good.</li>
            <li> Even my daughter&#x27;s nails (age 4) were sharp after cutting with the clippers.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t crazy sharp.</li>
            <li> The cutting edges are extremely sharp;&lt;br /&gt;after</li>
            <li> Build quality excellence and sharp cutting with tearing off cuticles.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;blades&#x27; are also quite sharp, easily cutting through nails.  </li>
            <li> I will say the cutting edge was sharp.  </li>
            <li> Sharp cutting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve abused them on other things than I should be cutting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like some of the other posters who are obsessive about their nails and this was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you got hard nails like me, I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> how dull the clippers were that I&#x27;ve been using for years!</li>
            <li> Trust me, you will never own another brand after you try Seki!</li>
            <li> I bought it after being disappointed by ones at a local CVS that were extremely weak.</li>
            <li> works well no issues but not sure I&#x27;d recommend to anyone... too expensive...</li>
            <li> Even get through youngest boys thick toe nails!  </li>
            <li> and it was very hard.</li>
            <li> The one I got is very dull, unlucky purchase.:</li>
            <li> They were Revlon, and have stated the test of time, but over the years they have become very dull.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m accustomed to filing after cutting, but with this I need to do much less of that.</li>
            <li> Makes it seem like my previous clippers were cracking the nail apart while these are cutting.</li>
            <li> and I have ingrown toenails which can be tough</li>
            <li> Ergonomically well designed, these clippers simply make it terribly unattractive to ever settle for anything less again.</li>
            <li> They literally clipped my very thick nails away with ease, no strain, every clip going off without a hitch.</li>
            <li> All my nails are very thick - so the Seki has been tested.)&lt;br /&gt;-Blade geometry.  </li>
            <li> , all nail clippers will get dull and wear out, even the expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> It is a high quality cutting instrument, and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> With every clipper I&#x27;ve owned, I&#x27;ve always had to do the clip and pull method when cutting the skin around my nails when it starts to peel from cutting my nails very short.</li>
            <li> Stupid as it sounds, these clippers are terrific!</li>
            <li> Not great at getting in and clipping hang nails or the cuticle around the nail.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t just bend the handle about halfway up to make it nearly parallel with the base.    </li>
            <li> Are you tired of things that just don&#x27;t do what they are supposed to?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend these to anyone that&#x27;s looking to ditch their old, cruddy nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I assumed that nail clipping was just something annoying that everyone had to put up with, but it turns out the process can actually be effortless--</li>
            <li> but I hate actually doing them</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I got tired of having the clipper handle pop off the body when you rotate them.  </li>
            <li> I do not have thick or difficult nails.  </li>
            <li> Not to be confused with Seka.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of the el-cheapo $1.99 variety.</li>
            <li> I will use it but not entirely happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for some time and they haven&#x27;t dulled or broken in any way.  </li>
            <li> This thing could cut off a 2 millimeter thick grandma toenail that had been getting stale for 20 years with no problem.</li>
            <li> This second clipper is literally a piece of crap.  </li>
            <li> Uneven cutting surface</li>
            <li> This is a secret in my house</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to describe what I mean but if you buy it, you&#x27;ll understand.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> Maybe I just got a bad one, but its pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a small distance, but it makes all the difference in the world for cutting.</li>
            <li> Ordinary nail clippers feel awkward when you use them.  </li>
            <li> The cutting head is on the small side.</li>
            <li> the cutting edge did not match, and the cut was not better than the $2 one from Walmart.</li>
            <li> It cuts the nail at an angle that requires you to use a file after cutting, which I have never done in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of bad nail clippers, leaving rough edges, that make clipping nails a tiresome chore.</li>
            <li> they usually notice if someone has dirty or unkempt fingernails - invest in yourself with this clipper.</li>
            <li> Sadly the vast majority of all the fingernail clippers out there are worthless piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First and foremost, the size of the lever relative to the base is a bit weird.  </li>
            <li> An annoying personal task is much less annoying.  </li>
            <li> My nails are very thick and difficult to cut.</li>
            <li> My nails are very thick and difficult to cut.</li>
            <li> I might file the cutting edges and make them dull.</li>
            <li> I hate to give these a bad review, because they are high quality, and I like that they won&#x27;t rust, and they cut well.</li>
            <li> bad don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worse than the random ones I get from drugstores.</li>
            <li> The clippers cutting edge that has what I&#x27;d describe as serious underbite.</li>
            <li> After all the hype, I was a little disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My toe nails got disgustingly long because I hated the clippers I had.</li>
            <li> I have to grind the edges down which I hate to do.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer had said, it may seem crazy to rave about a nail clipper but for those with tough nails</li>
            <li> You are paying for quality here, and I would encourage anyone frustrated by a dull fingernail clipper that has quit working to pick this up</li>
            <li> Which I always do anyway, so I dont know why the negative reviewers consider that a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the &amp;#60; $1 clippers from the store, but randomly decided to splurge on these.</li>
            <li> how lousy the ones I was finding in supermarkets and drugstores have been.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it beat the baby&#x27;s clippers to the door so the wife looked at me sideways when we opened it</li>
            <li> Needless to say the product speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> It is sometimes difficult to get around my toe nails.    </li>
            <li> These are on the expensive side in my opinion for nail clippers</li>
            <li> Nothing is worse than a clipper for your hands or your toes that break the nail instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it&#x27;s the tall face of the Seki that renders it a mediocre performer at this task.    </li>
            <li> (sorry for those who are squeamish).  </li>
            <li> If it were up to me, I would rate these 4.5 stars out of 5 because it is not absolutely perfect but close to it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I have weird nails..</li>
            <li> Cuts fingernails like butter, which is a weird thing to say about a nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I have some neuropathy in one hand which sometimes makes it difficult</li>
            <li> Please correct me in the comments if I&#x27;m wrong</li>
            <li> An expensive Brookstone clipper</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it appears my return date or</li>
            <li> Which is a weird thing I never thought I&#x27;d be writing.</li>
            <li> My nails feel like they have been filed rather than merely clipped.</li>
            <li> I know this is weird to say</li>
            <li> Before purchasing I was skeptical</li>
            <li> It was complicated to figure out how to use it..</li>
            <li> Some were from expensive kits.</li>
            <li> It makes it difficult to hold.  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I took a chance when I saw these Seki Edge clippers, and I could tell immediately I did not go wrong.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a weird request.</li>
            <li> I know that probably shouldn&#x27;t matter, but it just makes it feel weird to me.</li>
            <li> Seems unlikely that it&#x27;ll get wobbly too soon.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> These are expensive, perhaps 10 to 20 times the cost of drug store clippers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;I also find them to be weirdly weighted and difficult to hold because the finish is slippery.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I owned a pair of Tweezerman clippers as was not impressed at all.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very tough nails both hand and feet and never have jagged edges like all the others I tried.</li>
            <li> It seemed like no matter how much I spent on fingernail clippers, they were always terrible.  </li>
            <li> I also had trouble finding clippers that would work in my hands with some very bad nerve tremors.</li>
            <li> If you are tired of crappy performance and shoddy workmanship---BUY IT!!!!    </li>
            <li> I hate those stupid little useless files.  </li>

            <li> I also bought the matching toenail one which is equally disappointing too.</li>
            <li> for cutting, these take the cake.</li>

            <li> I purchased this because I wanted clippers with a longer cutting edge</li>
            <li> You must be crazy, or you must be hoping its one hell of a clipper.</li>

            <li> Why should cutting your nails</li>
            <li> These are made well, but the cutting angle makes it very difficult to clip my nails.</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> I just cant figgure out why an expensive pair of clippers cant have a NAIL FILE  !</li>
            <li> Expensive!</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, they are so bad they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have always been disappointed with drug store nail clippers.  </li>
            <li> Some may be disappointed that this clipper doesn&#x27;t have a file/nail-cleaning</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am disappointed with these Seki Edge nail clippers too, though.</li>
            <li> The reviews seemed to indicate these, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  </li>
            <li> But I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> My husband was so disappointed in all the clips he had.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hate when that happens because it is somewhat painful.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that crappy clippers were the reason I hated cutting my nails, but now that problem has gone from my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> stupidly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> The handle sticks up at a steep angle from the base.  </li>
            <li> So if you hate picking up fingernails everywhere after clipping, you might want to consider another clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> those are crap.</li>
            <li> Buy it if you hate clipping your nails.</li>
            <li> Unlike the crap drugstore nail clippers from China, these are hand-honed and finished in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I hate having to do that.  </li>
            <li> I would hate to lose them.  </li>
            <li> I feel like an idiot for spending almost $15 on these.  </li>
            <li> Come to think of it, I also feel like an idiot for spending time writing a review about fingernail clippers . . .</li>
            <li> I hate these nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I really hate drug-store nail clippers; they just don&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> Having bad luck with Seki finger nail clippers on Amazon!</li>
            <li> A real cutting of the nail.  </li>
            <li> I always hated using clippers, but then I had chemo &amp; radiation.</li>
            <li> will never buy another cruddy Wal-Mart/drugstore nail clipper.  </li>
            <li> I now look forward to cutting my nails each time!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed I&#x27;ve lost mine again.</li>
            <li> WRONG!!!</li>
            <li> Hey it sounds nasty but this is all part of the cleaning process!  </li>
            <li> The horrible nail clippers they sell in stores nowadays...</li>
            <li> and they are all awful.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how terrible unsharp</li>
            <li> I took a sledge hammer to one of the truly nasty \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; R*vl*ns.  </li>
            <li> Not even your worst enemy.</li>
            <li> After years buying the 2/3 dollars clippers I bought a really terrible one.</li>
            <li> I was using some terrible $3 clippers from the auto parts store checkout counter.  </li>
            <li> It was a shocking $29</li>
            <li> However, these are one of the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> What a piece of crap!</li>
            <li> But this &amp;#34;sharp nail&amp;#34; sensation is terrible.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who tends to clip my nails and tend to my horrible cuticles while watching tv and drinking beer......</li>
            <li> That feels horrible.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> best nail clippers I own so far, and you can tell it&#x27;s made with quality material</li>
            <li> The best fingernail clippers I have ever used</li>
            <li> Solidly build and does the job well.  Good to know some products are still built with quality in mind.</li>
            <li> Very precise, and easy cutting.  Except made for smaller fingers.  They need to make a larger size.</li>
            <li> The product arrived as advertised and on time.</li>
            <li> Are used to lose nail clippers all the time before I bought this one of my best purchases</li>
            <li> These clippers are worth the money. They slice through your finger nails nicely. Be careful though, if you are just going crazy with your clippings, you might get some skin. I have never used better clippers!</li>
            <li> Sharp and clean cuts. Really like it but wish it had a small pointed file attached as many fingernail clippers do.</li>
            <li> Short of a tiny lightsaber, I cannot imagine a more powerful tool for nail cutting. These clippers cut clean with no force, in a cold and eerie way.</li>
            <li> Fantastic -- best my husband and I have ever owned, &amp;#34;hands-down&amp;#34;. Love the Seki line...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always bought the &amp;#60; $1 clippers from the store, but randomly decided to splurge on these. They&#x27;re great! Super sharp and require much less force than the cheapo ones.</li>
            <li> Are you tired of cheap drug store clippers? Then buy Seki branded clippers. Even the finger nails clippers are tough enough to use for toe nails. The metal doesn&#x27;t bend and they seem perfectly balanced. Pretty close to salon quality or Better!</li>
            <li> Best clippers on the market.</li>
            <li> No negatives.  Just as described and it works perfectly without any noticeable problems or quirks.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this highly.</li>
            <li> ▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀█▓▒░▒░░░ PERFECT ░░▒░░▒▓█▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀</li>
            <li> The cutting jaws don&#x27;t meet perfectly. The jaws are about 1/10 of a mm misaligned. That&#x27;s a small distance, but it makes all the difference in the world for cutting. As a result, its cuts are not very clean and it handles hangnails poorly. For such an expensive clipper, I&#x27;d expect much better quality control.</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge is one of the best nail clippers that I have used.  There are two things I often find problematic with nail clippers: (1) they get dull pretty quickly and (2) the mechanism to clip the nails doesn&#x27;t work too well.  I did not see these issues with the Seki Edge.  In particular, the blade is quite sharp and the clipping mechanism works pretty well that you only have to exert minimal force to clip your nails.</li>
            <li> I want quality fingernail and toenail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;These are great.&lt;br /&gt;They cut easily.&lt;br /&gt;They cut smoothly without rough spots.&lt;br /&gt;Their design fits perfectly in my hand.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these Seki Edge clippers.</li>
            <li> Yes.  It cuts nails. And it cuts nails so superbly that I think I got a little too excited the first time I used it.  I just wished I hadn&#x27;t lost the damned thing already.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t imagine how good these are.&lt;br /&gt;Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> My main complaint about these clippers is that they don&#x27;t have the little metal attachment for scraping the crud out from under your fingernails.  They clip nails just fine though.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Comfortable thick lever makes this easier to use than standard clippers. These look nicer than most. But the proof is in the clipping. Snip. Straight through. No rough jaggies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has no file. With these clippers, though, I haven&#x27;t been filing the nails. They&#x27;re smooth enough straight from the clippers. With cheapo clippers, I&#x27;ve generally used an emery board anyway.</li>
            <li> After buying what I thought was good clippers at a beauty store to have them fail about 9-12 months later I called the customer service and they said they only expect them to last for 6 months so I was doing well.&lt;br /&gt;For 2X the price I tried these after reading the reviews and all I can say is WOW, these things are super sharp and the feel of the handle is superb.  Don&#x27;t wait to get a few pair of these, buy them now.</li>
            <li> The other day my wife misplaced my nail clippers...again...and out of frustration i purchased these Seki Edge stainless steel nail clippers and i must say, they were worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very sharp and the members are rigid, which means that they don&#x27;t yield when you hit the nail but shear cleanly though. I have big hands and therefore pretty wide nails, with some clippers i have to hit each nail 3 times; but these are wide enough hat in 1 or 2 clips the nail is neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> I set out to buy a &#x27;good&#x27; pair of nail clippers, and stumbled across all the glowing reviews of this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are a little more expensive that I&#x27;m used to paying, but based on the reviews I thought I would give them a try. I was not disappointed, these are amazing. The blades are formed from polished stainless steel, the handle from a brushed metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of design work went in to making these feel comfortable and perform well. From the ever so slightly curved blades, to the ergonomic styled handle with groves and indentations to ensure a comfortable and stable grip. These feel well made, and work just perfectly. Sharp, well balanced, and ergonomically formed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; They make a very satisfying noise when the metal blades close together. OK, so these are only nail clippers, and no need to get too excited, but it is difficult not to be excited about a product this good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so impressed, I bought a set for toenails too:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000SSDTOS Seki Edge Toenail Clipper]]</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I have ever used. Very sharp with great leverage and spring action to quickly cut your nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had mine for almost 4 years and ran into the first drawback... when I left them on my bathroom counter the other day. When I shower, the counter gets covered with moisture from steam, and the clippers formed some rust and stained my counter. It appears these are stainless steel EXCEPT for the bolt part that holds the assembly together...so here I am buying a new pair. Keep them dry even though they are advertised as stainless steel. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are professional clippers if there are any.  They cut perfectly smoothly and are easy to hold.  They never slip out of your hands or leave you with an incomplete cut.  I use them once a week for about 2 months now.  No difference in cut or feel.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY sharp little trimmer.  It also has a large enough opening for toe nails.    It should have some king of \\&quot;latching\\&quot; for the handle when not in use.  The handle can easily just slide off to the side.</li>
            <li> It really shouldn&#x27;t be hard to buy a decent nail clipper. Not that it&#x27;s the burning issue in my life, but it&#x27;s been bugging me for years how lousy the ones I was finding in supermarkets and drugstores have been. So I did some Googling. Found some $45 German engineered choppers that looked good, but decided to try these &#x27;cheapos&#x27; first. Very happy I did. These work. Like they should.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  It took me a while to decide to buy such expensive clippers.  These are fantastic.  I&#x27;ve spent more than what I paid for these buying horrible clippers that I toss in the recycle bin.  These give a nice clean cut.  They&#x27;re solid and will last a long time.  I&#x27;ve hidden them from the rest of my family so they won&#x27;t disappear.  I told them if they&#x27;re nice I&#x27;ll let them use &#x27;em.</li>
            <li> After suffering unknowingly for years with cheap fingernail clippers that mostly sheared off nails and required two hands to use, my husband bought this for me as a romantic birthday present.  Awesome!  They cut effortlessly leaving a clean edge, and I&#x27;ve been using it for all my nail-cutting needs (along with the occasional price tag removal) for six months with no slowing down.  I just purchased another for my Grandmother.</li>
            <li> Same with the Seki Edge Toenail clippers, these are the best I&#x27;ve used. They&#x27;re better than the Tweezerman clippers, because they&#x27;re sharper, and because of the molded grip on them.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clean cutting clippers, good quality, would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well on nails but not on hang nails and ty skin that breaks around the nails</li>
            <li> you know how you always wish nail clippers actually clipped your nails?  and maybe your cuticles too?  and that they don&#x27;t split your nails or rip your cuticles?  well... here you go.  These clippers clip clip clip and keep on clipping!</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. you won&#x27;t cut yourself, it&#x27;s just going to do the business it set out to do very quickly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;The action handle / lever is a bit long and causes me to lose a bit of dexterity over the smaller ones.  I imagine I will get more adept at using them over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you clip down, this will not struggle, it will simply cut right through.  So set your cut carefully.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than some other upscale clippers. Worked well. Son-in-law was pleased. Nice clipper. well made. Only downside is that it does not have a file if you need one.</li>
            <li> These are the best finger nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t say enough good things. I bought this for my boyfriend because he constantly clips his nails to avoid the habit of biting them. He says he had never used a better set of clippers. I used them too (even on those pesky thick toenails) and they work so beautifully. Clipped it right off like it was nothing. So pleased with these!</li>
            <li> Okay, so I don&#x27;t really drive an Aston Martin or wear a Panerai but at least I can splurge on this clipper. Ah, the simple and affordable luxuries that make the downturn in the economy a little more bearable. I don&#x27;t make what I used to, not by a mile but I can still afford items under $20!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When we were having nothing but trouble with the junky clippers made for infants, I went to Amazon and purchased every infant nail clippers listed: literally every single one (there weren&#x27;t that many). In doing my search I came across this clipper, read the glowing reviews and figured, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; Unfortunately it beat the baby&#x27;s clippers to the door so the wife looked at me sideways when we opened it and it was a \\&quot;gift\\&quot; to myself. I said, \\&quot;It&#x27;s ours!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the lead in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are manufactured by Greenbell of Japan, sold under the name Seki in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper really is an order of magnitude better than all other clippers I own. The next best clippers I have are Tweezerman, also in brushed stainless. But they just don&#x27;t rise to the level of these clippers. I really appreciate good steel and these must use it. The best cutlery steel is known to come from the US and Japan. A few types: 420 series, 440, AUS-6, 8, 10 (Japanese), ATS-34 (Japanese), 154-CM (American), and so on. There are literally dozens of steel types and they differ in how they sharpen, hold an edge, rust, break and every other characteristic under the sun based on the alloys used. I have NO IDEA what steel is being used, but this nail clippers is also sold under the Dovo Solingen, Germany INOX brand for twice the price. That&#x27;s a German branded company established in 1906, selling a \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; product, using Japanese steel. It&#x27;s as though they admitted that these are better than what they could produce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From an online source regarding the standards to meet as a Dovo product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The materials used in their manufacture include the tried-and-tested carbon steel categories C45 and C60; however, more than half of them are manufactured from non-corrosive stainless steel including at least 13% chromium and 0.46% carbon. In some cases, special alloys with a higher proportion of chromium or molybdenum are used. Examinations of the material, hardness, pattern and extent of grinding of the scissors are essential parts of the quality control process at DOVO, along with functional and optical checks. The \\&quot;Solingen quality\\&quot; is a minimum requirement for DOVO, which is fulfilled by the entire product range.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the Greenbell site:&lt;br /&gt;Greenbell was founded in 1968 in Osaka, Japan by Mr. Kiyoshi Ishida. Greenbell set up its factory in Seki Japan where it is world reknown for cutlery and cutting tools.

It is the generational transfer of experience and knowledge that has made Greenbell the gold standard of beauty and grooming tools recognized by the world today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers just go right through with that satisfying click that&#x27;s hard to describe, really. It&#x27;s not the same as with a regular clipper. They&#x27;ve also designed the leverage differently with these so you feel like you have much more power. It&#x27;s an odd feeling, as though your muscle memory is off from decades of using \\&quot;old school\\&quot; clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of curiousity I have asked the US distributor to find out what steel is being used in these and will report back if I find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who may be searching, I&#x27;ve discovered that Seki does in fact manufacture a baby nail clippers, not available on Amazon but available directly from Seki.

            <li> My husband always complains about his cheap nail-clippers that break after a few months.This one did the trick he says that now he is the happiest man alive. He tells me that not only does he use it for his finger nails but also for his toe nails. In fact he threw away all his old nail clippers and made a special box just for this nail clipper.Needless to say the product speaks for itself.</li>
            <li> Best clippers i&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li> This clipper is great! Cuts quickly with no mechanism flex. Made from stainless steel is a big plus and won&#x27;t rust in the shower.</li>
            <li> I always hated using clippers, but then I had chemo &amp; radiation. Since then my nails have been both very hard and very brittle. I bent and broke a few sets of nail clippers over the last few months, and finally sprung for these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, they are very sharp, but I don&#x27;t really like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have a nail file, but after you trim your nails with these you REQUIRE a file. These trim your nails easily, but leave you with a very sharp nail edge AND sharp points where you adjusted the clippers and clipped around your nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also find them to be weirdly weighted and difficult to hold because the finish is slippery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sending them back, because that&#x27;s a hassle &amp; I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s no such thing as an enjoyable nail clipper. And, I&#x27;d honestly be very happy with them if they had been half the price. But they weren&#x27;t, so I feel like the price is too high.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if I&#x27;m still using these clippers when I&#x27;m 85, I&#x27;ll feel like I got my $ worth out of them! Ha!</li>
            <li> Its great because it was way better then the previous clippers I had because this one was way faster and sharper.</li>
            <li> So great I ended up coming back to buy a second one (and a toenail version) - with 5 people in our house, someone was always hoarding it!</li>
            <li> Another top of the line product.</li>
            <li> I previously reviewed this item and loved it.  It was so easy to cut; I was quite impressed.  Now, after several months I am not so sure (and would like a reply or two from other purchasers).  Here is the issue:  the clippers cut like butter, much easier than anything I have ever used but, the cut invariably leaves a jagged feeling edge.  I always need to file the edge and the end result is not a smooth looking or feeling as I would like.  Have others had a similar experience?  If not, perhaps this pair is defective and should be returned.  Any help would be appreciated.</li>
            <li> These clippers get the job done. They&#x27;re sharp, precise, and comfortable to hold. Do yourself a favor, though, and buy more than one. Put one in every medicine cabinet. That way you can throw out those clippers you&#x27;ve had forever (but nobody can remember where they came from) and not be tempted to use the old ones just because these good ones are in the other bathroom.</li>
            <li> Love this clipper! Very sharp, and great quality of materials. Still was pricey though, you shouldnt have to spend so much just to get sharp clippers. The only thing I wish it had is a file. The clippers are so sharp it leaves a sharp 90 degree angle at the end which bothers me. But they do the job they are supposed to do.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are made in Japan (not China) and are made of high grade steel with sharper edges and better leverage than an average nail clipper. You nails will be cut noticeably more precisely and with less effort. You will hardly need to press on the lever to cut your nails. The result is your nails will look cleaner without jagged edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will cut your toenails as well. I personally prefer these over the regular toenail clippers since these are smaller and can cut with more precision than regular toenail clippers. These also have enough leverage to cut toenails with ease.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a bargain then I would stick to the regular nail clippers that cost only 1/3 as much. I never had issues with regular nail clippers. But then again, these clippers are clearly better and built to last and will serve me well for decades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried 15 diff clippers over 10 years; this is Ultimate. I&#x27;m one of the most pickiest people about nail clippers because I cut the dead thick skin too. Nothing even comes close to this clipper. If you have a better one, I want to know !</li>
            <li> This clipper is sharp and so well made that it is a completely different experience to cut your nails. It&#x27;s still a sharp edge to the cut, but it isn&#x27;t burred or rough like how less effective dime-store cutters leave the edge of the nail.    I bought one for the house and one for the travel kit, too. Since a clipper is used every few days, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I found these to be better than the \\&quot;cheapies\\&quot;, but less necessary than the toe nail model. I&#x27;m not sorry I bought them, I was just more impressed with the toenail clippers. I guess that finger nails are easier to cut for any brand clipper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every clipper out there, and this is the sharpest and sturdiest.  I had gotten used to buying clippers every time I saw them in any store, hoping to find some that actually cut my nails without tearing them, or without pieces breaking off the clippers, and now I can throw all those cheapos out.  These are identical to some Heinkels I bought and lost many years ago....</li>
            <li> Just like a nail clipper is supposed to be:  It is very sharp and actually \\&quot;cuts\\&quot; your nails...     Downside: Because it is very sharp, and not very wide and round (compared to the exact shape of an average human fingertip) it creates \\&quot;edgy\\&quot; rectangular cuts.  Still love it!</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are made by a company called Green Bell. They make AWESOME nail clippers. These clippers cut very well, and are very high quality. I would have given it 5 stars, however, after a trip to Japan, I found that Green Bell makes a ton of other models of nail clippers under a different Japanese packaging (it&#x27;s available at the Narita/Haneda airports, Tokyo Hands, and many of the local stores in Tokyo). After seeing the Japanese models with an integrated nail filer and nail catcher, it makes me wish this model had those features too.</li>
            <li> After all the hype, I was a little disappointed.  They are sharp, but somehow hard to position correctly, and the angle of the clipper handle seems odd.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and well made.</li>
            <li> Have used old, worn out or key-ring versions for years...  after tearing up nails &amp; fighting w/inferior types I bought these out of frustration.  Holy Smoke, comparing Seki&#x27;s vs the others is apples to alligators, it&#x27;s that pronounced!  Light weight yet substantial, sharp as a razor and exact...used them twice and it&#x27;s just simply a pleasure.  Pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> It seemed like no matter how much I spent on fingernail clippers, they were always terrible.  Regular clippers that you find at a department store are almost always made poorly and cheaply.  They end up essentially ripping the nail instead of cutting it.    The Seki Edge does NOT rip the nail - it cuts it cleanly and easily.  There&#x27;s no tearing, no raggedy edge due to dull cutting surfaces, no squeezing with all of your might just to get all the way through the nail ... these simply perform perfectly.  Easy to hold, excellent design and leverage means that you don&#x27;t have to squeeze them as hard as you do with a cheap pair.  I am so pleased with this set of clippers and I have no doubt that their quality construction will last me for many, many years.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Uneven edge. Returned it and bought the Deluxe one. That one didn&#x27;t cut and also returned that one. Having bad luck with Seki finger nail clippers on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I am 66 years old and have gone through a lot of fingernail clippers over the years.  These are by far the best!  They feel quite substancial in your hand, have a smooth mechanism, and are very sharp. I bought four pair and lost one to my wife after she used mine for the first time.</li>
            <li> I bought a pair of these clippers. I can understand some of the comments people make about having to file your nails after.  The clippers make such a clean cut that the edge is sharp.  I looked under a microscope and there is no burr or rise in the nail, but the 90 degree edge is sharp.  Even my daughter&#x27;s nails (age 4) were sharp after cutting with the clippers.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers mentioned, this is a well made and solid tool, feels good to hold and gives a solid snap when cutting. Does a fine job and appears built to last.    TH</li>
            <li> Ordinary nail clippers pinch through the nail, leaving a rough edge.  Ordinary nail clippers feel awkward when you use them.  The Seki clipper cuts cleanly and easily, leaving a smooth edge on the nail.  And the Seki clipper feels like it was made to be held by a human hand -- no awkwardness at all.  It&#x27;s a joy to use.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> After trying this, I&#x27;m never buying another brand of nail clipper.  It&#x27;s more pricy than most brands, but it is the sharpest clipper I&#x27;ve ever tried, and it is high quality.</li>
            <li> This is a really good quality nail clipper, but the nails are thrown far away so you need to vacuum clean after each use!</li>
            <li> Its Great GREAT GREAAAAATTT!!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this nail trimmer.  I feel that not only does it cut well, that it will last a long, long time.</li>
            <li> I am always on the hunt for the perfect nail clipper. Most of them are cheap and not sharp. Or they&#x27;re sharp but leave the cut edge very sharp. The Seki Edge one cuts your nail cleanly and you don&#x27;t even have to file it after because it&#x27;s not sharp/jagged like other nail clippers! I wish the actual cutting area was a little lower on the nail clipper because it&#x27;s higher up than I am used to with other nail clippers. It&#x27;s difficult to describe what I mean but if you buy it, you&#x27;ll understand. Besides that, it&#x27;s an amazing product. It&#x27;s pricier than other nail clippers but once you use it, you&#x27;ll realize it&#x27;s worth every penny. My friend has $50 nail clippers which are her favorite and I just asked if she wanted to try mine out and she did and loved them, so she&#x27;s ordering herself one too. It&#x27;s a great product and definitely durable and always gives you a sharp, clean cut.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best clipper I have ever used in my entire life. That may sound hyperbolic but I am telling it, it is 100% literally true.    Using normal clippers, I always find myself fumbling with them because of my big hands. And because I have thick nails, I have to struggle with normal clippers while trying to apply the considerable force necessary to get the clipper to cut through my nails.    This clipper is easy to hold, well-made, and slices through my nails like butter. No fumbling, no struggling, no cursing. This thing just works and works great.    For me, these are the best clippers I have ever used. I&#x27;m so glad I listened to the reviews.</li>
            <li> I have always been disappointed with drug store nail clippers.  Even if they work well at first, eventually they do a poor job of cutting nails cleanly.  A few years ago, I found a pair of very expensive nail clippers made by a German knife company, and they became my prized possession.  Then my kids lost them.  I have been looking for a replacement ever since.  And now I have found something even better--the Seki Edge nail clippers.  Every household should have several of these!!  And, the price is reasonable, when you consider that you will have these 10x as long as the drug store clippers.  Small things like this can make your life so much easier.  Indulge yourself.</li>
            <li> Great product. I&#x27;m ordering more for stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> Makes nice, clean cuts with very little effort. Would like to see a nail file with a nail cleaner blade. Maybe a keychain hole.</li>
            <li> This works great. Very sharp cut. You need to watch out because your nails will be sharp for the next few days if you don&#x27;t file them down. Should last forever. Works well on toes too.</li>
            <li> These clippers have the feel of quality that I notice when I both hold them and when I cut my fingernails.  They cut cleanly and, while expensive, I expect to get many years of use out of these fingernail clippers.  If you enjoy the feel of quality and are willing to pay for it, I recommend these as one of life&#x27;s little and affordable joys.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with these clippers.  The design makes them comfortable to hold and provides extra leverage for easy cutting.  Cuts consistently and cleanly.</li>
            <li> Obviously, this product is outrageously expensive for what it is. I bought it for the pleasure of using a superior tool. And it is superior. What I notice the most is that the entire mechanism is rigid, which gives a feeling of control. Normal clippers flex while in use, so that the two blades come together suddenly, releasing the spring tension in the flexing metal. The Seki clipper closes smoothly and predictably as you squeeze it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaint is that the clipper does not ship with a carrying case. So I am not taking it with me on travel. I don&#x27;t want to bang up those expensive little edges.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and performed as advertised.  Very sharp and cuts smooth!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have to agree the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Nail Clippers are the best I have ever used and I will never buy a cheap drugstore pair again!  They are stainless steel, not chrome plated with very sturdy construction with a great cutting edge that seems to stay sharp.  There are no loose or wobbly parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: there is NO fingernail file built into your clipper (which I never use anyway) and also NO round hole in the base of the clipper (to attach a chain or key ring - which again, I have never done).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see no reason these clippers would not last a life time of normal use.</li>
            <li> We purchased the infant Seki edge clippers and liked them SO much that we just bought the Seki Edge Stainless Steel clippers for me and my husband! These are the best! The nail clippers are actually sharp, thus not snagging your nail and breaking off the ends like the cheap grocery store brands. Trust me, you will never own another brand after you try Seki! The price is totally worth it since they last forever.</li>
            <li> I saw great reviews, and I saw those that said these break the nail. They are SO sharp that that they cut through nails as if they were butter, but the truth is they do leave you with mildly raggedy nails. I don&#x27;t mind using a file, but I find myself going back time and again to grab a file. I&#x27;m thinking these probably aren&#x27;t worth the price, given the ragged edges,</li>
            <li> The Rockefeller of finger nail clippers...  what else can I say?  You&#x27;re hard pressed to find anything better.  It cuts through my hardest nail like butter... and my fiancee&#x27;s too.  His nails are so hard...  I love this thing and am assured I will never have to purchase another finger nail clipper again.  Nor will I ever curse it for not cutting properly.  This is the best of the best.</li>
            <li> I thought for the price it would be more handy.  It is sturdy and sharp but my main criticism is that it does not open up as wide as I would like it to.  It is sometimes difficult to get around my toe nails.    Still not a bad product though</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers after my trusty 20+ year old German-made clippers finally succumbed to metal fatigue, and the cheap China-made replacements I initially bought just didn&#x27;t cut it (pun intended). I never really thought I&#x27;d ever pay 15 bucks for a pair of clippers, but these are heavy, seem very sturdy, and cut both smoothly and cleanly. I expect these clippers to last for several years, but even if they only last a few years, they&#x27;ll still have been a better investment than the crummy five-dollar clippers I&#x27;ll never use again!</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are made like a fine Swiss watch and are super sharp. The last nail clippers you will ever buy (unless you lose them) - look no further.</li>
            <li> I like these clippers because all the cheap ones I purchased in the local stores are not sharp enough to cut easily and without tearing (I always clip my nails just after the shower so that is not the issue).  These just cut right through the nail, well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well designed and pretty sturdy.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers available - stays sharp and works perfectly!</li>
            <li> If you want a complete manicure these are not for you.  If you want clippers that clip, get them.</li>
            <li> Nice design, and good stainless steel feel to it.  Very good at cutting nail, for a clean cut.  Not great at getting in and clipping hang nails or the cuticle around the nail. Overall a good look and feel to the clippers themselves, I just want a more precision cut outside the nail itself.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known this clipper existed years ago.  Very few products that I buy exceed my expectations.  This one truly does.  The nails trim easily and smoothly every time.  In fact, I don&#x27;t have to get out of the shower and immediately trim my nails for a good result.  This clippers are truly sharp and more importantly, leave a clean, crisp edge on the cut nail.</li>
            <li> I have just one complaint with this clipper. It is too small. I have large hands and it is difficult to hold on to while clipping my nails. It does a good job, but I believe it could have been made larger (my other clippers are all larger- but don&#x27;t last) and it would rate five stars.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned. I would have no problem recommending this item to a friend.</li>
            <li> I mentioned in a review I did for Seki Edge Toenail clippers that I had looked for a long time for a product that didn&#x27;t feel like junk to me.  It was the same case for fingernail clippers.  These clippers are the exception.  They are well made and function perfectly.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I just got the Seki clipper and did fingers and toes.  Very smooth action, easy to control.  The only thing I miss from my .99 cent clippers is the little nail file.  Sometimes you need to clean under your nails, or grind down that little edge that you can&#x27;t reach with the clipper.  The Seki doesn&#x27;t have one, and I find I miss it more than I thought.  Otherwise it&#x27;s a great nail clipper.</li>
            <li> These are very well made and work well. We liked them so much we bought another pair for use in our home.</li>
            <li> These are on the expensive side in my opinion for nail clippers but they are worth it. As others others have stated they actually cut the fingernails rather than smashing them or tearing them.  Definitely recommended and would buy these again.</li>
            <li> It works fine, not much more to say.</li>
            <li> I find the Seki Edge Finger Nail clipper ok. It does the job, I do not find it particularly easy to use. It is very sharp, but the shape of my fingernails means that it is hard for me to cut close to the outer edges of the nail.  I ordered their  scissors, but those had a serrated edge and simply \\&quot;tore\\&quot; my nails instead of cutting. Mind you, my nails are very thin and they tear easy. They also flare on the sides, so they are \\&quot;problem nails\\&quot;.  I assume for the average person this clipper will found to be more than satisfactory.  It certainly seems to be very well constructed and precise... just not for me:-(</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time.  It is superior to the cheaper models I have been using, and it provides a pretty clean (but not perfect) cut.</li>
            <li> like taking a precision tool to tree stumps (in the case of my old, gnarled toenails)</li>
            <li> had such high hopes for these based on the reviews, but they left a rough edge on my fingernails. i&#x27;ll keep looking for the perfect clipper.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut the nail clean.  My other clippers would sometimes break/crack the nail.  I am considering getting the toe nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Simply put, these are the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever bought. Before settling on this one, I tried a few others, which cost less, but the quality wasn&#x27;t nearly as good. This Seki version costs a little more than average, but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality very sharp</li>
            <li> I had always used the \\&quot;dollar store\\&quot; fingernail clippers and had just gotten used to having to search for my fingernails after they went flying through the air. I was just lucky I didn&#x27;t lose an eye to one of those things.    As for the Seki clippers, the nails are just cut and they fall down. I&#x27;m not sure what they did different than the other manufactures but it&#x27;s a huge difference in performance. I bought a set of tweezerman clippers at the same time as these and there is still no comparison. These clippers out perform every other clipper I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I got tired of repeatedly buying cheap nail clippers, and having their handles bend under the stress, so I shelled out for this one.  The handle on this one is like 5x the thickness of normal clippers, probably cast metal, and lets you apply full pressure without breaking a sweat.  Makes quick work of clipping nails!</li>
            <li> I love these clippers! I waited a long time to get them because of the cost--and replaced 6 other cheap ones that kept breaking or dulling to non-use status in the meantime.  These stay sharp and get the job done. The only reason I rated 4 instead of 5 stars is because they don&#x27;t have the nail file thingy that you can clean under nails with(a must with 4 kids, lots of dirt and dirty nails).    They&#x27;re rather large (larger than the little cheapy ones you can buy in the store), which makes for a better gripping surface, but kind of big to be cutting nails on little kids.  I&#x27;d definitely buy more of these, though.</li>
            <li> Seki Edge Fingernail clipper along with the toenail clipper is one of best items I have bought on Amazon. The fingernail clipper is sleek in design and is practical to the maximum. You can clip your nails with minimum efforts... This thing cuts through your nails like nothing can. I liked it so much that I ordered a pair for a family member.</li>
            <li> For years I settled for dull, hard to handle, cheap-o finger nail clippers. For some reason, premium finger nail clippers just isn&#x27;t something we think about in life (at least, not me). When you envision \\&quot;finger nail clippers\\&quot; in your head, what&#x27;s the first thing you think about? First, probably the function they give you (chopping off your nails)... and second... that they&#x27;re a cheap and common device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone has a pair of finger nail clippers... they&#x27;re ubiquitous. Even if you&#x27;re living off ramen and beer, chances are you or someone in your living situation has pair of finger nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How many crappy $1 finger nail clippers are there in the world? Probably millions, if not a billion. I&#x27;ve no idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently something hit me, I don&#x27;t remember what, and I decided to buy the best pair of fingernail clippers money can buy. Turns out they&#x27;re under $15.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingernail clippers I like mattresses... because you use them so often, it&#x27;s worth it to spend more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the first cut with my new Seki clippers, I was in love. Never again will I buy the cheap version of something I use so often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do it!</li>
            <li> These stainless steel clippers are the best.  Make neat, smooth cuts -- never leaves jagged nails.  Solid construction. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and precise.  Have had for a few years and has not dulled.  Liked it so much, I bought the toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> The handle does not have a file and will not stay in place when closed. It&#x27;s a piece of crap.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because the cheap nail clippers I got at home would no longer cut my hard fingernails. It got really annoying as every several weeks I&#x27;d be filing them down with my glass nail file which took forever. I saw good reviews on this product and decided to give it a shot. It cut through my nails with no effort at all! I am very satisfied with this product. The only problem is I need to file my nails afterwards because it leaves a lot of sharp edges, but I do that all the time, so I don&#x27;t mind. If you got hard nails like me, I&#x27;d say go for it!</li>
            <li> Having bought plenty of cheap-o nail clippers, this thing really blew me away. Maybe a little expensive for a nail clipper, but a great product and surprisingly sharp. The only way you will need to replace this is if you lose it. It&#x27;s built to last.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. My dad always had the cheap $1 store ones that broke in a week. I decided to get something better, and these are so fast, smooth, and sharp. You can cut your nails in no time, and with precision. Great solution</li>
            <li> This is a nicely constructed clipper.  It works well.  Is it that much better that the cheap ones at the drug store?  I am not sure if it works that much better to justify the price, but then again this is not a review of pricing.</li>
            <li> Best Nail Clipper Ever!</li>
            <li> Very nice clippers. These are the new favorites in the house.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a $1 fingernail clipper for about 5 years now and purchased this clipper to replace it. I first noticed the size of this clipper is slightly larger than an average clipper, but the advantages include a sharper clip, slick handle turning mechanism, and the aesthetically pleasing design.  A fantastic product overall, but quite pricey compared to a $1 clipper.</li>
            <li> I had not been happy with old clippers so I thought I would order a good pair.  Well, these were not the ones.  Ok for nails but I wanted it for skin too.</li>
            <li> This item is to normal nail clippers like a nice set of flatware is to a cheap set of flatware.  Sure, they both do the same thing, but the nice set lasts longer and you can actually get ice-cream out of the container without bending the spoon.</li>
            <li> the sharpest clipper at affordable price !  A must have !</li>
            <li> sharp works well, I wish it had a nail file on it to clean up after the trim</li>
            <li> This is a very nice-looking clipper, super well-made.  But.  And there is a but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, it doesn&#x27;t have the traditional integrated file thing.  So it&#x27;s just a clipper.  It clips really cleanly, with great feel, but that&#x27;s all it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe they thought having two features in one product would just confuse the user, but try again Seki guys and gals, please.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of drugstore nail clippers, they always seemed so cheap, rusted easily, and never stood the test of time. I bought this clipper based mostly upon the reviews, and I must say the vast majority of the reviews were right on target. This is an excellent, high quality nail clipper from Japan that I can see lasting for years and years. I put my order in for this about 2 days ago, and received it at the end of the 2nd day (I did not do expedited shipping of any kind, just standard.) Very pleased so far with how quick the product came and the product itself. The nail clipper works very well &amp; cuts sharply. The only reason I am giving it a star less is because of the fact that it kind of leaves jagged edges behind, which is not really a big deal seeing as I am used to the drugstore clippers doing that. I just use a file afterwords. Another thing is it doesn&#x27;t cut your nails very short like I&#x27;m used to mine being. Once again though, not a huge deal, I just use a file to make them shorter and to get rid of the jagged edges.     Overall, a great product that&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> As with many of my Amazon purchases, this was based on the highest ratings. I usually like all things Japanese-manufactured, so I thought, \\&quot;It&#x27;s the highest-rated and Japanese? Sure, I&#x27;ll try it!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received it the material felt cheap. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m just being picky, but for $15+ clippers (which don&#x27;t include a file) I expected something more solid. Nevertheless, I tried them out and they certainly cut better than my previous Revlons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. But for the price I expected, as mentioned, something more solid, and with at least a bonus file, even if that wasn&#x27;t the best built-in file in the world.</li>
            <li> As far as fingernail clippers go, this is one of the best. I&#x27;ve tried many brands and styles and this one&#x27;s a keeper. This one&#x27;s easy to hold onto as opposed to the generic shaped ones that sometimes slip out of your grip. Lastly, it&#x27;s sharp enough to do the job on the first try, but not so sharp as to clip your actual finger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always felt like nail-clippers are made from tin cans, they&#x27;re just normally designed to be as absolutely cheap as possible and it sucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are different.  These are well designed, they feel solid in your hand.  Their also sharp as hell, I mean so sharp that you&#x27;ve got to be careful not to cut yourself or your cuticles cause it would be really easy to do.  The cut through thick nails with almost NO effort, seriously!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, these are an amazing value.  Look no further, you&#x27;ve found your clippers!</li>
            <li> None better, first quality, top notch professional clippers. Well worth the purchase price, you get what you pay for with these.</li>
            <li> These are by far the sharpest best cutting clippers I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish they had a file/nail cleaner like most clippers but other than that I love them.</li>
            <li> Small but very effective.  Cuts clean and my nails don&#x27;t peel as badly as before I started using them.  My only beef is they are very small.  I thought they were larger when I purchased them.  Would never work on toes but do well for fingernails.</li>
            <li> They work but not cleanly.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s like a mini samurai sword for your badass nail</li>
            <li> Works great.  I bought one to try and have bought a couple more since because they work so well.  Super sharp blades and smooth clipping.  What else is there to say?  They are super high quality nail clippers that do what they&#x27;re supposed to do really well.</li>
            <li> I am a consummate clipper of fingernails. If I don&#x27;t have a clipper nearby - or worse, if the only clipper is one of those that leave the edges rough and ragged - I end up picking at them, nibbling at them, and leaving a bigger mess. My only solution is clippers that clip cleanly, leaving edges as smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind. These clippers do that.  I sometimes wish they came with a mini-file, but by and large, the clip is smooth enough that no file is necessary. This is well engineered, solid, and well made. If I were to wish any improvement it would be to taper out the ends of the cutting edge just a bit to better reach those pesky little crevasses. Hands down better than the little cheap things hanging in most stores, where the quality you get it just luck of the draw; where the best are half decent and the worst can&#x27;t even handle a hangnail. If I lost these, I&#x27;d buy them again. These are the ones I keep my eyes on when a family member asks to borrow them.</li>
            <li> Great nail clipper. Easy to use and very sharp edges making for a clean cut. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After using a number of different fingernail clippers over the years (e.g., Trim, Revlon, Dovo, Victorinox), I&#x27;ve found the Seki Edge to be the best so far for two main reasons.  (1) First and most important, the cutting edges of the Seki are sharper and cut my nails more cleanly than others and much easier (that is with less force or pressure required).  Regarding the sharpness of the clippers, another reviewer complained about them not being that sharp because they left such a rough edge on his fingernails.  The reason they leave such a noticeable edge is because they ARE sharper than other clippers and make such a clean cut across one&#x27;s fingernails that there is a sharp 90-degree-angle edge where the cut was made.  One just needs to take a file or emery board and lightly round-off this sharp 90-degree edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) The clipper is much easier to hold and use.  In particular, the end of the top (moving) part of the clipper is slightly curved with a raised \\&quot;ledge\\&quot; that you thumb rests against and prevents your thumb from repeatedly slipping off or (compared to clippers with a more pointed end) digging in to your thumb and starting to hurt.  The rear of the bottom part is wide and curves slightly downward so that it too fits well on your other finger(s) and stays put.  All stainless steel and a nice finish are icing on the cake.</li>
            <li> I had always purchased the drug store variety of nail clippers but decided that I would go the extra price and buy something better.  This clipper is probably the best that I have seen and feels like a surgical instrument in your hand since it is made of stainless steel.  The way it is made allows the clipper to stay in your hand and not jump out after a clip.  They are heavier than the cheap clippers and are very sharp which makes for a nice clean cut every time.  I highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li> I had 2 old RED Hello Kitty nail clippers (discontinued) for 18+ years and it is now rusted.  I have been looking forever for one that is closed to this one for years.  Finally, a nail clipper that delivers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Super Sharp, Does not chip/crack your nails.  My son said it cuts like butter.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The nail flew all over.  I am ordering a deluxe Seki nail clipper that will hold the nail in one place, after it is clipped, just like the my antique Hello Kitty nail clipper :)</li>
            <li> I normally would not pay this much for some nail clippers but my old ones were about 10 years old and I figured with all the great reviews why not. I was not disappointed theses are very high quality and very sharp I could not believe how sharp they were . well worth the difference in price and these should last a very long time. I liked them so much I ordered the straight ones to do my toe nails.</li>
            <li> Excellent clipper with very sharp edge and ergonomic feel.  I think it is worth the money.  Comparable to an expensive clipper we had purchased in Japan but subsequently lost.</li>
            <li> Cuts very good, hard to hold, needs a better grip.. Many more out there that has a better grip... would I buy it again..  I don&#x27;t think so.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers for both my husband and I to use based on the reviews...these clippers are fantastic.  They cut easily and cleanly and are the best clippers we&#x27;ve ever had.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these and gave some to relatives - they were similarly impressed.</li>
            <li> OK, when it comes to certain things, I am really picky. And the personal grooming tools I use have got to be high quality and sharp. I don&#x27;t like cutting toenails anyway, but when I have to do it, I want my clipper to be comfortable in my hand and above all, the blades must be sharp and properly aligned. Nothing is worse than a clipper for your hands or your toes that break the nail instead of cutting it. Treat these tools with care and don&#x27;t leave them out where your kids will rip them off. It seems like every time I spend a small fortune on these types of tools, my daughters come over and when I need them, they have walked off all by themselves. So now, I buy really good quality grooming tools such as these and keep them where my kids don&#x27;t know where they are at.&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are great, the blades are so sharp it takes no effort to cut through any nail needing cut. The handles fit my big hands and don&#x27;t slip out while trying to use them. If you are anything like me, spend the bucks and buy a good set of nail clippers and then guard them from getting up and walking away. These will last for a long time if you take good care of them.</li>
            <li> Light years ahead of the cheap fingernail clippers sold in drug stores and supermarkets.  Extremely well made.  Has a nice solid feel to it.  Makes very sharp cuts, even if they&#x27;re tiny.  An absolute pleasure to use.  Sorry that I didn&#x27;t spring for this purchase far sooner.</li>
            <li> Powerful finger nail clipper. I bought it after being disappointed by ones at a local CVS that were extremely weak. It is a little pricey but you can tell it is high quality. It also doesn&#x27;t have the typical metal nail file you find on other nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Still sharp, very very easy to use. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a great nail clipper. Going on three years and I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> These are nice strong clippers with a solid edge, and they give the satisfying &amp;#34;snap&amp;#34; sound when they blast through the fingernail with the tenacity of a samurai sword. However, the blade is just ever so slightly misaligned on one of the leading edges which causes it to leave a small burr with each snip that results in the need for a nail file after I&#x27;m done. However, they are WAY better than any chrome plated cheapo clippers from the store.</li>
            <li> Simpy the best nailclippers I know. They are really sharp. The cut is so clean that you can get away with not having to touch up with a file. Better than any &amp;#34;made in China&amp;#34; junk. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my nail clippers from Sephora after they broke.  These are fairly small and clip cleanly.  They are so precise that I felt comfortable using them on my two year old.  While they are nice, I&#x27;m not sure they are worth the money.  I think I prefer the ones from Sephora, which felt more substantial and I think cost a few bucks less.  I also felt like I had a better grip with the Sephora clippers.  I just hope these hold up better than the ones from Sephora.</li>
            <li> My Clyppi broke under abnormal circumstances, which was no great loss because they didn&#x27;t cut fingernails very well. The Seki are much better. Sharper blade, cleaner cut, more durable.</li>
            <li> So most people probably view fingernail clippers as a pretty basic drug store staple, but this is far and away the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Cuts are clean and consistent, &#x27;feel&#x27; is very solid, and overall is just a quality product.  No reservations whatsoever.</li>
            <li> These are very well made clippers and very sharp. They may be a little over kill because they are almost too nice. You either have to get several clippers to place in your car, office and home, or you have to get used to using these and then changing to a much inferior clippers when you want to work on your nails somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Great Christmas gift.  This is the Rolls Royce of clippers.  I bet it lasts a lifetime.  (Just don&#x27;t misplace it.)</li>
            <li> I have used 100s of nail cutters. Its a bit pricy but it&#x27;s the best one I have ever used</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to spend so much for a pair of clippers, but I&#x27;m really glad I did.  It cuts through nails like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li> Makes you realize the difference in quality between the $1 clippers you get at the supermarket checkout lane or the Dollar Store and  clippers that are simply self-explanatory when you read:  &amp;#34;Stainless Steel&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Made In Japan&amp;#34;.  These will clip smoothly and cleanly, with no ripping.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper I ever used. Perfect size (not too small or too big), excellent sharpness, well balanced and tension. Highly recommended. Quick delivery of purchase from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s soposed to do well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and it works well. It gives your nails a clean cut.. but it doesn&#x27;t open wide enough. It takes some maneuvering to properly get at your nails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Seki Edge fingernail clipper for several months now and thought I would share my thoughts.  First, the background.  We&#x27;ve all used the cheap clippers from the drugstore and almost always find them disappointing.  But I was lucky enough to find a really good one at least 15 years ago.  It looks like all the others and the only markings say \\&quot;Made in China.\\&quot;  But, by some fluke, it works perfectly.  So why did I buy the Seki?  To have a backup in case something ever happens to my amazing cheap unit.  I figured the cost would be worth it if they did as good a job as my old unit.    Here&#x27;s the short version:  They&#x27;re okay, but I expected better and I still prefer my old cheapies.    Here&#x27;s the long version:  They&#x27;re okay.  Really.  They&#x27;re sharp and feel like quality.  They&#x27;ll probably last a long time.  Unlike the cheap units, I&#x27;m guessing that Seki has good quality control that results in each unit being just like all the others that roll off the line.  So why do I still prefer my old cheap unit?  Well, remember that my cheapie happens to be that one in a million that came off the line perfect.  The Seki falls short of that standard in the following ways:    1. The Seki makes it difficult to cut your nails very short.  I think that&#x27;s because the face of the clippers is tall, which means it rests against the skin under your nail and prevents you from sliding the clippers farther onto the nail.  It&#x27;s not a big proble!m, but an annoyance when I&#x27;ve torn a nail and need to trim the remainder very short.    2. The handle sticks up at a steep angle from the base.  Considering that the unit is constructed from slippery stainless steel, it is difficult to get a grip and squeeze without having the cutting jaws slip out of position.  I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t just bend the handle about halfway up to make it nearly parallel with the base.    3. They don&#x27;t do nearly as good a job as my old pair at nipping my hangnails.  I have a lot of trouble with hangnails, which are little torn pieces of hard skin along the corner of the nail.  To remove them cleanly requires sharp nippers that can be applied to the base of the hangnail.  It is essential that the corners of the cutting jaws meet perfectly, which is why most cheapies fail this task.  Perhaps it&#x27;s the tall face of the Seki that renders it a mediocre performer at this task.    4. There is no integrated nail file.  To this day, I&#x27;m still using the little steel nail file on my old cheap unit, even after I cut my nails with the Seki.  Good grief!  How long can I expect the old clippers and file to last?    In conclusion, the Seki fingernail clipper is an okay unit.  I just wish it was as good as my old $1.98 unit...</li>
            <li> This fingernail clipper is a flawlessly engineered piece of Japanese steelwork. The last fingernail clipper I will ever need. Also, a great and affordable quality item to gift to those people that are difficult to buy presents for.</li>
            <li> not what i expected they leave my nails rough and jagged they work ok on my toe nails but still leave the nail jagged I would not but these again</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t loose it your going to have a clipper for many years.  Might as well have the best.</li>
            <li> Well made and sharp. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Great nail clipper. Compared to lots of others, these stood out as the best. I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
            <li> The cut is not as smooth as it should be. The cutting head is on the small side. The price is way overboard. Save your money, find something else.</li>
            <li> These are the greatest clippers!  Expensive, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I guess since it is for fingernails, it is not as robust as toe nail. Probably because of its size it has certain flimsy feel to it. It is still very sharp, though not as balanced as the bigger one, probably it has to with physics. Nevertheless it is very good product, and highly recomended.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised, I have only had it for about 30 days so I have only used it maybe 3 times but the quality and feel seems to be first class.</li>
            <li> Spend the extra $10 over a cheap one, it&#x27;s worth it. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be this much of an improvement over a $3 one.</li>
            <li> Best fingernail clippers!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used those those junky $1.99 nail clippers you can pick up at the drug store. And I always thought I couldn&#x27;t do any better. Finally, after buying some $20 tweezers and marveling at the difference between them and the cheap stuff, I decided to buy some better nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are excellent. The weight of the tool is perfect and the cutting quality is perfection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I spent the money on these! (In fact, once I used them, I ordered the companion toe nail clippers as well!)</li>
            <li> As nail clippers, they work great - even for tough toenails. They have a satisfying \\&quot;clip\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the metal is relatively scratchy. The top handle scrapes against the body in an uncomfortable way. It&#x27;s totally possible that I&#x27;m just very sensitive.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great.  I purchased a pair about 2 years ago and they are just as sharp today as the day I bought them.  I like them so much that I sent a pair to my father and he loves them as well.  They work so much better than the cheap fingernail clippers that you buy everywhere else that are either never sharp to begin with or are made of such cheap materials that they are dull within a few uses. These clippers are very sharp out of the box and stay sharp.</li>
            <li> Cuts so cleanly that the edges of the nail are left sharper than you may expect. A buff with a file smooths them out. If there is any fault, it is that it cuts almost too easily, making it very tempting to overtrim.</li>
            <li> After trying a slew of alternatives, I purchased a Seki Stainless Steel Toenail Clipper several months back.  It works well and the the quality is great.  I was so pleased that I bought the fingernail clipper.  It also performs superbly.  Well constructed and designed.    If you are tired of crappy performance and shoddy workmanship---BUY IT!!!!    I guess I am a converted cynical skeptic.</li>
            <li> Yes you are going to pay a little more for these than regular clippers but I promise you it&#x27;s worth it. As soon as you put them in your hand you can tell they are sturdy and quality made! The blades are so precise and sharp it is unreal. So effortless unlike other brands! The matte polished finish of these gives the steel a great look and feel. Made in Japan. As soon as you clip one nail you will notice the difference like I did and never go back to cheap brands. I also immediately purchased the toenail clippers just like these. Clipping your toenails with those are just as amazing.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers, they feel great in your hands and have a smooth action when cutting nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would make them better is if they could cut hang nails as well as they cut finger nails. It is nice to have one tool that can do both (which I have had in the past).</li>
            <li> Not inexpensive, but worth it. Now if I can just keep my family from borrowing and not returning it!</li>
            <li> The clipper cuts good but, I wish it had a fingernail file/cleaner and the cast metal pusher could be nicer fit and finish but, the stainless steel cutter is good. It is always better to buy in person I guess?</li>
            <li> Super sharp and high quality, these actually cut the nail and don&#x27;t break it like the cheap ones.  I know the $15 price tag is steep, but we&#x27;ve used them for quite a while now without any issues and they are as sharp as when I bought them.  So much for the $2 pairs that wear out every 3 months.Only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t come with the nail clean-out tool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for 5½ years now and it is still as sharp as new!  I originally found that the corners at the ends of the cutter blades were so super-sharp that they would snag my nail as I moved it along the nail while cutting.  But I just took a small file and with a quick light swipe dulled those corners enough that they would easily glide along as I progressed through each cut.  An ignition file fits fine, or even some fine sandpaper would probably do the trick.  The slightly dulled corners have no effect on the cutting ability of the blade as a whole.  (Just be careful to only swipe the very tips of the corners and not the main part of the blade.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: Some may be disappointed that this clipper doesn&#x27;t have a file/nail-cleaning blade.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing how little effort is required to cut my nails with this tool.  It seems like it will last a lifetime … as long as I don&#x27;t loose it.</li>
            <li> Same quality and a third the price of henkels branded clippers I bought 7 years ago in Tokyo.  Cuts cleanly and maintains sharp edge.  Bonus for style points.  This is the cadillac of clippers and will last a life time.</li>
            <li> For such a frequent task you deserve a good tool - this is it.  I knocked off one star just because I wish there were a file.  I also bought the larger one for toes at the same time - that was a waste.  This one is larger than most and I like it better for toes too.</li>
            <li> These are an affordable luxury. They look and feel like what they are - a finely crafted piece of metal. The component that usually fails on cheaper clippers - the &amp;#34;pin&amp;#34; attaching the lever handle to the spring bottom - seems rock solid. These are my new go-to gift to get the people who have seemingly everything.</li>
            <li> over two years now I own/use this nail clipper and it&#x27;s still sharp, what can i say more about it.</li>
            <li> I got so frustrated using those cheap $5 fingernail clippers sold in drugstores and grocery stores  that I went on-line and purchased a $30 German made clipper. That wasn&#x27;t much better!. Finally, I found the Green Ball Seki Edge based on reviews. So I purchased one. I can&#x27;t believe that this model works so well and is half the cost of the expensive one yet works flawlessly!. It&#x27;s only 3 times the cost of the cheap ones that tear your nails! You won&#x27;t loose the Seki Edge. You&#x27;ll cherish it!</li>
            <li> Does a great job without tears and pulls like over the counter clippers . Worth the extra bucks for a nice job!</li>
            <li> I am very frugal and hate to spend too much for anything. I debated for about a month on whether I would spend this much on nail clippers. Point blank I always bought the old cheap-o and just bought new ones every two to three months. When it dawned on me that I was spending roughly 12 to 15 dollars a year on clippers. That is when I thought I would at least give these a try. I am so glad I did. These cut so well, that half the time I don&#x27;t have to file my nails afterwards. No tugging, no uneven cuts unless you cut them unevenly. So don&#x27;t hold off go ahead and buy them, you will be so glad you did.</li>
            <li> The quality of this item is outstanding. It&#x27;s worth the extra money up front. We&#x27;ve had it for years and it&#x27;s been great.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I put up with crummy cheap nail clippers for 20 years without looking for an alternative like these. They&#x27;re sharp, the rod that holds the pivot for the lever is solid (as opposed to being notched to accept the pivot), and the action of the lever is precise. Totally worth the little premium over regular clippers.</li>
            <li> A little pricey, but cuts so much more cleanly than any other clipper I&#x27;ve used.  Highly recommend it - great gift idea.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know there was anything like this on the market.  I thought I was going upmarket because I went to the beauty section and bought the Revlon clippers instead of the checkout stand clippers. These are so solid and sharp.&lt;br /&gt;Why 4 stars?  (1) No nail file, and (2) it&#x27;s hard to explain but the cutter is more blunt-nosed than the cheapies.  You have to work a little harder to get short nails into the opening.  They&#x27;ll take some practice but I&#x27;m confident that these will last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This fingernail clipper is just what you want for a home manicure tool.  It is made of stainless steel, instead of other cheap materials which break quickly.  It cuts effectively and is just the right size.  This is definitely worth the few extra dollars which you pay initially as it will probably last for years!</li>
            <li> Great quality - maybe too good?  I had a cheap Trim brand clipper that I had for years and loved - but recently lost.  None of the other brands of cheap clippers I had worked well at all so I thought I&#x27;d try these.  These are sharp and work very smoothly but (it&#x27;s hard to explain), you don&#x27;t get a lot of feedback - and plus (to me), they are not at all comfortable to hold.  They simply don&#x27;t work as well as my old pair.  Oh well, they look good :)</li>
            <li> This clipper is much heavier with a smoother finish than the standard clipper and feels good in your hand. It has a very sharp clip and should function well for many years.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Sturdy little nail clipper that cuts very well. Wish it had a little chain to attach to my key-chain.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Very sharp which makes cutting your nails very easy. I&#x27;m a massage therapist so value having trimmed nails and I can immediately tell if I use lesser quality clippers. And conversely, if I&#x27;ve temporarily misplaced these, my &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; clippers, I have an immediate sense of relief once I find and use these &amp;#34;A Team&amp;#34; ones again. (it&#x27;s THAT much easier!)</li>
            <li> I go through nail clippers faster than any person really should.  I&#x27;ve very picky, and found that most I&#x27;ve used are either poorly designed, flimsy, or just plain dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are none of those things.  They&#x27;re made from heavy duty steel, and they feel it.  The blades are sharp, and cut cleanly. And, my favorite part, they put a little &amp;#34;ramp&amp;#34; on the handle to keep your thumb from sliding off. Thats a problem I have with most other clippers I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought both the fingernail and toe nail versions, and they are both great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t cheap, but you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If lost, I&#x27;d buy them again.</li>
            <li> Just a quick review - this really is the best clipper ever. Very sharp, great feel, easy to grip, dont know what else to say - I did tell my wife she can check it out but it has to be returned promptly!!  hahaha</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic fingernail clipper. It is the best I have ever used and is so practical for people who have very hard nails. I plan on buying it for gifts because I know everyone will be happy with it.</li>
            <li> I am tired of clippers that are dull, dull, dull!  After receiving and using these Seki clippers, I&#x27;ll never, ever buy another set of el cheapo dollar ninety-nine 99 cent clippers.  Seki look and feel like quality.  Would I buy these again?  You bet!</li>
            <li> You might think the lowly task of clipping your nails (or your cat&#x27;s nails, believe it or not) is not worth thinking about.  These clippers will change your mind. If you want to step up to civilization, these are the clippers to use.   Smooth, simple and effortless operation. You can absolutely feel the craftsmanship. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smart looking &amp; works well.</li>
            <li> These are not inexpensive but they are excellent quality and something that you regularly use.  These are certainly the best that and most comfortable clippers that I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Have been looking for a sharp pair for years.  Do not waste money on cheap ones.  Clean cut- barely need filing.</li>
            <li> I was tired of having clippers that either crush and tear my nails or clip so straight that they leave sharp edges.  I paid a little extra for these and I’m glad I did.  These clippers are very sharp, have a slight bevel to keep the edges smooth, they’re sized right for my hands, and have a nice indent making them very easy to hold.</li>
            <li> We love our Seki&#x27;s. They are the best in my opinion. You can&#x27;t go wrong and they are reasonably priced, if you&#x27;re used to buying good quality.</li>
            <li> Best fingernil clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have collection of nail clippers acquired over the past 5 years.  All of them bought at the local Walgreens, CVS, and RiteAid - the typical &#x27;made in China&#x27; stainless steel nail clipper.  After a while these tend to lose the sharpness and the lever action requires significantly more pressure to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;But not these new clippers.&lt;br /&gt;if I&#x27;m not careful, I could slice a chunk of finger off.  These clippers are sharp and effortless to use.  The lever mechanism operates so smoothly compared to my $3 clippers from the local pharmacies.  Overall, quite pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am completely impressed with this product. For the first time ever, I actually enjoyed cutting my nails. The clippers did not leave any jagged edges, and they did not become trapped between clippings that usually result in a tear. One reviewer commented they were heavy. They are heavier than the ones you buy in the check-out lane of a store. However, their design makes them very easy to manipulate. I actually found them easier to use than the typical clippers. If I could change one thing, I would put a rubber grip on the bottom to help prevent the smooth metal from slipping, but this certainly does not warrant a reduced rating.</li>
            <li> I had this split running down a ridge in the middle of my left thumb nail for several years.  It seemed like it would never heal.  I asked my doctor what to do about it.  He showed me his identical 4 year old split thumb nail and told me to live with it.  I did not want to live it.  I spent a lot of money on manicures, but nothing seemed to help.  The manicurists tried the glues, the wraps, the oils, and the super polish, but none of them had any effect on the split.  At times the split would almost heal itself, but never quite make it.  It would always split farther during a final attempt to clip the last of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this clipper as a luxury not thinking it would actually help with the split nail.  I was totally bewildered when the Seki fingernail clipper removed the last of the split during the second clipping.  I lost sleep thinking about this.  What had changed?  I had purchased probably six different drugstore nail clippers over past year alone, but they were all relatively dull.  I tried three different manicurists over the years with no improvement with the split.  I came to the conclusion, the drugstore clippers and the manicurists professional nail nippers were dull and kept the split from healing by bending and contorting the nail during the cutting process.  The Seki clipper being extremely sharp there was very little bending of the nail which avoided additional stress on the nail and split.  The sharper edge allowed it to cut using less pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am kicking all the manicurists to the curb for taking my money without solving the problem.  The seven year old split is finally healed.  The Seki clipper is truly a fine instrument and the company has made this new customer a believer.  I just order the Seki toenail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank Seki for making an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> So much better than drug store China clippers - will last a lifetime</li>
            <li> how about that, they really built something that is does a better job at something as simple as cutting nails</li>
            <li> The ergonomics on this are fantastic. I wish all clippers were so nice and easy to handle! However, the clip is where it counts most, and on that front: the finishing is quite poor quality. The blades are not aligned well and poorly finished, leading to a rough cut. My previous $2 clippers from South Korea, which I lost, were far superior in finish, even if much less comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> Everything that other people have said is true. The weight and blade on these are superb and I could not ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> These are made well, but the cutting angle makes it very difficult to clip my nails. The cheaper drug store clippers may not last as long, but do a better job.</li>
            <li> This product along with the [[ASIN:B000F37UNM Seki Edge Toe Nail Clipper]] are simple tools that help make life a little more enjoyable and easier.  These also make nice gifts for family and friends as they will be pleasantly surprised by the build quality, design, and sharp blades.    Some of my thoughts:  - Cost: Yes initially they are more expensive than the cheaper ones but after having used them for over 6 months, it looks like it will last longer.  However, these are not to the point of out-of-reach high luxury items with gold plating and studded with diamonds.  They are probably more expensive because of quality build, carefully thought out design, and the use of good materials and processes.  I also contacted Seki Edge through e-mail and confirmed that they are made in Japan which also probably contributes to the higher price.  - Features: It would have been nice if these nail clippers came with a file.  The cheaper ones I&#x27;ve seen have this feature and can be pretty handy to help smooth out the nail after cutting.  However, if you are mainly using it for manicure or pedicure purposes at home, then you can always buy a separate file for the job.  Also note that in addition to not having a file it also does not have a finger/toe jam picker.  Hey it sounds nasty but this is all part of the cleaning process!  But it&#x27;s okay because if I see jam, I&#x27;d rather just cut my nails short and give them a good washing.  - White Sticker: The white rectangular shaped sticker with \\&quot;Seki Edge\\&quot; logo in red and black looks like it might come off over time.  I wish they instead engraved or stamped their name or even kept it off entirely.  This of course is not a big issue but my first impression was that this sticker somewhat cheapened the look.  - Size: Another first impression was that these clippers are not small or travel sized.  Possibly the ergonomic design and leverage needed to cut with ease contributes to a slightly bulkier product design compared to the cheaper ones.  Despite this bulkiness, I can see this clipper being ergonomically friendly for those with large or small hands.  - Quality: The build quality is like a tank and yet it feels nice to hold in the hand.  Also when you open and twist the handles, it flows smoothly and it does not feel like it will fall off or disconnect like the cheaper ones often do.  I notice a hint of metal to metal sound when turning the handles, which probably will produce scratch marks over time, but this is not such a big issue to me.  I am not sure what the two slots on the edge of the handle are for but I assume that it is for style and to help lighten the weight.  I also appreciate the stainless steel material.  The brushed stainless steel found on the body and the smooth sandblasted surface look on the handle is nicer than the chrome plated or \\&quot;gold\\&quot; plated shiny ones typically found elsewhere.  The angles and curvatures throughout the design also contribute to a nice looking clipper.  The blades are what really set itself apart from the competition.  You can really feel that the perfectly aligned sharp blades actually grip your nails before proceeding to clip off the nail crisply and assuredly.  I wonder though how long the blades will last over time.  Thankfully I understand that this is twice tempered steel and that it can be sharpened.  As with any tool you need to get used to it.  I recommend cutting a little less nail in the beginning until you get the hang of it (no pun intended).  For me I got a little carried away in the beginning and I cut off too much nail.  After a day of handling items, opening doors, and typing on the computer, I noticed my nail was slightly separated from the finger on the very tip causing it to be sore (sorry for those who are squeamish).  Anyway, there is also sometimes a clicking noise after immediately following each nail clip depending on the amount of force you give.  This sound assures you that the clipper did its job and is ready for the next \\&quot;bite\\&quot;.Overall I found these two tools to be a nice and helpful addition to my everyday life.  The fact that I know that I do not have to struggle with low quality clippers (easily dull and misaligned blades and small design that is hard to hold and slips when given too much pressure) when clipping my nails gives me peace of mind.  For a few bucks more, I consider this to be a significant upgrade.  If it were up to me, I would rate these 4.5 stars out of 5 because it is not absolutely perfect but close to it.  However I will give these 5 stars since this is the best nail clipper I have ever experienced.    As a side note I feel like these nail clippers give the similar unexplainable good feeling that is produced by Felco Classic Pruners [[ASIN:B00023RYS6 Felco Classic Manual Hand Pruner #F-2]] (for gardening purposes which I highly recommend) when using it and yielding great results.  If you own one you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> These quality-made clippers are outstanding.  Not only do that cut cleanly and with precision, but they require little hand/finger pressure to make the cut.  This is vitally important for anyone with a significant loss of dexterity or hand/grip strength.  Even for someone without those physical disabilities, these clippers are far superior to and much easier to use than the cheap ones you get at the drug store.  Life is too short to use those.  Given how often and how many times you will use nail clippers over your lifetime, don&#x27;t you deserve to use the best?  If so, get these.  You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> nice quality, cuts nails like I have never seen before, the only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the metal produces this &amp;#34;nails on chalkboard&amp;#34; effect/sound when twisting the top part to engage when ready to use, maybe it needs a better design to avoid this; maybe like a washer or other plastic or silicone based buffer were the top lever and the cutting element meet.</li>
            <li> These are so much better than the ones that you can get at the big box stores.  Really sharp and probably will stay sharp for a very long time!</li>
            <li> Saw this product on the TV series \\&quot;How it&#x27;s Made\\&quot;  Needed a new nail clipper and thought what the heck.  It&#x27;s way more money than I&#x27;ve ever paid for one in the drug store.  But from the program it looked well made.  When I received it, I was shocked how smooth it clipped my nails.  There&#x27;s no flex in the lever action.  Just bought another one as a gift for my mom.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers ever! They&#x27;re sharp and durable.</li>
            <li> I know, they&#x27;re clippers...but they are so good! I didn&#x27;t realize how much I was putting up with until my clippers finally broke and forced me to get new ones. So glad I found Seki&#x27;s product. They are so good. I have a toe that was injured and my nail is now thick. These clippers do the job with ease.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get the fuss about this clipper at all. It&#x27;s worse than the random ones I get from drugstores. It gives them a really rough uneven cut, and is difficult to hold (slippery as it&#x27;s bare metal). Yesterday it slipped straight out of my hand into the bathtub (my hands were dry). This was probably the third time I used it after owning it for six months. When I bought it my intent was to replace my drugstore brand with a nicer quality product but I am finding myself consistently avoiding to use it. I also bought the matching toenail one which is equally disappointing too. These are two of the few times that I feel let down with an apparently popular purchase based on Amazon community reviews.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve owned the Seki/GreenBell toenail clippers for several years, and they are far better than anything else we&#x27;ve used in the last 6 decades.  As a result, and being disgusted with each of several pairs of more common drugstore brands, such as Revlon or Bates, I started looking for a fingernail version of the Seki.  Having failed to locate one in a stick store, I finally found the product online and ordered two.  True to form, they are vastly superior to anything else either of us have ever used.  The Seki engineering and machining is the pinnacle of quality craftsmanship.  You won&#x27;t find anything better.  The cutting surface makes very clean cuts and goes through tough nails like butter.  For a man especially, the textured handles make grip and control a much better experience than with any other brand.  I thoroughly endorse the Seki products, and can&#x27;t imagine there being anything better available.  They may be a little more expensive than more common clippers, even after shopping around online, but for products that give a lifetime of frustration and problem-free service, the extra outlay is well worth it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know what I missing until I bought these at Whole Foods one time because it was all they carried. Oh boy, are they wonderful. If you&#x27;ve never tried them buy them know. Absolutely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical on spending the money on these since they cost a pretty penny, but boy was it worth it.  Now I make sure I don&#x27;t lose these like my others.  They&#x27;re so sharp and its such a difference to what I&#x27;m use to with the $1 clippers you can buy at walmart/target.  Take the investment on something you use a lot, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> works very well and a vast improvement over the cheaper ones out there. would definitely buy again and will likely get a 2nd one as well.</li>
            <li> As previous reviewers have already mentioned, these fingernail clippers are the bee&#x27;s knees.  The cats pajamas.  The bombizzle fo shizzle.  After using regular drug store, wal-mart quality fingernail clippers for several years, I decided to look for something better online and came across these.  They were a bit on the expensive side, but the reviews had me intrigued enough to take the plunge.  I have no regrets.  I am a male and have really thick fingernails that grow at a pretty rapid rate.  Regular clippers would really have a tough time with my nails and often leave me unsatisfied with how they left my fingernails.  When I first pulled these out, the heft and general build quality were the first things of note.  The thickness of the metal really make them feel like they were built to be your last pair of clippers ever.  Once I started using them, I found out why the reviews were so incredible.  They literally clipped my very thick nails away with ease, no strain, every clip going off without a hitch. No longer did I feel like I was \\&quot;tearing\\&quot; my fingernails as opposed to clipping as with dull drug-store clippers.  These things will have no problem with fingernails, toenails, hangnails, whatever you have.  I&#x27;ve been using them for months and they show no signs of letting up.  PROS:  Build quality is outstanding; will not rust; will outlive you most likely  Cuts through thick nails with ease  CONS:  A bit expensive but very much worth it.  Won&#x27;t have to buy another pair for a long time.  No file, just clippers</li>
            <li> I will have these for years to come</li>
            <li> These aren&#x27;t as extraordinary as other reviewers have out, in my opinion. They work. They aren&#x27;t crazy sharp. I&#x27;ve noticed they tear my nails more than rip but I find that to be common with most clippers. Maybe I have weird nails..&lt;br /&gt;They aren&#x27;t bad they just don&#x27;t seem that special for that price.</li>
            <li> best clippers i have ever used! bought two more for my husbands toiletry case and one for my own that we travel with.</li>
            <li> Superb product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using the cheap Trimz nail clippers all my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is a whole new experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It fits the fingers for ease of use. The cutting edges are extremely sharp;&lt;br /&gt;after the cut there is no burr that needs to be filed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended; I suspect the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper will last a lifetime.</li>
            <li> Not much to say except these function exactly as they are supposed to.  Very sharp, well made, (I&#x27;d even say ergonomic), I can&#x27;t point to a single downside.  Yes, they are more expensive than the big box store brand, but as is often the case, you get what you pay for. These are so nice, I&#x27;m even considering getting these as stocking stuffers for some of the family next year, (yes, they are THAT nice).</li>
            <li> This is a superior product that is made incredibly well and performs just as incredibly. Very sharp and precise. You won&#x27;t even need a nail file! It cuts that smoothly and perfectly!!    Go get one!!    I bought the toe nail version as well and my review for that would be identical to this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, so normally I don&#x27;t put much thought and effort into high quality hygiene products. But after my last two pairs of cheap nail clippers that I bought from the grocery store kept breaking on me, I decided it would be a smart investment to get something that would be a lot more durable and reliable and thus save me money in the long run. That&#x27;s how I ran across this beauty of a product. The steel used is top notch and it clips my nails easier than anything else I&#x27;ve tried (my prior clippers would occasionally have a hard time clipping my nail entirely and I&#x27;d have to bite it off). It grips really well and you can tell from its feel that it will not fall apart on you. There&#x27;s an indentation for your thumb that is a nice feature to keep it from slipping off (in case you&#x27;re trimming your nails with wet hands, perhaps). The base is wide so that your other fingers have enough space to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I haven&#x27;t found a single thing wrong with these clippers. They&#x27;re worth every penny. Do yourself a favor and make the smart investment.</li>
            <li> This thing really is as good as everyone else says. It&#x27;s like a chainsaw compared to a bow saw - with a standard Revlon clipper being the bow saw. Sharp, crisp cutting right through the nail. None of the wavering bending or forcing an odd angle to get a good cut that you have to do with standard clippers.</li>
            <li> I have a pair of tweezerman nail clippers that when I use leaves my nails so sharp I&#x27;ve literally cut my face by barely brushing my finger over my neck.  These are so much sharper, leaves my nails smooth, and are solid and heavy.  I&#x27;ve read other reviews that they rust and I can&#x27;t understand why unless they leave then in water or the shower or something.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even believe I found this nail clipper. I saw it in a magazine from a company I bought a folding knife from. I thought wow, it never dawned on me there was anything but cheap junk nail clippers from Walgreens. Then when I saw the Seki name, I recalled that my very expensive and rare folding knife is made in Seki Japan, where some of the sharpest knives in the world are made using exotic steels.  I decided to see if Amazon sold this nail clipper and once I saw it on Prime I only had to grapple with the price.  Fifteen hogs is big bucks for a nail clipper. I decided to treat myself  and find out if these are really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, you&#x27;ll immediately be impressed with the quality of these clippers. The fit and finish is fine stainless steel, not chrome on metal. They clip my nails perfectly. They&#x27;re by far the sharpest I&#x27;ve ever used and I could probably get away without filing because they leave no rough edge. I still choose to file with an emery board, but because of the nice cut I spend less than half the time with the file compared to cheap clippers. These clippers don&#x27;t come with the built in file which is a plus for me. I hate those stupid little useless files.  My hands aren&#x27;t very big and I have no problem using these. There nothing awkward, even during my first use with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the only problem I can think of. These cost fifteen bucks and they&#x27;re the best. If I ever lose them I can&#x27;t revert back to using cheap junk clippers. I&#x27;m spoiled now.</li>
            <li> Simply put these do not cut smooth.  They are barely better than the cheapest ones you would find at walmart.  The cut leaves the shredded fingernail feeling.  The actual steel it is made of appears to be good but the cut is poor.  The revlon deluxe clippers have a better edge.  Maybe it is just quality control, but at $15 I recommend you not even try these.</li>
            <li> Finally a decent pair of clippers instead of the chinese crap found locally. They do the job cleanly without leaving ragged nails like the cheap ones do.</li>
            <li> This is a solid nail clipper. It feels sturdy and seems like it&#x27;ll last long. The only problem I have with it is that it feels kind of big and is a little harder to maneuver than my previous clippers. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good.  Edit - After having this for 2 years, I&#x27;ve really grown fond of it. It works exactly as it did when I first bought it. Very very sturdy and consistent with the cuts.</li>
            <li> I never realized how bad drugstore clippers until we bought these. When you get these, you know immediately they are different from the cheap ones. They are stainless steel where the cheap ones are plated steel(big difference). The cut is clean and smooth. As a man, I carry clippers everyday in either my work pants or casual clothing(clippers can be used in many useful ways). No more cheap clippers for us!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same crappy clippers for about three years and had no intention of making any changes.  Then I saw an ad in BMWs roundel magazine for a superior clipper called Klhip.  They were around $60.  I wasn&#x27;t about to drop $60 on nail clippers, but the ad was enough to get me researching for better clippers.  I decided on the  Seki based on previous reviews, and being made in Japan vs. some other asian country with less dedication to quality products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m perfectly happy with these clippers.  They go through nails better then el cheapo clippers like a sharp knife goes through a tomato better than a dull knife.  Can&#x27;t speak for how well they&#x27;ll work in a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This got four stars instead of five because i&#x27;m just not enthusiastic enough about fingernail clippers to ever give them five stars.</li>
            <li> Awesome clippers will never switch brands.</li>
            <li> i purchased this nail clipper because i was sick of the cheap ones becoming super dull after a few months of use. i am happy to say that these clippers are just as sharp as the day i got them. the one relatively minor annoyance is that they squeak because of the metal rubbing on metal at the hinge. a dab of oil fixes this.</li>
            <li> While this feels a bit small in my hands, it is very high quality and cuts with ease and precision. This product reminds me of a cooking class I once took, where the instructor claimed that you could replace entire sets of kitchen knives with a santoku knife (slicing, dicing, chopping) and a paring knife (peeling, seeding, coring). The idea behind the chefs advice was that instead of buying an entire set of marginally effective knives, just purchase two high quality, versatile knives and master them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is exactly what you should do here. Throw away those old plastic-metal hybrids, the rusting steel clamps that pinch &amp; tear, the expensive boutique clippers that never get a clean cut. Throw them all away and buy the Seki edge clippers. And then buy a few pair to gift to those who&#x27;d shirk at the cost, yet would certainly appreciate them. Your friends, family, loved ones may never know a better way exists until you show them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I still primarily use a santoku &amp; pairing knife!</li>
            <li> very well made. The cutting edge is sharp, the tool is weighty and bigger than regular clippers so it is easy to hold and ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;To use.</li>
            <li> Good quality steel construction. I wanted a solid, stainless steel clipper for long term use, which is not easy to find. I&#x27;ve been using this one for several years now and I&#x27;m not disappointed. This is the clipper you&#x27;ll have for the rest of your life. You might want to buy two of them, because if you ever lose it you&#x27;ll be peeved that you now have to use the one you bought at Target 20 years ago until you can get another one.</li>
            <li> Made from pure stainless steel! using this for 8 months now and still no traces of rust build up. amazing nail cutter!</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and sturdy. No file, but no need with a clean cut. The only downside is that if you get these, you won&#x27;t want to use cheap clippers ever again.</li>
            <li> Stop wasting your money on those Made in China nail clippers and buy these.  Not expensive at all plus the quality is amazing, it&#x27;s from Japan after all.  Solid cast metal top piece, very ergonomic feel.  Blades are very sharp and exactly meet each other.  It smoothly clips your nail like cutting cheese, not the snap tearing action from the others.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> LOVE these! So much better than what I can buy at a drug store!</li>
            <li> The best Fingernail Clippers that I have ever owned. Super sharp and quality heavy duty construction. No flexing or mis-allignment while trimming nails.</li>
            <li> Sharp and size is just right. It looks bigger in the picture but it is only around 2 inches. Will recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Japanese fingernail clippers are just awesome. I don&#x27;t know why but the build quality is just superior to any American fingernail clipper. It&#x27;s just easy to use - your nails effortlessly clip off. When I use other nail clippers, they generally require too much pressure to properly work. This is like cutting butter - easy.</li>
            <li> These clippers are worth every penny. Yes they cost a little more than the cheap drug store clippers but they&#x27;re well worth it. They are clearly made of high quality material. They&#x27;re sharp and cut cleanly and smoothly. I&#x27;ll never buy a cheap set of nail clippers again.</li>
            <li> FINALLY a nail clipper that actually cuts!!  Imagine that!  I&#x27;m thrilled beyond belief that I have found this nail clipper.  No more tears wheneven I cut my little girl&#x27;s nails.  We have always used the clippers we got from Target or some local drug stores and after a few uses they become dull so instead of cutting the nails all the way through they leaves sharp edges.  Then I have to file the nails down so she doesn&#x27;t scratch her face.  NOT fun!    I will be buyer a few more to have around just in case we lose this one!</li>
            <li> Definitely nicer than anything you&#x27;d get at the Drugstore, but not a 5-star nail-clipping experience, assuming there is such a thing.</li>
            <li> I wanted better fingernail trimmers and this one was more expensive, but very highly rated.  I decided to trust the reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> clean cut，nice design，I love it very much. This is the best i ever have. GIve me a quite good experience</li>
            <li> Are you tired of things that just don&#x27;t do what they are supposed to? Toss your drug store nail rippers and get these. Make a place for them and return them to their place! One less curse word per week..</li>
            <li> I thought I had decent nail clippers. Clippers I promptly threw in the recycling bin after trying this on one nail. It gives you a perfect clean cut. No breakage. I&#x27;m accustomed to filing after cutting, but with this I need to do much less of that. And I have less peeling and breakage later on.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the blades are set back a tiny bit, which makes it hard to cut my toe nails. I have long finger nail beds (and hard, as opposed to soft nibble nails). They cut my finger nails with ease, but it&#x27;s a struggle to see what I&#x27;m doing when I cut my toe nails. It feels like I&#x27;m forcing my toe far back in there and am bound to lop off a toe tip. But with a few uses I&#x27;m getting more comfortable--as I haven&#x27;t made anything but perfect cuts on my toes as well. If I had larger toe nails I&#x27;d try the clippers made for feet. Maybe they&#x27;re better suited to nails that are set back from the ends of our digits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of different nail clippers over the course of my life, and this is the sharpest one I&#x27;ve used so far. Probably so good at being sharp that I have to be careful not to cut too much of my fingernails, but that&#x27;s not really a big issue. This one&#x27;s on the expensive side, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I guess actual katana makers made this one because it&#x27;s the samurai sword for fingernails!</li>
            <li> Great made in japan clippers. Ive looked for a good pair clippers for a long time, these are built like a tank and sharp. Being a guy I pulled off the red sticker on the handle and they look manly now.</li>
            <li> The Cadillac of nail clippers</li>
            <li> Makes a clean, easy cut every time.  Worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> Super sharp! Make sure you are positioned correctly on the nail because it will cut through any part of the nail you put in between the blades. Why people say Revlon is the same I have no idea.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d broken at least 3 cheap drugstore nail clippers before i bought the Seki.  it cuts through finger nails like a hot knife through butter, is solid in the hand, and feels like it will never break.  the blades are sharp enough to require some care while clipping. a superior product for hygiene - never buy  a cheap clipper again!</li>
            <li> One of the regular mundane personal hygiene chores that we all face is to keep our nails trimmed. Sadly the vast majority of all the fingernail clippers out there are worthless piece of junk.  I recognized this for a long time and sought a workaround by purchasing a fifty dollar, yes you read correctly, a fifty dollar nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seemed like an enormous amount to pay relative to other nail clippers but I rationalized if it worked well and lasted many years it was worth it.  The device was the Klhiop [...].  Well I would not even give that device a one star as it was a clunky design and the blades were dull after LESS than one year. I have had $2 clippers last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I started my search again and was delighted to find the Seki clipper. The moment I opened the package it was crystal clear this was a phenomenally designed and precision engineered product made of high quality materials.  I anticipate getting many solid years of service with my weekly nail trimmings with the Seki and am deeply appreciate that Amazon allowed me to find this gem.</li>
            <li> Outstanding fingernail clips. Very clean cuts, extremely sharp. Easy to use. Money well spent, for a lifetime of use.</li>
            <li> It seems strange to be writing a review about a nail clipper, but this is the first example I&#x27;ve owned that actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to with zero fuss. The last 4-5 clippers we&#x27;ve owned have been dull, ripping rather than cutting the nail, and break quickly due to crummy manufacturing. The Seki is a deal compared to the money I&#x27;ve spent on junk so far. Save yourself the hassle and just go with the Seki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ Super strong&lt;br /&gt;+ Super sharp&lt;br /&gt;+ Just the right size</li>
            <li> These clippers actually make it a joy to cut finger nails. They are substantial clippers, with an attractive stainless steel finish, and feel like they&#x27;ll last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are also sharp as can be. So sharp, in fact, that you might remove a little bit of skin and not notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for cutting, these take the cake. They don&#x27;t chop at the nail and nail fragments don&#x27;t go sailing across the room. It just neatly and precisely slices the nail off, exactly where you place the cutters, with very little pressure required.  You&#x27;ll wonder how you survived all these years with the clippers you bought at the drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are worth the price.</li>
            <li> Makes clipping even the NASTIEST of toenails effortless. Truly a great product, built well, and functions great. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> What a good set of nail clippers. I have always purchased the cheap stuff at the drugstore and my nails always seemed to break off instead of being \\&quot;clipped\\&quot; off. These clippers provide a smooth finish making filing afterward unnecessary. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who finds the cheap stuff just isn&#x27;t cutting it.</li>
            <li> I will keep this review short, after all, you are only buying a nail clipper :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one well constructed quality product. It feels nice in hand. It is very sharp and you can clip your fingernails effortless. This is probably the sharpest nail clipper I&#x27;ve used in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick thumb nails, and I&#x27;ve always struggled when clipping these tough nails in the past. This clipper really helps, it gives sharp and clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since there are 160 (and counting) reviews praising this little clipper, I will provide you some insight on what I don&#x27;t like about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: when you clip your nails, they fly everywhere! It&#x27;s an old fashioned clipper. Now days, most of the clippers have a little storage area on it to gather all of your clipped off fingernails, so it won&#x27;t make a mess. This one doesn&#x27;t have it. So if you hate picking up fingernails everywhere after clipping, you might want to consider another clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Very sharp, high quality clipper.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great.  I have hidden them from the rest of my family because if anyone else used them, they are so good, I would never see them again.</li>
            <li> Sometimes you go through life and wish you had a pair of great nail clippers. So you start looking and you&#x27;re not sure what to get. Well, look no further. These are well worth the price. They cut great!</li>
            <li> Seki is know for making world class samurai swords. This fingernail clipper is worth every penny. Stop trying to save a few bucks and get these clippers.</li>
            <li> the cutting edge did not match, and the cut was not better than the $2 one from Walmart. It was not comfortable in our hand. and we are not big. (keep in mind these are deigned and made from Asia). We also brought the toe nail cutter, and it was much much better, and it work well for finger nails too.</li>
            <li> This is actually the second clippers I have bought because when I moved, somehow I lost/misplaced my first set.  These are easily the best clippers I have ever owned.  Super sharp (Japanese), these things clip right throw with minimal effort.  I love these so much that I make other people try them--is that gross--and most people are like, &amp;#34;they are clippers, what&#x27;s the big deal?&amp;#34;  Then after one &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34;, they all say, &amp;#34;Wow! These are amazing.&amp;#34;  I just sit back and smile because I know my job here is done.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt the best and sharpest fingernail clipper out there.</li>
            <li> My wife actually bought these clippers based on the Amazon reviews.  I decided to give them a go and see how they compared to my classic Trim clippers that I bought for a couple bucks at CVS.  Well it&#x27;s kind of like comparing a Honda to a Ferrari, the difference in quality and performance is just that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the cut:  The Edge cuts very cleanly, even with the tougher or thicker nails.  Watch out for flying bits of nail though.  The curve in my nails is so pronounced, it looks like a sadface.  While the Edge could cut them, I had to do it in small pieces and those can go flying without some preventative care to avoid getting shot in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Function: The hinge seems to be very well made.  The cutter handle pops open easily and smoothly, and the execution of the cut is practically effortless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, quality: When you feel these in hand, they feel heavy and like a quality tool you spent a lot more on.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like your standard chrome plated junk (cough Trim).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, the wife had to order a second one and her mysteriously disappeared...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Seki fingernail clipper for a few months now.  The heft and precision of this highly engineered product will change your opinion that all fingernail clippers are alike.  They aren&#x27;t.  The Seki has a longer handle than most to provide better leverage.  The cutting blades are so precision cut it&#x27;s like having automatic transmission.  My fingernails have never looked so neat and trim and I&#x27;m just a guy who ordinarily wouldn&#x27;t pay much attention to such things.  The Seki changed my mind.  I now have a spare Seki as well as a third one for my toenails.  It&#x27;s not often I&#x27;m this much impressed by a product.  Quality, quality, quality!</li>
            <li> I love these! Great quality, good price and does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had these for a while, and they&#x27;ve never failed to disappoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The item is larger than most clippers and is not described as being larger, and is difficult to use.  Good quality steel though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using different kinds of fingernails and by far these are the best i tried, they cut your nails nicely and its painless.</li>
            <li> Amazing clippers! Will cut any nails with minima pressure and nice sharp blades. Will never buy any other clipper. You owe it to yourself to have a good pair of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Clippers were MUCH smaller than I expected, tough for my big clumsy hands to hold...and do not come with a filer built-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not worth the money...(i guess all these superb reviews due to lack of decent competition)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better off going with  Easy Press Clippers - 4.9 out of 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of using cheap, flimsy nail clippers, these are a real revelation. The Seki  clipper is strong and elegant, leaving a flawless nail end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used very cheap nail clippers, but having lost my last one I decided to get a better one.  This seki is really nice.  It&#x27;s so sharp it is a bit intimidating at first.  You definitely want to be a bit more careful with it.  It cuts the nail cleanly.  It seems very well made and that it will last.</li>
            <li> In this day of utter junk, merchandise that somewhat resembles that which it purports to be, but affords mediocre performance, at best, and breaks unavailingly within months, if not days, it&#x27;s wonderful to encounter a product that begins with sound engineering design, is constructed of the correct materials and is manufactured to high standards.&lt;br /&gt;These Seki nail trimmers (I bought two sizes) work perfectly and will, I&#x27;m sure, continue to serve me through the end of my life.</li>
            <li> works well no issues but not sure I&#x27;d recommend to anyone... too expensive... I think you can buy one from WalMart much cheaper...&lt;br /&gt;as far as the product does we have no issues. does its job....</li>
            <li> Absolutley the best clipper I have come across in all my 67 years.&lt;br /&gt; old and arthritic it was a real chore and time consuming before the purchase but almost a pleasent chore now</li>
            <li> Good, sharp clippers, but they don&#x27;t open wide enough. It takes some maneuvering to get at your nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Seki toenail and fingernail clippers. The Seki nail clippers have a bigger opening than the toenail clippers!!??  Buy the (cheaper) nailclippers to cut your thick toenails..Not the toenail clippers. elgin</li>
            <li> Looking for one that actually cuts?  This is it.  Very high quality.  Now can pitch all those old ones we have that don&#x27;t cut.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This cuts both ways I guess, we love that these are sharp, don&#x27;t leave little bits, don&#x27;t take a ton of pressure... but my 8 year old cut his nails a bit short the first time because he wasn&#x27;t used to them.  Now he&#x27;s fine though, and happy too.</li>
            <li> My family has been using J.A. Henckle Nail clipper for 8 years (works great even now), and I love it very much. When I moved out from my parent&#x27;s house and when I was about to order one myself, I saw people recommending Seki Nail Clipper over Henckle&#x27;s Nail Clipper. So i thought I&#x27;ll give a shot to it, and purchased Seki instead...and wow...I LOOOOVE this Seki Clipper. I never thought I would need separate nail clipper for toe nails (one is enough to do all job), but since Seki nail clipper is so wonderful, I&#x27;m kinda tempted to buy a Toe nail clipper as well.</li>
            <li> These are a huge improvement over any other clipper that I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Good service.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers ever. Wish I discovered this way earlier</li>
            <li> The best nail clippers I have used. It has a very ergonomic design which is comfortable in your hand. The blade is very sharp and durable and cuts effectively. I only wish the cutting edge was a little bit wider. I have smaller fingers and fingernails, so it might harder for a person with large nails to use.</li>
            <li> It starts rusting after 1-2 years.  I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this nail cutter a second time.  Not a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> best nail clippers i&#x27;ve ever owned. hiding them so family members don&#x27;t steal them</li>
            <li> Well made. Good look and feel. Weighty. Sharp. A tad bit small IMO for home use, but great for travel. If I bought another clipper, I&#x27;d experiment with a larger design.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. Just buy them and be done with it. I&#x27;ve had these forever and they are still as sharp and effective as the day I opened them.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Sharp, easy to grip, no whammies! Just a great product.</li>
            <li> This marvelous clpper cuts the time I spend on my nails by two thirds. It leaves a smooth edge, unlike any other clippers I&#x27;ve ever had. Therefore, I can quickly file my nails into the shape I want. I&#x27;m so pleased that I just purchased Seki&#x27;s toenail clippers and nostril scissors.</li>
            <li> After a lifetime of using crappy 99 cent drugstore nail clippers I was truly shocked to discover that there is a better way.  These actually cut the nail, instead of crushing their way through.  Cutting is faster and easier and gives a much smoother edge.  We recently misplaced ours and are eagerly awaiting the replacement.</li>
            <li> I have two issues with these clippers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The cutting head is not wide enough.  I have average sized finger nail width  (3/8s - 1/2 &amp;#34;) and the blades on this are only about 1/4 inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The blade opening is also very small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you combine these two features it very difficult to get an accurate cut.</li>
            <li> Well, I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d spend this much on a nail clipper, but this is some pretty fancy stuff. It really does feel like I&#x27;m cutting my nails with Samurai Swords.  The feel is very sturdy and has an even weight distribution. Cuts fingernails like butter, which is a weird thing to say about a nail clipper. I expect this to last forever!</li>
            <li> Leaves kind of a rough edge but they do a fine job.</li>
            <li> Cuts very good.  It would be much better if it was made to also collect the nails as they are cut..</li>
            <li> Great fingernail clipper, so sharp it cuts so easily!&lt;br /&gt;only downside is that it&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> I love this new clipper. I have previously owned some higher end nail clippers in the past which to compare it to.  The Seki produces a smooth, clean cut. I have some neuropathy in one hand which sometimes makes it difficult but I really appreciate the easep with which the CT does the job.</li>
            <li> The construction of these clippers seems very solid and in good style.  They give you good control over what you are doing and the cutting edges seem to cut really well.  They seem to be holding up well for me too.  I have a pair of these in a toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> Until you get a quality Nail Clipper you do not know what you&#x27;re missing.  Whether dry or moist and softened, these super sharp clippers will have you tossing all the drug-store brands in the trash.  They actually cut your nails instead of squeezing them until they pop off.  Love em.</li>
            <li> Very sharp like razor and comportable,high quality stainless steel and price is Good so costeffective the other spesifik&lt;br /&gt;Made in japaneese</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m writing a review for a nail clipper, but this is seriously the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. Sharp, precise, sturdy!</li>
            <li> Having been using cheap clippers all the time, I am quite surprised by the quality of this. It&#x27;s sharp and takes so little effort to do the job. The experience of clipping nails is so good with these clippers that I apparently do this more frequently ( :</li>
            <li> The horrible nail clippers they sell in stores nowadays...I can&#x27;t believe it, they are so bad they shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to be sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with these Seki Edge nail clippers too, though. They are definitely sharp and cut with ease, but they don&#x27;t leave my nails smooth unfortunately. There&#x27;s always a little bit of the nail that&#x27;s not smooth. I always have to use a nail file afterwards. Maybe my fingernails are just odd (28 year old Male).</li>
            <li> I read the first review that is listed as most helpful and that person&#x27;s review was spot on.  This product is high-quality.  The spring is strong and tight.  The blades are sharp as all heck.  The entire thing fits in your hand easily.  Excellent product and worth every penny.  I look forward to seeing how many years it lasts.  I&#x27;m betting this thing will end up costing me a dollar a year after all the years I&#x27;ll own it.</li>
            <li> Really sharp, really works, compared to the normal drug store clippers is like comparing a nicked rusty plade to surgical steeel. It is expensive, but to use an old cliche; &amp;#34;expensive, but, worth every penny&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are much nicer than the cheap ones.  These are sharp and cut the nails off rather than pinching them off.</li>
            <li> If you come across this review please do not hesitate and buy this now!! the semi nail clipper is great super tough with a sharp edge that continues to be my favorite after 1 year of constant use</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever owned! Cuts smoothly and easily with less pressure than cheaper cutters.</li>
            <li> Love these! I first went down the road of purchasing a cheap pair of nail clippers at a local retailer. This was a mistake as they did not cut well and left my nails rough. I turned to Amazon and found these clippers by Seki. I recognized the brand as Seki is also known for their knives. I received these two days after ordering and they do exactly what I want! They are sharp and leave a clean, precise cut. I&#x27;m sure they won&#x27;t last forever as any cutting blade will dull with use. When that day comes I know I&#x27;ll be coming back to buy another pair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, the look and feel is top notch. I&#x27;m not in the business of loaning out my nail clippers, but if I were I would be proud to loan this pair!</li>
            <li> This is a great set of clippers made in Japan very solid. The long handle offers nice control! Highly recomend!</li>
            <li> The cutting edges are very sharp, so clipping requires very little pressure. The lever is longer than typical cheap clippers, with a recessed indent for the thumb.  This makes for a stable clipper that is easy to use, even for those of us who have lost some range of motion in our hands.</li>
            <li> The sharpest clippers I have ever owned. The build quality is very good.</li>
            <li> These are so much better than normal fingernail clippers.  I hope they stay this sharp for a very long time.</li>
            <li> These are nice and sharp, and cut very cleanly. They are a bit smaller than I expected though. They are almost the size of the small travel size nail clippers. I would have preferred them to be a bit bigger, but I like them.</li>
            <li> excellent and would recommend this product to everyone</li>
            <li> I really do like these after my dog chewed my other good pair, my wife lost a good pair and we were left with a cheap set - so cheap I&#x27;d be better off cutting my nails with scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY complaint is that they are too small I think for most guys (maybe not woman). They are heavy duty and seem reliable overall.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it. I&#x27;ve been using the same clipper for years until I lost it in an airport. It&#x27;s really easy to cut nails and they haven&#x27;t been flying off as much as I&#x27;ve been used to. So, probably as good as a nail clipper gets?</li>
            <li> These clippers feel good in my hand and they actually cut my nails better than anything I have used before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky when I cut my fingernails and this clipper really gives you precise control over your cuts. It&#x27;s really not a curved blade so that can be tricky to not have sharp edges but you&#x27;ll quickly get the hang of it. Much better than a generic fingernail clipper from the department store.</li>
            <li> The clippers seem sharp, but surprisingly often leave torn and partially attached fragments at the ends of my nails.  In other words, although the blade seems very sharp, it often doesn&#x27;t give me a clean cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t like that the top bar is shorter than the bottom one.  It makes for an odd grip.  No built-in file is really strange, too - that should be a given.  And finally, the two slits at the bottom seem to be decorative only - I can&#x27;t imagine a practical purpose for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vastly overpriced, and not that good.</li>
            <li> These are amazing in that they take very little pressure to use and cut cleanly. My nails are very thick and difficult to cut. These clippers are extreme!</li>
            <li> I was tired of dull clippers so I tried the Seki brand. I made a good choice. They cut great and are easy for me to hold. Try them.</li>
            <li> is better than my brook stones nail cutter! extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m leaving a review for both this fingernail clipper and the matching toenail clipper from the same company, SEKI EDGE, as many people will likely want to purchase both products for their nail-cutting needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are SHARP. Awesomely sharp. I&#x27;ve never used such a high-quality pair of nail clippers before, usually opting to purchase those cheap $2 department store brand clippers. The different is night and day between a quality set and the cheaper ones. Using these to clip my nails is quickly and effortless -- you need to apply very little pressure to get a nice, clean cut. Using cheaper clippers, I noticed that after a couple of months or so, it takes a considerable amount more force to clip the nails. And I don&#x27;t even necessarily have thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are made out of some sturdy, stainless steel and have a nice weight to them. They&#x27;re not at all heavy, but they have enough weight to them to help cut those thick nails with very little effort. The fingernail clipper opening seems to be roughly half a centimeter, and the toenail clipper opening is very slightly wider (maybe about 1-2mm wider). These are not accurate measurements that I have taken, rather estimates. Please correct me in the comments if I&#x27;m wrong and I&#x27;ll edit my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend these to anyone that&#x27;s looking to ditch their old, cruddy nail clippers.</li>
            <li> This cuts through both fingernails and toenails effortlessly. The only catch is that it&#x27;s so sharp, you&#x27;ll have to file your nails to smooth out the sharp edges after using it.</li>
            <li> Eventhough it&#x27;s a little bit pricy, it&#x27;s just what I wanted.  Cut with smooth edges.  More than ten years ago I randomly purchased a nail clipper (which is made in Japan with no brand name) while I was in Hong Kong. It cuts nails like butter and leaves smooth edges.  I tried to find another one just like it and had been searching for many years (spent over $30 on numerous nail clippers made in Germany, China, even Japan.) None of them came even close.  I finally found this one!!! It&#x27;s not exactly as good but it&#x27;s like 95% just as good.</li>
            <li> Love these.  Great cutting for a finger nail clippers.  There is no pulling or tearing of the finger nail.  clips cleanly thru the nail.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, money well spent!  Cuts cleanly, easy for the thickest nails, and has held up well to heavy use by a bunch of us.</li>
            <li> Great quality product, but ... well, it leaves my nails a bit flaky on the edges. I never had this issue before. I have to file my nails now, or it will chip. I have soft nails, so maybe don&#x27;t buy this if you have soft nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I love the high quality material and build of it.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a good nail clipper for years.  Bought everything at CVS and they are all awful.  After reading reviews for Seki, I ordered it.  I LOVE IT!!  What a difference.  Nice and sharp.  Easy to use.  I am now ordering a set to give to my Mom for her birthday.  It&#x27;s a strange gift but I think she&#x27;ll like it too.  It&#x27;s the simple things in life....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dozens of pairs of nail clippers over the years, and these are the best.  When I needed an extra pair of clippers, I decided to search Amazon to see what the best pair I could find was.  The reviews seemed to indicate these, and I haven&#x27;t been disappointed.  They cut very well and evenly.  I am very happy I bought these.</li>
            <li> Love these little clippers. My wife thought I was crazy to pay this much for clippers, but one day she tried them and said, \\&quot;Wow, you really can tell the difference!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Great product ! Great service !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dude, and never cared about my nails. I still don&#x27;t care what my nails look like, but holy cow after I got these my finger tips just feel great, particularly when typing and playing instruments etc. Not to mention my girlfriend likes my hands not to be prickly or to inadvertently scratch her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just do yourself a favor and get them.</li>
            <li> The most awesome nail clippers ever. You&#x27;ll never need another pair, except with your significant other keeps stealing them from you.</li>
            <li> For the size it works. Too small for me.&lt;br /&gt;This product is very well made, high quality.&lt;br /&gt;Going to keep them in my travel kit, they are small and OK in an emergency.&lt;br /&gt;If you want small clippers these would be hard to beat from a quality stand point.</li>
            <li> I like this clipper.  It&#x27;s sharp, the blade is nicely rounded for the fingernail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lever doesn&#x27;t require strength to press when cutting.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy looking for sheer practicality in a nail clipper, then a toenail clipper is probably the best thing you can get. But add to this specification the &amp;#34;edge&amp;#34; of Seki Edge products and you&#x27;ll have a nail clipper you&#x27;ll love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the clipper model here is very small. It&#x27;s more like a hand pinky nail clipper. I don&#x27;t recommend it, even if it&#x27;s good for what it is or better than your ordinary clipper.  You&#x27;ll want to pick up the bigger models of the Seki Edge SS clippers instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve grown tired of the cheap 99cent clippers that you buy at the drug store, that don&#x27;t clip, rather they just tear your nails off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a tweezerman, but it just doesn&#x27;t quite grip right. An expensive Brookstone clipper but again, it just slips out of my hand. The Zwilling and Seki were my two choices and I couldn&#x27;t make up my mind, so I bought both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Seki, feels very balanced in my hands, and doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to slip out between my fingers. I have about a size 8 hand. Also because of the weight of the extra metal in the bar you press down on, it feels more effortless when you are clipping. The clipper of course is much sharper than your standard clipper, but where it wins, is ergonomics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent clipper</li>
            <li> The best I have found to date. I get so tired of replacing cheap ones that the metal breaks.</li>
            <li> I like the high quality of these clippers.  What a change from the ones I find in drug stores.</li>
            <li> I was getting really tired of the cheap walmart 3 dollar nail crunchers. They always left bad jagged edges. These are not cheap at all but they work VERY well. Precision cuts and clean edges. They work with little effort. Only thing to keep in mind is I used the cheapos to cut away dead skin around the nails every now and then. I could see cutting too far with these as you wouldnt have time to stop when you feel pain because they are so damn fast and efficient. I would buy them again if I had to.</li>
            <li> the little handle that you push does not slide around as you press it.  cuts sharply and neatly.</li>
            <li> As described.  Would buy again.  Very sharp and well made</li>
            <li> I bought this item on the advice of some of my friends and after reading other reviews about this product. I&#x27;ve owned countless nail cippers all my life and, admittedly, I didn&#x27;t really care then if it came from the dollar store. It&#x27;s just to cut nails right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so... so very wrong. After using the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper, I realized all clippers were not made equal. What have I been doing all these years? I&#x27;ve been wasting my time with all those cheap 50c clippers which needed twice the effort to cut or even left sharp raggedy edges on my nails. But the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper cuts your nails cleanly and effortlessly. It&#x27;s like a well-crafted samurai sword... for your nails.</li>
            <li> These really are good clippers. Nice little snip. Fit and finish are a step above the dime store variety. Pleased.</li>
            <li> Between the products cost and the shipping I spent around $30 on this.. I mean come on, at the end of the day it&#x27;s just a nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;Clips like a beast tho.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I wasn&#x27;t that impressed. They&#x27;re a good quality metal and the mechanism seems pretty sturdy, but they don&#x27;t seem to cut any better than the many cheaper clippers I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> I wish I could get my money back on all the clippers I have purchased from a big box store. I can&#x27;t. They were cheaply made and we gave up in frustration from doing our nails. My husband said that they were cheap and we should find ones that weren&#x27;t. We called around and no one carried the more expensive and good ones. Then I thought &#x27;I&#x27;ll bet Amazon has some.&#x27;  And it did!  I love my new clippers.</li>
            <li> Made in Japan. I may never have to purchase another nail clipper after this one. Seems like it&#x27;s built to last for years.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase which was to replace the problematic (dull, difficult) nail clipper I bought at Target a couple of years ago, as well as the pair we bought at a pharmacy a few years before that. I can imagine that there are finer clippers out there, but for cutting my finger nails these work very well. I don&#x27;t have a problem with my fingers slipping on them as some have stated here. You do have to be careful not to cut too low, or at least I do, as these are sharped than the ones I had been used to. I would consider buying another pair to go in the other bathroom.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need another review detailing these clippers, but I just had to put in my 5-star rating with all the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is it that manufacturers today think they should make cheap, cruddy products instead of investing in quality materials and workmanship?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy another cruddy Wal-Mart/drugstore nail clipper.  Once again, as in many other areas of my purchasing life, I am learning to look for quality and pay a bit more for it.  The resulting satisfaction from such a mundane activity as clipping my nails is completely worth a few more dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Japan can gladly have my money when American companies fall so woefully short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Seki.</li>
            <li> Great clippers, but toe nail clippers are even better and require less effort.  The size of the cutter on the toe nail clipper is not much larger than the fingernail clipper.  The fingernail clipper might be better suited for smaller hands - like for children.</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought these years ago,. If you, like me, have always used cheap nail clippers from the drug store or convenience store, you owe it to yourself to start using Seki clippers.</li>
            <li> This is one quality product. Cuts sharp and precise. You can feel the quality when using it. Snips away with precision. Very happy with this item.</li>
            <li> would highly recommend-works great</li>
            <li> Worth every penny. Sharp, comfortable, feels durable. Works much better than the cheap versions you can pick up in any drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;Great level of manufacturing and finishing</li>
            <li> I think this is the BEST fingernail clipper I have ever used.  The cut is so quick and sharp, I almost worry.  What a perfect stainless steel!!!  I wish it was just a bit wider though so it can do a longer cut.  Buy this thing, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned my Seki fingernail clippers for years now, and they still work as good as the 1st day I got them. How many cheaper clippers can you say that about? And work great they do! Once you experience what it&#x27;s like to trim nails with something this \\&quot;industrial strength,\\&quot; there is no going back!</li>
            <li> I thought this nail clipper was going to be much better quality than the typical clippers you can buy in the drug store.  But I was disappointed.  The clippers are certainly powerful, but they leave a ragged edge.  I have to file my nails every time I use this clipper.</li>
            <li> Great nail clipper. High quality. We love it. We were getting frustrated at the poor quality of nail clippers available out there. This one is built like a proper tool.</li>
            <li> I really like these clippers</li>
            <li> First clipper I&#x27;ve had that makes no &#x27;click&#x27; sound.  The blades are so sharp, they quietly glide through.. No pieces flying off everywhere.  After using this clipper, I didn&#x27;t have to file any sharp points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely one thing you&#x27;ll use your entire life.. As a teen, I was always getting those &#x27;grooming kits&#x27; as gifts from relatives.  Trust me, this clipper is a much, much better gift, and will be around for years after those cheap kits have fallen apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always preferred quality over quantity..  I wish I had these years ago, I would have given one to a co-worker who was always clipping his nails...  It would have been so peaceful and quiet!&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!  And tie a string to it.. I&#x27;ve already ordered another because someone else took a liking to my first one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:::::::: updated&lt;br /&gt;There are a few things that bother me about this product.&lt;br /&gt;It claims a lifetime warranty, yet there is no phone number or address&lt;br /&gt;It is labeled &#x27;stainless steel,&#x27; however, the lever contains no steel, and as another reviewer posted, that&#x27;s where it breaks.. Without getting into metallurgy, it is a great clipper, but the lever will eventually break off.. So if you buy this clipper and it doesn&#x27;t cut effortlessly, you should get a replacement.  If the blades aren&#x27;t doing 99% of the work! that lever isn&#x27;t going to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If something is gold-plated, you wouldn&#x27;t advertise it as solid gold, I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See also, my reviews of the Seki nail file and the toenail clipper.</li>
            <li> Very sharp clippers, very little effort required to use.  Easy to keep hold of while clipping nails.  Worth the extra cost... Now if I can only keep them away from my wife...</li>
            <li> Read reviews here on Amazon and SS nail clippers seems to be the way to go.  I&#x27;ve used this less than 5 times so far, but they were probably my best nail clipping experiences so far.  I don&#x27;t know how good the more expensive ones are over this one, but for the average person, just get this.  The construction is very high quality, blades are sharp, and the shape is ergonomic.</li>
            <li> I tried based on so many reviews and I just don&#x27;t like them. They snag the heck out of my nails. I ordered a pair from Solingen and the difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> Other nail clippers literally don&#x27;t always quite cut it. These cleanly and effortlessly cut nails. Revlon should get out of the business.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This thing is sharp and feels great in my hand.  I have 3 of these and wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else.</li>
            <li> This is not a poor clipper.  It does cut well.  However, the pin holding the clipper handle is zinc plated steel.  The handle is aluminum, which is fine... but the sticker on the handle is tacky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this clipper so I could keep it in my shower.  The pin holding the handle rusted within a week.  It is silly to sell a clipper with stainless steel cutting springs which does not also have a stainless steel pin to hold the handle...  At this price point for a nail clipper I find this completely unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you hate cutting your nails then having to FILE them, because your nail clipper left them sharp, and worse, left them with jagged edges that catch on everything? I originally bought the Clyppi Fingernail Clipper and returned it because&lt;br /&gt;(1) it was used -ew! and&lt;br /&gt;(2) I had already purchased the Seki toenail cutter so I was familiar with SEKI quality and was very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fingernail clipper is just as high quality as the SEKI toenail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This nail cutter trims throw nails effortlessly and leaves a clean smooth edge. And since they are stainless, you can even WASH or sanitize them and they won&#x27;t rust!</li>
            <li> I THINK WE HAVE 3-4 OTHER NAIL CLIPPERS ACQUIRED OVEER THE YEARS. Most were adequate but became less useful as arthritis set in. I could hardly believe the difference that these made. They clip cleanly with virtually no effort to exert pressure. The result is a smooth cut with no rough spots. Arthritis or not - these are the greatest. My husband tried them &amp; exclaimed, &amp;#34;Wow&amp;#34;! Perhaps that should be the title for this review.</li>
            <li> Threw out my other clippers.</li>
            <li> Title says it all - these are way more expensive than your standard clippers, but from the moment you hold them you know they are much higher quality.  I have no doubt the sharp blades will far outlast the throw-away kind I&#x27;ve cycled through in the past.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after the raving reviews, but I am dissatisfied with what I got. When I received it, the blades are mismatched. When they clamp down, the blade don&#x27;t match entirely, so when I clip my nails, it&#x27;s not a clean cut. I don&#x27;t think this is the intended nature of the blades of the Seki Edge, and only what I received has this small defect, because other nail clippers I purchased before have their blades match perfectly. Unfortunately, it appears my return date or RMA date is past 3 months, so I am slightly disappointed that I won&#x27;t be using this product, as the lack of a clean cut hurts my nails.</li>
            <li> So sharp and doesn&#x27;t get dull. I haven&#x27;t had a hangnail since I have been using these (that&#x27;s over 2 years now.) Those cheap grocery store ones are not worth it, highly recommend using these clippers.</li>
            <li> Nice, high-quality product.  Nice, smooth action.  Very much worth the extra money you pay for it.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Something so ordinary like nail clippers, why write a review? Because in no way are they all made the same! These are by far the best clippers I have ever used in my life, and I&#x27;m over 40. They are easy to use, unlike others that are almost painful to press down, and the clippers feel like quality in your hands.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this item last May (2013) and am still having trouble adjusting to using it.  I&#x27;m used to using a cheaper pair of clippers throughout the years.  This item is heavier and a little more challenging to slide under the nail before clipping. It seems like there&#x27;s probably a &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; to learn for using this item.  I continually go back to a cheaper set that is easier for me to handle.  I think the product appears to be higher quality and packaging was great.  Arrival time was 5 days from a Sunday to arrive in my mailbox the following Friday.  I have no complaints against the company--just may be that as an older man, I&#x27;m not as flexible at using this item as others may be.  This item appears to cut very, very sharply and probably very long lasting.  The price included free shipping when I ordered it last May--that was one of the reasons I was ready to pay a higher price for this nail clipper.  (Chase)</li>
            <li> Wasnt sure about these when I ordered them, but they are worth every penny. Insanely sharp and easy to cut your nails with.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, good japanese quality&lt;br /&gt;Was a little reluctant to spend such amount, however certainly dont regret it, these would be best clippers i have ever had, better than tweezerman....</li>
            <li> Every time my husband uses it he comments on what a fine clipper it is and thanks me for ordering it for him. He keeps it in a special place so as not to misplace the greatest personal tool he has ever owned. Do you also make a nose &amp; ear clipper?</li>
            <li> This is one fine nail clipper.  There&#x27;s no file-cleaner blade and nothing to catch the clipped nails from falling on the floor, but if you want the sharpest cut available, this is the one...</li>
            <li> Have the larger toenail clippers bought from sharper image years ago, love them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are better for fingernais, but they are sharp sharp sharp.  Careful you can cut your cuticles closer than you might want.</li>
            <li> High quality, nice weight and feel, easy to use.</li>
            <li> A freaking nail clipper, how is it that I have to buy one online? Well you know those cheap ones you buy in the cosmetic aisle at your Wal-Mart or Target? Yeah..those are crap. This one feels sturdy and doesn&#x27;t have the shiny slippery coat that makes those cheap ones useless. Buy it if you hate clipping your nails.</li>
            <li> This clipper works just like all nail clippers should.  Effortlessly makes crisp clean cuts every time, no mashing or tearing of the nail.  The audible report when a nail is clipped is pleasing, you know you are using a quality product.</li>
            <li> SO SHARP, the best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned. I guess you do get what you pay for with these. Very clean cut nails.</li>
            <li> So far love these clippers.  Requires minimum pressure to get a clean cut. Have added 2 pairs to the household + the toe nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I wanted a good pair of clippers.  In my household, any clippers we had ended up in the junk drawer in the kitchen.  Clippers from maybe 15 years ago, some falling apart, some rusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought these so I could get rid of those.  Bought these cause I thought they would last a long time.  When I first used them, they would cut really well with a snap.  A year or so later, they don&#x27;t have the same &#x27;bite&#x27;.  They&#x27;re not at the point of tearing instead of cutting, but they&#x27;re noticeably different.</li>
            <li> I was looking for another cheap nail cutter after mine broke, but saw this one and had to try it after reading the reviews. I never thought I could notice a difference in a nail trimmer but you sure can with this one. Cuts so well and looks like it&#x27;ll last a long long time. Worth the extra few bucks to get a good one now instead of buying a bunch ones over the years.</li>
            <li> Which is a weird thing I never thought I&#x27;d be writing. But here I am, sharing my love for a certain set of nail clippers on the internet, for everyone and their mother to read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re sharp. They cut nails. That&#x27;s about it. But they do it super well with almost no pressure required. At least 13x better than the $.99 nail clippers from the drug store, which is convenient considering they&#x27;re approximately 13x more expensive. Just buy them.</li>
            <li> best nail clippers I have ever owned. Pristinely sharp and cut nails with accuracy and precision. I use these to cut my nails and those of my children (age 4 &amp; 7) and have always cut our nails with ease and without trouble.</li>
            <li> Love these clippers and boy ARE they super sharp compared to others I have owned. I have to be extremely careful when using them as they are professional quality and you better be sure you want to cut that before you commit.</li>
            <li> I bought 4 of these for myself and members of my family.  You won&#x27;t know you need a 15 dollar fingernail clipper until you _use_ one.  It is easy to hold and slices through nail like butter.  Unlike the crap drugstore nail clippers from China, these are hand-honed and finished in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you clip a fingernail with these, there is NO rough edge to file or remove.</li>
            <li> very well made clippers, probable the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I bought several for friends, my wife and daughter******  ******</li>
            <li> I love these.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if they would be worth the money that there could be that much difference in nail clippers.  They are so worth it.  Strong, clean, sharp, smooth.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> High quality, precise cut. I had no need to file my nails. (I keep them very short) they are great to trim kids nails also. No tearing. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I liked this one so much I bought the toenail clipper too. The clipper is soundly make, nice to hold and feels like it will last forever. It&#x27;s also very sharp and precise.</li>
            <li> Binge order haha. These things are awesome. Very sharp! Does leave the nail a little rough but it&#x27;s all good. Cuts a clean and very easy on thicker nails.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have had cheaper brands of nail clippers, but these are definitely the best we&#x27;ve ever had. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> These are very sharp, quality steel, nice finish and will last as long as you have nails. You still need to file the nails after you cut them as a sharp edge and a burr is always left - even with quality cutters.</li>
            <li> High quality, very solid. Very good control while in use in every position. Very precise clipper, will show you how well you trim your nails. I play guitar, and I like my finger nails trimmed close, and I like to have one of these in all my guitar cases.  2017 January Update. Buying another one, lost my original during a move. Still 5 stars. I play guitar, must keep my fingers trim or they catch on the string. Thinking on getting a few of these, hide in a guitar case, chain to an amp. But like a good knife, you keep it in a good sheath or block til you need it. Take care of your tools and it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I will never need to buy another nail clipper. These are 1000x better than the cheap $1 clippers you might find at Walgreens.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve owned. Effortlessly get a clean snip each time. Seems to be well made</li>
            <li> These cost more than many other, similar-looking clippers.  But you get what you pay for.  These are well-made, substantial, and very sharp.</li>
            <li> Much better than the vast majority of nail clippers you will find. If you don&#x27;t lose it, you will love it.</li>
            <li> My husband can&#x27;t quit going on about how awesome these clippers are. They cut the nail so easy and a leave a nice smooth edge. You can tell they are made well as soon as you hold them in your hand.</li>
            <li> I got this more than 2 years ago and have been using it ever since. Is it perfect? Definitely not, but neither are clippers by any other brand, including hugely overpriced models which are \\&quot;made in Solingen, Germany\\&quot; or the ones with \\&quot;creative\\&quot; names like \\&quot;Clyppi\\&quot; (if anyone will be claiming otherwise - most likely they are paid shills for certain company, and unfortunately Amazon attracts many of these).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it sharp? Yes, it is, at least mine was and still is, even after all that time of regular usage. If yours wasn&#x27;t - you might have gotten a defective one, just return it for replacement. You also have an equal chance of getting a defective (or improperly sharpened) unit from ANY other brand, that&#x27;s what the warranty is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it comfortable enough to use? For me - yes, BUT the shape of your hands and fingers (and other stuff like thickness and hardness of your nails) is most likely different so it might not be for you. Not the fault of the clipper, just try out other models with different shapes, you might find the one that will fit YOU the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it a 100% stainless steel? Well, no - for example the lever is made out of some aluminum alloy but that has no effect on its functionality or durability.&lt;br /&gt;Is it durable enough? Yes, it is - mine still works well, no breakages of any kind, no rust, no peeling of any surface parts (even the sticker is still there!), although I don&#x27;t try to shower it every day (I prefer to clip nails while they&#x27;re still \\&quot;dry\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it leave the edges of your nails somewhat \\&quot;rough\\&quot;? Yea, it does - like I mentioned before the clipper is VERY sharp straight from the factory so depending on your nail&#x27;s composition and thickness it may leave the edges of your nails also somewhat \\&quot;sharp\\&quot; to the touch. Of course you can always use a nail file (not included with this clipper, you need to buy it separately) to smooth out your nails or let them be smoothed out \\&quot;naturally\\&quot; over some time. Personally I don&#x27;t mind it because the benefit of the sharper jaws (you do not need to squeeze the lever as hard as on most other clippers) really outweighs this minor drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth its price? For me - yes, especially compared to the junky \\&quot;no-name\\&quot; clippers you can get at your local pharmacy or any store which sells grooming items and which usually require much more effort to operate then start to go dull or break after a year or less. For you - I don&#x27;t know, just try them out yourself and decide.I don&#x27;t mind it because the benefit of the sharper jaws (you do not need to squeeze the lever as hard as on most other clippers) really outweighs this minor drawback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth its price?

            <li> I have average size hands but found that lever always slipping. Cut was average, nothing special.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nail clipper that is sharp and sleek, then get this one.  I bought the $20 Tweezerman Clippers and it doesnt even cut as well as clippers from the dollar store.  The only drawback is it doesn&#x27;t catch the clippings.</li>
            <li> These are sharp but they crack the nail leaving a rough edge. My nail was broken to the point that I had to trim it shorter than I liked and I had to file the edges because it was catching on everything.  I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers are really good and worth the money.  They really do cut, rather than tear through, your nails.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the money but the quality sure makes up for any doubts.  Very solid works great! BUY IT!</li>
            <li> Really loving the feel, and quality of these.  Glad I went with the Seki for sure.  The offset clipping keeps the blade edge sharp, and precise. I didn&#x27;t realize how terrible unsharp my old finger nail clippers were, let alone my relatively new toe nail clippers.  These are awesome! I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Razor sharp, instant no effort cut and clean as a whistle..glad I bought several..you can&#x27;t do better...Last a lifetime.. BUY NOW!</li>
            <li> bought several different brands of these higher priced clippers to run a &amp;#34;taste test&amp;#34;. This was the only brand that cut my nails better than the super cheap ones you buy at any drugstore. These are pretty darn sharp and cut the nails pretty smoothly. Now if they would add the plastic sleeve around these to catch the nail clippings, and the built in emery board that some of the other brands have integrated, this would be the perfect set of clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS, the emery board on a couple of the other brands worked really well. Very convenient/</li>
            <li> Glad I bought this item. I needed a bit more in the cart to qualify for free shipping. It&#x27;s well built and very sharp.</li>
            <li> High quality, Japanese steel and grinding. Well worth the price. A true tool for grooming. Gret gift too. Enjoy it, I do.</li>
            <li> Very happy to find these.  Easy to use even though my thumb injury will keep me using my old drugstore clippers for along time.  Never using those old clippers again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers work perfectly to make nice clean cuts but that&#x27;s a bonus to actually being able to hold and squeeze them. Nice solid design with a satin finish looks nice but all I care about is THEY WORK AND DON&#x27;T HURT to use so yay :)  I&#x27;m ordering more, for my purse and for stocking stuffers for my sisters.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found and purchased these years ago.  Super sharp and so comfortable to use. I would never go back to the cheaper drug store models.</li>
            <li> Nice clean cut. Never knew what good clippers were like until I tried these. They are the Katana blades of nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my folks for Christmas last year.  They love them.  Nice and sharp.  Now I need to buy a pair for me!</li>
            <li> These are great clippers.  Pricey, but head and shoulders above any I&#x27;ve ever used.  I haven&#x27;t had them long enough to say how well they will hold up.  They are very sharp.  I&#x27;m a buy and they cut my toenails very well (that&#x27;s why I bought them)  They are easy to hold due to the shape of the handle.  There is no file attached.  Happy so far.</li>
            <li> Very well made. The clipping part is made of steel and the top part that you press down with your thumb is made of cast aluminum. It would be better if there was more texture on the metal parts to prevent it from slipping/moving when using it to cut nails. Also, it is so sharp that it leaves the nails perfectly squared off, thus leaving a sharp edge like |_|. This therefore requires on to file your nails after clipping. I typically do not have to file after clipping with other (cheaper) clippers.</li>
            <li> I have never used a clipper better than this one. Toes, fingers, a tree, whatever. These are excellent, I keep them in the shower on a semi-dry shelf, they have been there for 6 months or more, and no sign of rust. Others have all rusted just from the humidity in there, but not these.</li>
            <li> very sharp, smooth action and ergonomically friendly. Now that I&#x27;ve bought the pair to trim fingernails I&#x27;m going to get the larger pair for toenails..</li>
            <li> Very sharp. Extremely neat and smooth cut. Outstanding quality. I&#x27;ve been using Seki nail clipper for about a year now and I have a feeling that it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Our local Pharmacy chain had two quality ranges of fingernail clipper: a 99 cent version and a 3.99 version. We bought the 3.99, with a famous name attached, and it is basically worthless. It was then I decided to go on Amazon and just get the best I could find. We got the Seki and guess what? It works!</li>
            <li> Great fingernail clippers, dare I say buy it for life quality. It doesn&#x27;t strip the nail and always cuts fully and accurately. I&#x27;ve had no issues with rust either. It&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I always knew there must be a better set of nail clippers out there, but it was never really at the top of my list of things to find.  I wish I could post this somewhere other than on the Seki Edge page, because by now you too have fortuitously stumbled apon this gem.  But nevertheless, you should feel more than confident adding these clippers to your shopping cart.  They go through water-softened nails like butter, and do a nice clean cut no matter the condition.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are not inexpensive, but it will likely be the last fingernail clipper you ever have to buy!  My only regret is that we didn&#x27;t discover them sooner</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers. Well made, very sharp, easy to use. Takes half the effort to use. Well worth the price. I have carpal tunnel in both hands, I would recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> High quality nail clippers that vastly exceeded my expectations.  In the past I had paid much more for Solingen steel clippers that were no where as good as these.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great, sharp and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> These are outstanding clippers, far superior to the usual &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; variety.  Very sharp and precise cutting surfaces.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nail clippers are sharp and stay sharp.  Been using them quite awhile.  My nails grow very quickly.  I don&#x27;t know how I have gotten along without them.  Well made.  I never realized that sharpness was so critical to comfortable nail clipping. Wish they would add a small pouch to keep them in.  I am concerned  they could become dulled.</li>
            <li> Superb quality and craftsmanship on this one. Stays sharp and precise. I love it !</li>
            <li> Good quality. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> These are expensive (for nail clippers) but they are very precise, sharp work like a champ.  Don&#x27;t try to trim your cuticles with these as they&#x27;re so sharp, you can cut yourself without even noticing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WELL worth the money!</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I have ever used, Blade is sharp and cuts through nails like butter. Great clippers</li>
            <li> Great clipper.  Very sharp and ergonomic.  Does not pull on the nail when cutting.  I wish it had a nail file attachement on it like the majority of clippers.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive, but worth it. I&#x27;ve been putting up with cheap fingernail clippers for too long. The old ones wouldn&#x27;t cut my thumbnails, which are kind of tough and thick. Tried diagonal pliers, which worked, but are straight cut, so the nail edges had to be trimmed and rounded.&lt;br /&gt;The seki is great, cuts smoothly and clean, no sharp edges. This is a good buy</li>
            <li> I love this nail clipper.  It cuts easily and cleanly with sharp blades.  No other clipper I&#x27;ve had has compared.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper leaves my nails jagged and sharp.  When you clip your fingernails, the device should be more rounded where it does the clipping.  No matter how hard I try, my nails are not smooth and I feel like I&#x27;d have to file them to smooth them out.  I&#x27;m a male, so filing my nails isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve done before or am willing to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these based on good reviews, but will have to continue searching for a pair of La Crosse nail clippers because those are the best.  I&#x27;m very disappointed I&#x27;ve lost mine again.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and sturdy.</li>
            <li> It was great to find the edges so sharp and precise in shaping my fingernails.  They are definitely a &amp;#34;cut above&amp;#34; the ordinary drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li> Build quality excellence and sharp cutting with tearing off cuticles. Hopefully it will last as long as some of the other reviewers have mentioned. 10 years or more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of nail clippers in my life, but I haven&#x27;t found any that swings as smoothly or feels as high-quality as this pair.  The metal is very nice and refined, and the pieces do not grind against each other like many others do.  The &#x27;blades&#x27; are also quite sharp, easily cutting through nails.  I find the cutting action to be quite smooth, rather than the sudden snap of many others.</li>
            <li> I is obviously a very good quality product.  I would have preferred the clipping end to be curved.  Other than that, it works well.</li>
            <li> Seki City, Japan is where some of the world&#x27;s best steels are made, and this little clipper did them justice.</li>
            <li> Great product, exactly what I have searched for to avoid rough cuts.</li>
            <li> This clipper is one of the finest I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;m a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I have been using Revlon Clippers (only 2 - I lost the first!) for over 40 years.  They were both satisfactory and I was happy with them.  Came across Seki when I was looking at a $65. Fingernail Clipper.  Cannot compare to the $65. one, but this Fingernail clipper is significantly better than any other Clipper I have used.  Nice sharp cuts.  Worth every penny.  Only criticism is the same one in many other reviews.  No nail file attached.  So, I also bought the Seki Curved file and it works better than any other nail file.  If my previous nail clippers have lasted as long as they have, I expect this one to last as long or longer.  Unless, I lose this one, will not have to buy another one.  May buy as gifts now.</li>
            <li> Very good build &amp; material quality. Amazingly sharp. Good buy. Recommended buy.</li>
            <li> When you try to buy nail clippers in a store, you find either really expensive sets, which I never buy, because I am cheap, or modestly priced, but very shoddy, and not sharp at all ones. These clippers are excellent! They are very sharp and well made, and you know they will last for a long time. I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Best quality nail clipper ever! I am very happy with my purchase and I would recommend it to everyone (-:</li>
            <li> Beside a very pleasant appearance, this clipper cuts fingernails neatly and effortlessly. I have used American, Korean, Brazilian and German clippers, but none of them even approach the performance of the Seki Edge. Its quality exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I have always used the cheap clippers from fleet farm or the ones you find in the bins right at the check out. But never again these are amazing they leave a smooth clean edge and don&#x27;t send the clippings flying.</li>
            <li> This is the best fingernail clipper I have ever used. My nails feel like they have been filed rather than merely clipped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I finally pulled the trigger and bought these.  Worth every penny I paid for this and the regular clippers.</li>
            <li> Who would&#x27;ve known something as trivial as a nail clipper can make a difference in one&#x27;s life? I&#x27;ve been using the cheap dollar nail clippers all my life and finally got tired of replacing them every year. Since I didn&#x27;t do any research, I just decided to buy the most popular nail clipper on Amazon and ended up with this. Upon first use, I was amazed at the quality and build of the product. The weight feels nice in the hand and the spring action is wonderful. The blades are amazingly sharp and cut through my nails with ease. No more carpal tunnel from struggling with cheap clippers! They also leave a nice finish that&#x27;s not sharp like some of the reviews have mentioned. Guess everyone&#x27;s nails are different. I highly recommend giving this product a try regardless of what people say. You don&#x27;t want to miss out on something great. I plan to buy a few more to gift to family members.</li>
            <li> Good vendor. The clipper is very sharp (easy press to clip) and its Stainless Steel (impervious to salt water.) I bought it for Scuba diving, instead of carrying a knife (dangerous and many dive boats don’t allow knives.) A nail clipper? HaHa; for defense from sharks? No, for monofilament fishing line. Safe and it easily snips the line. (I got snarled one time in old line wrapped around a coral head, scary, it’s almost impossible to see monofilament underwater.) Buddy cut me free with his knife with a lot of hacking. Oh yes, great for manicures too!</li>
            <li> One of the better nail clippers I have.  Cuts cleanly and without the crush.  I kind of wish the leaver were thinner and the length of the clipper though.</li>
            <li> Quality of cutting A++++. Wish that the head expanded a little more</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper is a solid feeling fingernail clipper that provides a nice clean cut.  A bit pricy compared to drug store clippers, but definitely worth it.  This is one clipper that will not need to be replaced.      I like to keep my clippers separate, but this fingernail clipper is more than adequate to act as a toenail clipper.  The cuts are so clean I never needed to file in conjunction with my cut.  However, if you like to file your clippings, you will need to invest in a separate file; a file is not built into this unit.</li>
            <li> Positives:&lt;br /&gt;* Super sharp and cuts easily with precision&lt;br /&gt;* Very high grade of stainless steel&lt;br /&gt;* Nice design, IMO&lt;br /&gt;* Enough heft to let you know this is solidly made with a comfortable feel&lt;br /&gt;* Swivels nicely without breaking apart like the cheap Walmart, Dollar store, pharmacy type of clipper&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives:&lt;br /&gt;* None, nada, zippo.  Well, maybe having to guard it from others in the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some commented on the price.  But given the craftsmanship and materials used, this is a bargain.  I easily went through three or more cheap clippers in a year, and even brand new they never performed anywhere near the Seki level.  There are an incredible amount of positive comments about this product that are well deserved.  Nobody offered anything better (aside from a \\&quot;mysterious\\&quot; german brand purchased eons ago).  A handful said \\&quot;cheaper ones\\&quot; are the same or better.  If you believe that, I have a bridge I can sell you in Brooklyn.  Once you try this clipper those sort of comments will cause you to LOL.&lt;br /&gt;It was almost as much fun throwing out the old nasty cheap clippers as using this little masterpiece.  Almost.  I took a sledge hammer to one of the truly nasty \\&quot;made in China\\&quot; R*vl*ns.  That felt great.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered another for my wife, and I will probably gift a few of these to friends and relatives.  Try it, you deserve it.  And nobody deserves the made in China ones.  Not even your worst enemy.</li>
            <li> These clippers are spectacular! It looks so simple but man is it worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I&#x27;m a guy with big hands and big feet. Consequently, my fingernails and toenails are also pretty big. I&#x27;m VERY used to doing the \\&quot;double clip\\&quot; on a single clipping because the clippers I&#x27;m using wouldn&#x27;t clip through my thick nail. With these Seki clippers, every clip is a clip. It always clips off on the first try. Man that is such a relief. I&#x27;ve hurt myself plenty of times in the past because of all the effort I&#x27;d put into the second and third tries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways... I am calling these \\&quot;nail clippers\\&quot; and not \\&quot;fingernail clippers\\&quot; because these can easily go through my gigantic toenails. They require almost no effort on my part at all!  I usually have to use generic toenail clippers on my fingers to get them to clip, so this is very welcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some negatives... Well they do not come with a metal file that I usually see on generic clippers. But then again, that isn&#x27;t what these are made for. If you got these quality clippers, you likely have a quality separate emery board or nail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I looked at the toenail clippers they have listed. There&#x27;s only about a .1 inch difference but that may be all that is needed. If you have smaller fingers and nails, these fingernail clippers can probably serve both your toes and fingers. I may end up getting the toenail clippers too, but these seem to get that done just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These will be the last clippers you ever buy!</li>
            <li> These are high quality clippers that will be appreciated by anyone who appreciates quality cutting tools.  They are butter smooth and appear as if they will last a lifetime.  These are pricy but the build quality backs up that high price.  I&#x27;m really not passionate about nail clippers and don&#x27;t give 5 stars lightly, but this is a well made product that deserves it.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer had said, it may seem crazy to rave about a nail clipper but for those with tough nails it&#x27;s a priority. This clipper is very well made and I&#x27;m sure will stand the test of time. Leaves a nice smooth edge.</li>
            <li> OK, I would not have thought that nail clippers are that different.  Tweezerman&#x27;s are darn good from other brands but I decided to try the Seki&#x27;s based on other reviews.  Glad I did.  These Seki&#x27;s cut like butter.  Very, very well made.</li>
            <li> Amazingly sharp and durable feeling. have had them for a couple months now and they are by far the best nail clippers I have ever had. You hardly have to push at all and they cut smoothly through even the thick thumb nails. No more ripping, tearing or jagged nails. I bought several $5 drug store clippers and now thanks to Seki Edge I will never have to again. Thanks Japan!</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper I have ever owned.  Well worth it.  Am thinking of purchasing the toenail clipper too.</li>
            <li> Superlative engineering.</li>
            <li> Great clippers.  They work!</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers mentioned, this is a well made and solid tool, feels good to hold and gives a solid snap when cutting. Does a fine job and appears built to last.</li>
            <li> A sharp improvement over run of the mill clippers.</li>
            <li> The bomb. Well constructed and very durable. Works well for delicate and stubborn nails. Once upon a time stuff like this was made in America.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit smaller than I expected, but does the job well enough.  Much sharper than stuff you get at your local store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 pairs of this brand (2 fingernail, one toenail)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, cuts cleanly and doesn&#x27;t leave the jagged edges left by cheaper brands.</li>
            <li> As usual fast and prompt service.  This clipper has the sharpest blades that you could want.  It is  made of stainless steel and has a nice weight instead of flimsy lightweight steel.  A very we&#x27;ll made, high quality product.</li>
            <li> It is sharp, strong and the blades are slightly wider and farther apart to accommodate larger or more curved nails.  It is comfortable to hold and doesn&#x27;t wobble.  It won&#x27;t do larger toenails, but I didn&#x27;t expect it would.</li>
            <li> Trimming nails is always a nuisance, this makes the process much more enjoyable. Very good quality</li>
            <li> Love these nail clippers. They are sharp and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Wow I know i&#x27;m going to sound like a parrot here but this is the best nail cutter I&#x27;ve ever used... It blows all other nail clippers out the water... It is a little small for toe nails but I dont know what else to say.. Don&#x27;t just say it is just another nail cutter and move on.. This really is different.. I know this is weird to say but it makes cutting your nails not as much of a chore as other cheap clippers do..</li>
            <li> I never thought that I would be reviewing a fingernail clipper but nevertheless here I am!  This clipper is excellent, high quality, heavy metal that seems as if it will last for ages!  Clips nicely, cuts nicely, and leaves your nails looking nice.  You are paying for quality here, and I would encourage anyone frustrated by a dull fingernail clipper that has quit working to pick this up and you will NOT be dissappointed!</li>
            <li> I actually look forward to clipping my nails now! Okay, maybe that is an exaggeration but being a male with thick, healthy fingernails, many other products caused me to need to clip twice to get it to work. This thing clips before I can even squeeze all the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product. Well made, ships fast and has a crisp matte finish.</li>
            <li> These are the best set of nail clippers that I have ever had, I keep finding the mini mart cheap ones hiding in different places and throw them out, they&#x27;re never as sharp as these clippers and no where near as comfortable or strong. If you&#x27;re looking for a set of nail clippers and don&#x27;t want to spend to much these are definitely the ones for you!</li>
            <li> cuts like a hot knife through butter! very smooth and clean. I love this brand and I bought some other stuff from them. The material is very durable, and very light. The best nail clipper I have used.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. It is the finest fingernail cutter on the market. I highly recommend purchasing Seki. No Cons were found.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used (I&#x27;m 62, I&#x27;ve used plenty including expensive ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about them is the ergonomics: they&#x27;re shaped in a way that makes holding them much easier than older traditional (even high end traditional) clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s worth trying them out, I&#x27;m guessing you&#x27;ll like using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just ordered another two for my travel kit and for my wife&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Very sharp. I hide this one from the family because the kids are always stealing clippers and then they are missing when I need one.  I just bought my second Seki fingernail Clipper because mine disappeared.  I guess I will have to find a better hiding place.</li>
            <li> This is a great nail clipper.  Revlon nail clipper used to be my go to clipper but these days the quality got so bad I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore and have been looking for a good one for about a year.  I think I finally found one.</li>
            <li> High Quality product !!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the nicest clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. It cuts clean, no jagged edges, but the grip could be better, it&#x27;s a little slippery and takes a few seconds to get a good, solid grip. Would be nice if it had a hole to put it on a chain or keyring.</li>
            <li> I originally bought these two years ago. Best nail clipper ever, super sharp and keeps the edge. I lost my pair and bought a new one right away. I think I lost that one too and I will definitely buy a third Seki Edge if I can&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> After years buying the 2/3 dollars clippers I bought a really terrible one. Then I decided to look up a better solution. I found this one and thought kind of funny how people gave excited reviews about it. Well, I am now one of them.&lt;br /&gt;This guy has an excellent grip and cuts my nails without chewing them.</li>
            <li> This and another Seki nail clippers are my favorites.  They come extremely sharp from the factory.  The fact that they are sharp makes for cuts that I don&#x27;t really have to use a file on.</li>
            <li> Very well built and work great!</li>
            <li> This thing makes clipping your nails effortless.  It&#x27;s a thousand times better than those cheap made-in-china ones that are sold everywhere.  Feels like it will last forever, so worth the extra expense up front.</li>
            <li> I never knew I needed this till I lost my last clipper that I keep in my backpack - they have a lot of uses besides nails.  No more cheapo clippers from Revlon etc.  I decided to look on Amazon as Walmart was out of stock on the one I wanted to try and found these.  The reviews looked good and although the price was a bit more than what I thought reasonable, I decided to give it a shot.  When I took them out of the box the first thing that impressed me was the obvious craftsmanship - you could tell they were well made and a quality item.  As far as clipping - I&#x27;m a guy so for me to say this means something - they are nail cutting nirvana.  You don&#x27;t realize how poorly those clippers you get in the big box stores are until you try something like this.  Then you realize how much those cheapo clippers flex, how they cut leaving a jagged edge, and how dull there blades are.  Dull blades and flexing handles lead to imprecise cutting - they&#x27;re like a car with sloppy springs and shocks that make it hard to drive precisely and quickly.  These Seki clippers cut quickly and precisely - I&#x27;d make the analogy that they are the Formula One version of clippers.  Very nice and worth the money - they are so good my wife stole mine and I had to get another pair.  They are also great for travel - I put zip ties on my check in luggage so I know if someone has opened the bags and whenever I get to my destination I&#x27;ve used the clippers in my backpack to clip the zip ties - normally this is an arduous affair as my old standby Revlon clippers take forever to cut the zip ties.  These go through in one quick cut - awesome.</li>
            <li> I like these so much I buy them as gifts. If I have to use any other nail clippers besides these, they&#x27;re just sad by comparison. These are really great for cutting through thick dude nails, too.</li>
            <li> AI always thought tone nail clippers were equal. WRONG! These cut through thick, brittle toe nails in snap....no pun intended. My daughter noticed their superior quality on the first try. I wish I had found them years ago.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper ever</li>
            <li> I was frustrated with the cutting quality and longevity of the el-cheapo fingernail clippers, so I decided to invest in something fancier. So far I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the extra 10 bucks. It is amazingly sharp, so I can cut my nails faster and more accurately. So far I don&#x27;t see any sign that it will lose its sharpness anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus, it is also more comfortable to hold and better looking than the el-cheapos out there...</li>
            <li> Before purchasing I was skeptical but now I can&#x27;t image ever using a simple convenient store nail clipper ever again. These are precise, sharp, and cut down on time to cut nails. They are very sharp compared to the simple/cheap convenient store type clippers so be careful the first few times using these. You will soon get use to them though and will never want to use any other type. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought these clippers to replace my trusty pair that I sadly and stupidly ran over.  As mentioned in most other reviews, they are very sharp and cut effortlessly.  I have two beefs with them though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the size of the lever relative to the base is a bit weird.  I&#x27;ve always used clippers where the lever was roughly the same size as the base.  The base on these is significantly longer than the lever.  That led to it feeling a little awkward in my hands and made it feel like it was harder to cut with precision than clippers I had previously used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it feels like the cutting edge isn&#x27;t curved enough.  The angle of the curve doesn&#x27;t match the shape of my fingertips so it&#x27;s a lot more difficult to get good clean even cuts the first time on the edges of the nails without having to do significant cleanup afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither of these flaws is enough to make me stop using them but if I had to buy again, I would probably try a different product because this one doesn&#x27;t seem to fit me well.</li>
            <li> good product, good material, well built, looks solid, sharp enough but its ends are somewhat thick to easily manipulate under nail. but still great product and will definitely use it.. thanks alot</li>
            <li> Great Product, cuts like butter through your nails.  Highly recommend.  I can never go back to the cheap clippers again</li>
            <li> Great - this thing is sharp and cutts tough nails like a snap.  Well machined and hand sharpened &#x3D; better than ones that are for sale in your local drug store.</li>
            <li> Good quality clippers.  But not for very short nails!  If you have to trim your nails below the skin line, meaning no free-edge, these are NOT for you!  I am a massage therapist so I cannot have ANY nail.  (I test by digging my nails into the inside of my arm.  If my nails leave marks, they are too long!)  I should have listened to the gentleman who stated this earlier, but they looked like the ones I was using now so I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot.  Nope, he was right!  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT HIGH QUALITY ITEM</li>
            <li> Bullet proof clippers that seem like they will last a long time....</li>
            <li> I am not a beauty expert. I have not used very many pairs of nail clippers throughout my life. In fact, all of the ones I have used were almost certainly way too dull. Any nail clippers I bought from the store were extremely cheap. Also, I&#x27;m male, though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s important for this item. However, I think my use case represents a pretty large portion of the population who needs nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the clippers I&#x27;ve used before, these are magical. Expensive, yes, but wonderful. They&#x27;re sharp and cut very easily. Before, I would put off clipping my nails, and I developed a habit of biting my fingernails to avoid having to sit down and actually maintain them. While I still catch myself chewing out of habit, these clippers have made it effortless to switch over to proper nail care. They&#x27;ve upgraded my quality of life. I assumed that nail clipping was just something annoying that everyone had to put up with, but it turns out the process can actually be effortless--almost fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they could stand to be a smidgen wider, but that&#x27;s not enough of an issue to take off a star.</li>
            <li> Bought on a whim, I figured I&#x27;d try a quality clipper for once rather than the super cheap ones. Turns out you get what you pay for. These have a good feel in the hand, no rust, no falling apart, good quick cut. I have no experience with other quality nail clippers to compare to, but these are certainly worth owning a pair of.</li>
            <li> I have always wanted some good nail clippers.  In my profession I have to keep my nails clipped short.  The clippers you buy at the drugstore or discount stores tear nails more than clip them.  I always end up having to file my nails afterward to get a smooth edge.  But the Seki Edge stainless steel fingernail clipper changed all that.  I bought these, along with the Seki toenail clippers, about a year or two ago.  I will never use another clipper again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers are very sharp.  They cleanly clip, and do not tear, your nail.  The edge is very smooth.  You can sand the edge afterward if you want, but you won&#x27;t need to do so with these clippers.  They are also very ergonomic.  I have arthritis in my hands, but these clippers are easy to use.  Their only negative is they lack a little tool to clean any debris from under the nail like the cheap clippers usually have, but that is a small annoyance for such a high quality clipper.  They are expensive, but if you want quality nail clippers that leave a nice, clean edge these are the ones to buy.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d write a review for a fingernail clipper but this one is worth writing about. It is sharp and sturdy and I have recommended it to several people (who&#x27;da thunk?). Have had mine for a couple of years and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> This is totally awesome... I can&#x27;t believe it. Back in Kazakhstan, we all use goats to cut our nail size. But after coming to USA, there are no goats, so I used to bite off my nail and it was very hard. This thing is the best invention ever. It was complicated to figure out how to use it.. but the design is awesome. I will take many back to Kazakhstan.</li>
            <li> This clipper clips. It is not a drugstore clipper for which one has to wonder whether nails might need to be made of something else or shaped differently for the clipper to work effectively. While I am sure it is possible to live without a great clipper - having done so for decades - and there may be less expensive clippers that are as effective - I am not planning to become a clipper test mule - it is more than safe to say that this clips nails easily and cleanly.</li>
            <li> High quality, very sharp. Looks like it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> So sharp! And haven&#x27;t dulled yet and it&#x27;s been 9 months. Best nail clippers I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Folks may think it&#x27;s silly to spend so much on this.  But no recent department or drug store clipper I&#x27;ve used has worked nearly as well as the 30+ year old, made-in-USA one we lost a few years ago.  Clippers we tried would leave chipped edges, require too much pressure, have poor accuracy, etc.  However, these are just great, both the build quality and functionally.  After using these once my wife changed from \\&quot;That&#x27;s too expensive\\&quot; to \\&quot;Why didn&#x27;t you get the toenail clippers at the same time?\\&quot; :-).  These are like a high-quality shop tool...you pay for the quality but it does the job extremely well, feels good in the hand, and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these for different keychains in the family.  You need to get a size 7 or 8 split ring and attach it thru the Seki&#x27;s handle slot. The handle lever clears the slots so it does not rest on the split ring and the lever closes all the way flat.  WIth most other clippers, the lever handle hits the keyring attachment and so the lever is always shifted to the left or right.  These are first rate clippers.  They look cool too!</li>
            <li> Quality product, makes trimming nails quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several clippers quickly because my fingernails grow quickly.  This is the best set I have ever purchased.  Very well made and sharp.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Superb quality and easily cuts the finger nails without using any force, or having to twist it upside-down to get a clean cut.</li>
            <li> Great set of nail clippers. You can see and feel the quality when you cut with them. In fact, your nails end up being much more neatly trimmed with these. They work equally well on fingernails and toenails.</li>
            <li> This is a good fingernail clipper. I got sucked into the raving reviews and the fact that it looked so fancy. I thought it would change my nail clipping life, but it did not. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s a good nail clipper and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last longer than any of the cheaper ones you can find in the drugstore, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting the cheaper ones that work pretty well for a few years and then just replace them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t get the product again, but maybe I won&#x27;t need to!</li>
            <li> It matched the toenail clipper and its a &amp;#34;set&amp;#34; so I bought them at the same time worked out great it clips fingernails</li>
            <li> I stun myself at times by actually responding to requests for reviews. In this case a nail clipper should fall into the category of &amp;#34;too much information&amp;#34;  but this clipper is excellent. It is easy too use, sturdy and very sharp. In other  words it works as designed. This is redundant but not so; many clippers available at CVS and Walgreen do not work well leaving a less than coveted result.</li>
            <li> I bought a set of these nail clippers for my husband a good year or two ago, and they still work just as well as the day we got them. They cut extremely well, are sturdy, and look pretty sleek too. Definitely worth the money; they will last for years.</li>
            <li> Would have liked a file to be part of this.</li>
            <li> I pretty much only use these because they&#x27;re stainless steel and I clip my nails in the tub when they&#x27;re soft so they don&#x27;t chip or fly across the room. I am a woman with medium width nails and I love the size of these clippers. But they aren&#x27;t sharp.. at all. They pull on my nail and tear it. Its just odd because really they seem well made but when you look at the blade, it actually appears rigid. Its a total ripoff. Majorly bummed. Since I probably wont keep using them, I splurged on trash.. because I&#x27;d never spend this much on a pair of clippers. It was just something that was important to me because I like having nice nails but I hate actually doing them and I thought this might help a girl out.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers for fingernails.  Well made and very sharp.  Their only weakness is they are a little slippery to hold.</li>
            <li> okay, nail clippers are not all the same and yes you can clip your nails with the drug store brands or even some higher end brands but once you use this you&#x27;ll know the difference. noticeably for me was how i barely had had to file my nails after using this clipper. it&#x27;s precise enough that you don&#x27;t really need a nail file. i keep my nails short and this is worth ever penny.</li>
            <li> This is my second pair.  I lost the first one.  These are 3x the cheapo clippers but worlds better.  The cuts are exact and precise.</li>
            <li> best brand, easiest to use, easy on the hands..little pressure!</li>
            <li> Very sharp! I like that it cuts the nail so smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;With other clippers there is a loud click as it snaps through the nail and send it flying.&lt;br /&gt;Not the Seki. Just a smooth cut that drops the trimmed peice right in front of the fingertip.</li>
            <li> quality craftsmanship</li>
            <li> Quality nail clippers like this cannot be found at you corner Walgreens or CVS.  The last good nail clipper that I purchased at a retail store was many years ago, it was Korean made.  The clippers in the stores now are junk, including an overpriced Revlon brand.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  Thought I&#x27;d try some new clippers and these are incredibly sharp.  Well worth the money</li>
            <li> It is a sad situation when you have to pay this much money for a fingernail clipper.  However, I guess the old adage is still true -- you get what you pay for these days...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stainless steel nail clipper is a true precision cutting instrument, and it works GREAT!  It is extremely sharp, and the cutting edges are perfectly aligned.  I found the clipper to be ergonomically correct, and it is a little larger than the usual fingernail clippers that you will find in a drug store.  That makes this fingernail clipper a little easier to hold and operate.  The net result is that your nails will be cut in an effortless manner with a very smooth edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI, this nail clipper is made and assembled in Japan, and it is branded with the registered trademark name:  Seki Edge.  However, the Japanese company that actually manufactured this nail clipper is a very well established Japanese firm known as Green Bell, which is located in Seki City, Japan.  Green Bell is an outstanding Japanese company that is well known for making high precision cutting instruments and the very finest personal grooming tools.  I&#x27;ve owned other Green Bell products, and I always thought they were great.  Hence, I was EXTREMELY pleased when I saw the Green Bell logo stamped on the bottom base of this nail clipper. What a pleasant surprise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Stop reading all of the Amazon product reviews and BUY THIS ONE.  It is a high quality cutting instrument, and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My husband was so disappointed in all the clips he had. Some were from expensive kits. He loves these. We ordeed,r (2) will be ordering more so we will never use another set of dull clippers again.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived as expected, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Took me nearly 50 years to find these. Excellent product. Will never waste money on another brand.</li>
            <li> My wife recently bought these [[ASIN:B000F35R00 Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clippers]] at the same time as buying [[ASIN:B00GQ0GD4A Clyppi Fingernail Clippers]].  Both are excellent clippers and deserving of their high ratings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if I had to choose between them, I think I would go for the Seki.  They are slightly heavier (32 grams vs. 25 grams) so feel ever-so more sturdy, have a 50% taller opening (making nail positioning that much easier) and are a couple of dollars less expensive (at the time of this review writing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t go wrong with either, but if are looking for the best, go for the Seki.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and cut well.  They have a little to wide of a span for smaller hands.</li>
            <li> Very clean and precise cut and well built. I was worried this wasn&#x27;t going to be better than the generic nail clipper but it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> First of all this thing is like a piece of artwork, and looks very sleek. Aside from that it does an amazing job clipping nails. It is very solidly built, good materials, sharp, and you don&#x27;t have to really put pressure against the nail at all. This prevents cracking and things that cheap clippers can cause. Is does not have a piece for cleaning under the nail, but is still well worth the price. Buy these, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes. I am OCD about my nails and was really looking forward to getting these. You can imagine my disappointment when they arrived and the first cut I made (on the skin around the cuticle), ripped the skin instead of making a clean cut. This happened each time I tried them, so I grabbed my magnifying glass and my fear was confirmed. The cutting edges were visibly mis-aligned. I pulled out my trusty $3 clippers that always cut cleanly and looked at them under the magnifying glass to verify what I already knew... the edges were aligned perfectly. Needleass to say I sent these back. Maybe it wa a fluke, but I dont understand how the edge can be hand finished and be that far off.</li>
            <li> The heading says it all.  It does an excellent job, effortlessly.  I can easily recommend it to anyone.  Good job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a bad habit like most people and I bite my nails. One way to break that habit is to have a nail clipper handy when you get the urge to chomp away. Well, that is how I&#x27;ve been doing it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are very well made. Defiantly the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever seen or used. I&#x27;d recommend these to anyone who has finger nails.</li>
            <li> Before this, I never used a clipper any better than the ones you find hanging from a pegboard at the Dairy Mart. These Seki clippers are a world apart from those pretenders.  If you have fingernails, buy these.</li>
            <li> Best nail cutter i have owned. Pricey but worth it. Edge is sharp and cut is clean. No complaints at this time</li>
            <li> bad don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Another great product from Seki.</li>
            <li> It works. But it&#x27;s super expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen tons of better and cheaper nail clippers in Walmart. Just pass around I buy one.</li>
            <li> These were well worth the money. Always purchased under five dollar pairs before. They cut so clean and effortlessly, even hard nails. Will buy another pair if any thing happens to these.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent $14 on a fingernail clipper, but you definitely get what you paid for. I&#x27;ve been using this since January and it still cuts just as sharp as when I first bought it. Definitely worth the money and will steer clear of the cheap ones from the dollar store.</li>
            <li> clipper was excellent</li>
            <li> i hesitated on buying this. stupidly. i even bought the pair of stainless steel finger and toe nail clippers carried by Amazon, that is cheaper. they don&#x27;t compare. this thing slices through my nails like a warm knife through butter. no comparison to even other higher-end clippers. do it. buy it.</li>
            <li> Well, I never thought I&#x27;d be writing a raving review of finger nail clippers, but here we are. I&#x27;ve used these a few times since I got them from Amazon and I seriously have never used clippers that even come close to these. They take almost zero pressure to clip through the nail and are fairly comfortable to hold in your hand. I&#x27;ve always been a Walgreens or CVS nail clipper guy, but if only I had known that these existed. Granted, they&#x27;re at least double the price of the cheapo brands, but I&#x27;ve gone through enough of the cheap ones to make up the cost difference. Plus, they&#x27;re nail clippers, they&#x27;ll last a while.</li>
            <li> Very well made with an excellent sharp cutting edge.  Should last a lifetime the way it is built.  Well worth it.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend makes fun of me for getting so excited about a pair of nail clipped, but my god, these guys provide the sharpest clip I&#x27;ve ever experienced. As someone who takes their nail clipping seriously, you&#x27;re doing yourself a disservice if you don&#x27;t own these guys.</li>
            <li> These clipper are well made that&#x27;s for sure.  The cutting on the other hand (no pun intended), is a little sharp and straight.  It cuts the nail at an angle that requires you to use a file after cutting, which I have never done in the past.  I guess it&#x27;s not too bad, just requires a little more time.  If I don&#x27;t file my nails after using there clippers they tend to flake up around the edges.</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> And very well made, unlike the clippers I&#x27;ve been using my whole life. I&#x27;m certain these will last for many years to come.</li>
            <li> I never realized that paying a little more for tweezers and nail clippers would make so much difference.  I used to fight with the cheaper ones to get the job done, but these clippers are so sharp and precise.  I will definitely buy them again.  They also would make nice stocking stuffers for the holidays next year.</li>
            <li> Really well crafted. Seems genuine and long lasting. I am not sure what else can be said, its a nail clipper. Better than any Made in China crap.</li>
            <li> really nice clippers, but I think it is overpriced.  I ordered this because I got tired of having the clipper handle pop off the body when you rotate them.  On this one, it is solid.  No issue there.  The design takes getting used to.  The clipper moves smoothly.  however, the handle is angled up high and is long.  It makes it difficult to hold.  It does provide more leverage when cutting.  It almost feels like it was designed for someone else to use to cut your fingernails.  My fingers don&#x27;t open that wide normally when I am using a clipper.  I would have liked a stud or mechanism to keep the clipper handle from sliding around.  I would also have liked the clipper to have a keyrig hole instead of slits.</li>
            <li> Works better than any clippers I&#x27;ve used before, and feels like they&#x27;re built to last. An inexpensive luxury I use every week.</li>
            <li> Have not used it yet but can tell they are well made just by holding them.  Heavy and solid material.</li>
            <li> These clippers work awesome!!!  I have purchased so many clippers recently over the counter and they just don&#x27;t cut clean.  They leave your nails kind of rigid.  These cut crisp and clean!!  Love them!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve worked your way through a bunch of ordinary nail clippers that eventually lose sharpness or make unclean cuts, you might feel like you&#x27;re ready for the real deal. This stainless steel nail clipper hails from Japan, straight from the forge of Hattori Hanzo. As an anecdote for how sharp it is, samurai use it to cut their toe nails. Right from the package, it looks and feels significant. The blade is sharp, the hinge is smooth and doesn&#x27;t shift, all leading to a clean, decisive cut. It&#x27;s design is clearly calculated for those with no time to waste, where one second could spell the difference between life and death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t expect any features and frills, like a nail collector that never works. It doesn&#x27;t even have a nail filer, although you won&#x27;t really need one. This is a tool. It is simple, effective; it tells people that you mean business, and that you&#x27;re not afraid to do a little cutting to get where you want in life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true, you get what you pay for and for me these are such awesome clippers I&#x27;m considering buying a second one and stashing it away in case I lose the current one.</li>
            <li> These are great nail clippers...  they leave a nice clean edge, no tearing...  exactly what nail clippers are supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I have a pair (?) of these and ordered another in case I lose them. They&#x27;ve held up for a couple of years so far and work for both my fingernails and toenails. They are slightly larger than your usual drugstore type nail clipper. The nail is left clean with no rough edges. They are the best I&#x27;ve every used!</li>
            <li> Instead of pinching until nail cuts, this clipper cuts the nail so well that it doesnt go flying, cut through nail like nothing is there.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp. Wish the end was a little wider since is smaller clipper and the lever would be easier to control.</li>
            <li> Took a really long time to choose because I really did not want to have to return it.  I hate having to do that.  Wonderful product! Choose it because it came frrom Japan and not China.  As a child the best personal tools were from Japan &amp; they are still great.  Only wish that there was a file attached to clean under the nail.</li>
            <li> Exquisite. Save on the nail filer and buy this. The edge is so sharp that it cuts without any burrs. Sure it is expensive, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used and I have ingrown toenails which can be tough beasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are nicely textured and very sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how people wrote multiple paragraphs about them but for me suffice it to say that these are really the only clippers I want to use into the future.</li>
            <li> I have not been happy with the finger nail clippers, purchased at drug stores,  for decades. Toe nail clippers, yes, finger nail clippers, no. Finally, I have found finger nail clippers that easily do the job for my old fingers. I only wish I had stumbled upon them sooner. Easily worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the highest quality fingernail clipper I have ever used.  I highly recommend this clipper to others.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This clipper is very sharp and well made.  I also own the toe nail clipper and it works great too.  Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Although it does not have a file, it is otherwise easily the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves a fairly sharp edge after clipping, and you will need to buff that down a bit to avoid scratching yourself.  Everything works smoothly and efficiently, and is easuly held and used by the weaker hand.  Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Is a wonderful tool for arthritic fingers.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  They cut very decisively and the oversized bottom grip helps immensely with precision. They are easy to hold as well.  I do not have thick or difficult nails.  However, these trimmers are the best I have used.</li>
            <li> What everyone says is true...these clippers truly do work way better than anything else you&#x27;ve probably tried. My whole family loves them, including my kids! Need to order more now...</li>
            <li> Great set of clippers, very sharp, and very sturdy feeling. Nice clean cuts.</li>
            <li> These are incredible products.  Great steel, precision machining and great cutters.  These cost more than the cheap made-in-China stuff, but substantially better.</li>
            <li> Yes, it cuts the nails well.  yes, it is stainless steel.  But frankly speaking did not find it worth 14 us$.  I did not return it as its too cumbersome and too small a product to return.  I suggest do not waste money on this.  Their are cheaper cutters which will do the same work for 1/3rd the price.  Giving it 3 starts because it does the job BUT not worth the extra cost.</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest clippers I have ever had.  I have very strong finger nails and these will cut right through them without tearing the nail.  The weight and finish is excellent.  I gave them a 4 because they could be a little longer for easier handling.</li>
            <li> These are awesome clippers.  I never thought I&#x27;d pay this much for a pair, but now that I have them you&#x27;ll never find me buying the .99 ones at the drug stores ever again.  They seem to stay super sharp and actually cut instead of tear.  They also have a nice weight to them, don&#x27;t rust so must actually be a good grade of stainless, and appear to be made very well.  Extremely happy with these.</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I have ever used. Solid lever, no bending at all. Cuts nails so cleanly, you barely have to file them.</li>
            <li> Absolute best quality nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> really nicely made and super easy to use. love it.</li>
            <li> I wish everything was designed with this attention to detail and craftsmanship. Bargain.</li>
            <li> These are great! Very sharp! Well worth the price!</li>
            <li> much better than cheap old clippers....just don&#x27;t loose them</li>
            <li> This is a a top tier nail clipper. Finger nails can be tricky to cut and this does a wonderful job. Anyway, this is well made and will last for years. I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> One of the nicest quality clippers I have ever had. I think this product is worth the price and I would recommend it. I have been using it over a month and no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> The best nail clipper you will ever own. This nail clipper is sharp like a razor and it stays sharp for a long long time. I own this nail clipper for over two years now and it is still sharp. Before I bought this nail clipper, I used to own Zwilling Ultra Slim clipper. The Zwilling Ultra Slim clipper looks great and slim, but it doesn&#x27;t cut nails very well like this Seki Edge.</li>
            <li> I have used nail scissors and file for years.  With this clipper I just make 2-3 cuts and finish off the rough edges.  My nails don&#x27;t split as much trimming with this clipper.</li>
            <li> Based on all the great reviews, I thought this was a no brainer decision, but I found my nails are too thick to easily insert into the clipper.</li>
            <li> These are so sturdy they make all the clippers you buy at the grocery store or drugstore feel like junk.  The edges are very sharp and cut nails like a hot knife through butter. The ridges in the clipper make it easy to hold on. My wife loved them so much she bought two more pairs and threw all our old ones out!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I can add anything new to the rest of the positive reviews, except to say they ARE worth the price!  I&#x27;ll never go back to buying cheap nail clippers.  You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Cuts with ease! I questioned myself for the price of the clippers, but when I received them I understood! They are wonderful!</li>
            <li> good product  and service</li>
            <li> Is not as sharp as my old one and has an uneven edge. Maybe I just got a bad one, but its pretty much worthless.</li>
            <li> Another fine Seki clipper to go along with the two different Sekis I already had.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe anyone could make a fingernail clipper that compels me to leave a glowing 5 star review. This fingernail clipper is in a class of it&#x27;s own. Until you buy it and use it you will have had no idea that clipping your nails could be such a pleasant experience. Don&#x27;t ever buy another cheapo fingernail clippers, seriously.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and goes through nails smoothly. The width of the blades is a little less than standard clippers that  you&#x27;d buy in the drugstore, even though the quality is much higher.  Unless you have particularly small fingernails you might consider something with a little wider head.</li>
            <li> It is well built and should last much longer than the cheap ones at the drug store.  The problem is that it is harder to manipulate and to get under the nail for those who keep their nails short.  If your sick of cheapies fallinf apart, go ahead and buy this one.</li>
            <li> Really high quality and well-made. Only drawback is the missing file/nail pick. They cut consistently well and are made of a nice, solid material.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers ever made.  ENOUGH SAID!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Where have these been all my life?!?! I won&#x27;t be buying any more of those 99 cent clippers at the drug store than mangle my nails. What a difference quality clippers make!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male that doesn&#x27;t care too much about this kind of thing.  I was a little skeptical of this product, but I had some money to burn.  I decided to order this and was pretty happy with it.  I&#x27;ll order it again if I ever lose this product.</li>
            <li> Should have come with a fold out file.</li>
            <li> You haven&#x27;t trimmed your nails until you use these clippers.  I was using some terrible $3 clippers from the auto parts store checkout counter.  It&#x27;s like going from a Yugo to a Ferrari.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THESE FOR MY TWIN DAUGHTERS, THAT WAY COULD HAVE A COLOR OF CHOIVE. WORK VERYWELLFOR POCKET CAMERAS.</li>
            <li> very sharp and durable. they aren&#x27;t cheap, but you get what you pay for. The ones sold at Wally world don&#x27;t even work, but these are exactly what you need</li>
            <li> great! mom has arthritis in her hands and this clipper is well designed enough for her to use it w/o any issues.</li>
            <li> The metal is not comfortable.  The cutter is not contoured enough and the clip is too heavy.  Very awkward to use. Completely over rated.</li>
            <li> Amazing and well worth the money.  I have three different models of Seki nail clippers and they are simply the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> We lost the good pair of clippers and the crap pair we had left were driving me batty. I hopped on Amazon, and as is my usual path ended up spending a good amount of time reading reviews and up-selling myself to 5 times my original budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was worth it. I have never used good clipper before apparently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the count down to losing them begins!</li>
            <li> These clippers are okay!</li>
            <li> Very precise &amp; sharp .</li>
            <li> My husband has always had a problem with fingernail biting and this keeps him from doing it as he carries it with him everywhere and anytime he gets a hangnail or anything else he uses this right away.  Works beautifully.</li>
            <li> These are bigger and clunkier than clippers you can get for a fraction of the price. I was curious how the best selling nail clippers on Amazon handled, and I could not be more disappointed. This one lasts longer? I&#x27;d be happier buying five cheaper, easier to use clippers than this. Would not recommend at all.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  From the first time taken out of the container, I could feel the quality.  Once used, they passed that quality on to the actual physical action.  They are &amp;#34;GREAT.&amp;#34;  I highly recommend.  I use them on my toe nails as well and they work perfect!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. You&#x27;ll never buy another nail clipper. This is a quality product made with quality materials and quality craftsmanship.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have owned.</li>
            <li> The nail clipper works really well. It makes cutting nails very clean, fast, and easy. It has a smooth surface and looks stylish too. I love it!</li>
            <li> These do seem like quality clippers and they arrived super sharp. I&#x27;ll have to see how it lasts. I was surprised (and knocked a star off because of it) that these clippers didn&#x27;t have a little flip-out nail file. I keep my old clippers around just so I can use the file/scraper thing.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. My nails are very thick and difficult to cut. These are amazing in that they take very little pressure to use and cut cleanly. I couldn&#x27;t recommend these any more highly.</li>
            <li> Seki is the best.  Thanks for fast delivery</li>
            <li> The Best! This is by far the best nail clipper that I have ever used. Very precise and clean, so much nicer that even the $8.00 - $10.00 clippers that you find in stores. I bought this on a whim mostly because I was wondering if someone could really make a more precise and clean cutting nail clipper and I have found this to be true. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Purchased along with the matching jumbo-sized neanderthal toe-nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blade is sharp, and build quality is solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The width and curvature of the blade does not seem to be appropriate for my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; size hands. have to make several cuts along the nail and you end up with a nail more akin to a stop sign than a smooth arc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going into the trash, and getting replaced with the el cheapo Revlon clippers that you can find in the drugstore (and certainly here at Amazon too).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those rare purchases that is inexpensive enough that you should do it where you can see the product in person before deciding to buy.</li>
            <li> great clippers , they are easy to use, steady and cut really well</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this nail clipper.  It works so well.  I let a few of my friends try this out, and they were so impressed.  I will probably purchase a few more for friends and family.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and cut the nails without requiring much pressure, but I have found that to be a bit of a problem with trying to keep my nails short. The blade is too large to clip corners without grabbing a piece of skin. Sometimes you don&#x27;t notice that you have skin in the clipper until you get cut. I am still using my old clippers at times because of this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d expensive for a clipper, but I&#x27;ve never owned one that clips half way as good as this.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper money can buy. The action is smooth and quick and precise. It also feels good in the hand. So much better than a dollar store clipper. I&#x27;ve been giving them to family members who like to &amp;#34;borrow&amp;#34; mine! Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> was expecting a little better based on reviews but it does what it says</li>
            <li> Excellent! The blade is really sharp and cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> The one I got is very dull, unlucky purchase.:(</li>
            <li> Great.  Best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I have ever had, very sharp</li>
            <li> these are the best nail clippers in the universe</li>
            <li> I bought at least five clippers to determine which was best and none even approached this one for quality of construction and sharpness.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper i have try! cuts so nicely.... I will be buying products from Seki</li>
            <li> great quality clippers</li>
            <li> I found these after my last $5 drugstore clippers started ripping my nails instead of cutting them and I&#x27;m not sorry.  I&#x27;ve only used these a few times so I guess the test of time is to be seen, but they feel different.  They are sturdy in my hand but not too big and it&#x27;s obvious which is the top side of the clipper, something I have trouble with.  They clip quickly, without hesitation, and do it cleanly.  They are only open a little bit so they are not suitable for clipping my thick toenails, so I&#x27;ve ordered the toenail clippers also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll give you an update if I become less happy with these.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper ever had.</li>
            <li> these cutters are Sharp. really sharp she loves my hands now</li>
            <li> These are the best nail clippers I have ever had. They are comfortable to work with and super sharp.</li>
            <li> These are absolutely fantastic nail clippers.  The edges are so sharp that you could actually clip your nails without needing to file them afterwards.  My husband loves them so much he refuses to carry them in his pocket for fear of losing them.  Solution, I ordered him a second pair.</li>
            <li> I use these for fingernails and toenails. They clip cleanly and effortlessly. I agree with what some other reviewers have said that they are a little awkward to hold at first, but I think it is just an impression that takes a bit of getting used to and doesn&#x27;t actually affect it&#x27;s functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about deducting a single star since these do not seem to trim hangnails as effortlessly. I did not because these are not called &amp;#34;Hangnail clippers&amp;#34; they are fingernail clippers. I have either a separate pair that does the job just fine. I wonder if cheaper clippers use a sharper angle that cut hangnails easier, but then lose their edge and don&#x27;t work as well after a time, whereas I expect these to last as long as I can keep track of them.</li>
            <li> This clipper is replacing a Tweezerman clipper that I bought at a CVS some two years ago. Compared to the Tweezerman clippers -- which set me back $12 -- these clippers are way better despite being about the same price. They have a heavier and more solid feel, leading me to believe they are more durable and of superior construction to their Tweezerman counterparts. Of course, only time will tell for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starts, these clippers definitely clip much better than my Tweezerman&#x27;s did out-of-the-box and they are light-years ahead of those cheap generics. The rounded contour of these clippers is perfect for progressively clipping nails while keeping the nail itself more-or-less rounded; all my previous clippers have been \\&quot;straight\\&quot; in comparison, and would always produce annoyingly sharp points and \\&quot;polygonal\\&quot; nails. Consequently, these are probably the first clippers I&#x27;ve used where I don&#x27;t feel an all-consuming urge to file my nails right after clipping them; the clippers are able to produce a smooth enough cut free of sharp points that I am okay with not filing my nails down to smooth them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but I believe the rounded countour is also what makes these the first clippers I&#x27;ve ever used where I don&#x27;t tend to accidentally \\&quot;overcut\\&quot; my nails and expose the more sensitive flesh at the tip of my finger. This is an issue which, in the past, would leave me with sore tips for a day or two thereafter. As a guitar player, I prefer to keep my fingernails short so I can grip my strings better (the longer my nails, the more they would dig into my fretboard and \\&quot;push\\&quot; my fingers away from the strings slightly... a feeling I greatly dislike). Overcutting my nails and playing the guitar would make this a painful endeavor and I had long woed being unable to clip my nails and play guitar comfortably immediately afterwards. This clipper solves that issue beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clippers lack a nail-catcher which is perfectly okay for me as I would rarely use nail-catchers on my previous clippers anyways. While nail-catchers are somewhat effective, I&#x27;ve noticed they always get in the way of seeing what I&#x27;m actually cutting (leading to poor cuts or overcuts). Given that nail-catchers don&#x27;t catch all the nails, and I have a tendency to tip my cutter downwards which would always result in caught clippings falling out, the inconveniences of all the nail-catchers I&#x27;ve used over the years far outweigh the actual convenience of having one. It&#x27;s always seemed more reasonable to cut my nails over a small garbage can and then vacuum the spot afterwards to clean up any clippings that might have gone flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s worth noting that though Seki sells a toe-nail clipper, for me these fingernail clippers are more than adequate for my toes as well. I&#x27;m not sure what other people&#x27;s toenails are like, but all my toes -- with the exception of my big toes -- have nails that are smaller than my fingernails. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay $15 or so for another bigger \\&quot;toenail\\&quot; clipper when I&#x27;d probably only use it to cut my big toe-nails. Based on that, these fingernail clippers make great toenail clippers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, these are excellent nail-clippers. I&#x27;d been wanting clippers like this for a long time, and I finally got &#x27;em!I would rarely use nail-catchers on my previous clippers anyways. While nail-catchers are somewhat effective, I&#x27;ve noticed they always get in the way of seeing what I&#x27;m actually cutting (leading to poor cuts or overcuts). Given that nail-catchers don&#x27;t catch all the nails, and I have a tendency to tip my cutter downwards which would always result in caught clippings falling out, the inconveniences of all the nail-catchers I&#x27;ve used over the years far outweigh the actual convenience of having one. It&#x27;s always seemed more reasonable to cut my nails over a small garbage can and then vacuum the spot afterwards to clean up any clippings that might have gone flying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it&#x27;s worth noting that though Seki sells a toe-nail clipper, for me these fingernail clippers are more than adequate for my toes as well. I&#x27;m not sure what other people&#x27;s toenails are like, but all my toes -- with the exception of my big toes -- have nails that are smaller than my fingernails. It doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay $15 or so for another bigger \\&quot;toenail\\&quot; clipper when I&#x27;d probably only use it to cut my big toe-nails. Based on that, these fingernail clippers make great toenail clippers as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, these are excellent nail-clippers. I&#x27;d been wanting clippers like this for a long time, and I finally got &#x27;em!</li>
            <li> So pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fingernail clipping used to be fun.  When I had a great clipper, that is.  But, I went for the $1.99 store specials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I was happy, for a day or two.  But like a summer hookup with that cute boy / girl at the snack shack, things never lasted that long.  The relationship turned dull, bitter, and biting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along came the Seki. Not to be confused with Seka.  Those of you who know, grin a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is da bomb.  It is compact, gives good cut, and a satisfying click.  Hard to beat that.  Well worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> Husband tells me these are the world&#x27;s best nail clippers. Perhaps that opinion is due to our possession of some really crappy clippers he used for comparison. Perhaps not. They really are strikingly better than the junk for sale at the local Wal-Mart. I hesitated at their price. Spend the money. They&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are expensive but they work great. I&#x27;ve never used a pair this good in my live. I can feel the quality every time I touch them. If you&#x27;re willing to pay a high price, I don&#x27;t think you can do batter than this.</li>
            <li> Works as mentioned by other 5 * raters. Leaves nail very smooth after the cut. so much so that you may skip to file the nail. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: It does come with a filer in the internal side of the lever. some nail cutter come with a file.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several clippers in the past year and they were either too difficult to maneuver or they just shredded my nails. I was buying the &amp;#34;best&amp;#34; and most expensive clippers I could find and disappointed every single time. These are easy to use, comfortable in your hands, and sharp enough to make clean cuts. Someone else&#x27;s review said that they couldn&#x27;t cut their nails short with these. My own nails were damaged by acrylics and I can&#x27;t leave any white or they will get caught on stuff, tear, or peel. These clippers clean them up. I don&#x27;t have to feel bad about my nails every time I look at them or feel their edges anymore.</li>
            <li> hands down the sharpest easiest you will EVER use</li>
            <li> Great clipper, very accurate and easy to use. Very precise.</li>
            <li> Sharp and feels comfortable</li>
            <li> These are the best clippers ever seen in my house.  Don&#x27;t try to buy any at Walgreens or typical retail store. These are the answer hands down.  Outstanding quality</li>
            <li> Cutting is easy and edges are sharp. The cutting edges are a bit narrow for toes or larger fingers</li>
            <li> Each of us has certain tools or accessories in which we are more or less interested than the average person.  Maybe you&#x27;re totally wrapped up in finding \\&quot;the ultimate hammer\\&quot; where, to me, it&#x27;s no big deal.  I suspect that I am a lot more interested in a quality nail clipper than the average person who&#x27;s sufficiently satisfied with the chrome plated items we find in most drugstores and grocery stores.  If the average nail clipper you find in the local store is good enough for you, then there&#x27;s no reason to read this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I find the typical chrome plated, \\&quot;inexpensive\\&quot; nail clipper to be utterly maddening.  Why?  A) the chrome plating often starts falling off before you even open the package and it begins to fall off even faster when you begin using the clippers; B) the cutting edge on most brands is utterly inconsistent.  If I buy two pair of a given brand, I find one clips just fine while the second gets about half way through my nail and decides it&#x27;s just too much work and I end up tearing the nail instead of clipping it.  C)  The clippers tend to fall apart WAY too fast, with the thumb lever becoming loose and wobbly in no time.  D)  The metal is such low quality that any significant encounter with water gets them rusting like crazy.  E)  Even the better ones have such poorly shaped cutting edges that they&#x27;d be better described as \\&quot;nail crunchers\\&quot;, leaving a rough edge instead of a smooth, clean edge.  Some cutting edges are so poor they won&#x27;t even cut cleanly through loose skin around the nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these gripes about the common nail clipper ring a bell with you, then I strongly suggest you try the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Nail Clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, it&#x27;s stainless steel, not chrome plated ... no flakes of chrome getting imbedded under your fingernails ... no rusting after a few days in damp shower kit.  Second, the construction is sturdy and substantial, not flimsy.  Third, the cutting edge is masterful, delivering a clean, smooth cut every time ... a cut accompanied by a satisfying CLICK!! that tells you it&#x27;s cut cleanly through the nail.  Forth, the mechanism is designed to work smoothly with no ill fitting, loose or wobbly parts.  It&#x27;s simply the best fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve EVER used and I can highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that people&#x27;s priorities do vary, there are a few product details you should consider before purchasing ... if you like a fingernail file built into your clipper, you won&#x27;t find one here.  Personally, when I need a file (which isn&#x27;t often with this true edged clipper), I use the one in my smallest Swiss Army Knife.  Second, there is no round hole in the base of the clipper to which to attach a chain or key ring.  There are two narrow slots through which a small diameter chord could be fitted, but nothing big enough to support a chain or key ring.  Lastly, this item is made of substantial stainless steel, so it&#x27;s considerably heavier than most clippers.  If that&#x27;s likely to bother you, keep it in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have NO regrets about this great clipper and I&#x27;m SO glad I got it., delivering a clean, smooth cut every time ... a cut accompanied by a satisfying CLICK!! that tells you it&#x27;s cut cleanly through the nail.

            <li> These are easy to use, have a comfortable grip and they cut the nail instead of crush it like some bargain models do.  I&#x27;ve not used any that are better than Seki.</li>
            <li> sharp, works well, feels strong, otherwise excellent product that does what it advertises, no new features though</li>
            <li> I was in Stuttgart when I found a German nail clipper for sale in a gift shop. It was a shocking $29 but since I was on vacation and in a pretty good mood, I examined it and tested it in the shop. It did such a good job that I bought one. It remains to this day in my night stand, unshared with my family. Feeling a little guilty, when I saw the Seki clipper at a tempting price, I pounced. Alas, the quality is about as good as a $3 clipper I recently bought and no where near as good a give-away clipper I keep in the bathroom. There must be a better clipper out there and I&#x27;ll keep looking. This isn&#x27;t the dream clipper I hoped for.nail clipper</li>
            <li> Way better than the last 5 I&#x27;ve purchased at walmart or a gas station, etc. Very sharp and cuts clean but I can only give it 3 stars because if you try to use either side to cut a hangnail it will not cut it at all.</li>
            <li> My husband uses clippers in the shower, and the rust marks left from cheaper, non-stainless steel clippers really annoy me.  So, I bought the Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper for him.  Unfortunately, it is not completely stainless.  The bolt that holds the two pieces together is non-stainless and rusts!  I essentially paid 5x the amount of a cheaper clippers for the same problem, and am very disappointed in the false advertizing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how many different fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve owned in the past 60 years.  A bunch!  All were the inexpensive variety, the kind you find in supermarkets or drugstores.  The problem with them is they just don&#x27;t cut your fingernail right.  The top part bends before the fingernail is cut if you cut your fingernails while they are dry and the edge of the fingernail is rough, after the cut, and needs to be filed.    The Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper does an excellent job!  Smooth edges left on your fingernails because of the sharp cutters on the clipper and, since the lever is twice as thick as the cheap fingernail clippers, there&#x27;s no bending of the lever.</li>
            <li> Ordered and received on time.  These nail clippers are top quality.  I am very please with them.  I would hate to lose them.  That would mean I would have to order a new pair.  I am now spoiled.</li>
            <li> Ive used this for about a year now and really have enjoyed it. The construction is top notch, the metal used exceptional. It has shown no signs of dulling and seems like it will last my lifetime.</li>
            <li> It cuts like laser but there is one vexing problem.&lt;br /&gt;After all the clipping is done my nails have sharp edges so that when I run my fingers over my other hand they scratch like a cat. I have to grind the edges down which I hate to do. I didn&#x27;t have to do that before.</li>
            <li> Bought both the finger and toe nail clippers for my husband.  He really&lt;br /&gt;likes the heft of these items.  Good choice</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS NAILCLIPPER - WORTH THE PRICE!</li>
            <li> These are seriously excellent nail clippers. Yes, they are more expensive, but hands-down worth every penny. I am appalled that I used cheap ones for so long. There is an enormous difference!</li>
            <li> Yeah, I paid too much for this clipper.  That being said, it is the best one I have ever used!&lt;br /&gt;My sister was right; pay a few more bucks at the start to avoid replacing every other year.&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt this will be the last one I ever have to buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used cheap ones before. They work, but holy cow, they don&#x27;t work nearly as well as this. Do yourself a favor and get these. You have no idea what you&#x27;re missing out on.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself (after buying a fancy case with lots of tools for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day) and I&#x27;m very pleased.  So many years of using a cheap one made my first experience with this clipper quite a happy one!  Which sounds like I need a life, except who has time to waste filing your nails afterwards.  With this clipper you get a nice, sharp cut and often you don&#x27;t need to do any filing at all, except for a little touch up.</li>
            <li> love em, they are nice and sharp and easy to hang on to.</li>
            <li> The sharpest and clean cut fingernail clipper. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very high quality, super sharp nail clippers.  They slice through my nails with ease. Never had anything this good.</li>
            <li> These things cut nails like a hot knife through butter. Incredibly smooth operation, you don&#x27;t get the &#x27;click&#x27; or &#x27;snap&#x27; like the cheaper models of clippers. No jagged edges left behind.</li>
            <li> Been a very good set of clippers!</li>
            <li> I will never use a different nail clipper again.</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers ever!!</li>
            <li> Very sharp and very good quality. Miles ahead of the the cheap drugstore clippers.</li>
            <li> High quality, ergonomically satisfying.  A good purchase.</li>
            <li> I used a TRIM nail clipper before these and that lasted me many years.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the size (bigger than trim) I find it hard to grip it securely and have control over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The indent on the clipper is supposed to hold your thumb but it just keep slipping.&lt;br /&gt;I am going back to small size nail clipper most likely TRIM</li>
            <li> I went on a quest for the best nail clipper I could find - at any price. I was tired of the el-cheapo $1.99 variety. I bought these three:    Zwilling J.A. Henckels Ultra-slim Nail Clipper (ASIN: B002NH4YS2)  Zwilling J.A. Henckels Fingernail Clipper (ASIN: B002ULRVJA)  Seki Edge Stainless Steel Fingernail Clipper (ASIN: B000F35R00)    They are all fine products, but the only one I use on a regular basis is the Seki Edge. It&#x27;s sharp and feels great in my hands. The J.A. Henckels Ultra-slim is a very slick product and is extremely sharp (maybe even too sharp), but it&#x27;s a bit too small for regular use. The other J.A. Henckels clipper is designed to catch nail clippings, and it works well, but I find it a little too bulky.    I recommend all three of these clippers but the the Seki Edge is the best of the best.</li>
            <li> I bought theses with larger size.  Good weight and well made. Easy to clip nails and they cut nail with no problem</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get it.  There is nothing special at all about the function of these Seki Edge (model SS-106) fingernail clippers.  I have a 20+ year-old, no-name pair of clippers that clip just as well, along with a two-dollar \\&quot;Trim\\&quot; brand I bought a few months ago that cut better.  These are solid and well-made, yet their size and heft make them even less desirable given their mediocre performance.  I feel like an idiot for spending almost $15 on these.  Come to think of it, I also feel like an idiot for spending time writing a review about fingernail clippers . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a number of \\&quot;premium\\&quot; nail clippers in the past.  Always a disappointment.  Not this time.  This is one fantastic nail clipper.  It&#x27;s easy to hold, cuts effortlessly, and leaves a clean edge.</li>
            <li> Nice and sharp and comfortable to use.  It make cutting my grandson&#x27;s nails an easy process. Would buy it again.</li>
            <li> These stainless clippers are sharper than the cheaper ones and hold their edge a lot longer.  It&#x27;s a pleasure to use good tools.</li>
            <li> These clippers work really nice , really sharp , smooth cutting with minimal effort even with thickest nails. I bought a pair of Twizzerman clippers and wasnt satisfied with cutting so just got the Seki Edge today and worked great.</li>
            <li> Hands down, the best nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s super sharp and cut easily and cleanly every time. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I needed a fingernail clipper, and I have had mostly good experiences with Japanese made products. The clipper are solid meaning that you know you are holding a quality object (being what seems like 100% stainless steel), the way the clippers actually clip the nails off, the weight of the clippers, etc. There are a few things that I am not sure about. One is at the end of the clippers there are 2 small open areas like slits that I have no idea what they are to be used for. Since it would be good to connect these to a keychain of sorts, I first thought the slits were for this reason, but I could not figure out how to get them on my keychain. The part that you press down to cut the nail moves around no matter where you put the clippers, so some sort of cover or case would be good to have so you do not cut yourself trying to find the clippers in a bag. Also, the part that you press down to cut should be able to be secured to the main part of the clipper. My older clippers have a small file with a way that the end of the clipper fits into this and does not move around. I would not use Amazon to ship anything to me again since the last several times they have done a very poor job of protecting the items that they have shipped to me.</li>
            <li> These are a little heavier than the normal clippers, but they work much better, mostly because they are so sharp. I&#x27;ve only had them for a couple of months, so I am waiting to see how long they last. I can&#x27;t see going back to the cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  This is how fingernail scissors should work.  We need to get a 2nd paid since my hubby is always accusing me of hiding these from him :)</li>
            <li> There are few products that incite more unrestricted, fiery rage in me than cheap fingernail clippers. Having to struggle to clip a nail or deal with a hangnail is second only to stubbing my toe on the chart of things that make me hate living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to buy these. They looked sturdy. Industrial, even. But I was pretty skeptical that they&#x27;d be worth the price. Fortunately, they are the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. They&#x27;re plenty big, they are very sharp and they can handle tougher nails like mine. Clipping my nails with these is a snap and I feel like they&#x27;ll last a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Sharp, cut well&lt;br /&gt;- Very well-built, sturdy&lt;br /&gt;- Good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper ive ever used!</li>
            <li> Green Bell (makers of Seki) got it right. It sounds weird to say, but these clippers are a joy to use. High quality, smooth action, sharp cutting edges. I&#x27;ve had maybe ten pairs in my life by other brands... though they were admittedly all less expensive. Can&#x27;t imaging buying anything other than Seki going forward. I&#x27;ll also check out their other products.</li>
            <li> Luxury Class fingernail Clipper!  I&#x27;ve lived in Asia for over 25 years and have many fond memories of the bathhouse ladies cutting my nails with such precision.. perfect every time.  They used these.  The view wasn&#x27;t bad wither.</li>
            <li> Really like these clippers.  Very well made, I plan on keeping it the rest of my life assuming I don&#x27;t lose them moving/traveling.  Bought a pair for parents as well as they only ever had the cheap clippers.  It&#x27;s a little pricy but I think worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Nice sharp clipper. Have been using it for the past year and it is still sharp.</li>
            <li> I bought both these, and the &amp;#34;Clyppi&amp;#34; brand clippers.  These &amp;#34;Seki Edge&amp;#34; clippers give a great cut with the sharp blades, but I find them a little too heavy and smooth/slippery to grip well when clipping my young kids nails.  They are still very good clippers, but I think would be best for adults nails (especially men).</li>
            <li> Easily worth the price, best clipper ive ever used.  High quality; should be the last I ever buy if I don&#x27;t lose it.</li>
            <li> Best toenail clippers out there!  Kids are always breaking clippers!  Thee seem indestructible.  Even get through youngest boys thick toe nails!  Highly recommend!!!!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> These are hands down the best clippers I&#x27;ve owned. No bent nails. Makes a crisp cut. I love that they feel very sturdy with a ridge on top for your thumb or finger. I expect these to last forever, so long as I don&#x27;t lose them.</li>
            <li> It did not meet my expectations as it was smaller than my previous one which was a Trim.  Also, I would have liked a straight cutting edge it makes nail clipping easier.  The cutting edge did not fit under the nail easily.  It would be better if the cutting edge opened a little more.  I will say the cutting edge was sharp.  I will use it but not entirely happy with the product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient to have because of it&#x27;s small size.  I do have to say that I&#x27;ve used better ones.  Also, it may be just me but it makes a metal-on-metal sliding noise when you open/close the clippers, and this noise is SUPER grating for me.</li>
            <li> Simply the finest fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve ever had my hands on.  It actually cuts the nail with sharp edges instead of smashing through it with blunt edges like the rest.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> The best fingernail clippers I have ever owned and I have owned many.  They are quality made.  They cut the nail cleanly every time!</li>
            <li> I got tired of those dull, easy to break cheap ones that you find at the drugstore.  This is sharp and well made.  It is a long-term investment, so it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Well built unit with solid feel. At first I found the top handle a bit thick and clunky, but have found that I got used to it and appreciate its design and build. The way nails are cut seems cleaner and sharper than other cheap unit I had before.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge is sharp and cuts clean every time.  I highly recommend it!  It should last through years of normal use.</li>
            <li> Something you may not have known (before now) is that instrumentalists -- especially string players -- must keep their nails trimmed neatly and accurately. Most nail clippers do a poor job. This one does a great job, and other string players have ordered this one after trying mine. The blades are very sharp, they cut easily and smoothly, and the lever handle is designed for easy use. It feels like a professional tool in the hand.</li>
            <li> I have had these since 2010 and they are still working just fine. It cuts the nails without any distortion of the lever part.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why with our modern technology we can&#x27;t make nail clippers that really work well. (i actually have the same problem with staplers).  Every pair of nail clippers i had either didn&#x27;t line up quite right or were dull.  Finally, after a long search found Seki Edge nail clippers.  They are a bit more expensive. But, worth every penny.  These nail clippers work as well or better than nail clippers should.  I&#x27;ve had these for some time and they haven&#x27;t dulled or broken in any way.  I highly recommend them.... now if only i could find a stapler that works as well.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the best nail clipper I have bought. Bit pricy. Hopefully lasts longer for the money spent and remains sharp.</li>
            <li> Best clippers I have found for a long time . I used to dump out the new can of clippers and sort out the good ones and then do it again till I got a good pair . I purchased two pair of these and both are very sharp.I just cant figgure out why an expensive pair of clippers cant have a NAIL FILE  !</li>
            <li> Last year, I decided that I would buy quality products that worked well instead of cheap products that would cost me less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before, I would buy nail clippers from the drugstore that cost 5 or 6 dollars. They did what I needed them to do and when they didn&#x27;t, I threw them away. Within the past two years, I lost one set due to rust (kept it in the bathroom), one set to the clipper breaking (the metal part snapped in two!), and one because I lost it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well...I decided to invest in the Seki Edge. It was highly recommended by a number of people I know. It was more expensive than the ones I had bought before, but I wanted something that would last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you pull it out of the package, you know you&#x27;re holding a quality product. There&#x27;s a heft to it that never felt in a nail clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to cutting nails, it does so cleanly and easily. I recently had to use an old clipper of my mom&#x27;s and immediately regretted not waiting until I got home. Just like my old clippers, I had to work to cut through the nail, and I was left with rough edges that I had to file down. With the Seki Edge, cutting my nails is effortless, and I never have to file them afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m buying a second pair for my mom to replace hers.</li>
            <li> I had been having problems with nail clippers, never finding the right ones that would do a good job clipping my nails cleanly and evenly, not leaving spurs, could clip fingernails and toenails, could handle the corners on ingrown nails or problem areas, could handle small clean-up spots without making matters worse, and so forth. I also had trouble finding clippers that would work in my hands with some very bad nerve tremors. I had bought individual clippers, sets of grooming tools, specialty clippers and items, and all sorts of things, all to no avail. I took a chance when I saw these Seki Edge clippers, and I could tell immediately I did not go wrong. First, they are very sharp, high-quality clippers - and sharpness makes a huge difference! They are aligned well, which eliminates the spurs and uneven spots. The basic fingernail and toenail clippers have specially formed ends and holding grooves on both the top and bottom ends to make them much easier to hold when your arm is extended, even with hand tremors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else now. I let my wife try them out, and she loved them. I watched over her as she used them, took them back from her immediately, hid them from her, and am buying a set of them for her for her birthday at the end of this month. All the clippers purchased are excellent products I would highly recommend to anyone who wants great clippers at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you&#x27;re looking at this product, you&#x27;re probably more interested in getting a good quality nail clipper than you are in saving a few bucks. This nail clipper is quite expensive, but it&#x27;s great quality and easy to use. Upon unpacking it and trying it out, I immediately was OK with the price paid. It has a nice weight in the hand, and feels like it&#x27;s built really well. The angle of the clipper is a bit steep, but the indentation ensures that your fingers won&#x27;t slip when using it. The blades themselves line up perfectly, and are super sharp. This thing will go right through thick nails with easy, leaving a very clean cut that hardly requires filing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this nail clipper if you&#x27;ve ever been aggravated with the uneven or torn cut that you get from cheap clippers.</li>
            <li> I was curious as to what an expensive nail clipper could do.  There is no comparison between this one and the cheap drugstore nail clippers.  If you like a very solid feel, and perfection, buy this one.  It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This product is not as great as all the other reviews make it out to be. It doesn&#x27;t cut that cleanly and isn&#x27;t any better than the $4 nail clipper I bought years ago from CVS.</li>
            <li> i other nail clipper was getting dull and had this annoying squeak sound to it. i do cut my fingernails a lot and im deff happy with the purchase its sharp and has a great feel to it great size.</li>
            <li> Great action, sharp edge on the best nail trimmers ever bought. No more disappointing trial &amp; error with other brands.</li>
            <li> If there were I segment for luxurious nail clippers you would find these there. Well made. Smooth. Very effective nail tool.</li>
            <li> These were a replacement for an identical product with a different brand that I got more than 10 years ago from Brookstone. Eventually they got dull but they had lasted a long time and done very well. From the first few uses, these will be exactly the same.</li>
            <li> Have purchased Seiki clippers before and they are consistently excellent.  Highly recommend!  Very clean cut on the toughest nails.&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For the money spent on this I consider it the most value for the money. Very solid and sharp, cuts clean and good steel quality. recommended!</li>
            <li> Better than my old nail clippers I purchased from my local drugstore. Build quality feels great and they are really sharp. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Exceptional nail clipper .,Received product when promised and the clippers are high quality and very sharp. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Yes , it is expensive,but I would like to think I will never have to buy another one again.Fits well into hand and cuts my tough nails very well.</li>
            <li> Yes, we all should feel weird spending this much on fingernail clippers.  However, this is a quality tool and does an infinitely better job than any clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is like the difference between a Shun and a Target brand kitchen knife... worth the price.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is great! I have been using it for a few months now; it is very sharp and makes clean cuts. I bought this to replace my inferior nail clippers that were always leaving me with ragged edges, and this one does a great job.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and very easy to use. There is a big difference versus heapo-cheapo ones. Recomend highly.</li>
            <li> This has the sames problem as the toenail clipper, you can&#x27;t get a grip on it.&lt;br /&gt;The clipping head needs to be a bit larger.</li>
            <li> these are the best clippers ive ever seen. buy them now. they are super sharp, and never chip, fray, or tear your nails. I&#x27;m kind of OCD about my fingernails and I&#x27;ve always wanted clippers that were actually sharp and the blades aligned and level. That doesn&#x27;t seem like much to ask but i went thru half a dozen clippers and they were all garbage. These are the only clippers I&#x27;ll ever use again.</li>
            <li> The best clippers we have ever used.  My husband is quite picky and the product pleased him.  Heavy, balanced and feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> First blades, then hair wax (look up UNO &amp; Gatsby wax), now nail clippers, lol, Japan makes good stuff.  Best clippers I have ever used.  Silky feeling clipping and effortless.  They are worth it.</li>
            <li> This works much better than the less expensive regular clippers. I keep my nails trimmed to reduce scratching and tearing up my skin due to eczema.  With this, don&#x27;t have to worry about filing as much after trimming.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I wanted clippers with a longer cutting edge but they&#x27;re actually no different than standard clippers. The quality of the metal and the size make them easier to handle, so that&#x27;s a plus. But the thickness of the cutting edges and the standard size of the edge make no real improvement over the inexpensive clippers that you can get anywhere.</li>
            <li> Best stuff!  Though I&#x27;d recommend the toenail version, even for fingernails.  At least if you are a big guy.  This seems a bit small after using their other product for a few years.</li>
            <li> Great fingernails clipper, have the toenail version works great.</li>
            <li> Since I use these clippers for trimming my cats &amp;#34;fingernails&amp;#34; I look for 2 things.  A wide opening to accomodate thicker nails and a Sharp cutting edge.  These clippers are great!!!  Hope they stay this sharp for a long time.  And they are easy to hang on to.</li>
            <li> I was searching for something better than what is available in my small town.  This is great and I wish I had ordered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Great for fingernails and nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> The Seki Edge Fingernail Clippers are a quality piece of craftsmanship.  Not only do the clippers have the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of quality, they perform excellent in cutting fingernails.  I am so impressed by these clippers, I have decided to give them as gifts to all the members of my family.  In other words, the Seki Edge Fingernail Clippers communicate thoughtfulness to the receiver.</li>
            <li> Without doubt the best nail clipper available anywhere.  So superior, there is no contest.</li>
            <li> These work as described.</li>
            <li> It is definitely high quality product. I agree with a few other reviewers that the angle of operation is a little too steep for no reason to be so. You will eventually get used to it but is somewhat different then all other types of nail clippers. I mean steeper. It does cut better then any other clipper especially on the first cut. I had piece of nail on the top of my nail and this cutter went through both layers of nails like a knife trough butter. So it is the best quality nail clipper but i would not say by far. Proportionately speaking Revlon is almost as good but so much cheaper. So this is good product but it is a luxury item. And luxury i overpriced.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper is of a very good quality.</li>
            <li> Very good product, price on the steep side.</li>
            <li> My husband has one and I decided I needed one for clipping the cat&#x27;s nails. It is so sharp it makes that job easy. Amazing how much better this is than the cheap one I was using.</li>
            <li> Very rigid, sharp, and jaws meet precisely.  These are way better than the pieces of junk from the drug store.</li>
            <li> Makes trimming fun, wish my nails would grow faster so i could use more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is the best fingernail clipper I have ever owned. I wish I had ordered it a long time age. It cuts neatly and cleanly and feels very durable. It should last a long, long time. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised and works well.</li>
            <li> These clippers are razor sharp, was able to cut through my toughest nails</li>
            <li> My husband bought these for himself after I added the toenail version to one of his presents (leather toiletry kit). He immediately saw the difference in quality. We&#x27;ve both gotten so used to them, we get made when the other sneaks them on business trips. Can&#x27;t go back to Revlon cheapies now! Even got my father his own set last Christmas.</li>
            <li> these are awesome, was surprised it didn&#x27;t come with the little sharp blade that most nail clippers come with under the handle, but still, awesome product, arrived on time, and was packaged nicely, thank you!</li>
            <li> These are the absolute best nail clippers I have ever used.  Buy them; You won&#x27;t regret it.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the few extra dollars.</li>
            <li> the most wonderful thing ever!! never really thought about how wonderful it could be to have nice clippers until i bought these!</li>
            <li> Cuts really well, but no file to smooth out the edges. Very precise cutting of nails and it os very ergonomic to hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will surely last a while, but probably mainly due to the fact that I&#x27;d rather use my other clippers with a built in file. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also pretty expensive!! Not sure if it&#x27;s worth it. I&#x27;d say look at the SS-109 instead.</li>
            <li> Works much better than clippers found in drug stores. Only complaint is there is no file/pick. Have been keeping it in the shower on a suction hook and it has not rusted yet.</li>
            <li> Really like this fingernail clipper-sharp, and does its job well. The only thing I&#x27;d change is to make a \\&quot;catcher\\&quot; for the nail clippings, as some clippers have, but it&#x27;s no big deal. A bit expensive for a nail clipper, but worth so much more than the throw-away clippers you get in sets, or simply have laying around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with this, and would buy it again no contest.</li>
            <li> These are top tier clippers at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Good quality nail clippers. They are sharp and work really well on even thicker nails. I bought these based on the reviews here and must agree with what others say, these are good quality for the price. Wouldn&#x27;t hesitate recommending these to a friend.</li>
            <li> These cut perfectly every time with the satisfying clip noise. Use them for both finger and toe nails and have never had a problem. They aren&#x27;t getting dull either after roughly 6 months of weekly use.</li>
            <li> So I was first introduced to these things while visiting my geeky friend Carlos in Texas. We&#x27;re both hardcore travelers and all about neat and efficient toys, also into researching forever on best items. He was so excited about having located the &amp;#34;worlds best nail clippers&amp;#34; which were these specific nail clippers. He then INSISTED that I try them out. I thought it was a weird request. I tried them out, and I was like &#x27;yeah, ok dude that&#x27;s cool.&#x27; Not really understanding what was happening. Fast forward two years and I need to buy some nail clippers and I debate it out cause you know, its a nail clipper, but I buy a pair. This very one, and now I&#x27;m like &amp;#34;HOLY CRAP.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; No really, these are the best freaking nail clippers your ever gonna buy ever. It&#x27;s really weird getting so excited about a fingernail clipper. It&#x27;s like I have turned into my friend Carlos and now I&#x27;m telling you with the same level of enthusiasm &amp;#34;Yo, you need to try these nail clippers out.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clipper works effortlessly, and because it&#x27;s made in Japan, I like to think this little nail clipper is the the culmination of thousands of years of Japanese sword making technology. Some Japanese masters on the top of a mountain are making it their life&#x27;s work to bring us the best in nail clipping technologies. The clippers edge made from secret family techniques, passed down to each male successor, taking an entire lifetime to master.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will warn you though, this WILL change you. If you ever lose it and need to use a &#x27;normal&#x27; clipper you&#x27;re gonna have a bad time. After this I&#x27;m afraid there&#x27;s no turning back. You&#x27;ll be that person, the one telling people to try out your nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I never thought that clipping my nails would be such a revelation, until I used these nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are god-tier nail clippers and now that I use them, I can&#x27;t go back. They cut accurately,smoothly and without hesitation. The action is far smoother than your standard 99 cent clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that they&#x27;re made of real steel instead of the chrome covered pig iron of most cheap clippers is a good sign of their durability. if I had it to do over again, I&#x27;d order a model with a nail file, but other than that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with these Samurai sharp clippers.</li>
            <li> If you are paying $12 bucks for a nail clipper. You must be crazy, or you must be hoping its one hell of a clipper. And I can tell you it is one hell of a clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First up let&#x27;s talk about the construction. Its stainless steel, but holding it you can&#x27;t help but feel there&#x27;s a certain energy pulsating within. The moment you pick it up, it is cold to touch but quickly warms to your finger. Almost like it comes alive in your hands. Unlike any other stainless steel, its forged in Seki, Japan. The same place where they forged my samurai sword. It is effortless in clipping nail, similar to how I can split a grown man in two with a single swing of my sword. If there&#x27;s a problem, its that the blade is too sharp, but nobody buys a Corvette and complains its too fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, actually using it. Buying the best frying pan doesn&#x27;t make you a master chef, buying the best dSLR doesn&#x27;t make you a professional photographer, and buying this nail clipper doesn&#x27;t make you a manicurist. The clipping action is solid, no creaks, no flex, just a confident &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; sound. Yes the body of the clipper is smooth, so make sure your hands are dry and get a grip. It doesn&#x27;t let you cut nails extremely short easily, but then again, its trying to stop you from taking a chunk of your fingertips out. The blades on this thing is REALLY sharp, and its designed that way to stop you from dismembering yourself. It clips short enough, but short is relative, that&#x27;s what she said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, no, this does not cut hangnails effectively, it does not have an integrated file. You are buying a fingernail clipper, and that&#x27;s ALL it does, clip nails. It does this one thing and one thing only really well. Seki Edge makes a range of cuticle cutter and other hardware that each does a specific job. If you are looking for nail care all in one, this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, in this day of age people expect everything in one. This is not an iPhone, it cannot sync your mails, take pictures and play music all at the same time. This is a frigging nail clipper and it only clip nails. I only use my samurai sword to dismember and disembowel people, I don&#x27;t peel apples with it. Would you?</li>
            <li> After reading these reviews I was really hoping for a nice, sharp clipper.  However, these are one of the worst I&#x27;ve ever used.  Does not provide a clean cut, cuts similar to cheap Trim clippers.  I will stick to Tweezerman and even Revlon.</li>
            <li> Sometimes spending two or three times more can really improve your quality of life. When the product is less than $15, this is definitely worth it. I was tired of bad nail clippers, leaving rough edges, that make clipping nails a tiresome chore. The cut from the Seki is so smooth and clean, I actually don&#x27;t have to file them afterward, and they make me look forward to cutting my nails.</li>
            <li> Best fingernail clipper I ever had. Works great on trimming the cat&#x27;s nails also.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to cut with and it cuts real sharp.</li>
            <li> a quality product well worth the money get two or three you won&#x27;t be dissapointed</li>
            <li> These are great because th</li>
            <li> I always had these dull old nail clippers and always ended up with split nails,after using that for a while my nais are healthier than ever.It cuts well and it is very sharp !</li>
            <li> I am a guitar player, so fingernails of any length at all to me are a nuisance. That being said, I always need a set of nail clippers nearby. I have an old set of nail clippers (made in USA) that work really well, but I needed something for work. So I went to the local Target store to buy another pair. Nothing made in USA available there. But they did have a pair of...ehem...\\&quot;levRon\\&quot;...(brand name intentionally blurred)for $4 that should work OK, right? WRONG!!! What a piece of crap! Made in China of course. They couldn&#x27;t even cut a fart much less a fingernail. Thoroughly perturbed, I looked online for the best pair available, price be damned, and found the Seki Edge. These nail clippers are gooood!! Made in Japan, and they put my old Made in USA brand to shame, never mind the...ehem...levRons. In fact they are so quick and crisp when they cut, I almost think that they are going to cut the top of my finger off! Scary good! Anyway, don&#x27;t settle for less. These are 100 times better than the ehem...levRons... and only 3-4x the cost.  Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1IXRGOCFMWHGP]]My video review of the Seki Edge nail clippers.</li>
            <li> Item is as represented.  Very handy folding handle; excellent finish.  Sharp cutting clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the cost.  Best I have used till now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MelK</li>
            <li> The clippers cut really well, but the texture really bothers me.  All around the blades it has a brushed metal feel, and every time I push my nails into it they drag/grate against it and it reminds me of a chalk board.  I know that probably shouldn&#x27;t matter, but it just makes it feel weird to me.</li>
            <li> There are so many cheap clippers out there, how do you find the one that really works?  Easy, buy this one.  It is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive- OK, but it will last forever.</li>
            <li> It may seem silly to pay over ten dollars for nail clippers when you can get one at a gas station, or pretty much anywhere, for 79 cents. Take my word for it, these are different. Cheap clippers crush the nails before eventually cutting and that makes a rough edge. I never realized it before using the Seki Edge. Others who post here and care to write more about it than me have said it all, I just advise you to buy them if you are the least interested in a quality nail clipper.</li>
            <li> I really like these nail clippers, they are very high end, yet reliable, definitely the best bang for your buck</li>
            <li> What!? No nail cleaner? Otherwise, this is surgical quality.</li>
            <li> GOOD QUALITY AND SHARP</li>
            <li> May seem ridiculous but I&#x27;ve owned at least 10 pair of clippers.  All of them were capable of clipping my nails.  However until using the Seki Stainless, I had never realized how much the old ones squeezed the nail (mild discomfort), then cut it, leaving a rough edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are like using a razor to slice right through my nails.  I cannot say enough about how much easier and faster it is to trim my nails and our children&#x27;s.  Our kids used to complain that the old clippers hurt.  Not a peep since using these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No rough edges to smooth out, no bending my nails - wow!  I wish I had purchased them sooner.  Worth every penny to me.  Will buy more for travel since they aren&#x27;t too big to take with me in my bag.</li>
            <li> I would have rated this a 5 but the cutting surface is a little small. Maybe it is made more for women&#x27;s hands. Otherwise they work great. Takes very little effort to cut through nails and they are very sharp providing a crisp clean cut.</li>
            <li> After years of being disappointed by affordable nail clippers, I finally found one that does its job well, doesn&#x27;t cost too much. It&#x27;s hard these days to find a product that gets regular use that lasts, does its job well, and doesn&#x27;t cause dread or remorse when needed. I expect this to last for years so it&#x27;s worth the extra few dollars if you were considering any of the commonly found clippers such as the Revlon.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job. It&#x27;s heavy duty with the right amount of leverage and it&#x27;s very sharp. I would give it 5 except for the price.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret getting one of these units. The cutting edges are so much sharper and it just works better. No more rough edges after trimming your nails. Also requires much less effort.</li>
            <li> Super sharp and extremely fine quality steel make this a deluxe trimmer for nails.  There are no other attached utilities, like cheaper trimmers have. This is just a nail trimmer. The stainless steel is very sharp and cuts smoothly. The entire mechanism operates very smoothly! I see the differences between the cheaper, $5 types and this one. I have a couple of Seki pocket knives, and this Seki trimmer does not disappoint! I recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like this fingernail clipper, and would have given it  5ive stars if it were easier to hold.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy this brand.</li>
            <li> Not a deal for the price</li>
            <li> good quality clippers</li>
            <li> I saw these in Japan - forgot to buy them before leaving.  Great to find on Amazon.  My nails are tough - and grow fast  - and these simply said are perfect.  I own both finger and toe nail versions.</li>
            <li> These are no better or worse than any other I&#x27;ve purchased</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t ever have paid much attention to nail clippers in the past. But this is just the best I&#x27;ve ever seen. Clips quietly and smoothly through the nails. Makes this easier and cleaner than ever before!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually worked so well that I soon had my wife wanting to use it. And since I travel a lot, and wanted to have it with me... Had to order another one just for her.</li>
            <li> The is the best one that I have ever used. In face I am hiding it from the rest of the family.</li>
            <li> Best fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned...and that&#x27;s a lot! This is one I do not carry around in my pocket, for fear of loosing it.</li>
            <li> Have had a pair of these a long time, still quite sharp.  Worth every cent, these are the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever had by a very wide margin.</li>
            <li> My husband and I ordered this awhile ago and at first, we were in love. This thing cuts super precise and it&#x27;s easy peasy. However, after a few weeks we noticed that our nails kept breaking. We stopped using this nail clipper and started using our old clippers and our nails stopped breaking so easily. Coincidence?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of obsessed with my fingernails (which doesn&#x27;t result in them always looking great, as a guy, but they&#x27;re trimmed well) and although you can&#x27;t do detail work due to the width and size of this clipper, it is incredibly high quality for the money. Blades are quite sharp and very exact. Seems unlikely that it&#x27;ll get wobbly too soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying $1.49 clippers for years. These are so much better. They are sharp and shaped to be easier to hold. I think they will last for a long time. I am very happy and would recommend them to others.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve never used clippers like these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually ordered these to replace the exact same ones I&#x27;ve had for well over a decade. My girlfriend had misplaced them, so, I ordered another.  Before they arrived, she found my old ones. So, the new ones are still new in the package and I&#x27;m still using my old ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, they&#x27;re awesome. Last forever. No flex to them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get them. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s something about the way these clippers cut my nails - I can never get a good/close cut. I have much cheaper nail clippers that I started using because they get closer.</li>
            <li> The Seki fingernail clipper works better then any I&#x27;ve had so far.  I have wide nails, so if the clipper was a little wider would be even better.  Maybe I should try a toe nail clipper for my nails?</li>
            <li> I really wanted a premium nail clipper and didn&#x27;t mind the price. However, this clipper leaves my nail too sharp. I think the problem, ironically, is that it does &amp;#34;too good&amp;#34; of a job clipping the nail. It leaves a nice 90 degree angle on the nail, which actually makes it very sharp. As in: dangerously sharp in my opinion. Even scratching an itch is a problem with nails this sharp. And there is no way I&#x27;m getting intimate with my wife until I&#x27;ve filed these nails down. I think you could accidentally hurt someone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sending this back to Amazon. I will either find a different/better premium clipper, or go back to cheaper clippers. But this &amp;#34;sharp nail&amp;#34; sensation is terrible. I hate these nail clippers. I know that is a strong reaction to nail clippers, but it is a true statement. It is the strangest feeling to touch your own fingernails and wonder why they feel so.... sharp and hard. Weird. My fingernails are very short, and yet I feel like Wolverine. Seriously, I didn&#x27;t even know this was possible. If I didn&#x27;t experience it myself I would think that it was an exaggeration.</li>
            <li> good design and materials. Fits very well in your hand. Great leverage, very sharp, clean cuts...no jaggies. Kind of high in price, but well worth it. Buy...Buy...Buy</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Very sharp and cuts nails easily&lt;br /&gt;-Improved finger grip compared to the standard CVS, walgreens nail clippers&lt;br /&gt;-Similar price to the ones in the stores but I never need to leave me house&lt;br /&gt;-Hasn&#x27;t dulled in the few months I have had them&lt;br /&gt;-Cuts fingers and toes with the same clippers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-None!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always used the standard department store clippers and these cut a lot better. Its also nice to have an improved finger grip as I always used to slip and twist my nail with the older style nail clippers. Hate when that happens because it is somewhat painful. Has not happened with these yet. I would buy these over and over but I don&#x27;t think I will need to because these things last forever!</li>
            <li> good for nails of all kinds. its the size of a finger nail clipper but has a big enough jaw opening to bite thick toe nails. This thing could cut off a 2 millimeter thick grandma toenail that had been getting stale for 20 years with no problem. Sharp enough that you should file your nails after. Which I always do anyway, so I dont know why the negative reviewers consider that a bad thing. When you cut anything with a sharp tool, it leaves a sharp edge. Dont let that be confused with dull clippers that squish your nail and leave it all ruined. These work excellent and dont let anyone convince you otherwise. best and only cosmetic buy for this guy in a while.</li>
            <li> Made very well!!! Haven&#x27;t had any complaints. Seem to be very sharp and would recommend to anyone looking for such things!</li>
            <li> The Seki nail clippers I recently purchased are the sharpest and easiest to use clippers I have ever owned. I was tired of the drugstore type nail clippers and decided to purchase something that would last and would cut finger nails easily and leave a smooth cut. These are definitely the ones to get if you want an easy cut without any rough edges. They are larger and heavier than the normal clippers you might find, and a little pricey, but definitely do a good job. My wife decided to try them recently and I am afraid I may lose them to her as she was quite impressed.     These are the best ones I have tried and will not need anything else.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a really nice sharp clipper but this seems to just be OK.  Compared to the Tweezerman brand I have had in the past, these are not nearly as sharp.  I feel like I am just pinching off the nail, not getting a good cut.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying these clippers after going through about 10 cheap clippers that required brute force to use.    I have to admit that, after reading all the positive reviews, I&#x27;m fairly disappointed in these.  Why?  Well, first, they don&#x27;t seem to be all that sharp.  But that may be more perception than reality, because they do cut my nails well.    But even more disappointing is that the opening is so narrow that I have to fumble around just to get my nails into the slot.  I found a cheap pair of all-stainless steel clippers at the big-box superstore for about $3.00 that seem to do a better job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a massage therapist and so getting my nails nice and short is a must. With every clipper I&#x27;ve owned, I&#x27;ve always had to do the clip and pull method when cutting the skin around my nails when it starts to peel from cutting my nails very short. When I first used these clippers, I literally giggled with joy with how easily they cut through everything. For the cost, everyone should own a pair! If they came in some sort of male manicure set with a metal file, that would be ideal!</li>
            <li> Yes absolutely the best I have ever used.  Far superior to any  other similar product available and worth the money.  Hpwever I use  their toenail clipper to trim fingernails as its larger size makes it easier to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful nail clipper for use at home. I have small hands so it is sometimes hard to get the tip down to clip. It is so sharp that you have to be careful it is properly positioned before you pinch or you could lose more than nail! It is larger and heavier than one would want for carrying in a purse.</li>
            <li> This is great fingernail clipper. It cuts extremely well and seems like it will last for a while compared to my prior clipper that lost its cut very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Cons***&lt;br /&gt;This fingernail clipper should flag two things that the person buying should know.&lt;br /&gt;-The clipper is small (not tiny but smaller than average: especially the part that does the clipping)&lt;br /&gt;-There is no filer to file the nail or get dirt from underneath the nail.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers.  I bought then when my $2 pair kept giving me uneven cuts.  The clippers are a little on the curved side, meaning that they don&#x27;t cut across your nail in a straight line very well.  I have learned to adjust for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy another pair of these if they ever go dull, which is not likely since the company use to manufacture samurai swords in Japan.</li>
            <li> Well-made and easy to use. The hinge is smooth and the body construction looks to last a lifetime. A bit small for adult finger nails. I would suggest going with the toenail cutter even for your hands if you have average or larger hands.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price to have clippers that work as they should. Since minimal pressure is required, they are easy on my arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite satisfied. It&#x27;s not as great as my old Hoffritz, but still good. Nicely designed, too. Comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> I love how sharp this nail clipper is!  After buying this, I bought the baby nail clipper and toe nail clipper.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and seem to be of quality construction. However, surface rust spots after only having them for about four months or less. I&#x27;d hoped they&#x27;d be a bit more &amp;#34;stainless.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> These are awesome. If you don&#x27;t have a problem with the crappy, flimsy nail clippers, you&#x27;ve got, you probably won&#x27;t notice a difference. If you hate nail clippers and just want them to work, these are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> solidly made , work nice , but seem to slip sideways while in the closed position. worth the price? , we&#x27;ll see</li>
            <li> This is a high quality nail clipper that is worthy of the high price and great reviews. I was a little surprised by the small size, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. It&#x27;s best used as a fingernail, not toenail, cutter due to the size.</li>
            <li> These are great; far better than the grocery store, made in China clippers.&lt;br /&gt;It took a few uses to become completely comfortable with them however as the metal is quite slick to hold on to but feels very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend. I had to buy my husband his own pair bc mine kept disappearing.</li>
            <li> The difference between these clippers and my old standbys that are made by TRIM is huge.  I recently damaged my Ulnar nerve on my left hand during some home improvement projects I was working on.  That meant that I was unable to apply much squeezing force with my left hand.  I rotated through my entire stock of TRIM brand clippers, looking for one that I could actually use effectively.  I went through TRIM clippers that were made in the USA, Korea, and the latest Chinese TRIM clippers, and there was no joy whatsoever.  It wasn’t until I tried these Japanese clippers that I realized how bad my TRIM clippers really were.  These cut fingernails with very little applied force and cut much more cleanly than even my Korean TRIMs, which were my standard for quality clippers before trying these.  I can even use them with my gimpy left hand, so that even though I kind if feel like an uncoordinated slob with the nerve damage, my fingernails on my right hand won’t look that way.  This is really a good quality product and I doubt I’ll ever go back to TRIM, even when my hand gets back to normal.</li>
            <li> By far the best.  The safest.  I will have to buy another one for my family.</li>
            <li> Bomb proof, epic clipper! Super sharp and seriously, it will change your life. Totally worth every penny. You&#x27;ll clip all your nails into oblivion effortlessly.</li>
            <li> Excellent clippers.  Leave a nice cut, no tearing of nails.  Cut straight through my thick man nails.  Great value.  Have had for a few months now -- still super sharp!</li>
            <li> works well for the intended purpose</li>
            <li> Superior cutting edges, lasting for years, in my experience. Own three pairs, so I am never without. Keep them in camper, desk, purse.</li>
            <li> I was uncertain, but figured I&#x27;d try these. They are so much better than the ones I was buying at the drugstore.  They cut very smooth and clean, like the difference between a cheap knife and a really good one.  While I don&#x27;t really care, they do look better too.  If they really do last as long as others have said, I&#x27;ll rate 5 star.  I saw a review that said they don&#x27;t cut as short as the user would like.  I have not seen that problem.  They cut as short as I can imagine they could.</li>
            <li> They seem pretty sharp, but 75% of the time, they split my nail. So then I have to make my nail shorter than intended and if I&#x27;m lucky, while I&#x27;m doing that, just maybe it won&#x27;t split in another place. Going back to my duller clippers I guess. Glad I found them.</li>
            <li> This is a nice, heavy nailclipper and it does cut thick toenails nicely, but it kind of blunts out the edges more than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> Nice weight with a slight texture on the anodized/painted surface so that it&#x27;s not as slippery as the chromed ones. The shape and edge of the base and the handle are also nicely curved and very ergonomic. Have a few around the house now :) with the first one being over 10 years old and still working well.</li>
            <li> Not all nail clippers are created equal and this one is probably the best. Cutting is very precise and responsive. I wish it had something to keep the cuttings from flying across the room, but other than that, this is probably the finest clipper you can buy at this price.</li>
            <li> The edges on this clipper are so sharp, it takes about half the “normal” pressure to trim your nails. It leaves a nice clean cut and is even ideal for kids’ nails, as the force required is just a touch and it’s over. Kids don’t like something that looks like it’s going to hurt, and this thing just nips off the nail and it’s over.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, never had fingernail clippers as good as these.</li>
            <li> These fingernail clippers are made extremely durable, and feel like a high quality product.  Out of the box it worked extremely well as cutting nails and did so leaving clean edges that really don&#x27;t require filing to smooth out.  I&#x27;m not sure if I am just use to them now, or if it truly has dulled, but after a few weeks it seems as though it does not cut as easily.  The edges are still nice and clean but it seems to require more effort.  Overall I still highly recommend these nail clippers, although I might suggest buying a couple, as we all know how easy it is to misplace clippers.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.  It is like it is motorized or something in the way it cuts the nails like butter! It is ergonomic and far, far better to use than the classic clippers.  I especially like to use it on my toenails as it slices them just as easily as fingernails unlike many which struggle that way.  Not that it matters much but it also looks very nice!  Get one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Best. Clippers.  Ever.  Seriouisly, I CANNOT stand cheap crappy nail clippers.  These are worth every penny.</li>
            <li> These are super sharp and cut effortlessly.  The only reason that I give a 4 out of 5 is because after trimming my nails are left with a sharp edge.  If you file your nails after it&#x27;s fine, but I don&#x27;t do that.  I also have a set of Henkel&#x27;s clippers and I don&#x27;t get the same sharp edge on my nails after clipping like I do with these.</li>
            <li> Great quality clipper!  I&#x27;ve bought so many cheaper ones in local drugstores and they either don&#x27;t work well or fall apart within months.  These seem to be made extremely well, although I only just received them.  The quality seems superior to any others I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> The last time I bought fingernail clippers was back in 1961 when just as O was being discharged from the USAF.  They were Revlon, and have stated the test of time, but over the years they have become very dull.  The Seki shows me just how far new technology has come.  They are extremely sharp, and they require much less pressure to cut the nail than the Revlon ones ever.</li>
            <li> debated between these and the clyppi, for whatever reason chose these.  i&#x27;m happy with em.  they&#x27;re very sharp and work smoothly.  i&#x27;ve been using cuticle trimmers for nails for a long time, and i still like those better because it&#x27;s a smaller cutting edge and easier to maneuver.  this can get a little bulky sometimes and hard to make finer cuts.  and i don&#x27;t use a file or anything, so all the trimming is done with these.  but i&#x27;m thinking i&#x27;ll get used to it, haven&#x27;t used a set like this in forever.  build quality is superb, hopefully the edge stays sharp for a long time.  if so, they&#x27;re worth the hefty price tag.  if not, i&#x27;ll revise this rating.</li>
            <li> Ok, I was skeptical about the companies claims and description, but I was pleased to find these the sharpest and most comfortable clippers to use ever. And I have tried some at three times the price.</li>
            <li> Expensive! you can buy it way cheaper from retailers!</li>
            <li> I am a guy who tends to clip my nails and tend to my horrible cuticles while watching tv and drinking beer...... I was always buying and losing terrible drug store clippers and knew there had to be something better even though I know nothing about clippers....&lt;br /&gt;I bought these and it&#x27;s like buying a great sharp knife after using crappy ones you&#x27;ve had since college.....&lt;br /&gt;These are great.</li>
            <li> Very sharp indeed. But splits my nail after clipping. That feels horrible.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom, as she has arthritis and has not been able to cut her own nails. She loves these and now swears by them. I was thrown off by the price but being able to hear that my mom can cut her own nails with ease is completely worth it. I plan on purchasing a pair for myself.</li>
            <li> I resorted to buying nail clippers on Amazon after one cheap set of clippers completely fell apart and couldn&#x27;t be put back together, and the cheap set I replaced it with really just bent my nails until they gave in. Absolutely terrible! The Seki ones are a HUGE improvement and I will never buy the cheap ones again. Reading other reviews, my nails did feel a little sharp but nothing out of the ordinary when using other clippers. Yes, there is a metal on metal sound that irks me but might not bother most people. There is no nail file so you&#x27;ll need a separate one. These minor setbacks still don&#x27;t keep this from a 5 star rating though. Very impressed and relieved to finally be able to cut my nails properly!</li>
            <li> This is the darn Cadillac of fingernail clippers. It&#x27;s worth it never to have raggedy, t--short fingernails again.</li>
            <li> Cuts neatly and well, and leaves my nails well-trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback it the lack of a nail file, but otherwise it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Good weight and solid construction. A pleasure to use. I am glad I did not order the even more expensive one. This was just right without taking out a second mortgage.</li>
            <li> Take it from a neurotic violinist...these are great clippers! Definitely designed for a smaller hand, for what it&#x27;s worth...I&#x27;m going to order the toenail clippers too.</li>
            <li> Sharp with well aligned blades.&lt;br /&gt;Good handle, gives feeling of control over clipping. Well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally a clipper worth owning. Seems pricey, but oh so worth it.</li>
            <li> These clippers are definitely worth the money.  You can tell right away it is well made.  It cuts through nails with ease without much effort and doesn&#x27;t split or crack the nail at all.  I never though I would spend this much on a set of nail clippers, but after using them - I would never buy a different pair. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how smoothly and effortlessly these trim nails. They are nothing like what you buy at a drug store. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> First let me say that I have had 99 cent clippers do a better job than these. For all the rave reviews these clippers recieved, and the relatively high price of these seki vs other clippers, I expected much more. While they seem of excellent build quality the lever should be stainless steel, and not die cast metal. On top of that (at least on the ones I recieved) these leave the top edge of my nails EXTREMELY SHARP. So much so that I actually cut myself with my nails by accident. Upon closer inspection it seems the sharpened jaw of the clippers top and bottom edge are not aligned properly which is either just poor quality control or poor craftmanship, likely both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would return them but I have already thrown away the packaging. I invested in these because I was sick of cheap quality chromed drug store clippers. I spent FAR MORE for the same results. STAY FAR AWAY from these. My guess is all these stellar reviews are from paid reviewers.</li>
            <li> Best cutter ever. I have 4: fingernail and toenail both in my travel bag and at home.</li>
            <li> Super sharp, like the best knives from Japan. You get what you pay for, cheap is poor quality(China), quality is pricey but best(Japan, Germany, USA). Also, I do not feel like to buying a cheap new nail clipper every year, so I watch my Seki Edge like a hawk. Nobody else will touch it. Amazon shipped it with BLAZING SPEED for free, I was shocked when it arrived in my mail box. Quality product from the &amp;#34;world&#x27;s best online shopping website&amp;#34;, Amazon...... &amp;#34;Mahalo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Absolute precision in cutting...lived up to the accolades.</li>
            <li> So nice I bought their mustache scissors..the best. I do believe these will last a lifetime (heirloom type item).</li>
            <li> I thought this was a luxury, I even felt reluctant as I clicked order, wondering if I could really justify spending this much money on a fingernail clipper?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer is yes I can.  It&#x27;s that good.  And your finger/toenails aren&#x27;t going to stop growing any time soon, so it&#x27;s an investment that will pay off for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I let a family member use it and they remarked how nice it is and asked where they could get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I use this, I like to imagine ancient Japanese Samurai swordsmiths moonlighting and hammering these fingernail clippers out at the blacksmith in their off season.... Haha!</li>
            <li> I purchased a set of Seki Edge toenail clippers to replace a set of clippers I had been using for a while, which I recently lost.  I started thinking, if the toenail clippers are as good as everyone says, I&#x27;ll regret it if I don&#x27;t get some fingernail clippers to go with the toenail clippers.  Both sets of clippers came in today, and I immediately tried out the toenail clippers.  Needless to say, I was impressed.  Even though my finger nails weren&#x27;t exactly getting out of control, I was so pleased with the results on my toenails, I went ahead and worked my fingers over with these clippers.  Like the toenail clippers, these were comfortable to use, and made very clean, precise cuts on my nails.  Very little pressure was needed.  I found that I didn&#x27;t have to keep clipping a little at a time to get everything even, or to remove a jagged edge.  They just worked great.  I was also able to reduce the time needed to get the job done.  I am convinced, and I would suggest you give them a try.  Worth the extra money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great nail cutters - the best I have owned. The long handle is very effective in removing hard to get toe nails</li>
            <li> These clippers are remarkably well-made, both in design and execution. They are much, much sharper than the standard drugstore cheapies. I am hoping they will keep their edge, they have very slightly staggered blades, to avoid the two edges blunting each other in use. I also have their toenail clippers, which are similarly impressive.</li>
            <li> Awesome nail clippers - the best I have ever purchased.  They are sharp, and fit in you hand easily.  Wish I had found them years ago!</li>
            <li> I am happy to have it. It&#x27;s very sharp and can cut my nail sharply and accurately. My parents like to use it.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for nail clippers that would actually work and was easy to use. I definitely found them with these clippers. These are the best clippers ever.!!</li>
            <li> After spending untold dollars at department stores and pharmacies trying to find a trimmer capable of trimming my thick, tough nails caused by many years of manual labor, I lucked out and found this one. It&#x27;s absolutely the Rolls Royce of trimmers. Solid, substantial, sharp, not flimsy or flexible - it&#x27;s perfect. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Compared to other clippers I have used this one cuts easier. based on my expeerience using it II  recommend it.</li>
            <li> Bar none, the best fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  Its so precise and effortless when using, I can&#x27;t wait to use it again.  Its simply&lt;br /&gt;the best fingernail clipper out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sharp and it works well. It gives your nails a clean cut.. but it doesn&#x27;t open wide enough.Glad I bought this item. I needed a bit more in the cart to qualify for free shipping. .</li>
            <li> Egronomically sounds. I love that it is stainless steel.  It is sharp, and cuts nails cleanly. It will last for a long time!!</li>
            <li> I just used them once on my toe nails though, but they are at the present moment the best clippers I have ever used. I really like that they have an extended bottom easy to get all my fingers on it. They are also very sharp so it doesn&#x27;t take any pressure to actually clip a nail. It also helps that the lever is designed at a very sharp angle unlike cheap clippers where it is more of a bend. Well worth the price of admission if you ask me.</li>
            <li> leaves my nails sharp and rough, difficult to use, went back to the $2.00 drug store clippers, way better and cheaper</li>
            <li> I had been using a set of nail clippers from the 1970&#x27;s. They were just worn out. We bought some other clippers at the grocery store or drug store and they were awful - not as good as the old ones. So I decided to shop for a better quality clipper and got these Seki fingernail and also some Seki toenail clippers. I never thought that nail clippers could be this good. I love them. Admittedly, I&#x27;m not a clipper connoisseur, but these things are as sharp as the samurai swords they claim to be associated with.</li>
            <li> These are wonderful,cannot believe the difference.They are so sharp. Everyone in my family is getting a set for Christmas.So glad I found them</li>
            <li> Better than most SHARP</li>
            <li> Very Nice and Excellent Shipping</li>
            <li> These are very nice clippers, much better than Revlon. They are comfortable to hold and easy to control. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Excellent Item and Fast Shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am a strange dude who obsesses over high-quality finger nail clippers and has to keep my nails and cuticles short and neatly-trimmed.  I also have to take a pair of clippers with me when I go out of town even for just a day or two.  These are the best fingernail clippers I have ever owned.  Very sharp, sturdy, and reliable.</li>
            <li> I prefer the toe nail clippers for their larger size.</li>
            <li> I have been buying and tossing fingernail clippers for years as they get dull and tear the nails.  This clipper is super sharp providing clean cuts and no tearing.</li>
            <li> One of the nastier things in the world is a clipper that isn&#x27;t sharp enough; your nail suddenly bends and it&#x27;s awful. These are very sharp and mechanically precise. They do the job.</li>
            <li> First time I have ever felt that nail clippers were hard to hold in my hand.  These cut superbly yet they seem to want to slide/wiggle out of your hand.  Not ergonomically built.</li>
            <li> They work better than the Seki TOE clippers which I bought a couple of years ago.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  The metal quality is good.  The shape is easy to grip because of the shape &amp; finish, and the blades make nice, clean, quick cuts.  It has a little more width than most fingernail clippers.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality. Leaves smooth cut. Slightly larger than most clippers so a little bulky feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the sharpest fingernail clipper I&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;ve had it over two years and I can&#x27;t tell that it has lost any sharpness what so ever. One star off for the thumb lever. In the storage position there is not a detent or lock of any kind to keep the thumb lever from rotating. That makes it unfriendly for pocket carry. If it came with a leatherette case to tame the thumb lever I would have no problem giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best, if not the best, fingernail clipper we&#x27;ve ever purchased. After purchasing clippers at the local drugstore, we were disappointed that they left ragged edges and required a lot of pressure to cut the nail.  After tossing those, we were willing to pay top dollar for a good clipper.  After much research, we chose this clipper.  They are everything you expect a fingernail clipper to be at a reasonable price.  They cut precisely and easily with little effort. If we lost these, I would buy the same clipper again - in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Although it is sharp enough to cut your nails smoothly, it is too small to use easily. It is hard to grip and requires several clips to do a nail.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s a little bit pricey but its worth every penny, its that good. if you are looking for quality and efficiency this is for you.</li>
            <li> Only once in my life have I had a pair of nail clippers this good. I know what I&#x27;ll use for entire forcible future.&lt;br /&gt;Very sharp, Not too curved. Some thing very much worth the money. An ah ha moment, why I wasn&#x27;t using something this good for so long.</li>
            <li> Finally something made of good quality.  So many things just keep getting cheaper and cheaper.  These don&#x27;t waffle under load.  I&#x27;ve abused them on other things than I should be cutting and yet they continue to hold up and stay sharp.  Buy them for life and don&#x27;t share them!  Someone wants to borrow them....buy them a set as a gift.  Oh yeah and they don&#x27;t rust.  I&#x27;ve had the cheap one&#x27;s rust up.  I guess just from the moisture in a bathroom.  I believe these must be made of stainless steel.</li>
            <li> Sharp, the curved blade is easy to work with and solidly built.  We bought 3 more to keep in suitcases and around the house</li>
            <li> This is a precision nail clipper of high quality. It is SHARP! It is easy to tell the difference in the inexpensive clippers one usually finds in the drug store. They are expensive, but one would expect to pay more for this quality.</li>
            <li> These were purchased to replace the best pair of clippers I&#x27;ve ever had (the old Brookstone clippers which have been changed several years ago with a less than average pair) after buying drug store selections for over a year.  The cut is clean and fast.  The only criticism is the blade surface isn&#x27;t quite long enough and requires several cuts on each nail (more than usual).  Other than that, they are very nice, easy to grip and fairly light.</li>
            <li> I have the Seki Edge toenail clipper and love it, so I bought this product.  I am sad to report I have absolutely no need for it.  It&#x27;s just a smaller version of the toe clipper and has no functionality as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I just use the toenail clipper on my fingers and toes.</li>
            <li> Very sharp as described and reviewed by customer. I wish it has a built-in nail filer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fingernail clipper I have ever owned.  It feels really sturdy, and is extremely sharp.  It does a great job.  I will definitely by from Seki again.</li>
            <li> I am only writing this review because there are way too many overly positive reviews. Someone must be paying for all these reviews. These clippers are not good. They are dull, send nails flying all directions, and leave my nails with sharp edges. I was suspicious about the number of great reviews for nail clippers. I should have known better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know they made fingernail clippers like this. Cuts through nails like butter, feels great, perfectly ergonomic, just the right size, etc. I will never use the standard drugstore clippers again. I wish I had splurged on one of these decades ago.</li>
            <li> these cutters do a great job at cutting nails (d&#x27;uh).  they are sharp and easy to use with one hand.</li>
            <li> Cuts through my nails like a hot knife through butter. I can&#x27;t get enough of these Seki clippers. I want everything Seki! Seki sheers, Seki shaver, Seki knives and Seki guillotines!</li>
            <li> like these so much ,i bought another..</li>
            <li> ***Copied from my review of the matching toe nail clippers. These are the same quality, just sized for fingers.***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had a problem keeping my nails trimmed as I hate the feeling of cheap clippers trying to force their way through my nails. I purchased the fingernail and toe nail clippers at the same time and it makes all the difference in the world. These cut cleanly through my nails with very little effort, they are very comfortable to hold and seem very solid. I had no idea that crappy clippers were the reason I hated cutting my nails, but now that problem has gone from my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for my toe nails, I have had several pairs of clippers break while trying to cut my thick nails. These will not have that problem. I barely have to use any pressure to cut right through them. It just amazes me what a difference a quality product can make&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be recommending these to everyone I know, and will be trying to convince everyone to trash their cheap clippers. If you are hesitating because of the price difference of these compared to your Wal-Mart/dollar store/pharmacy clippers, stop and remember: sometimes you get exactly what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Handle at a bit of an odd angle but cuts beautifully.</li>
            <li> Way better then $0.99 clippers from the drugstore.  These things are made in Japan and are a quality product! .</li>
            <li> I had bought a couple of other nail cutters, all were either dull or break the nails. This one is very well made and does the job with any problems, will recommend.</li>
            <li> I got to go against the vox populi on these clippers, though my problem isn&#x27;t the same as the ones I see in some of the other bad reviews (my top/bottom match, the &amp;#34;blades&amp;#34; are plenty sharp, etc.) - my problem is that they are hard to position over the nail.  It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t extend far out enough or something.</li>
            <li> Sharp, very sharp,  hardly any pressure needed to cut.  Radius of cutter is perfect.  Size is great,  not to small or too large,  just like the three little bears.</li>
            <li> this cutter created bad cuts leaving big burrs everywhere it cuts; save yourself time and money not ordering this cutter;</li>
            <li> Very smooth operation and just feels good in your hand. The cheap clippers don&#x27;t even compare. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best nail clipper ever.  Nice weight.  Solid design for a good grip, and it is extremely sharp.  I have so many pairs of these I lost count.  Get both finger and toe nail clippers !</li>
            <li> I am no expert on these things but this surely beats the lightweight cheapies that my wife has bought at drug stores,  This is a sturdy little fellow that takes a firm clean bite and I I expect to ;pass it down to my great grandchildren and they, in turn, pass on to theirs at which time its value as a beautifully functioning antique will  be such that they will have the joy of living in luxury.</li>
            <li> These are expensive, perhaps 10 to 20 times the cost of drug store clippers. They are worth it, at least to me. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;The bottom handle part is longer and wider so the clipper doesn&#x27;t twist and jump out your hands.&lt;br /&gt;The blade is much sharper so it snaps when it cuts.&lt;br /&gt;The jaws of the clipper are open wider at rest so it&#x27;s easier to insert your nails.&lt;br /&gt;The spring action is much stronger so each cut is more purposeful, it should last longer.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Brookstone clipper set that cost about four times as much. This clipper is better than the one in that set.</li>
            <li> As I get older it is getting more difficult to trim my finger nails.  I don&#x27;t have the strength to squeez other clipper&#x27;s.  This clipper is much sharper and has more leverage.  I&#x27;m happy with the clippers.</li>
            <li> I love these clippers and will never buy a different brand again. They work better than any other pair of clippers I have ever owned. I was going to buy the small baby cliippers for my daughter&#x27;s nails but didn&#x27;t like that it had a catch for the nails.</li>
            <li> These are expensive nail clippers and as soon as you pick up the product you can tell you will have them for a long time because of the quality materials. They work perfectly, but for the price, I would have wanted a nail file or at least a nail file tip to clean under the nail. The other reviews are accurate in that it makes cutting any nail a breeze, but it cuts the nail so well that it needs to be filed afterwards. This is because the edge of the nail is cut at almost a 90 degree angle due to how well the clippers clip the nail. This is not a complaint, but simply an observation and a reason that a nail file would have been a nice addition. Also, if you are one to cut your nails really short be cautious because this will cut through the sensitive part under the nail with ease. I would recommend this product to anyone, but tell them to purchase a nail file as well. Does Seki make a nail file? I did not find one.</li>
            <li> Those clippers are sharp! They cut right through the nails leaving a clean cut. They&#x27;re so sharp I love cutting my nails LOL</li>
            <li> I have rock hard finger nails. Drug store clippers last about 3 clippings for me before bending or just snapping. These clippers are weighty and very sharp! No more filing after clipping, yeah! I highly recommend these, especially for those of you out there like me with unusually hard nails.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at personel item in my xmas stocking. It the It works great. It feels good in your hand and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This line of implements is worth every penny of it higher price. If you&#x27;ve been using the cheap models sold at the drugstore, treat yourself to one of these.</li>
            <li> Extremely sharp and very effective. Heavy and feels well-made.</li>
            <li> Dont hesitate to get one of these.  The best investment over junk clippers that cost $3-5.  Its will last you a lifetime.</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper I ever had and well worth the price.  But why did I give it only 2 stars?  Please read on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was tired of the cheaply made clippers that never worked well, so although $13 is quite high for a clipper I decided to give it a chance.  Once I got it I was VERY impressed and it clipped my nails very cleanly and with a distinct &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; sound each time.  The clipped nail literally flew away!  Sometimes I use a clipper to trim my cuticles and this trimmer did also did that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much that I order another and that&#x27;s why only 2 stars.  This second clipper is literally a piece of crap.  As soon as I got it out of the box and looked it over it seemed that the jaws were not as precisely aligned as the first one.  But I figured I might as well give it a try.  So I clipped a nail and instead of a nice crisp &amp;#34;clip&amp;#34; sound I got a dull kind of thud sound.  And the clipped nail was STILL ATTACHED to the nail.  The clipper did NOT fully cut the nail.  I had to rock the clipped nail once or twice and then it came off.  THIS IS HOW THE CHEAP CLIPPERS WORK.  Then I tried a cuticle and the same thing happened.  The first clipper was worth $13, but this one is only worth about $3!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning the second one and although I&#x27;ve only sampled 2 units one was good and the other bad.  But since that&#x27;s not a good enough range of samples I&#x27;m willing to give it a try again so as soon as I get the refund on the second I will order a third and will update this review once I get it.</li>
            <li> These clippers have finely honed blades that cut nails effortlessly, continuing to uphold the reputation of Japanese blade makers as the finest in the world. One has to marvel at their stellar quality control. My only complaint about these clippers is, the overall size is small and petite, and when I use them to clip my cats&#x27; nails they sometimes slip out of my hand, and I have small female hands. I&#x27;m going to try the Seki Toenail Clippers for the cats and am sure the blades will cut sharp and true.</li>
            <li> Bought these years ago now, and lost them recently (I swear they&#x27;re in this house somewhere)! How many people can say they tore up their house looking for their favorite nail clippers? Hah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second purchase, just as good as the first and now $10 cheaper. A quality clip, feels strong, they&#x27;re good clippers, what else is there to say?</li>
            <li> This is a well made clipper.  The edge is great and the right size for a woman&#x27;s fingernails.  It functions properly, and I am sure I will have it for a long time.  So why only 4 stars?  The price is almost $15.00.  I have previously purchased nail clippers for $.99 at one of the big retail discount stores.  It also has a good edge and is easy to use.  It may well fail mechanically after a year, but that has not been my previous experience.  I will be using the Seki Edge clippers that I purchased.  I guess I&#x27;ll get back to you in 15 years, or when it breaks, whichever comes first.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I actually decided to go ahead and spend the money on these clippers. One would think clippers are just clippers, but having used so many cheap clippers in the past, I am beyond pleased with this item. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> great pair clippers cuts both toe nail and fingernails  well</li>
            <li> Highest quality nail clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned. Owned it for nearly two years now, I think, and it&#x27;s still sharp as ever.</li>
            <li> These are well made and really sharp.  They feel substantial and you want to recommend them to everybody.</li>
            <li> Uneven cutting surface</li>
            <li> great product, a bit expensive but impressive sharp</li>
            <li> These are the best fingernail clippers I&#x27;ve ever owned and I can&#x27;t stop recommending them to people. They are great for thick nails like mine, and they are worth the higher price because they don&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> Similar to the toe clipper ~ very sharp and they do the job nicely!  Much better the others I have purchased in the store.  Would buy these again.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but excellent clippers.  Also, these are truly a fine example of beautiful industrial design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like some of the other posters who are obsessive about their nails and this was quite disappointing. The clippers cutting edge that has what I&#x27;d describe as serious underbite. This gives them a really rough uneven cut and makes it impossible to get the edges close. I&#x27;ve spent half as much and gotten much better quality and I guess I&#x27;ll stick with them.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, I thought to myself, &amp;#34;How much difference could one nailclipper make?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a fool.</li>
            <li> Best of the Best ! 10 stars product !!!</li>
            <li> Who knew there were better clippers. I play stringed instruments so I have to constantly keep my fingernails at bay. These make the job easy and I actually keep them in my instrument cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are very well made so I don&#x27;t imagine you would have to replace them very often. It probably evens out with all of of the $1 clippers you buy at the grocery store which have such a short lifespan.</li>
            <li> Best clippers to date! The curve of the blades is a little more extreme than I&#x27;m used to but everything else makes up for it. Build quality is top notch, metal looks nice and finished, and it&#x27;s sharp! It cuts when you tell it to cut...not slipping off the nail. Be careful not to trim too short because these clippers make it easy!</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper ever! You will wish your nails  grew faster so you ccan cut them more often. THis is a  fine piece of  perfectly machined perfection.CUts  right thru nail with no resistance. No more lttle  shards of nails after clipping.</li>
            <li> Nice clipper, works very well</li>
            <li> ... actually too sharp for my taste! It&#x27;s samurai sword-level of sharpness (seemingly, at least, if not actually), requires one to use it with great care, or one&#x27;s nails will be filled with scratches.</li>
            <li> Unquestionably the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used in my 60 years of life.  Worth at least twice more than the 12 bucks I paid for them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think nail clippers were any different from one another, until I tried these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of the advantages :&lt;br /&gt;-The curved grip design is much more ergonomic and easier to use than traditional flat nail clippers.&lt;br /&gt;-The blades are very sharp, and cut easily and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;-The cast level has a nice feel and adds extra leverage to power through even thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;-Made in Japan, supposedly by the same folks that used to craft samurai swords, how cool is that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You won&#x27;t regret purchasing these, just try it out!</li>
            <li> If you are a person who has scoured the market both local and online for a sharp, good looking, and reasonably priced fingernail (not toenail) clipper, this is it.  It has a lever arm mechanism that actually fits a man&#x27;s hand, does not slip or tip over, and exerts the proper cutting pressure.  It is excellent and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Man, this is THE clipper!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product. Excellent Service.</li>
            <li> These are great smooth cutting clippers. I would buy them again for sure. There is nothing negative I can say about these. They will probably be around for 30 years.</li>
            <li> Wow, it is sad that I waited so long before buying this. The difference between the cheap concenience store nail clippers and this professional grade clipper is astounding. My philosophy in life is buy it nice or buy it twice. This is one of those &amp;#34;buy it for life&amp;#34; purchases that makes you happy to do something as simple as clipping your nails. I&#x27;m a guy and I&#x27;m a little excited about this, but seriously when you go on interviews or talking to superiors or working with your hands, you would be surprised how important it is to have well kept nails. I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of hiring supervisors who tell me they usually notice if someone has dirty or unkempt fingernails - invest in yourself with this clipper.</li>
            <li> I really hate drug-store nail clippers; they just don&#x27;t work well.  Expensive clippers work much better, but I hate paying the extra money.  These are a good compromise; a little pricey, but they do work well.  One of the best nail clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note, all nail clippers will get dull and wear out, even the expensive ones.  Don&#x27;t expect these (or any nail clippers) to last more than a few years.</li>
            <li> Stupid as it sounds, these clippers are terrific! They make cutting nails effortless and they do an amazing job withy clean and quick cuts.</li>
            <li> This is the best fingernail clipper I have ever seen.  The metal is amazing, just feeling it in your hand you know this is a quality item.  It cuts excellent.  Totally worth buying, very satisfied!</li>
            <li> It cuts with twice the ease of my other clippers and feels like great quality. I&#x27;d definitely recommend this upgrade.</li>
            <li> I agree with one reviewer who noted the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;after you trim your nails with these you REQUIRE a file.&lt;br /&gt;These trim your nails easily, but leave you with a very sharp nail edge\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also with&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I also find them to be weirdly weighted and difficult to hold because the finish is slippery.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you don&#x27;t file your nails after using these you may just slice your ear off. *laugh*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I play guitar, after cutting my nails but not filing them, i scratched a mark in my rosewood fingerboard.  This suprised me greatly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOOO expect that you&#x27;ll need a file.  Buy a good metal file from the drug store.</li>
            <li> The fingernail clipper is at least five times more expensive than others, maybe ten times more expensive.  I was wondering if they could possibly be worth it.  The verdict is in - WORTH EVERY PENNY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are super sharp, and glide through fingernails with ease.  I did not ever think it would be possible to cut fingernails this easily!!! I now look forward to cutting my nails each time!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product - the quality is worth the price. When you use it, you really feel the difference from any other nail clipper</li>
            <li> As advertised, this clipper is very sharp but is larger than most clippers, does not open as wide as some clippers and therefore is abit clumsy &amp; less maneuverable than some other clippers.</li>
            <li> Nice, sharp edges.  I&#x27;m glad I sprung for nicer clippers!</li>
            <li> Clipper is very well made and easily clips finger nails and toe nails as well. Very impressed. Product is pricy, but hope it will last forever.</li>
            <li> Tired of the performance of the more common, less expensive fingernail and toenail clippers, we decided to buy a serious, top of the line sort of product.  We bought both the fingernail and toenail clippers.  They are simply a great pleasure to use.  The cutting is easy, the amount of force needed to clip is so much less.  Ergonomically well designed, these clippers simply make it terribly unattractive to ever settle for anything less again.</li>
            <li> Some of the best clippers I have ever used.</li>
            <li> just what i was after. I have thick nails so cheap cutters suck for me. These are well built and sharp</li>
            <li> The first time I used this instrument, it was like cutting butter instead of nails. These clippers remind me more of surgical equipment than nail clippers. They are brilliant. And for all you good ole Americans too dumb to consider anything made outside of your safe little country, these are from the far east. So don&#x27;t buy them You will turn into a communist, move to Russia, and change your name to Bobby Joe Stalin.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever found and I have had dozens in many price ranges.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, cuts nails cleanly. A bit large and awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> PRO:  They work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:  They aren&#x27;t stainless.  I&#x27;ve had mine less than six months and they&#x27;re already rusting.  (And no, they aren&#x27;t kept in the tub.  They rusted just sitting in the medicine cabinet.)</li>
            <li> Well built, sharp, and gets the job done the first time without splintering nails.</li>
            <li> Pricey, but the best you will ever use.  Extremely sharp. Cuts cleanly with no effort.  Also bought the toenail clippers, but this fingernail clipper works well on toes too.</li>
            <li> One day, I was using a 99 cent pair of finger nail clippers and they broke because they were so cheap. I was irked so I went on Amazon and ordered these. Wow is all I can say. I understand it’s just a pair of finger clippers and its sounds lame that I get excited about these, but I do.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don’t think I will ever have to buy another pair of finger nail clippers in my life. They cut through nails like a hot knife through butter. My wife was pissed I spent $15 on finger nail clippers but once she started using them she took back her comment. I have now since ordered  a pair for my mother-in-law and father-in-law.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Never knew there was a difference in nail clippers. These things clip VERY cleanly and with pretty much no effort at all. I was really surprised to be honest. Comfortable to use and great results!</li>
            <li> Excellent product, Never spent this much on a nail clipper but this was totally worth it. Very sharp. arrived very quickly and was the best price I could find on the internet. Very satisfied and hope to deal with again. Thanks</li>
            <li> If you have trouble with regular nail clippers, you won&#x27;t have any problem with these.  Granted, they are expensive as far as nail clippers are concerned, but you get what you pay for here.  They are sharp and don&#x27;t require much pressure to cut.</li>
            <li> The best nail clippers I ever had! Thank you!</li>
            <li> fantastic trimmers, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Sharp. Hefty. Clean cuts. These are a well needed  upgrade to the run-of-the-mill grocery store beauty aisle nail clippers. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I guess I am in the minority in that I consider these clippers to just be ok, and probably not really worth the premium charged when you could buy 8 or 10 of the cheap ones for the same price.  Might these hold up longer without getting \\&quot;loose\\&quot;?  Time will tell, though on the other hand as mentioned you could simply buy multiple cheaper clippers for the same price, and have them stashed all over and move on to the next pair when they got loose or seemed less sharp.  These probably are a BIT nicer than your standard clippers, if that is what you are looking for, but not that much better, so don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> My husband was looking for &amp;#34;the best set of nail clippers money can buy&amp;#34;.  He says I found it :-)  Now the only problem is when someone in the house steals them and he can&#x27;t find his clippers!</li>
            <li> I actually don&#x27;t like these because they make my nails too sharp. I&#x27;ve gone back to using my old dull clippers because they leave my nail edges softer, more natural and not as sharp. If you use these, you will probably want to use a file afterwards. I hate to give these a bad review, because they are high quality, and I like that they won&#x27;t rust, and they cut well. They just cut too well. I might file the cutting edges and make them dull. Of course this review is just my opinion. If you want a super sharp clipper, this is for you.</li>
            <li> These are a must-have. After owning these you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever bothered with the typical stuff available in the drug stores like Revlon or LaCross.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a toe nail clipper and it works fine. I have bought the cheaper ones at the local outlets and some work but most are not very good. This costs a little more but it is as good as I have had.</li>
            <li> It seems like the drugstore brand of nail clippers used to work fine. Whether product quality or change in nail structure, it has been difficult, over the past few years (maybe more) to find a pair that doesn&#x27;t leave edges ragged or require tremendous pressure to work. The Seki Edge works like nail clippers should. Finally.</li>
            <li> I finally got tired of using cheap, dull clippers.  In my house, my things belong to everyone.  There is never a set of clippers to be found.  So my strategy has been to buy lots of clippers and eventually all the spots where clippers go will eventually be full and I would readily be able to find my clippers.  To accomplish this, I would go to Wal Mart and buy them 5 or 6 at a time once or twice a year.  This has been a sound strategy for me in the past with ball point pens so I thought it would work with clippers too.  I was wrong, well, the strategy is sound, but virtually all the clippers I would buy were pieces of ****.  So what I had were a lot of clippers that were dull or the metal would eventually break from the fatigue of being dull and the extra stress of cutting the nail with a dull clipper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I decided to change my strategy.  I still enjoy the smoke screen of all those other clippers in the house to confuse my clipper competitors.  I bought this the Seki clipper and WOW, it is great.  VERY sharp and a definitive \\&quot;click\\&quot; as it cuts the nail.  It feels FAR more precise than ANY other clipper I have used.  This is a secret in my house and I have no plans to share.  Maybe I&#x27;ll be able to keep them for several months all to myself!  I am sharing with you though, if you want an excellent set of clippers, you have found what you are looking for.  I would definitely buy these again.  I did a search of the internet and was not able to beat the price I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> These clippers are heavy duty and have not dull yet.  I have a drawer of various clippers that are use to clip my own nails and the nails of my pets.  Other clippers tend to already be dull on one side forcing you to use the other to perform a clean clipping.  These clippers allow me to clip my pets&#x27; nails regardless of which side is being used.  The clip is fast and clean.  I am careful when using them because they are so sharp I could shear through skin very easily (this is not a bad thing, in my opinion, just a caution for using such good clippers).</li>
            <li> Really good clipper.... but be careful, it is extremely sharp!</li>
            <li> Not much to be said here except they are the best nail trimmers I have ever owned. I expect they will last a lifetime.!!</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper because I already have a Seki toenail clipper which is excellent.  This fingernail clipper is every bit as good as the toenail model.  I gave it four stars only because it is a little small for my big fingers.  However, the quality and sharpness is excellent and far surpasses anything you can buy in a drugstore.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Feels like a quality instrument in your hand before you even use it.  The cut is sharp, fast, and clean.  I&#x27;ve never had a clipper after which I didn&#x27;t have to use a nail file, i do now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read one or two negative reviews, i think maybe they received the one in a thousand defective outliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was $10 less than the German pair I considered purchasing, and I am completely pleased.</li>
            <li> These fingernail clippers are designed to be easy to hold on to and to clip your nails easily and smoothly.  The clipping lever is formed so your thumb meets it comfortably and efficiently.  The blade edges are usefully sharp--no more cheapies for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order was filled and sent in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> The finger nail clippers are da bomb. They are quality made and I feel as if they will be the last pair of finger clippers I will ever have to buy in my lifetime.</li>
            <li> Great quality and workmanship.  My husband was always breaking other brands of clippers or they really just wore out quickly.  The Seki have kept their edge and work smoothly unlike others that seem to catch and not cut cleanly.</li>
            <li> Works effortlessly, like magic.</li>
            <li> Sharp and well aligned. The clipper is a little larger than I had anticipated, but not so large that it is too big to be controlled.</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these at a much higher price from Brookstone 6 or so years back. It still works great. It is far more solid than the cheaper clippers that you&#x27;ll find at the big box retail and drug store chains. I have thick nails and these cut through them like butter. The only problem is that my wife keeps taking it out of my drawer and leaving it around the house. I purchased a second one recently and the build quality appears to be identical to my first one. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. It&#x27;s a good size for finger nails. I have the toe nail version as well. It is very sharp and high quality.</li>
            <li> Pretty good set of nail clippers. They&#x27;re pretty sharp and work great for my fingernails. Not so much for my toenails, but I have a bigger nail clipper for that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve carried a fingernail clipper in my pocket every day for at least 20 years. It&#x27;s an essential tool that&#x27;s with me as often as my keys, wallet, or chap-stick. I&#x27;ve owned many clippers over the years, and this is hands-down the best I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s solid stainless steel as opposed to chrome-plated whatever, and it has a sharp, precise cutting action, and a solid, high-quality feel. A top-notch product.</li>
            <li> Works great--just need to find a good &amp;#34;container&amp;#34; to hold this and other products to keep in my purse with me.</li>
            <li> This tiny little thing is superb. I was skeptical initially. But turned out to be a great purchase. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I have had the Green Bell nail clipper for about 15 years &amp; it still works as good as the day I received it. When I Googled Green Bell to order a set for my grandson the name Seki came up instead. Since it looked the same, I figured Seki had purchased Green Bell, so I ordered the fingernail clipper. Looks is all it has in common with the Green Bell clipper. The Seki does not cut the nail as cleanly &amp; leaves the nails with a rough edge. Oh well, too bad!!</li>
            <li> These clippers are superb!! They far exceeded my expectations. Been using them for about 10 months now. Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Easily the sharpest clippers I have ever used. The high price is the only reason I deducted a star. I was very surprised how much of a difference that sharp clippers make over a cheap pair. Now I&#x27;m spoiled (convinced) that quality matters.</li>
            <li> Takes some getting used to because it is very sharp and precise, but this is the best clipper I&#x27;ve ever used. The first couple times I used it I cut a little too close to the skin and it felt unwieldy, but not anymore. Very durable and worth the money.</li>
            <li> I refuse to use another fingernail clipper again. I actually tossed all the other ones in the house and will be ordering another pair of these for a back up, they are that nice.  You hardly have to press down to clip the nail, and it&#x27;s smooth..I&#x27;m not mechanical at all, so is that a gear? a hinge?  Whatever it is, it&#x27;s worth the $. Never again will a $4 pair work.</li>
            <li> These are really nice nail clippers.  I will NEVER go back to using the cheap clippers from the big box store.  These work very smooth and effectively.  I&#x27;ll be curious if they maintain the sharpness or eventually go dull.  The clippers are very expensive but well worth it.  I actually have to hide these from other family members to make sure they don&#x27;t go missing.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the quality every time I use them. They clip the nail without any real effort required.</li>
            <li> I was &amp;#34;bored&amp;#34; on a Sunday and was looking up reviews on nail clippers. I had just bought some drug store ones to replace the old ones I couldn&#x27;t find. I thought they must make something better? So I read the reviews and decided what the heck? Wow!!! Very impressed, sharp, quality feel, etc... If I loose these I&#x27;ll definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> Seki Edge:  Excellent quality materials, well-crafted, well worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cutting edge in clippers, they are solid, accurate, clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It should hold it edge for a long time if the quality of the stainless steel is any indication. Great leverage for ease of cutting. No fingernail file on this unit but its precision cuts make up for it. Could be consider a bit slippery for gripping on the bottom piece. Good standard curve on the cutting edge to make adult cuts. Probably sharp enough to do toenails but not recommended. No keyring hole for portability, belongs at home anyway as a precision instrument.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad and I can&#x27;t walk into a store anywhere and pickup one up but Amazon makes the purchase convenient.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this at all. It leaves small dents on the nail and doesn&#x27;t come with a file. I like the cheap ones I&#x27;ve used for years much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many clippers over the years, but none as good as these.  They cut cleanly and easily.  I just have to find a place to hide them so my kids don&#x27;t walk away with them.</li>
            <li> These clippers are exactly as described; they feel good in your hand, they don&#x27;t slip around. They are sharp and do an accurate cut quickly and cleanly. I had no idea how dull the clippers were that I&#x27;ve been using for years! So nice to have reliable clippers; well worth the price.</li>
            <li> They are SO nice.....cut my fingernails like a charm! Has a very nice cutting edge. Highly recommend! Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I feel like an Iron Chef every time I clip my toenails.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the package, I could tell these were very high quality clippers. After all, nail clippers are really just a tool, and I&#x27;ve been around tools all of my life. These are a classic example of &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;. You could by 6 pairs at Walmart for the same price, but you still would have a cheap, inferior tool. I would rate these a 5, but I wish they had a built in file. I read other reviews saying they cut so nice you didn&#x27;t need the file, but I don&#x27;t agree. Regardless of how well they cut, you still need a file to smooth things out.  Having said that, I wouldn&#x27;t let the lack of a file prevent me from buying these again.</li>
            <li> These clippers are very sharp and nice, but wish they would not slide right or left when they are closed.  Maybe I can find a fingernail clipper by Seki which is made the same way as the toe nail clippers I bought.  They would also be a little easier to hold.</li>
            <li> I went with others reccommendations and found these nail clippers to have a smoth action and clean cut. If your putting this set together with the toenail cutters it is something you will want to keep from your kids and wife. Makes cutting your nails very smooth and quick.</li>
            <li> Sharp, strong, feels like it will last longer than me. Only drawback is lack of a holder that prevents the clippings from escaping onto the floor. I knew this going into the purchase though, so no ding for that. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> 14 dollars for a nail clipper!!! Before you try and burn the people who paid that let me tell you that they&#x27;re not crazy. This nail clipper is sharp, and it keeps sharp, I have had it for 1 yr and a half and its holding its own. I have quite thick nails, so nail clippers are always hard to press on, but with these it&#x27;s like my nails are made of thin paper. I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> There is a big difference between this clipper and drugstore ones. These are really well made and a solid cutting instrument . But why not a fingernail file and scraper/cleaner like the cheapos have? Reminds me of old phonograph players. The more you pay, the less they do. Oh well, files are available at least. 5 stars for quality and getting it right.</li>
            <li> I never thought I could really like a nail clippers! I thought they were all the same. Not so. This one is truly different and makes it much easier to use, especially with kids!</li>
            <li> Best clippers ever! People try to steal them. Seriously! People try to steal them. I actually gave these as gifts this Christmas and the recipients LOVE them too! These absolutely blow away every other clipper I have used. My mother-in-law that has those 3&amp;#34; gel nails used them in a nail &amp;#34;emergency&amp;#34; and guess what...? SHE FREAKING LOVED THEM! Everyone loves them. If you don&#x27;t believe me, come on over and I will let you try them. If you say meh after using them I will punch you in the face for being a liar.</li>
            <li> Very sharp and easy to handle.</li>
            <li> These are super sharp and require amost no effort to use.  They are high quality and don&#x27;t stick during use.</li>
            <li> These clippers are extreme! Made entirely of stainless steel (and not the cheapo kind), it feels like these are the superman of nail clippers! Clips very easily and smoothly.</li>
            <li> Wow, I didn&#x27;t realize how crappy most drugstore nail clippers were until I got this. Can&#x27;t go back now...</li>
            <li> The best clippers ive ever purchased, very sharp and very easy to hold to</li>
            <li> I love this little thing. I wish it had a filer though.</li>
            <li> After several months of usage...these clippers are the best I have ever used!  They cut my fingernails clean and neat.  Easily cut my husband&#x27;s thick nails.  Great!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best nail clippers I have ever used. Excellent value!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AT GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> Very sharp, works great.  I bought another.</li>
            <li> Awesome little tool for men&#x27;s grooming. Quality head-and-shoulders above what one gets with pharmacy sold clippers. Used it for a year now and it&#x27;s still very sharp and you get that crisp click sound when clipping the nail.&lt;br /&gt;While not as cheap as pharmacy or dept store sold clippers, this one is made to last.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend buying together w toe-nail clippers - which is a larger clipper and has a more straight edge.&lt;br /&gt;Only reason this wasn&#x27;t 5 starts - I deducted a star due to absence of addl extension (not sure what it&#x27;s called) used for digging into nail bed to remove cuticle. Some of my old clippers had it and it&#x27;s great for trimming side of the nail.</li>
            <li> These are the sharpest clippers I have ever had. Much better than the $.99 one at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Wow. These nail clippers are amazing! I always hated cutting my nails since clipping my nails meant me struggling with cutting down perfectly to the right length while trying to put as much pressure as possible to make a clean cut. With these, it only takes me about 2 minutes to get rid of my talons so I&#x27;d definitely recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> Sharp points but not sharp enough blade for cutting cuticles cleanly. I did keep though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about all that &amp;#34;from the maker of Samurai swords&amp;#34; stuff, but these are the best clippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Really sharp, excellent precision engineering. A little too tall or stacked for maneuverability, but a great clipper.</li>
            <li> These are not fingernail clippers. These are fingernail cutters. These are no different than cutting your fingers with a pair of scissors. Nails need to be clipped so they don&#x27;t have rough edges. Cut nails have very uneven rough edges.</li>
            <li> best nail clipper money can buy</li>
            <li> Best nail clippers I have every used.  They are surprisingly heavy, but just due to how well they are made.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper.  Who knew you could love a nail clipper?</li>
            <li> As other reviews have said, this clipper takes a while to get used to. It is heavy and clips hard, and I cut into my skin/cuticle a couple times the first few times I used it. But once I got used to it I really liked it. It is strong enough for even the toughest nails, hand or feet, and it cuts cleanly. Steel is high quality stuff too. A little pricey especially when you are used to buying clippers for 4-5 dollars, but if you think you might want this, I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> The best fingernail clippers I have ever used! I have ordered more of them to give to members of my family. They love them too!</li>
            <li> These clippers are quite nice. They feel high quality in your hands, they fit well in your fingers and they cut effortlessly. Makes it seem like my previous clippers were cracking the nail apart while these are cutting.</li>
            <li> An annoying personal task is much less annoying.  The Japanese maker delivers on everything.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this on Amazon for my husband and he loves this product.!! I then used the product and was amazed at the ease of the product. Give it a 5 star!!</li>
            <li> The very best nail clippers I ever owned!</li>
            <li> Get excited about nail clippers? Really?? Surprisingly, yes. Sharp as can be, and nice and heavy, while also being comfortable to use, with a nice, wide, ergonomic lever. My one complaint is that the lever moves so smoothly that it takes a few tries to get the correct grip down, to keep the lever centered, especially when using your non-dominant hand. I really like that the cutting edge isn&#x27;t curved quite as much as other clippers, and that allows me to flush off cuticles. By the way, I&#x27;m a shipfitter/welder, not some GQ type, and my hands take a beating at work; I needed a real tool keep my claws trimmed, not some chintzy little fru-fru device, and this does just fits the bill - and, just like any quality tool, it&#x27;s well worth the extra expense.</li>
            <li> Wow...  Perfect item!  Nice, slightly larger size makes it very easy to use and comfortable in the hand too.</li>
            <li> This is the best clipper I have ever had. I have very tough nails both hand and feet and never have jagged edges like all the others I tried.</li>
            <li> Your search for the highest quality clipper ends here. Believe the hype.. Buy it. You will not regret this purchase. The best clippers I have ever used in my 40+ years of life.</li>
            <li> These are a lot sharper than other nail clippers we have purchased in the past and do a great job of cutting the nail.  I do not recommend using these to cut hangnails though.</li>
            <li> Seki&#x27;s fingernail clipper is a fine precision instrument that makes accurate cutting easy and pleasurable.&lt;br /&gt;Quality feel and finish. Durable construction. Feels good in your hand. Put this clipper to work!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but looking at everyone&#x27;s review I took a chance and what a difference they make over the cheap ones you buy at the drugstore. Well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> I bought these nail clippers after two or three different pairs of Revlon nail clippers got me mad enough to punch a baby. My toe nails got disgustingly long because I hated the clippers I had. I paid $15 for these clippers.  If for some reason I lose these and have to buy another pair. I&#x27;d pay $50 for them. They&#x27;re that good.  So good in fact, this is the first review I&#x27;ve ever left on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been a prime member for like three years.</li>
            <li> Due to my healthly strong nails, I have broke several nail clippers that I purchased at local stores, this one is very strong and does well trimming my nails.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nail clipper the best I have ever used and highly recommend it. Well made and cuts clean.</li>
            <li> These really work nice. I have never spent this kind of money on clippers, but I guess you get what you pay for. I better not lose them. I wish it included the cleaner that most have. But, to the ease that these cut, it got 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I tried these clippers and they cut better than any I have ever tried.  I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
            <li> These clippers do cut with great ease but leave a rough cut on the nail.  I have to file my nails every time I clip and I have never had the need to file my nails.  Also, the blades do not meet to the very edge which sometimes leaves a &amp;#34;thread&amp;#34; of nail remaining.  Overall, I wish I would have paid the few extra dollars and bought the better quality clipper.</li>
            <li> Superior to any other clippers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT GOOD PRICE FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Seki is the best nail cutter on the market. I don&#x27;t cut my nails with anything else.</li>
            <li> I had a nail clipper that I bought in Japan for many years but got misplaced when I took it on a trip.  So I went and bought a replacement at a local pharmacy paying good price thinking it will be better than those cheap ones.  I was wrong, it turned out to be like those cheap ones you can buy that has a keychain; pretty much forcing to cut rather than clipping it.  This one is just like the one I had; sturdy and effortless.  The best is that you don&#x27;t have to struggle trying to align the top after spinning it around since it&#x27;s locked in place.</li>
            <li> Go from finger nail CLIPPER to finger nail CUTTER!  It is time for all humanity to demand BETTER results from such important tools.  How often do you cut your nails?  Every week, every month?  But how often do you use your fingers??  Why should cutting your nails weaponize them?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;re here because, like me, you&#x27;re done with chopped-up hack jobs, and you&#x27;re ready to spend what it takes to feel awesome about what just happened at your finger tips.  Good news: you found it, and everyone is saying that in these reviews for good reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try not to repeat all the other reviews (solid stainless instead of chrome plated pot-metal, made in Japan, intentionally made to be good rather than &#x27;enough&#x27;, does improve on the job, etc.) and keep this specific.&lt;br /&gt;  At first it can be hard to notice just how substantially different these are from lesser clippers - but if you imagine being the manufacturer wanting to save a single penny (or less!) on each clipper, all the details quickly unfold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro:&lt;br /&gt;-The edge.  The reason you buy these or don&#x27;t.  Ergonomics are important, but the quality of the cut and the quality of the steel to hold the edge is everything.  This pair cuts like nothing I&#x27;ve used before or hoped for.  I bought the Victorinox pocket clippers because I am obsessed with finding the best: they are great, they are SHARP...and they honestly do not cut as well.  They cut great, but not like these.  (For this review, I&#x27;m using a pair of La Cross clippers as the &amp;#34;lesser clippers&amp;#34; comparison.  The best pair I&#x27;ve found under $10.  Also, I owned a pair of Tweezerman clippers as was not impressed at all.)&lt;br /&gt;  I used to wash my hands with hot water to prepare my nails for clipping, I used to file underneath, on the flat edge, and on top of the nail to avoid drawing blood when scratching an itch after clipping my nails!  Those days are over.  This pair s-l-i-p-s through your nail, slices. A real cutting of the nail.  Also, if you inspect a lesser pair, you&#x27;ll find a small overbite where the blades meet, even on the Victorinox - not on these. Now I clip, and do a quick filing of the top of the edge, done - smooth, not scratchy or jagged, and very time efficient. As good or better than all that filing I was doing to correct what my clippers should have been accomplishing themselves.&lt;br /&gt;-The steel.  It is a gimmick to make a kitchen knife in Solingen Germany and declare it a masterpiece.  BUT, they still make some of the best there in Solingen.  And Swiss made products are still awesome.  This pair is made in Seki Japan - they are so proud of this fact (and its relation to traditional Japanese swords) that it is their brand name.  Gimmick?  Honestly, I don&#x27;t think so.  From the moderate knowledge and familiarity I have with Japanese culture, I know that when they set out to be the best, it can be a very serious venture.  I have not had my pair very long.  But those who have say the edge holds up great.  It seems likely to me that it&#x27;s good steel, and I notice the lever is different from the blade, which says to me they used a better steel where it counts.  I would love to say it has a great heat treat to temper the steel, but I honestly don&#x27;t know.  However, the best way I know to find out is whether the metal &#x27;rings&#x27; or not - and this pair doesn&#x27;t &#x27;clunk,&#x27; it has a very sharp sound quality when on a hard surface.  Someone who has worked with blades a lot can tell you when a metal sounds soft and hard, and this sounds hard.  That would be a very big deal to me, and honestly what I would expect that for a $20 pair (they&#x27;re $17 for me on Amazon, March 2015).  Try this: hold by lever in &#x27;up&#x27; position, run an edge of the body up and down your finger and hear the ring.  Do this with lesser clippers, and it sounds like a shiny block of wood.  no ring.&lt;br /&gt;-Connections and fasteners.  Not that lesser clippers fail because they come apart (not usually), but on a simple machine like this, connection points are just under the cutting edge and the steel in importance.  On the Seki, the lever is connected to the the axle shaft by a real rivet that is sealed on both ends with a tight fit and NO wobble.  Very different, very cool.  The connection in the rear is the usual stamp-press to fuse the metals, but the stamp is especially large and you can see plenty of material has been shifted in the process.  Yet they take the time to polish out any bumps on the top, opposite of the detent.  I don&#x27;t know what the two long holes in the very back are for...but they could possibly add to connection since they are cut together, the seam line inside is hard to find, and there is indention from the cut on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;-Control.  I find it easy to cut what I want to cut.  My thumb slips down the lever of lesser clippers, and I notice I don&#x27;t slip at ALL when using these.  Also, the blade has a good shape and natural curve, the mouth opens wide, and is big enough to do large fingers and BIG toes just fine.  (I have a l.a.r.g.e. big toe with a prodigious nail.  All my nails are very thick - so the Seki has been tested.)&lt;br /&gt;-Blade geometry.  The clippers are made from thinner steel, and this leads to a sharper edge.  But if you look at the lesser clippers compared to this, their &#x27;mouth&#x27; almost seems to jut outward while the Seki come more straight down and seem to have &#x27;deeper teeth.&#x27;  More cut, less pinch.&lt;br /&gt;-Finish.  There is a higher grit used on the final grinding of the blade edges than on any of my clippers.  This means a great deal for a clean, sharp edge, and for the manufacturing process.  The edge is actually lovely to look at.  Since heat treat is likely, that would mean needing to use coarse, medium, and fine grits to remove metal smoothly but without causing too much friction heat.  You can&#x27;t just use &#x27;fine&#x27; grit and remove a lot of material without ruining the temper.  extra steps &#x3D; a lot more cost for the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-some spacebetween axle shaft and lever at connection points.  Harm: none.  But there is some play allowed there.  Not enough to ever &#x27;come off the rails&#x27; like some clippers - it&#x27;s not hooked on, it&#x27;s an actual rivet - and the play is very slight.  Perhaps this results in greater flexibility - I wouldn&#x27;t put it past the makers to have thought this through.&lt;br /&gt;-Flair.  Back of clipper that fits into ball of hand isn&#x27;t super ergonomic.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it&#x27;s not pointy like the back of lesser clippers, but the way it flares out at the back and is slightly thin (metal is thinner because of higher quality - it&#x27;s a good thing) that I notice it.  However, There is evident attention to grinding down these edges to make them smooth; they are.&lt;br /&gt;-Ergonomics.  There is obvious work to make this a good fit in the hand, and I do have large hands, but I&#x27;m not blown away.  Good enough?  Absolutely, I&#x27;m very pleased with the purchase.  But it doesn&#x27;t feel like a glove.  The thumb pad is indented to hold the thumb better, but isn&#x27;t wide or shaped like a thumb.  The lever sits a little higher than I&#x27;m used to, but that might actually contribute to better control. (see above)  The whole body curves down, and I think that increases grip, and the flair-out at the back actually improves grip too.  S ergos are actually 50/50 for me.&lt;br /&gt;-Coolness.  For such an awesome pair of cutters, for being the best, for being so expensive, for being (hopefully) the last pair I&#x27;ll ever need....they aren&#x27;t that cool looking.  The brand sticker is really uninspiring and is just an open sticker.  The 9 dots on the back of the lever are just there to look cool...but.  The grip is very adequate, and actually has some grooves for traction....but, not cool.&lt;br /&gt;-sharp edges.  It means good things about the manufacture of the product, but the inside sides of the two blade plates are such a harsh 90 degrees that it feels like it could cut me.  No actual danger, and the outside edges are rounded (which indicates good thought).  But the sides of the blade edge are so sharp I&#x27;m not sure if I have the actual blade or just the tip curve against my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there you have it.  They are the best, pros and cons, and worth your money if you care enough to even be reading this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I used my Christmas money to buy them!  Would do it again.  But NO ONE will be borrowing these, so I will not NEED to buy them again.</li>
