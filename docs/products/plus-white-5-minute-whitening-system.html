            <li>very good and easy!!</li>
            <li>I rinsed my mouth and my teeth look absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the purchase, and using the cotton swab, maybe able to extend the use.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t hardcore dedicated to keeping up with it, missed a good 5 times</li>
            <li>so that is good</li>
            <li>A couple of hints: The tube of gel and rinse are good for about 14 treatments.</li>
            <li>Good stuff for a good price.</li>
            <li>and it sounded good with a good price, so I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Good kit.  </li>
            <li>I never take the time to write a good review but I will on this product.</li>
            <li>Good product...</li>
            <li>Good stuff.  </li>
            <li>The teeth mould is good but it requires effort to stop it popping out and off your teeth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this inexpensive product (5 bucks!!!)</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>The mouth tray is also great because its sort of a joint mouth tray (bottom attached to top)</li>
            <li>Happy with results, am buying more here.</li>
            <li>this is the exact product I used, and it is awesome!!!</li>
            <li>My friend recommended this product to me and I&#x27;m so glad she did!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li>I liked it</li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li>I really liked this product for the money...</li>
            <li>Great product, I&#x27;m buying another right now!</li>
            <li>but with this product I fianlly have the beautiful smile I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li>need more than 5 mins to get good results, more like 15mins</li>
            <li>it was very easy to use</li>
            <li>So far its the best one i have found.  </li>
            <li>wash mouth tray thoroughly with warm water being sure to remove all the goo</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery, product works great.</li>
            <li>An excellent product for a pretty quick fix, just put it on before a shower and rinse off after.</li>
            <li>works pretty great</li>
            <li>I had good results the very first 20 minute session.</li>
            <li>dental hygienist also told me that the best time to use something like this is right after you get your teeth cleaned -- for the first three days, your teeth will pick up the whitening agents</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference in just 3 applications!</li>
            <li>But anyway, overall happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>I found better results forgoing the provided tray and using customizable whitening trays</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I always see results at one use but it just gets better from there.</li>
            <li>SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY &#x27;STRIP&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I always used crest white strips because I figured they were the best teeth whiteners sold in stores.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather spend more on more convenience.</li>
            <li>Buy this! :)</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>(5) squeeze the whitening goo in the provided mouth tray -- bottom and top.  </li>
            <li>Better than whitestrips</li>
            <li>Will buy more.</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>I love this product and keep it on for 20 minutes a couple times a week.</li>
            <li>I am in love with this</li>
            <li>works for the most part.</li>
            <li>buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>I think these work better than the whitestrips.</li>
            <li>more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still more room for improvement.</li>
            <li>Definitely the best solution for whitening your teeth</li>
            <li>I bought this thing in 2007 to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; my teeth, I used many days, and it destroyed my gums.</li>
            <li>Although I wish there was a bit more product included.</li>
            <li>It is an inexpensive product, readily available, and I got IMMEDIATE results!  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>This product works - nothing more needed to say.</li>
            <li>Way better than any strips I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>so I was very excited to try this.  </li>
            <li>I have had very good luck over the years with various tooth whitening products ranging from the dentist&#x27;s office to over the counter strips (like Crest Whitestrips).  </li>
            <li>I think these are great for those with sensitive teeth since they don&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>Her suggestion is to find a moldable football player&#x27;s mouth guard instead of the tray this comes in to make this more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>this product did not work as good and as fast as i thought it would</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am very pleased with the results and highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>After managing to quickly get the tray into my mouth with the hopes that this product would magically stay on my teeth, it ended up going on my gums and on to the inside of my cheeks.</li>
            <li>This is cheap</li>
            <li>You can spread the gel on your \\&quot;smile surface\\&quot; with your finger or a q tip for better coverage.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth trying :)</li>
            <li>I have tried this product before when it was available in Target.  </li>
            <li>No matter how carefully I filled the mouth tray, there would be some product that oozed out.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll be happy with the turn out and you&#x27;ll save a minimum of 20 bux choosing this over the big brands.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve been using some trays that I got for free from my dentist.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The trays don&#x27;t fit well for me.</li>
            <li>Do not Stop Go...buy this whitener, and follow the instructions precisely.  </li>
            <li>i bought this product to my wife, and after two weeks my wife is happy with her white and shiny teeth</li>
            <li>I leave the product on most times much longer that instructed, sometimes while showering sometimes while watching TV or surfing the web all in hopes of getting better results,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had good results so far (5 days or so).</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s call it a 3.5 star rated product; Itâ€™s convenient and easy to use, has good written (but, in tiny print) instructions etc.</li>
            <li>I have used this product in the past and I always feel that it is an excellent value.</li>
            <li>it was significantly cheaper than the rest and thought I would test it out.</li>
            <li>I thought it was fairly convenient and the mouth piece fit my mouth well enough.</li>
            <li>As a lover of dark coffee and red wine, my teeth were definitely a great test of this product, but I saw a difference two days in and it just got better after that... color me a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had such bright teeth before and there was no sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li>My teeth look whiter, but this product only takes me to about 3/4 of the way to where I want to shade wise.  </li>
            <li>I made my own customs trays by putting clear mouth guards in boiling water until flimsy and inserting them in my mouth to form around my teeth.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t used them for a full 2 weeks yet</li>
            <li>So take my advice, if you have sensitive teeth and want effective results, don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice and white :) so easy to use and the price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>quick set-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to test out something different to see if I get better and more noticeable results.</li>
            <li>The directions say to fill the tray on both the top and bottom if you want to whiten your top and bottom teeth at the same time.</li>
            <li>Luckily, none of the content was spilled.  </li>
            <li>Sitting around drooling all over the place isn&#x27;t the most attractive or comfortable, so at least you can spit an excess down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;- Make your own custom teeth trays!</li>
            <li>After my first day of use I could see a huge difference, I&#x27;m on day 4</li>
            <li>Oh I guess if I had to give any cons, the whitening gel was kinda funky, not in taste but that it wouldn&#x27;t wash off easy and doesn&#x27;t really dissolve in water.</li>
            <li>Very sticky formula, easy to put in</li>
            <li>And teeth are much whiter after 3 weeks!!</li>
            <li>still worth the money though.</li>
            <li>I use it to touch up my smile when I feel like coffee has taken a toll on my teeth.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>My teeth are relatively nice to begin with, so I was just looking for brightening boost - was hesitant to use twice a day as they recommended, and used just once a day at night for a week or two and could definitely tell a difference!</li>
            <li>i have been using this product for about 3-4 weeks and have noticed a &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; smile.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve mostly been doing touch ups), but I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference.</li>
            <li>My experience so far with this product is mostly of annoyance.</li>
            <li>Makes them a bit more sensitive though for a day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Don&#x27;t need prescription, you can buy it right off</li>
            <li>But for soooo much cheaper you can whiten your teeth with plus white and it works even better than the strips!</li>
            <li>As I said the crest pro are much better also it is worth pointing out that if you go to your dentist the minimum treatment time is 30 min per  session and it may take several sessions.  </li>
            <li>I do spit it out and put the mouth piece back in several times and still see great results.</li>
            <li>works very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not exactly the most comfortable whitening process (the solution foams up</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was quick and easy to use --- I used it for 20 minutes, twice a day for the first and second days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product actually works in one use and  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read at first that it takes 5 minutes</li>
            <li>I used it for 15 minutes at a time, once a day, and saw results after the first usage.  </li>
            <li>The product worked as described,  I will definitely order more as my wife is now using it.  </li>
            <li>EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK, TO GET GREAT RESULTS WITH AT LEAST 15 MIN INSTEAD OF 5 MIN USE.</li>
            <li>First day using it</li>
            <li>it does work i saw the difference the first time but after using it for like 7th time it started hurting my gums, so i stopped</li>
            <li>As for the rest, the &amp;#34;tray&amp;#34; that it comes with is made of cheap, soft, and flexible rubber.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product 2 times a day for 20 minutes each time for 4 days now and my teeth are already so much whiter!</li>
            <li>I hope with further use there will be more improvement.</li>
            <li>First off, the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days now (once a day for 20 minutes) and my teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li>These work pretty well</li>
            <li>I can already tell the difference, even after the first day.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!</li>
            <li>Nothing chang and its so hot for my teeth</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>; and the product didn&#x27;t even last for more than 6 days.</li>
            <li>Now I use it maybe once a week, and it really has lightened my teeth!  </li>
            <li>It is way cheaper than a laser whitenng, and many comment on how white my teeth look, &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li>First time I thought 5 mins was forever, like I would gag.</li>
            <li>I would only recommend this for people who are looking for more of a shine then to whiten.</li>
            <li>And after all of the pain and suffering, I didn&#x27;t notice my teeth to be any more white than they were before.</li>
            <li>I used it first time for about 18min.</li>
            <li>the first used, yes, worked, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li>This whitens your teeth FAST!  </li>
            <li>.. works better and faster than most more expensive whiteners.</li>
            <li>There has been no sensitivity after two full days of use, and I have VERY sensitive</li>
            <li>This has been the best way to whiten my teeth, I hate strips, so I am glad this one has a guard</li>
            <li>at first I applied it to the tray like the instructions said, the whole product went in my mouth instead of in my teeth,</li>
            <li>Many products make these extreme claims and rarely deliver.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much for fast delivery!</li>
            <li>However, the whitening effect is not terribly dramatic.</li>
            <li>This saves a ton and you&#x27;ll get lots of use out of this large tube.  </li>
            <li>; If you have whitened your teeth months ago, and would like to re-whiten them later on, you&#x27;re better off buying new gel.</li>
            <li>I intensely dislike the tray, can&#x27;t believe anyone has teeth that large</li>
            <li>This works very well ...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>it was much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the price, the results were much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>Haha I&#x27;ll see what happens in 2 weeks</li>
            <li>and I gave that up fast.</li>
            <li>My teeth are much much brighter</li>
            <li>Not only is this product cheap</li>
            <li>(I found the kit for $8 at RiteAid with an on-box coupon, ahem), but it really does work.  </li>
            <li>Finally a cheap alternative to white strips which hurt my teeth and gums a lot.</li>
            <li>I found it much easier to just apply the throw away adhesive strips that I had used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well and fast.  </li>
            <li>they would not need much maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>within that five minutes I really got results and saw a difference.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t do it any longer because too much saliva builds up in my mouth.</li>
            <li>Turns out, it used to work really well.</li>
            <li>Seems to offer a lot of bang for not so much bucks..</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need that much of the product every time you use it.</li>
            <li>I really need a lawyer,</li>
            <li>This stuff is gentle and WORKS.  </li>
            <li>I also leave it in for longer than the 5 minutes, so it really really is gentle, not any problems with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work very well.</li>
            <li>If your teeh are very stained...</li>
            <li>and I really did not notice much of a whitening effect at all.  </li>
            <li>, my teeth look much whiter.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product, but not spectacular.</li>
            <li>I drooled an embarrassing amount, but I was left with a significant stain lift once all was said</li>
            <li>I had braces and now I have a white smile!</li>
            <li>I am on day 5 of Crest White strips and have already noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>Was really looking forward to this working, due to the other great reviews.</li>
            <li>White if you are reading this, please let me get the original formula.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used the newest 40-50 dollar box of white strips, but this is so much cheaper and whitens in such a short amount of time, I wouldn&#x27;t even  bother with anything else.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 years old and first time I&#x27;ve used a home bleaching product.</li>
            <li>My teeth lightened slightly, but I had hoped for better results that I have been seeing.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this product for months now, and have seen no results what so ever, I even went to the store and bought another one to see if maybe it was just this particular bottle that didn&#x27;t work, and still no luck.</li>
            <li>I have only used this proDuct for 5 days and already see tremendous results.</li>
            <li>I was only able to keep the tray in for 3 minutes which isn&#x27;t nearly enough time</li>
            <li>Crest 3D White Whitestrips - Professional Effects with Advanced Seal Whitening Treatment</li>
            <li>(8) Wait 5 minutes or 15 - 20 minutes for more difficult stains.  </li>
            <li>This was the very first whitening product that I bought, and I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of strong coffee and dark tea, and this has really lightened my teeth up without causing sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I did lighten up my teeth a little and will keep doing it with more applications.  </li>
            <li>Very close to professional level whitening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also recommend picking up some toothpaste for sensitive teeth, because if you accidentally use too much whitening gel you&#x27;ll be suffering for it.</li>
            <li>Too much gel when you apply it directly onto the mouth piece.</li>
            <li>And comes with a double sided teeth tray.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the results are well worth using the product.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t know for a few more days</li>
            <li>followed the instructions exactly, including the plaque rinse, and although it was easy to use, I saw very little results in the two weeks</li>
            <li>that protects your newly whitened teeth.</li>
            <li>Talk to your dentist about something that works, and if they recommend this, find a new dentist.</li>
            <li>it was a new one, and never be opened.</li>
            <li>Now this product is VERY much reduced in strength compared to years ago and ESPECIALLY compared to the Crest.  </li>
            <li>Iâ€™m not opposed to starting on a second tube, but I will shop around looking for a higher rated product first.</li>
            <li>When I first used this item 12  years back</li>
            <li>I had no ill effects - no burning, white spots, etc.</li>
            <li>I now use it twice per week for 5 minutes at a time and not only maintain the original results but actually continue the process.  </li>
            <li>This is the best whitening stuff ever, however, when I received it, the package was already opened and it had spilled inside :(</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty gross.</li>
            <li>but some reached the back of my throat and it feel funny, like irritated.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not very satisfied with this purchase because I was looking for something that was easy to use.</li>
            <li>I drink a lot of coffee and since getting bracelets they&#x27;ve looked pretty yellow since I was young.</li>
            <li>teeth are very sensitive, but with applying directly on my teeth, I&#x27;ve had no issues.</li>
            <li>I think it is very deceptive to keep the same package for a product, but completely change the formula.</li>
            <li>but with results that fast I&#x27;d practically allow them to hold my eyes open and show me torture footage for 15 minutes, Clockwork Orange style.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Update -well after 2 -3 weeks of regular use I do not notice much difference.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day for three straight days and then once a day for the rest of the week, then I don&#x27;t need to use it until a couple/few weeks later.</li>
            <li>My teeth never got sensitive.</li>
            <li>It is painless, even on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I tried shaking it and the problem did not get fixed.</li>
            <li>It may be slower than a professional whitening and not as drastic</li>
            <li>Tried it three times so far, not in a row, but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or not.  </li>
            <li>do not put the gel on the tray, I use a Q-TIP and apply directly to my teeth and then wear the tray for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>The tube was punctured and the solution had completely liquefied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say Id used it for 4 or 5 days for 20 minutes a day before I really noticed how white my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m writing this review because returning this item is simply too much of hassle.</li>
            <li>So far I have used the product for about 4 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, this doesn&#x27;t work any better than a generic whitening toothpaste in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Good product, lousy delivery.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers I didn&#x27;t find any difference the first time I used it (and trust me, I looked!)</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work as well as previously, and maybe that is indeed true.</li>
            <li>I had been using this specific one for several days and was not noticing the whitening that normally comes right away from this, and it also seemed to have a different consistency.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 6&#x27; average build male and it didn&#x27;t look like the mouth piece would fit, so</li>
            <li>to start* whitening, so the first time I only left it in for five minutes!</li>
            <li>I have used different products in the past and this one is better, and cheaper, and simpler.</li>
            <li>i wanted very much to whiten my teeth and this product have worked but not as much as i expected it to work</li>
            <li>I am only giving four stars because I have gotten so many defective tubes (seal is broken, product is very liquidy).</li>
            <li>Luckily, this works well and his teeth get a few shades whiter after 2-3 times.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the fairly labor-intensive process: (1) mix the rinse 1 part to 3 parts water (2) rinse your mouth with that solution</li>
            <li>This did whiten my teeth a bit for my wedding, but it made my back teeth extremely sensitive!</li>
            <li>I should have known that this would be the same old thing that I&#x27;ve seen for YEARS!  </li>
            <li>Excited to see what will come in the next few uses.</li>
            <li>Product helped a little but did not seem to do very much, used exactly as directed with minimal results ,</li>
            <li>Most of the time, I couldn&#x27;t even keep the tray in for the full 5 minutes because my teeth hurt so bad.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get the same bubble action</li>
            <li>I used the 5 minute whitening system daily, 15 minutes per use for 7 days and saw my teeth change considerably during that time.  </li>
            <li>I am a daily coffee drinker, 23 years old and this is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far.</li>
            <li>This product is OK, but not great.</li>
            <li>The whiteness doesn&#x27;t &#x27;disappear&#x27; however, so you can whiten your teeth more slowly and only use it once daily to avoid sensitivity.</li>
            <li>The company is good with sending replacements, but it is still inconvenient.</li>
            <li>I ordered this based on recommendations from other users and compared to what the other brands charge this is by far the cheapest and it works quickly.  </li>
            <li>Used it for a week, 2x a day 20-25 mins every time, did everything said on the box, not a single improvement!</li>
            <li>On first application I only kept it in for a few minutes because I&#x27;d put too much gel in the mould such that it overflowed all into my mouth but even after that short time my teeth were noticably white</li>
            <li>After failing the first time, I tried again for a second time using a lot less gel.</li>
            <li>but the pain is not worth it, because no matter how much you try not to get the gel on your gums, some WILL get on.</li>
            <li>I did noticed an improvement using the product for two weeks, generally, twice a day for 15 minutes total.</li>
            <li>It whitens the teeth very well, but the mouth piece is not very comfortable.</li>
            <li>but I believe it was something like 20 minutes or so, not very long at all.</li>
            <li>For my first go, I left the product on for a little over ten minutes.  </li>
            <li>Have been skeptical about finding a good teeth whitener because of how yellow me teeth have gotten due to drinking coffee everyday, used it for the first time last night and my teeth are already white.</li>
            <li>I only noticed a slight degree in increasing my teeth&#x27;s whitening after going through a whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Have to buy different trays, because these ones impossible to use.they dont touch teeth, but the gel is good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has those white dots on their teeth from too much flouride when you were little</li>

            <li> I rinsed my mouth and my teeth look absolutely amazing!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase, and using the cotton swab, maybe able to extend the use.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t hardcore dedicated to keeping up with it, missed a good 5 times</li>
            <li> so that is good</li>
            <li> A couple of hints: The tube of gel and rinse are good for about 14 treatments.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for a good price.</li>
            <li> and it sounded good with a good price, so I ordered.  </li>
            <li> Good kit.  </li>
            <li> I never take the time to write a good review but I will on this product.</li>
            <li> Good product...</li>
            <li> Good stuff.  </li>
            <li> The teeth mould is good but it requires effort to stop it popping out and off your teeth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this inexpensive product (5 bucks!!!)</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> The mouth tray is also great because its sort of a joint mouth tray (bottom attached to top)</li>
            <li> Happy with results, am buying more here.</li>
            <li> this is the exact product I used, and it is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me and I&#x27;m so glad she did!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and very effective.  </li>
            <li> I liked it</li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest</li>
            <li> I really liked this product for the money...</li>
            <li> Great product, I&#x27;m buying another right now!</li>
            <li> but with this product I fianlly have the beautiful smile I&#x27;ve always wanted.</li>
            <li> need more than 5 mins to get good results, more like 15mins</li>
            <li> it was very easy to use</li>
            <li> So far its the best one i have found.  </li>
            <li> wash mouth tray thoroughly with warm water being sure to remove all the goo</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, product works great.</li>
            <li> An excellent product for a pretty quick fix, just put it on before a shower and rinse off after.</li>
            <li> works pretty great</li>
            <li> I had good results the very first 20 minute session.</li>
            <li> dental hygienist also told me that the best time to use something like this is right after you get your teeth cleaned -- for the first three days, your teeth will pick up the whitening agents</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference in just 3 applications!</li>
            <li> But anyway, overall happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I found better results forgoing the provided tray and using customizable whitening trays</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I always see results at one use but it just gets better from there.</li>
            <li> SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY &#x27;STRIP&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I always used crest white strips because I figured they were the best teeth whiteners sold in stores.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather spend more on more convenience.</li>
            <li> Buy this! :)</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> (5) squeeze the whitening goo in the provided mouth tray -- bottom and top.  </li>
            <li> Better than whitestrips</li>
            <li> Will buy more.</li>
            <li> It was okay</li>
            <li> I love this product and keep it on for 20 minutes a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this</li>
            <li> works for the most part.</li>
            <li> buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> I think these work better than the whitestrips.</li>
            <li> more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still more room for improvement.</li>
            <li> Definitely the best solution for whitening your teeth</li>
            <li> I bought this thing in 2007 to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; my teeth, I used many days, and it destroyed my gums.</li>
            <li> Although I wish there was a bit more product included.</li>
            <li> It is an inexpensive product, readily available, and I got IMMEDIATE results!  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> This product works - nothing more needed to say.</li>
            <li> Way better than any strips I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> so I was very excited to try this.  </li>
            <li> I have had very good luck over the years with various tooth whitening products ranging from the dentist&#x27;s office to over the counter strips (like Crest Whitestrips).  </li>
            <li> I think these are great for those with sensitive teeth since they don&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> Her suggestion is to find a moldable football player&#x27;s mouth guard instead of the tray this comes in to make this more comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> this product did not work as good and as fast as i thought it would</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; won&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am very pleased with the results and highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> After managing to quickly get the tray into my mouth with the hopes that this product would magically stay on my teeth, it ended up going on my gums and on to the inside of my cheeks.</li>
            <li> This is cheap</li>
            <li> You can spread the gel on your \\&quot;smile surface\\&quot; with your finger or a q tip for better coverage.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth trying :)</li>
            <li> I have tried this product before when it was available in Target.  </li>
            <li> No matter how carefully I filled the mouth tray, there would be some product that oozed out.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be happy with the turn out and you&#x27;ll save a minimum of 20 bux choosing this over the big brands.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve been using some trays that I got for free from my dentist.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trays don&#x27;t fit well for me.</li>
            <li> Do not Stop Go...buy this whitener, and follow the instructions precisely.  </li>
            <li> i bought this product to my wife, and after two weeks my wife is happy with her white and shiny teeth</li>
            <li> I leave the product on most times much longer that instructed, sometimes while showering sometimes while watching TV or surfing the web all in hopes of getting better results,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had good results so far (5 days or so).</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s call it a 3.5 star rated product; Itâ€™s convenient and easy to use, has good written (but, in tiny print) instructions etc.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and I always feel that it is an excellent value.</li>
            <li> it was significantly cheaper than the rest and thought I would test it out.</li>
            <li> I thought it was fairly convenient and the mouth piece fit my mouth well enough.</li>
            <li> As a lover of dark coffee and red wine, my teeth were definitely a great test of this product, but I saw a difference two days in and it just got better after that... color me a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had such bright teeth before and there was no sensitivity at all.</li>
            <li> My teeth look whiter, but this product only takes me to about 3/4 of the way to where I want to shade wise.  </li>
            <li> I made my own customs trays by putting clear mouth guards in boiling water until flimsy and inserting them in my mouth to form around my teeth.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t used them for a full 2 weeks yet</li>
            <li> So take my advice, if you have sensitive teeth and want effective results, don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice and white :) so easy to use and the price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> quick set-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to test out something different to see if I get better and more noticeable results.</li>
            <li> The directions say to fill the tray on both the top and bottom if you want to whiten your top and bottom teeth at the same time.</li>
            <li> Luckily, none of the content was spilled.  </li>
            <li> Sitting around drooling all over the place isn&#x27;t the most attractive or comfortable, so at least you can spit an excess down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;- Make your own custom teeth trays!</li>
            <li> After my first day of use I could see a huge difference, I&#x27;m on day 4</li>
            <li> Oh I guess if I had to give any cons, the whitening gel was kinda funky, not in taste but that it wouldn&#x27;t wash off easy and doesn&#x27;t really dissolve in water.</li>
            <li> Very sticky formula, easy to put in</li>
            <li> And teeth are much whiter after 3 weeks!!</li>
            <li> still worth the money though.</li>
            <li> I use it to touch up my smile when I feel like coffee has taken a toll on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> My teeth are relatively nice to begin with, so I was just looking for brightening boost - was hesitant to use twice a day as they recommended, and used just once a day at night for a week or two and could definitely tell a difference!</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for about 3-4 weeks and have noticed a &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; smile.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve mostly been doing touch ups), but I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference.</li>
            <li> My experience so far with this product is mostly of annoyance.</li>
            <li> Makes them a bit more sensitive though for a day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Don&#x27;t need prescription, you can buy it right off</li>
            <li> But for soooo much cheaper you can whiten your teeth with plus white and it works even better than the strips!</li>
            <li> As I said the crest pro are much better also it is worth pointing out that if you go to your dentist the minimum treatment time is 30 min per  session and it may take several sessions.  </li>
            <li> I do spit it out and put the mouth piece back in several times and still see great results.</li>
            <li> works very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not exactly the most comfortable whitening process (the solution foams up</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was quick and easy to use --- I used it for 20 minutes, twice a day for the first and second days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product actually works in one use and  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read at first that it takes 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I used it for 15 minutes at a time, once a day, and saw results after the first usage.  </li>
            <li> The product worked as described,  I will definitely order more as my wife is now using it.  </li>
            <li> EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK, TO GET GREAT RESULTS WITH AT LEAST 15 MIN INSTEAD OF 5 MIN USE.</li>
            <li> First day using it</li>
            <li> it does work i saw the difference the first time but after using it for like 7th time it started hurting my gums, so i stopped</li>
            <li> As for the rest, the &amp;#34;tray&amp;#34; that it comes with is made of cheap, soft, and flexible rubber.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product 2 times a day for 20 minutes each time for 4 days now and my teeth are already so much whiter!</li>
            <li> I hope with further use there will be more improvement.</li>
            <li> First off, the price can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days now (once a day for 20 minutes) and my teeth are so much whiter!</li>
            <li> These work pretty well</li>
            <li> I can already tell the difference, even after the first day.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!</li>
            <li> Nothing chang and its so hot for my teeth</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> ; and the product didn&#x27;t even last for more than 6 days.</li>
            <li> Now I use it maybe once a week, and it really has lightened my teeth!  </li>
            <li> It is way cheaper than a laser whitenng, and many comment on how white my teeth look, &amp;#34;did</li>
            <li> First time I thought 5 mins was forever, like I would gag.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this for people who are looking for more of a shine then to whiten.</li>
            <li> And after all of the pain and suffering, I didn&#x27;t notice my teeth to be any more white than they were before.</li>
            <li> I used it first time for about 18min.</li>
            <li> the first used, yes, worked, whiter teeth.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed the difference.  </li>
            <li> This whitens your teeth FAST!  </li>
            <li> .. works better and faster than most more expensive whiteners.</li>
            <li> There has been no sensitivity after two full days of use, and I have VERY sensitive</li>
            <li> This has been the best way to whiten my teeth, I hate strips, so I am glad this one has a guard</li>
            <li> at first I applied it to the tray like the instructions said, the whole product went in my mouth instead of in my teeth,</li>
            <li> Many products make these extreme claims and rarely deliver.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much for fast delivery!</li>
            <li> However, the whitening effect is not terribly dramatic.</li>
            <li> This saves a ton and you&#x27;ll get lots of use out of this large tube.  </li>
            <li> ; If you have whitened your teeth months ago, and would like to re-whiten them later on, you&#x27;re better off buying new gel.</li>
            <li> I intensely dislike the tray, can&#x27;t believe anyone has teeth that large</li>
            <li> This works very well ...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> it was much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the price, the results were much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Haha I&#x27;ll see what happens in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> and I gave that up fast.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much much brighter</li>
            <li> Not only is this product cheap</li>
            <li> (I found the kit for $8 at RiteAid with an on-box coupon, ahem), but it really does work.  </li>
            <li> Finally a cheap alternative to white strips which hurt my teeth and gums a lot.</li>
            <li> I found it much easier to just apply the throw away adhesive strips that I had used before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well and fast.  </li>
            <li> they would not need much maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> within that five minutes I really got results and saw a difference.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do it any longer because too much saliva builds up in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Turns out, it used to work really well.</li>
            <li> Seems to offer a lot of bang for not so much bucks..</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need that much of the product every time you use it.</li>
            <li> I really need a lawyer,</li>
            <li> This stuff is gentle and WORKS.  </li>
            <li> I also leave it in for longer than the 5 minutes, so it really really is gentle, not any problems with sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work very well.</li>
            <li> If your teeh are very stained...</li>
            <li> and I really did not notice much of a whitening effect at all.  </li>
            <li> , my teeth look much whiter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but not spectacular.</li>
            <li> I drooled an embarrassing amount, but I was left with a significant stain lift once all was said</li>
            <li> I had braces and now I have a white smile!</li>
            <li> I am on day 5 of Crest White strips and have already noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Was really looking forward to this working, due to the other great reviews.</li>
            <li> White if you are reading this, please let me get the original formula.</li>
            <li> To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used the newest 40-50 dollar box of white strips, but this is so much cheaper and whitens in such a short amount of time, I wouldn&#x27;t even  bother with anything else.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and first time I&#x27;ve used a home bleaching product.</li>
            <li> My teeth lightened slightly, but I had hoped for better results that I have been seeing.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for months now, and have seen no results what so ever, I even went to the store and bought another one to see if maybe it was just this particular bottle that didn&#x27;t work, and still no luck.</li>
            <li> I have only used this proDuct for 5 days and already see tremendous results.</li>
            <li> I was only able to keep the tray in for 3 minutes which isn&#x27;t nearly enough time</li>
            <li> Crest 3D White Whitestrips - Professional Effects with Advanced Seal Whitening Treatment</li>
            <li> (8) Wait 5 minutes or 15 - 20 minutes for more difficult stains.  </li>
            <li> This was the very first whitening product that I bought, and I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of strong coffee and dark tea, and this has really lightened my teeth up without causing sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I did lighten up my teeth a little and will keep doing it with more applications.  </li>
            <li> Very close to professional level whitening.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also recommend picking up some toothpaste for sensitive teeth, because if you accidentally use too much whitening gel you&#x27;ll be suffering for it.</li>
            <li> Too much gel when you apply it directly onto the mouth piece.</li>
            <li> And comes with a double sided teeth tray.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the results are well worth using the product.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t know for a few more days</li>
            <li> followed the instructions exactly, including the plaque rinse, and although it was easy to use, I saw very little results in the two weeks</li>
            <li> that protects your newly whitened teeth.</li>
            <li> Talk to your dentist about something that works, and if they recommend this, find a new dentist.</li>
            <li> it was a new one, and never be opened.</li>
            <li> Now this product is VERY much reduced in strength compared to years ago and ESPECIALLY compared to the Crest.  </li>
            <li> Iâ€™m not opposed to starting on a second tube, but I will shop around looking for a higher rated product first.</li>
            <li> When I first used this item 12  years back</li>
            <li> I had no ill effects - no burning, white spots, etc.</li>
            <li> I now use it twice per week for 5 minutes at a time and not only maintain the original results but actually continue the process.  </li>
            <li> This is the best whitening stuff ever, however, when I received it, the package was already opened and it had spilled inside :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty gross.</li>
            <li> but some reached the back of my throat and it feel funny, like irritated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very satisfied with this purchase because I was looking for something that was easy to use.</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of coffee and since getting bracelets they&#x27;ve looked pretty yellow since I was young.</li>
            <li> teeth are very sensitive, but with applying directly on my teeth, I&#x27;ve had no issues.</li>
            <li> I think it is very deceptive to keep the same package for a product, but completely change the formula.</li>
            <li> but with results that fast I&#x27;d practically allow them to hold my eyes open and show me torture footage for 15 minutes, Clockwork Orange style.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Update -well after 2 -3 weeks of regular use I do not notice much difference.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day for three straight days and then once a day for the rest of the week, then I don&#x27;t need to use it until a couple/few weeks later.</li>
            <li> My teeth never got sensitive.</li>
            <li> It is painless, even on my sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> I tried shaking it and the problem did not get fixed.</li>
            <li> It may be slower than a professional whitening and not as drastic</li>
            <li> Tried it three times so far, not in a row, but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or not.  </li>
            <li> do not put the gel on the tray, I use a Q-TIP and apply directly to my teeth and then wear the tray for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The tube was punctured and the solution had completely liquefied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say Id used it for 4 or 5 days for 20 minutes a day before I really noticed how white my teeth were.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because returning this item is simply too much of hassle.</li>
            <li> So far I have used the product for about 4 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wow</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, this doesn&#x27;t work any better than a generic whitening toothpaste in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Good product, lousy delivery.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers I didn&#x27;t find any difference the first time I used it (and trust me, I looked!)</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work as well as previously, and maybe that is indeed true.</li>
            <li> I had been using this specific one for several days and was not noticing the whitening that normally comes right away from this, and it also seemed to have a different consistency.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 6&#x27; average build male and it didn&#x27;t look like the mouth piece would fit, so</li>
            <li> to start* whitening, so the first time I only left it in for five minutes!</li>
            <li> I have used different products in the past and this one is better, and cheaper, and simpler.</li>
            <li> i wanted very much to whiten my teeth and this product have worked but not as much as i expected it to work</li>
            <li> I am only giving four stars because I have gotten so many defective tubes (seal is broken, product is very liquidy).</li>
            <li> Luckily, this works well and his teeth get a few shades whiter after 2-3 times.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the fairly labor-intensive process: (1) mix the rinse 1 part to 3 parts water (2) rinse your mouth with that solution</li>
            <li> This did whiten my teeth a bit for my wedding, but it made my back teeth extremely sensitive!</li>
            <li> I should have known that this would be the same old thing that I&#x27;ve seen for YEARS!  </li>
            <li> Excited to see what will come in the next few uses.</li>
            <li> Product helped a little but did not seem to do very much, used exactly as directed with minimal results ,</li>
            <li> Most of the time, I couldn&#x27;t even keep the tray in for the full 5 minutes because my teeth hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get the same bubble action</li>
            <li> I used the 5 minute whitening system daily, 15 minutes per use for 7 days and saw my teeth change considerably during that time.  </li>
            <li> I am a daily coffee drinker, 23 years old and this is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far.</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but not great.</li>
            <li> The whiteness doesn&#x27;t &#x27;disappear&#x27; however, so you can whiten your teeth more slowly and only use it once daily to avoid sensitivity.</li>
            <li> The company is good with sending replacements, but it is still inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on recommendations from other users and compared to what the other brands charge this is by far the cheapest and it works quickly.  </li>
            <li> Used it for a week, 2x a day 20-25 mins every time, did everything said on the box, not a single improvement!</li>
            <li> On first application I only kept it in for a few minutes because I&#x27;d put too much gel in the mould such that it overflowed all into my mouth but even after that short time my teeth were noticably white</li>
            <li> After failing the first time, I tried again for a second time using a lot less gel.</li>
            <li> but the pain is not worth it, because no matter how much you try not to get the gel on your gums, some WILL get on.</li>
            <li> I did noticed an improvement using the product for two weeks, generally, twice a day for 15 minutes total.</li>
            <li> It whitens the teeth very well, but the mouth piece is not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> but I believe it was something like 20 minutes or so, not very long at all.</li>
            <li> For my first go, I left the product on for a little over ten minutes.  </li>
            <li> Have been skeptical about finding a good teeth whitener because of how yellow me teeth have gotten due to drinking coffee everyday, used it for the first time last night and my teeth are already white.</li>
            <li> I only noticed a slight degree in increasing my teeth&#x27;s whitening after going through a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Have to buy different trays, because these ones impossible to use.they dont touch teeth, but the gel is good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has those white dots on their teeth from too much flouride when you were little</li>
            <li> I brush my teeth twice a day with crest 3d white and use the rinse, I&#x27;ve tried white stripes for awhile, tried probably every single whitening system out there including professional gel, non of them did anything to my teeth but make them extremely sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am interested to see how hard it will be to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I did some investigating, found one of my old containers that I had previously used, and realized this is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORMULA.</li>
            <li> bought this through a drug store, this does not work at all, and it is down right messy.  </li>
            <li> mouthwash I do use, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really needed or not, but I use it, why not.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t use it 2x daily as the packaging recommends, partially because I am busy and partially because it can cause sensitivity if you use it too often.</li>
            <li> Follow the instruction carefully because it can cause some soreness if not careful.</li>
            <li> i suggest basing your purchase upon how long your teeth have stayed yellow and what habits cause your discoloration.</li>
            <li> This will count down on the burning gums as well.&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse your mouth with mouthwash instead of completely brushing beforehand.  </li>
            <li> price is good, product works but gum shield is a little awkward....</li>
            <li> Just 2 trouble spots near gum line that are a bit yellow now.</li>
            <li> they are still a little yellow in some spots, and it&#x27;s not that in your face white, but they are white!</li>
            <li> In summary, I would say this takes a lot of prep time, is messy, and too caustic for the mouth if you do not very carefully remove and clean excess product.</li>
            <li> Although the directions tell you it is important to remove excess goo, it is very difficult to do completely thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> it lightened the stains on my teeth but did not completely remove them.</li>
            <li> Used according to directions and only had minimal whitening.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m lazy about stuff like this, and only used it once a day for the first few days.  </li>
            <li> I am working on different ways of applying the gel because putting it on both sides of the mouth guard is not very efficient.</li>
            <li> but i did not get the expected white i wanted</li>
            <li> The portion that divides the upper and lower half is very thick and the whole thing is made of this soft chewy material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a whitening treatment for so long but could not for the life of me justify spending the money for Crest White Strips, or other whitening treatments.  </li>
            <li> By the third day, some obviously got out and around my mouth -- a little on the edge of my tongue, some on my inside cheek.  </li>
            <li> As I said, I have tried several other products over the years without any problems.  </li>
            <li> I would suggest getting some other mouth piece if possible.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews prior to purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> also like the tip I picked up here about applying the gel to dry teeth.</li>
            <li> Above average product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always struggled with less then white teeth</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in about 6 weeks, and my teeth are still painfully sensitive with hot or cold.</li>
            <li> This is difficult if not impossible</li>
            <li> My significant other has sensitive teeth and he cannot use the crazy harsh teeth whiteners I do.</li>
            <li> I also apply it with a cotton swab directly to my teeth, instead of trying to smear it around the tray since that&#x27;s hard to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long I left in on for since I fell asleep with it on</li>
            <li> 15 minutes later, and after the cold water rinse, I could see a distinct difference in the shade of my teeth.  </li>
            <li> The tube is nearly empty</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; itself has almost absolutely no viscosity and this causes it to run off the tray and go all over the place.</li>
            <li> By the time it reached me the product packaging was crushed and misshapened.  </li>
            <li> (10) rinse out your mouth carefully.  </li>
            <li> You have to clench your teeth around it for the whole time as a combo of saliva and the product pools behind your teeth.</li>
            <li> Messy, works somewhat, as i never got the Ultra white shade in 5 mins that&#x27;s advertised on box.</li>
            <li> but my package came damaged and the pre-whitening rinse had spilled in the box due to the cap coming loose.</li>
            <li> Three days later my tongue and mouth were still sore and raw.  </li>
            <li> These work extremely well.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for awhile when other companies came out with the &amp;#34;3D white&amp;#34; products.</li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical about purchasing this product</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> My dentist says the discoloration is due to aging (64).  </li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I found out about this from makeup artist Kandee Johnson, who did a You Tube review of it.  </li>
            <li> Then, due to the fact it would liquify after a while, they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the white strips in the past</li>
            <li> Works as well as almost any other whitening system.</li>
            <li> Very hard to get the product to stay on well enough to actually whiten.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and applied this to that dead tooth and after 2 uses my dead tooth now is as white as my other teeth.</li>
            <li> It fits very strangely in my mouth and it is not comfortable to hold in.</li>
            <li> product is easy to use and not too bad in price.</li>
            <li> I wish it was still available at my local Target because I hate having to use delivery.  </li>
            <li> The mouthpiece that comes with is very weird and not user friendly.</li>
            <li> Judging by the poor shape of the package and to give benefit of the doubt to the manufacturer, I think the gel I got is completely messed up, otherwise other people would be having this problem too.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bad yellow teeth</li>
            <li> I usually do this in the shower, as it can get a bit messy if you are waiting for 15+ outside.</li>
            <li> Not worth</li>
            <li> Really not worth it.</li>
            <li> not worth the time it would take to return.</li>
            <li> not sensitive, thats why I could use it for a few days, the only thing I did notice was white spots in my gums, but I thought they would be removed with saliva and brushing, but I was badly wrong.</li>
            <li> reduced my valuation down to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> It felt like I was biting into very cold ice cream except 5 times more harsh.</li>
            <li> It was a gooey mess and also the smell was all over everything.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the mouth a gooey mess.</li>
            <li> I was instead met with a goopy mess covering the inside of the box and the tube itself.</li>
            <li> you can a bunch for a few bucks on Amazon, and then you just put them in boiling water for 30 seconds, pop them into your mouth and bite down until they form into the shape of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Made my teeth a little whiter, but warning: keep it off your gums or it will burn.</li>
            <li> but i did see little results tho</li>
            <li> So instead I took a q-tip and dabbed a little product on the front of my teeth and then applied the tray</li>
            <li> due to drinking coffee for the past 10 years, my teeth have yellowed quite a bit.</li>
            <li> i see results after a few days</li>
            <li> Did not make a difference for me and caused my gums to burn after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> Missing Tartar Control Pre Whitening Rinse and the mouthpiece.</li>
            <li> I hope to get the missing products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to the trouble to drop it off at a UPS, I&#x27;ve thrown away the box it came in,</li>
            <li> This step is messy and time consuming to get it all evenly squeezed in the mouth tray (</li>
            <li> I have a dead tooth in the front of my teeth.</li>
            <li> the kit is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> With a few weeks of 15 minute sessions once a day, I noticed whiter teeth without</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, but what else do you expect for the price?</li>
            <li> dramatic changes over multiple uses..</li>
            <li> however, my gums were a mess!</li>
            <li> I cannot use the amount on the box or even use a small amount for the time on the box or else it burns my gums and make some things like bumps appear on my gums and there was no difference in whitening</li>
            <li> only issue I have is it taste pretty terrible...</li>
            <li> Instead of filling the tray with the goo I recommend just squeezing a small amount onto your finger and spreading it along the fronts of your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not surprising though most teeth whiteners taste horrible.</li>
            <li> and kinda hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Any tiny cuts or irritations from your toothbrush are going to burn like crazy once the peroxide gets to them.  </li>
            <li> You have to do this all twice a day for at least 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> but they make my teeth overly sensitive, even painful after continued use.  </li>
            <li> Just because it says 5 minutes on the box, doesn&#x27;t mean it works in that time.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, it does.</li>
            <li> It also has a bad smell and feels gross in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This might be a solid product but the first time I applied it, it gave me a horrible stinger that hurt so bad</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so angry and was afraid this would happen after reading another similar review.</li>
            <li> See my review for Crest White strips, and buy them, you will not be disappointed at all..</li>
            <li> however, one time when i travelled to the other country, i put it in my luggage, and unfortunately i turned out to be liquid and spillover my luggage!  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing after following directions and no results.</li>
            <li> And so much less expensive than the others!</li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> I hate the 5 minute plus white.</li>
            <li> This stuff was not great</li>
            <li> which made it very painful for regular brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I recommend because it doesn&#x27;t taste horrible and my teeth are definitely whiter.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical of this product</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> but the application is so annoying that I have a hard time getting myself to use it.</li>
            <li> I noticed after a few minutes a terrible \\&quot;burning\\&quot; feeling</li>
            <li> Well, this is nearly impossible to do considering to fill both sides of the tray you have to turn one side over</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any discomfort so that leads me to believe the bad reviews are from people who are allergic to some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Since then Im living with periodontal disease, bleeding, bad breath, 4-6 mm</li>
            <li> Bad plastic container that came with it.  </li>
            <li> this product sucks!!!!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed, but it did whiten.</li>
            <li> so it was all over the inside of the sealed box when I opened it :(</li>
            <li> Not too bad!</li>
            <li> so I hated it.</li>
            <li> Using it for 7 days is probably all you need to the worst cases.</li>
            <li> the taste was horrible and I almost threw up trying to rinse my mouth</li>
            <li> it was disgusting.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product, don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> the result was horrible!  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Above average product.</li>
            <li> works very much. i see results after a few days</li>
            <li> Whitens without tooth pain.  I recommend because it doesn&#x27;t taste horrible and my teeth are definitely whiter.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s call it a 3.5 star rated product; Itâ€™s convenient and easy to use, has good written (but, in tiny print) instructions etc. etc. BUT I donâ€™t achieve as white a shade as I did with a VERY similar product 15-20 years ago. My teeth look whiter, but this product only takes me to about 3/4 of the way to where I want to shade wise.  I leave the product on most times much longer that instructed, sometimes while showering sometimes while watching TV or surfing the web all in hopes of getting better results, but itâ€™s just not happening.  The tube is nearly empty and I still am not where I hoped to be.  Iâ€™m not opposed to starting on a second tube, but I will shop around looking for a higher rated product first.</li>
            <li> great product, works!</li>
            <li> Made my teeth a little whiter, but warning: keep it off your gums or it will burn.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for months now, and have seen no results what so ever, I even went to the store and bought another one to see if maybe it was just this particular bottle that didn&#x27;t work, and still no luck.</li>
            <li> should be called teeth lightening system. it lightened the stains on my teeth but did not completely remove them. still worth the money though. mouthguard is made for some sort of child or something -- invest in an athletic mouthguard if you don&#x27;t want to be getting gel all over the place.</li>
            <li> This works very well ...this is my second bottle.  We use it regularly.  So far its the best one i have found.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Been looking for cheaper ways to whiten my teeth and have hit the jackpot.. Love this product actually works in one use and  dramatic changes over multiple uses..</li>
            <li> I have only used this proDuct for 5 days and already see tremendous results. I&#x27;ve had no tooth sensitivity. I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading reviews on teethwhiteningreviews.com and tried it out. I thought it was fairly convenient and the mouth piece fit my mouth well enough. I&#x27;m a 6&#x27; average build male and it didn&#x27;t look like the mouth piece would fit, so surprise! I didn&#x27;t read at first that it takes 5 minutes *to start* whitening, so the first time I only left it in for five minutes! I read after that to leave it in 15-20 minutes so I started leaving it in 15 minutes for about two weeks. I wasn&#x27;t hardcore dedicated to keeping up with it, missed a good 5 times (I did it 2 times a day for 14 days). I can definitely notice a whiter shade on my teeth, but I still have tea stains on the bottom edges of my upper row of teeth, which I was hoping it&#x27;d get rid of. I&#x27;m planning on starting again in a week or so for another two week period. So I&#x27;d say it works! Give it a try, and see how it does for you. Oh I guess if I had to give any cons, the whitening gel was kinda funky, not in taste but that it wouldn&#x27;t wash off easy and doesn&#x27;t really dissolve in water. Hopefully it doesn&#x27;t clog my sink!     But anyway, overall happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how quickly this inexpensive product (5 bucks!!!) whitened my teeth.  I used it for 15 minutes at a time, once a day, and saw results after the first usage.  It&#x27;s not exactly the most comfortable whitening process (the solution foams up and you end up spitting out foam for the 15 minutes, not to mention you&#x27;ve got a tray in your mouth for 15 minutes) but with results that fast I&#x27;d practically allow them to hold my eyes open and show me torture footage for 15 minutes, Clockwork Orange style.  Great product.  I found better results forgoing the provided tray and using customizable whitening trays instead- you can a bunch for a few bucks on Amazon, and then you just put them in boiling water for 30 seconds, pop them into your mouth and bite down until they form into the shape of your teeth.  I&#x27;m a wine and coffee drinker and smoker and I get compliments on how white my teeth are all the time.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It ACTUALLY works on Coffee, Smoking, &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; coloring, and works on &amp;#34;graying&amp;#34; on your teeth.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to afford&lt;br /&gt;-Can get it at almost any store.&lt;br /&gt;-Can use once a day. Using it for 7 days is probably all you need to the worst cases. I just needed 3 treatments, and I&#x27;m, a smoker/coffee/wine drinker.&lt;br /&gt;-Don&#x27;t need prescription, you can buy it right off the shelf.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy/quick set-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-It burns your gums.&lt;br /&gt;-It expires in a year or so; If you have whitened your teeth months ago, and would like to re-whiten them later on, you&#x27;re better off buying new gel. If you notice it does not burn your gums, or notice no result after treatment, then the gel expired.&lt;br /&gt;-Whitens your gums, it&#x27;s only a temporary effect.&lt;br /&gt;-Messy and kinda hard to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best to use at the end of the day when you do not plan to eat or drink after the treatment (water is O.K.) This stuff also comes in a &amp;#34;system&amp;#34; that also comes with a &amp;#34;After whitening rinse&amp;#34; that protects your newly whitened teeth. And comes with a double sided teeth tray.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the results are well worth using the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product years ago getting it from Walmart.  I&#x27;ve also used the Crest Pro strips.  Now this product is VERY much reduced in strength compared to years ago and ESPECIALLY compared to the Crest.  You don&#x27;t get the same bubble action and I can just feel that it is not as concentrated as the Crest which is about 6%  H2O2.  This is cheap so that is good - so we will continue to use and observe the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update -well after 2 -3 weeks of regular use I do not notice much difference.  As I said the crest pro are much better also it is worth pointing out that if you go to your dentist the minimum treatment time is 30 min per  session and it may take several sessions.  BTW  When I first used this item 12  years back it was much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I reduced my valuation down to 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Did not make a difference for me and caused my gums to burn after a few days of using it.</li>
            <li> These work extremely well. They get the bottom teeth white as well. Great price!</li>
            <li> Best whitening product I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I stopped using it for awhile when other companies came out with the &amp;#34;3D white&amp;#34; products. I always come back to this stuff though. It actually works!!!!!! Seriously, it does. I always see results at one use but it just gets better from there. I use it twice a day for three straight days and then once a day for the rest of the week, then I don&#x27;t need to use it until a couple/few weeks later. It is awesome.</li>
            <li> My teeth aren&#x27;t very yellow, but I wanted an extra touch up to make them sparkle. I&#x27;ve used this product for a week and it has done nothing.</li>
            <li> The product worked as described,  I will definitely order more as my wife is now using it.  She loves it also.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and I always feel that it is an excellent value. I use it to touch up my smile when I feel like coffee has taken a toll on my teeth. Make sure not to get the excess on your gums, because it will be uncomfortable after prolonged use. An excellent product for a pretty quick fix, just put it on before a shower and rinse off after.</li>
            <li> Mine came 2 years expired. &#x27;Nuff said.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews on several different whitening methods/products. I went with this becuase it was significantly cheaper than the rest and thought I would test it out. My teeth lightened slightly, but I had hoped for better results that I have been seeing. I&#x27;m going to test out something different to see if I get better and more noticeable results.</li>
            <li> BEST OTC TEETH WHITENER ON THE MARKET. ONLY 4 STARS BC IT TAKES REPETIVENESS, EVERY DAY FOR A WEEK, TO GET GREAT RESULTS WITH AT LEAST 15 MIN INSTEAD OF 5 MIN USE. BUT CAN&#x27;T BEAT THE PRICE OR EASE OF THE TRAY. SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY &#x27;STRIP&#x27;.</li>
            <li> For the price, the results were much better than I expected.  Great product and would buy it again. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Not bad. I noticed a difference after one use. My teeth never got sensitive. You have to stick with it every day. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all. Snake oil.</li>
            <li> Missing Tartar Control Pre Whitening Rinse and the mouthpiece. I hope to get the missing products, I will not use the 5 minute whitening gel until I get what I paid for.</li>
            <li> It is painless, even on my sensitive teeth. I have had a lot of pain using Crest white strips, but this did not bother me at all. However, the whitening effect is not terribly dramatic.</li>
            <li> First day using it and I&#x27;m seeing progress! Yellow to eggshell! Haha I&#x27;ll see what happens in 2 weeks</li>
            <li> The Gel, tube still in the box, leaked thru the box and all over everything in the drawer. It was a gooey mess and also the smell was all over everything.  Called the company, but no call back.</li>
            <li> it does work i saw the difference the first time but after using it for like 7th time it started hurting my gums, so i stopped</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product, but not spectacular. Two weeks of treatment (5 minutes per day) lightened my teeth one or two shades. A couple of hints: The tube of gel and rinse are good for about 14 treatments. You can spread the gel on your \\&quot;smile surface\\&quot; with your finger or a q tip for better coverage. Then use the tray to hold it in place. Also you can go to the company&#x27;s web page (pluswhite.com) and get a coupon for $2 off. Before starting, print out a tooth whiteness comparison chart and mark the color of your teeth for later comparison. I had no ill effects - no burning, white spots, etc. You do have to be careful to spread it evenly.</li>
            <li> This product is OK, but not great. After 2 weeks my teeth lightened about 1/2 shade. Before using it, go online and print off a tooth whiteness comparison chart. Mark your tooth color so you will have something to compare it to. I put the gel on the front upper and lower teeth with a que tip to ensure even coverage. You can get a $2 off coupon by going to the company&#x27;s web page. NOTE: the rinse is for after the treatment not before.</li>
            <li> Leaves the mouth a gooey mess. Avoid this and just get the strips. This was attempted once and I gave that up fast.</li>
            <li> I know this part of the review probably only happened to me but my package came damaged and the pre-whitening rinse had spilled in the box due to the cap coming loose. As for the rest, the &amp;#34;tray&amp;#34; that it comes with is made of cheap, soft, and flexible rubber. The &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; itself has almost absolutely no viscosity and this causes it to run off the tray and go all over the place. I tried shaking it and the problem did not get fixed. The directions say to fill the tray on both the top and bottom if you want to whiten your top and bottom teeth at the same time. Well, this is nearly impossible to do considering to fill both sides of the tray you have to turn one side over and this causes the gel to start coming out. After failing the first time, I tried again for a second time using a lot less gel. After managing to quickly get the tray into my mouth with the hopes that this product would magically stay on my teeth, it ended up going on my gums and on to the inside of my cheeks. They are still burning as I type this. I was only able to keep the tray in for 3 minutes which isn&#x27;t nearly enough time so I won&#x27;t even bother commenting on the effectiveness of the whitening. Judging by the poor shape of the package and to give benefit of the doubt to the manufacturer, I think the gel I got is completely messed up, otherwise other people would be having this problem too. In any case, I guess my only option now is to use one side of the tray at a time and maybe refrigerate the gel to get it to thicken. I&#x27;m not very satisfied with this purchase because I was looking for something that was easy to use.</li>
            <li> These are awesome for the price. My teeth are relatively nice to begin with, so I was just looking for brightening boost - was hesitant to use twice a day as they recommended, and used just once a day at night for a week or two and could definitely tell a difference! And, had plenty left over for when I want another boost!</li>
            <li> price is good, product works but gum shield is a little awkward....need more than 5 mins to get good results, more like 15mins</li>
            <li> I ordered this based on recommendations from other users and compared to what the other brands charge this is by far the cheapest and it works quickly.  I used it about 4 times and it made a big difference.</li>
            <li> At first i was skeptical about purchasing this product but I got it at the drug store for 11 bucks so WHY NOT?! I&#x27;ve been using this product for 4 days now, and no burning or irritation in my gums. I definitely see a difference! My teeth are much much brighter then they were before! Try using a whiting brush and toothpaste to go along with the whiting kit. I would recommend this product to everybody!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never seen an at home teeth whitening kit work so well. I always used crest white strips because I figured they were the best teeth whiteners sold in stores. But for soooo much cheaper you can whiten your teeth with plus white and it works even better than the strips! I&#x27;ve been using this product 2 times a day for 20 minutes each time for 4 days now and my teeth are already so much whiter! I can&#x27;t believe how well this works! It&#x27;s definitely worth trying :)</li>
            <li> This might be a solid product but the first time I applied it, it gave me a horrible stinger that hurt so bad I just washed it off and threw it away...</li>
            <li> I used the 5 minute whitening system daily, 15 minutes per use for 7 days and saw my teeth change considerably during that time.  I now use it twice per week for 5 minutes at a time and not only maintain the original results but actually continue the process.  It may be slower than a professional whitening and not as drastic but I am happy with the outcome.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the other reviews.  I have never used whitening products before so I was very excited to try this.  It whitened.....however, my gums were a mess! Irritated, sore, burst.....which made it very painful for regular brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no doubt that this will whiten your teeth but the pain is not worth it, because no matter how much you try not to get the gel on your gums, some WILL get on.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS, BUY CREST WHITE STRIPS INSTEAD.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this through a drug store, this does not work at all, and it is down right messy.  I bout the crest white strips through AMAZON, and I could not be happier.  See my review for Crest White strips, and buy them, you will not be disappointed at all.. this is the exact product I used, and it is awesome!!! Crest 3D White Whitestrips - Professional Effects with Advanced Seal Whitening Treatment</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting a whitening treatment for so long but could not for the life of me justify spending the money for Crest White Strips, or other whitening treatments.  Not only is this product cheap (I found the kit for $8 at RiteAid with an on-box coupon, ahem), but it really does work.  For my first go, I left the product on for a little over ten minutes.  I drooled an embarrassing amount, but I was left with a significant stain lift once all was said and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- Whiten in the shower. Sitting around drooling all over the place isn&#x27;t the most attractive or comfortable, so at least you can spit an excess down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;- Make your own custom teeth trays! There are plenty of DIY tutorials online using mouth guards from the sports section. This will count down on the burning gums as well.&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse your mouth with mouthwash instead of completely brushing beforehand.  Any tiny cuts or irritations from your toothbrush are going to burn like crazy once the peroxide gets to them.  Ouch!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Probably around ten. When I say &amp;#34;this product&amp;#34;, I am referring to the product that shares this packaging. However, this is not the same product that worked so well for all these years.. I had been using this specific one for several days and was not noticing the whitening that normally comes right away from this, and it also seemed to have a different consistency. I did some investigating, found one of my old containers that I had previously used, and realized this is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FORMULA. I think it is very deceptive to keep the same package for a product, but completely change the formula. Don&#x27;t waste your money, this doesn&#x27;t work any better than a generic whitening toothpaste in my opinion.</li>
            <li> this product sucks!!!!  I cannot use the amount on the box or even use a small amount for the time on the box or else it burns my gums and make some things like bumps appear on my gums and there was no difference in whitening</li>
            <li> I had good results the very first 20 minute session. Good stuff for a good price. I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> My significant other has sensitive teeth and he cannot use the crazy harsh teeth whiteners I do. Luckily, this works well and his teeth get a few shades whiter after 2-3 times. He spreads out the whitening to 1-3 times a week for a month. Then we purchase it again about 10-12 months later. Not too bad!</li>
            <li> Waited to review until I had tried it.  After 3 weeks not seeing any results.  I don&#x27;t drink wine and only 1cup of coffee a day.  My dentist says the discoloration is due to aging (64).  So maybe it doesn&#x27;t work on that.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for about 3-4 weeks and have noticed a &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; smile. I hope with further use there will be more improvement.</li>
            <li> The best, quickest whitening system ever. Very close to professional level whitening.</li>
            <li> I was so skeptical of this product but I saw it was ranked as the number 1 whitening system by a trusted magazine so I ordered it and gave it a try. First off, the price can&#x27;t be beat. Secondly it works! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 5 days now (once a day for 20 minutes) and my teeth are so much whiter! I&#x27;ve always struggled with less then white teeth (even yellow if I admit it) and I brush and take care of them. I think some of it is genetics (my dad has yellow teeth) but with this product I fianlly have the beautiful smile I&#x27;ve always wanted. I had braces and now I have a white smile! Thank you! I will say that you should follow the directions and I use a q tip to apply it because it saves the gel. Haven&#x27;t had any discomfort so that leads me to believe the bad reviews are from people who are allergic to some of the ingredients. I love this and I&#x27;m ordering another kit for my fiancÃ©!</li>
            <li> Great product which rlly works!</li>
            <li> I have been using this system for almost a month now and have seen great results. I made my own customs trays by putting clear mouth guards in boiling water until flimsy and inserting them in my mouth to form around my teeth. I use these customs trays with the plus white system several times a week.</li>
            <li> Tried it three times so far, not in a row, but can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working or not.  Will continue to use it (now that I&#x27;ve been to the dentist!) and hope it works.  For the price you can&#x27;t beat it if it does!</li>
            <li> This did whiten my teeth a bit for my wedding, but it made my back teeth extremely sensitive! I haven&#x27;t used it in about 6 weeks, and my teeth are still painfully sensitive with hot or cold. Disappointed, but it did whiten.</li>
            <li> Finally a cheap alternative to white strips which hurt my teeth and gums a lot. These work pretty well, I haven&#x27;t used them for a full 2 weeks yet (I&#x27;ve mostly been doing touch ups), but I&#x27;ve noticed a considerable difference. I think these are great for those with sensitive teeth since they don&#x27;t hurt at all. The mouth tray is also great because its sort of a joint mouth tray (bottom attached to top) so you can do both sets at the same time. I usually do this in the shower, as it can get a bit messy if you are waiting for 15+ outside.</li>
            <li> I should have known that this would be the same old thing that I&#x27;ve seen for YEARS!  Not worth all the work involved.  I&#x27;d rather spend more on more convenience.</li>
            <li> This product is great &amp; everything I was looking for. Easy to use &amp; won&#x27;t break the bank. I ordered this online, but you could also locate at Walgreens, Walmart, or similar store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not put the gel on the tray, I use a Q-TIP and apply directly to my teeth and then wear the tray for 15 minutes. I started doing this as directed and am almost done with my twice a day 14 day process. I can already tell the difference, even after the first day. I am a daily coffee drinker, 23 years old and this is just amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are very sensitive, but with applying directly on my teeth, I&#x27;ve had no issues. I do brush with Sensodine, so maybe that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mouthwash I do use, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s really needed or not, but I use it, why not. Ha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will DEFINETLY buy again!</li>
            <li> I JUST got this in the mail today and tried it out. After only one treatment of 20mins, my teeth look already a shade or two lighter. I keep looking at myself in the mirror smiling. Great product, I&#x27;m buying another right now!</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this product to me and I&#x27;m so glad she did! I use it twice a day for 20 minutes because I am an ex-smoker. After just ONE DAY of using this miracle whitening system, I&#x27;ve already acheived results! If my teeth look white after just one day, I CAN&#x27;T WAIT to see my results after two weeks!! The price is mindblowing! Buy this! :)</li>
            <li> I have tried this product before when it was available in Target.  I wish it was still available at my local Target because I hate having to use delivery.  The package was placed into a box too big for the product without any packing material.  By the time it reached me the product packaging was crushed and misshapened.  I had to tape the box back together just to get it to stand up.  And since the kit has several componets to it, you need the box after the purchase. Luckily, none of the content was spilled.  Good product, lousy delivery.</li>
            <li> I received this product on 1/28/14 and it was defective. The tube was punctured and the solution had completely liquefied. It states on the tube to not use and call them if the contents had liquefied. I&#x27;m so angry and was afraid this would happen after reading another similar review. I&#x27;m not going to the trouble to drop it off at a UPS, I&#x27;ve thrown away the box it came in, etc. Should&#x27;ve just bought it at Wal-Mart.</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working okay. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 weeks and have noticed some change in color to my teeth. Not bleach white like I wanted, but definitely whiter.</li>
            <li> I liked it and I&#x27;ve had good results so far (5 days or so). Unlike other reviewers I didn&#x27;t find any difference the first time I used it (and trust me, I looked!) but I did see something after the second and third. While nobody has said anything about my teeth appearing whiter, I do see a difference and I have used it ~5 times over the course of several days. I&#x27;ll continue to use it and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use it 2x daily as the packaging recommends, partially because I am busy and partially because it can cause sensitivity if you use it too often. The whiteness doesn&#x27;t &#x27;disappear&#x27; however, so you can whiten your teeth more slowly and only use it once daily to avoid sensitivity. I&#x27;d also recommend picking up some toothpaste for sensitive teeth, because if you accidentally use too much whitening gel you&#x27;ll be suffering for it.</li>
            <li> I have had very good luck over the years with various tooth whitening products ranging from the dentist&#x27;s office to over the counter strips (like Crest Whitestrips).  I saw this on TV and read reviews and it sounded good with a good price, so I ordered.  The first thing I noticed was the fairly labor-intensive process: (1) mix the rinse 1 part to 3 parts water (2) rinse your mouth with that solution (3) rinse with water (4) brush your teeth (5) squeeze the whitening goo in the provided mouth tray -- bottom and top.  This step is messy and time consuming to get it all evenly squeezed in the mouth tray (6) insert into mouth (7) wipe off any goo that has squeezed out of the mouth tray and gotten on your gums or anywhere but your teeth.  This is difficult if not impossible (8) Wait 5 minutes or 15 - 20 minutes for more difficult stains.  (9) remove mouth tray (10) wash mouth tray thoroughly with warm water being sure to remove all the goo (10) rinse out your mouth carefully.  You have to do this all twice a day for at least 2 weeks.  Whew!  I found it much easier to just apply the throw away adhesive strips that I had used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I had was getting all the goo off my gums, tongue, or inside cheeks.  No matter how carefully I filled the mouth tray, there would be some product that oozed out.  By the third day, some obviously got out and around my mouth -- a little on the edge of my tongue, some on my inside cheek.  I noticed after a few minutes a terrible \\&quot;burning\\&quot; feeling so I pulled everything out and starting rinsing furiously.  Three days later my tongue and mouth were still sore and raw.  I thought I should go to the doctor.  Although the directions tell you it is important to remove excess goo, it is very difficult to do completely thoroughly.  As I said, I have tried several other products over the years without any problems.  In summary, I would say this takes a lot of prep time, is messy, and too caustic for the mouth if you do not very carefully remove and clean excess product.</li>
            <li> burns the inside of your mouth just alittle</li>
            <li> it blows away white strips. very good and easy!!</li>
            <li> Used according to directions and only had minimal whitening.</li>
            <li> Works well and fast.  Better than whitestrips</li>
            <li> This is the best whitening stuff ever, however, when I received it, the package was already opened and it had spilled inside :( I was not happy.</li>
            <li> The gel was in liquid form and did not stick to the mouth piece so this product did nothing.</li>
            <li> Whitens in just a couple of treatments, I am very happy with this product.  Will purchase again in the future.</li>
            <li> Tube had a hole in it so it was all over the inside of the sealed box when I opened it :(</li>
            <li> I have a dead tooth in the front of my teeth. I&#x27;ve tried everything. I followed the directions and applied this to that dead tooth and after 2 uses my dead tooth now is as white as my other teeth. Awesome awesome</li>
            <li> I was leary but this does actually work. Follow the instruction carefully because it can cause some soreness if not careful.</li>
            <li> This was the very first whitening product that I bought, and I definitely won&#x27;t be purchasing it again. Most of the time, I couldn&#x27;t even keep the tray in for the full 5 minutes because my teeth hurt so bad. I didn&#x27;t notice any change in whiteness either, even after a week of using this twice a day. So take my advice, if you have sensitive teeth and want effective results, don&#x27;t bother wasting your money on this.</li>
            <li> Have to buy different trays, because these ones impossible to use.they dont touch teeth, but the gel is good. Will buy more. But separetely.</li>
            <li> It was okay, It got my teeth a shade whiter then they were but it didn&#x27;t get them the white white i wanted</li>
            <li> And so much less expensive than the others! I I settled on this whitening system after hours of researching the best whiteners.  This one came up quite a bit with people having lots of great things to say about it. I drink lots of coffee and smoke so I needed something that worked! It&#x27;s easy to use and very effective.  I&#x27;d say Id used it for 4 or 5 days for 20 minutes a day before I really noticed how white my teeth were.  Try it! You&#x27;ll be happy with the turn out and you&#x27;ll save a minimum of 20 bux choosing this over the big brands.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and decided to order this.  I don&#x27;t smoke or drink coffee or tea so figured once I whitened my teeth they would not need much maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions exactly, including the plaque rinse, and although it was easy to use, I saw very little results in the two weeks I used it on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read some comments saying the formula had changed and it didn&#x27;t work as well as previously, and maybe that is indeed true.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about two weeks and I have not noticed a difference. I even leave it on longer than stated in the directions...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because returning this item is simply too much of hassle. When I opened the box expecting a tube of whitening gel I was instead met with a goopy mess covering the inside of the box and the tube itself. It was quite gross. Do not reccoment</li>
            <li> I love this product and keep it on for 20 minutes a couple times a week. It works so well. I am only giving four stars because I have gotten so many defective tubes (seal is broken, product is very liquidy). The company is good with sending replacements, but it is still inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I like it.  Good kit.  It recommends applying whitening gel with a ear-bud or using the tray.  I&#x27;m trying both.  I did lighten up my teeth a little and will keep doing it with more applications.  It also arrived in time promised.</li>
            <li> so I used this once and actually haven&#x27;t had to use it again yet. within that five minutes I really got results and saw a difference. I am in love with this</li>
            <li> So far I have used the product for about 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;It works for the most part. I am interested to see how hard it will be to maintain.&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is it taste pretty terrible... It&#x27;s not surprising though most teeth whiteners taste horrible.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery, product works great. I get compliments on my teeth all the time!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works! I never take the time to write a good review but I will on this product. I suggest you apply it to you teeth with a q-tip and then place the mouth piece on. Too much gel when you apply it directly onto the mouth piece. I noticed a huge difference in just 3 applications! I use it 2 times a day for about 10-15 minutes. I can&#x27;t do it any longer because too much saliva builds up in my mouth. I do spit it out and put the mouth piece back in several times and still see great results. Sounds gross I know but it works!</li>
            <li> Really not worth it. the kit is a waste of time. why not just buy the gel and skip the rest?!?! not worth the time it would take to return. you win amazon.</li>
            <li> Nothing chang and its so hot for my teeth</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your teeth perfectly white, but it remove the stains. Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> Good product...Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Product did not work at all. It says &amp;#34;use twice daily for two weeks,&amp;#34; and the product didn&#x27;t even last for more than 6 days. I am on day 5 of Crest White strips and have already noticed a significant difference. I would not recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> nice and white :) so easy to use and the price is very reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again for sure. Wow</li>
            <li> Others say it does not work, however it did work for me. Just because it says 5 minutes on the box, doesn&#x27;t mean it works in that time.  I go by the directions and it says go for 10-15 minutes.  With a few weeks of 15 minute sessions once a day, I noticed whiter teeth without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to use and not too bad in price. I think these work better than the whitestrips.</li>
            <li> Product helped a little but did not seem to do very much, used exactly as directed with minimal results ,</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, I found out about this from makeup artist Kandee Johnson, who did a You Tube review of it.  Her suggestion is to find a moldable football player&#x27;s mouth guard instead of the tray this comes in to make this more comfortable to use. (I&#x27;ve been using some trays that I got for free from my dentist.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m lazy about stuff like this, and only used it once a day for the first few days.  Now I use it maybe once a week, and it really has lightened my teeth!  I drink a lot of strong coffee and dark tea, and this has really lightened my teeth up without causing sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygienist also told me that the best time to use something like this is right after you get your teeth cleaned -- for the first three days, your teeth will pick up the whitening agents more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the tip I picked up here about applying the gel to dry teeth. I also apply it with a cotton swab directly to my teeth, instead of trying to smear it around the tray since that&#x27;s hard to do.</li>
            <li> The trays don&#x27;t fit well for me. The whole process is messy. I had to sit with a washcloth over my mouth while using this to soak up the drool. Whitestrips are the way to go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 years old and first time I&#x27;ve used a home bleaching product. I did noticed an improvement using the product for two weeks, generally, twice a day for 15 minutes total. I am waiting a couple of weeks and will resume. Still more room for improvement. I ran out of whitener before rinse and bought an off brand tube of whitener at Dollar Store for $1.</li>
            <li> Was really looking forward to this working, due to the other great reviews. Turns out, it used to work really well. Then, due to the fact it would liquify after a while, they changed the formula. Now it doesn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;Plus White if you are reading this, please let me get the original formula. I do not care if it liquefies, I just want it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: Raising it up a star because customer service is great.</li>
            <li> It whitens the teeth very well, but the mouth piece is not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Do not Stop Go...buy this whitener, and follow the instructions precisely.  It is way cheaper than a laser whitenng, and many comment on how white my teeth look, &amp;#34;did I have them done?&amp;#34; ...etc.  Good stuff.  Best on the market.</li>
            <li> Definitely made my teeth whiter as advertised! Seems to offer a lot of bang for not so much bucks.. As a lover of dark coffee and red wine, my teeth were definitely a great test of this product, but I saw a difference two days in and it just got better after that... color me a satisfied customer!</li>
            <li> Very hard to get the product to stay on well enough to actually whiten. I&#x27;ll stick with my whitestrips.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even work in the slightest.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Walmart a year ago for twice this price. Good news was it works! I get &#x27;nervous&#x27; with mouth guard in and produce saliva, so it&#x27;s a bit of a chore for me. First time I thought 5 mins was forever, like I would gag. Just me, I guess. I gradually worked up to 15. No gum pain at all. I saw a difference in about 3-5 days. And teeth are much whiter after 3 weeks!! Just 2 trouble spots near gum line that are a bit yellow now. Happy with results, am buying more here.</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this for people who are looking for more of a shine then to whiten. Used it as directed. Left them on for 30+ minutes then brushed with Colgate for 5 minutes. no stand out type of results.</li>
            <li> ordered for my son who has had braces and wanted to get his teeth whitened. Product is doing a great job.</li>
            <li> My experience so far with this product is mostly of annoyance. The mouthpiece that comes with is very weird and not user friendly. The portion that divides the upper and lower half is very thick and the whole thing is made of this soft chewy material. It fits very strangely in my mouth and it is not comfortable to hold in. You have to clench your teeth around it for the whole time as a combo of saliva and the product pools behind your teeth. It&#x27;s pretty gross. This stuff is supposed to work well but the application is so annoying that I have a hard time getting myself to use it. I am working on different ways of applying the gel because putting it on both sides of the mouth guard is not very efficient. I would suggest getting some other mouth piece if possible.</li>
            <li> Although I am just now getting started. I intensely dislike the tray, can&#x27;t believe anyone has teeth that large and you don&#x27;t need that much of the product every time you use it. Won&#x27;t know for a few more days how good/bad it works</li>
            <li> This has been the best way to whiten my teeth, I hate strips, so I am glad this one has a guard and it&#x27;s only 5 minutes. Definitely the best solution for whitening your teeth</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if anyone else has those white dots on their teeth from too much flouride when you were little but I do and all the whitening things I&#x27;ve tried only made those dots brighter so I hated it. Then I tried this and it whitens my teeth and not only those dots.</li>
            <li> this product did not work as good and as fast as i thought it would but i did see little results tho</li>
            <li> Not a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;It takes time to work though. I did start to see some improvement in the colour of my teeth, but stopped.</li>
            <li> I bought this thing in 2007 to &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; my teeth, I used many days, and it destroyed my gums. Since then Im living with periodontal disease, bleeding, bad breath, 4-6 mm pockets.&lt;br /&gt;You are not gonna get white teeth, the only thing you are gonna get is a gum disease.&lt;br /&gt;Save your 5 dollars and 1000s for treatment. Im telling you.&lt;br /&gt;Im not sensitive, thats why I could use it for a few days, the only thing I did notice was white spots in my gums, but I thought they would be removed with saliva and brushing, but I was badly wrong. Dont buy, save your 5 dollars and 1000 for gum treatment. I really need a lawyer, Im thinking to sue this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far. I have pretty bad yellow teeth I drink a lot of coffee and since getting bracelets they&#x27;ve looked pretty yellow since I was young. I brush my teeth twice a day with crest 3d white and use the rinse, I&#x27;ve tried white stripes for awhile, tried probably every single whitening system out there including professional gel, non of them did anything to my teeth but make them extremely sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;I read the reviews on this one and decided to give it a try. at first I applied it to the tray like the instructions said, the whole product went in my mouth instead of in my teeth, the taste was horrible and I almost threw up trying to rinse my mouth it was disgusting. So instead I took a q-tip and dabbed a little product on the front of my teeth and then applied the tray and that did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest I&#x27;m not sure how long I left in on for since I fell asleep with it on but I believe it was something like 20 minutes or so, not very long at all. I rinsed my mouth and my teeth look absolutely amazing! they are still a little yellow in some spots, and it&#x27;s not that in your face white, but they are white! I&#x27;ve never had such bright teeth before and there was no sensitivity at all. I will be trying it again tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I hate the 5 minute plus white. It burned my teeth and hurt my gums. It felt like I was biting into very cold ice cream except 5 times more harsh. It also has a bad smell and feels gross in your mouth. I wanted to vomit after 1 minute of having it in my mouth. This is a terrible product, don&#x27;t buy it. And after all of the pain and suffering, I didn&#x27;t notice my teeth to be any more white than they were before. Talk to your dentist about something that works, and if they recommend this, find a new dentist.</li>
            <li> i wanted very much to whiten my teeth and this product have worked but not as much as i expected it to work it was very easy to use but i did not get the expected white i wanted</li>
            <li> i bought this product to my wife, and after two weeks my wife is happy with her white and shiny teeth</li>
            <li> I read other reviews prior to purchasing this item. Not wanting any discomfort caused by the gel contacting with my gums, I dabbed a cotton swab with the gel, and applied it to the mouth piece.  This gave an even distribution of the product, and prevented the gel oozing out.  15 minutes later, and after the cold water rinse, I could see a distinct difference in the shade of my teeth.  I am very happy with the purchase, and using the cotton swab, maybe able to extend the use.</li>
            <li> Did not make any changeat all  in the whiteness of my teeth.  Very disappointing after following directions and no results.</li>
            <li> Bad plastic container that came with it.  I only noticed a slight degree in increasing my teeth&#x27;s whitening after going through a whole bottle.</li>
            <li> On first application I only kept it in for a few minutes because I&#x27;d put too much gel in the mould such that it overflowed all into my mouth but even after that short time my teeth were noticably white and I didn&#x27;t have any burning/irritation. The teeth mould is good but it requires effort to stop it popping out and off your teeth. Prepare to choke on spit as there&#x27;s no where for saliva to go. Overall though, I&#x27;d recommend it because of that price + results if you can get through the saliva.</li>
            <li> This totally met my expectations and works! Although I wish there was a bit more product included. Only lasts a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Transforms teeth in 2 days. Best whitening system for your money.</li>
            <li> Definitely saw an improvement, so did a lot of my friends</li>
            <li> Very sticky formula, easy to put in but some reached the back of my throat and it feel funny, like irritated. I used it first time for about 18min. I have used different products in the past and this one is better, and cheaper, and simpler. rinse, gel, wash.&lt;br /&gt;After the first used, yes, worked, whiter teeth. I will do the 14 days treatment as instructed.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat skeptical about this product. Many products make these extreme claims and rarely deliver.  However, that is not the case here.  It is an inexpensive product, readily available, and I got IMMEDIATE results!  After the first use, I noticed the difference.  There has been no sensitivity after two full days of use, and I have VERY sensitive teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was quick and easy to use --- I used it for 20 minutes, twice a day for the first and second days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the results and highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> Truly helps! Thank you so much for fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Works well if you use it 5 days in a row. Do not get this on your gums!</li>
            <li> This stuff is addicting.  I&#x27;ve used the white strips in the past but they make my teeth overly sensitive, even painful after continued use.  This stuff is gentle and WORKS.  After my first day of use I could see a huge difference, I&#x27;m on day 4 and I love it.  Instead of filling the tray with the goo I recommend just squeezing a small amount onto your finger and spreading it along the fronts of your teeth.  Who cares about the back sides.  This saves a ton and you&#x27;ll get lots of use out of this large tube.  I also leave it in for longer than the 5 minutes, so it really really is gentle, not any problems with sensitivity.  For this price it&#x27;s the best product out there.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy, but what else do you expect for the price? Aside from the messiness, it works as described! Love it!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for this. Works as well as almost any other whitening system. If your teeh are very stained...it&#x27;s gonna take a lot of time to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff was not great and I really did not notice much of a whitening effect at all.  My teeth aren&#x27;t really yellow but I do drink multiple cups of coffee on a daily basis so I was hoping for SOME result.  Nada.  I do not recommend buying.</li>
            <li> Have been skeptical about finding a good teeth whitener because of how yellow me teeth have gotten due to drinking coffee everyday, used it for the first time last night and my teeth are already white. Excited to see what will come in the next few uses.</li>
            <li> This product works - nothing more needed to say.</li>
            <li> Used it for a week, 2x a day 20-25 mins every time, did everything said on the box, not a single improvement! Why are there 5 star reviews i just don&#x27;t get it!</li>
            <li> Messy, works somewhat, as i never got the Ultra white shade in 5 mins that&#x27;s advertised on box.</li>
            <li> i havent used it yet! but i had one before and it showed good results! i recommend</li>
            <li> due to drinking coffee for the past 10 years, my teeth have yellowed quite a bit. this product did not work as well as the dominant seller of teeth whitening strips. i suggest basing your purchase upon how long your teeth have stayed yellow and what habits cause your discoloration.</li>
            <li> This might work, but the goop is so goopy! It gets everywhere and burns your gums and the roof of your mouth. Maybe a smaller hole for the tube so it spreads thinner? I don&#x27;t know...didn&#x27;t like it.  Definitely don&#x27;t do both sides at once unless you want to drool all over yourself.</li>
            <li> this product works a lot!  however, one time when i travelled to the other country, i put it in my luggage, and unfortunately i turned out to be liquid and spillover my luggage!  the gel finally became liquid on the flight for 12 hours!  it was a new one, and never be opened. the result was horrible!  All the liquid leaked out.........</li>
            <li> This whitens your teeth FAST!  Way better than any strips I&#x27;ve used.  To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used the newest 40-50 dollar box of white strips, but this is so much cheaper and whitens in such a short amount of time, I wouldn&#x27;t even  bother with anything else.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> works pretty great, my teeth look much whiter.  Makes them a bit more sensitive though for a day.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product for the money...it well exceeded my expectations.. works better and faster than most more expensive whiteners. Would buy again..</li>
