            <li>I have been using this cologne for more than 20 years and love it with passion.</li>
            <li>I have worked in the fragrance industry for many many years.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend this cologne, although I wish it lasted longer on my skin, seems to disappear quick but still great!!</li>
            <li>Guerlain is the best perfumer and with my long time love affair with its cologne</li>
            <li>Refreshing, clean, and invigorating.</li>
            <li>Great anytime cologne but especially morning fragrance.</li>
            <li>I request an original men&#x27;s cologne instead sent me a woman&#x27;s perfume or cologne forged</li>
            <li>so I will make a claim to receive Mastercard unless you send the original colony.</li>
            <li>Imperiale by Guerlain is a scent that is clean</li>
            <li>MUCH CHEAPER, BUT SADLY BETTER.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what this smells like as it was a gift, but it arrived quickly and in manufacturer seal.  </li>
            <li>Fresh lemon-lime scent.  </li>
            <li>this is a fresh and lemony scent for men of all ages.</li>
            <li>I am very familiar with Imperiale, and this is far from it.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>After you spray it on, it won&#x27;t last more than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon</li>
            <li>, I know this is not the real thing.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and does not overpower, allowing you to use throughout the day or night with proper discretion.</li>
            <li>A classic fragrance to go with the rest of the current colognes you may enjoy.  </li>
            <li>I have received more compliments on Imperiale than on any other cologne I have ever worn.</li>
            <li>Did not receive the same packaging as in the picture, which is the most recent and theoretically the freshest.</li>
            <li>This last version smells familiar but the scent does not last.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how such a sweet scent can be formulated without also creating a way for it to last.</li>
            <li>I love the little tiny bottle ..</li>
            <li>am going to take action for deceipt.</li>
            <li>I remember having purchased it at a high price several years earlier.</li>
            <li>When I opened up the shipping box, I found the bottle box had no clear plastic wrapper (which you would expect for a brand new item) as if it had been opened up before.</li>

            <li> Hard to find fragrance.  Fresh lemon-lime scent.  Have had to purchase while on vacation, in the past.  Caribbean shops charge much more for it.  This will allow me to save more, and spend  vacation  time laying in the sun.</li>
            <li> I just got Imperiale from Guerlain purchased thru the Amazon website. I have been using this cologne for more than 20 years and love it with passion. When I opened up the shipping box, I found the bottle box had no clear plastic wrapper (which you would expect for a brand new item) as if it had been opened up before. I sprayed a little and within a few minutes the scent had gone. Guerlain is the best perfumer and with my long time love affair with its cologne, I know this is not the real thing. &lt;br /&gt;I am going to take action for deceipt. I should have known something was fishy at that price</li>
            <li> Did not receive the same packaging as in the picture, which is the most recent and theoretically the freshest. Colognes don&#x27;t have expiration dates, but they do go bad over time, so the packaging does make a difference in quality.</li>
            <li> Imperiale by Guerlain is a scent that is clean citrusy(if such a word exists). The fragrance is light and does not overpower, allowing you to use throughout the day or night with proper discretion. The price is also quite a bargain for such a quality product.</li>
            <li> A classic fragrance to go with the rest of the current colognes you may enjoy.  My father always had a handkerchief that had been moistened with it.</li>
            <li> I request an original men&#x27;s cologne instead sent me a woman&#x27;s perfume or cologne forged, this is not the characteristic smell of the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not the product you requested so I will make a claim to receive Mastercard unless you send the original colony.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what this smells like as it was a gift, but it arrived quickly and in manufacturer seal.  Very nice....</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent for men, a great gift.</li>
            <li> Excellent Real &amp; Original Cologne!!!</li>
            <li> I got this perfume at an antique store... I thought it would be expensive, but it was actually ionly five dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I use it a lot. I love the little tiny bottle .. The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> Smells AWESOME!! Surprised and very happy!!! I highly recommend this cologne, although I wish it lasted longer on my skin, seems to disappear quick but still great!!</li>
            <li> good price and product</li>
            <li> The scent was like the original I had experienced years ago. Unfortunately it does does not last and I suspect the these bottles have less of the more expensive oils. Just a guess.</li>
            <li> This product is just water with a little bit of fragrance. After you spray it on, it won&#x27;t last more than a minute.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon should take this deceit out of their selling list.</li>
            <li> Love this scent from Paris!</li>
            <li> this is a fresh and lemony scent for men of all ages. It has a nice clean just showered scent that works great in warm weather without being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This is not Guerlain Imperiale.  I just don&#x27;t know what it is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I am very familiar with Imperiale, and this is far from it.&lt;br /&gt;2.  This is just water, alcohol and a faint touch of fragrance. No fixative at all. After 5 minutes, it is gone!&lt;br /&gt;3.  There is some Arabic writing on the bottom of the box??  Why?&lt;br /&gt;4.  The bottle says &amp;#34;Made in France&amp;#34;, but that probably applies to the bottle itself, not to what is inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I RECOMMEND 4711, MUCH CHEAPER, BUT SADLY BETTER.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne at a deep discount. I remember having purchased it at a high price several years earlier. This last version smells familiar but the scent does not last. It is gone within 10 - 20 minutes max. I wonder if I purchased a counterfeit. I don&#x27;t see how such a sweet scent can be formulated without also creating a way for it to last.</li>
            <li> I find this similar to 4711 but longer lasting.  It is a marvelous cooling summer fragrance.  One of the best of the five original &amp;#34;cologne&amp;#34; fragrances.  (Jean Marie Farina, 4711, etc.)  I wrote Jean-Jacque Guerlain (spelling?) about 60 years ago with a question about the date on the bottle, and he replied with a personal note, and under separate cover, a one-gallon bottle of the fragrance!</li>
            <li> Repeat product. 4th time I&#x27;ve bought this. Best price and consistent product.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has ever smelled Guerlain for Men will be captivated by it citrusy scent.  I have been buying it for years.</li>
            <li> I have worked in the fragrance industry for many many years. I have worked for many companies and represented a variety of colognes/fragrances. I have never smell a better fragrance. I have received more compliments on Imperiale than on any other cologne I have ever worn. Refreshing, clean, and invigorating. It smells like a gin and tonic (hold the tonic) with tons of lime. Great anytime cologne but especially morning fragrance.</li>
