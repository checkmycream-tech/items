            <li>Best blades there are!</li>
            <li>These are the best DE blades on the market, period.</li>
            <li>These blades are the best I&#x27;ve ever used .</li>
            <li>They are both excellent blades; I was not dissatisfied with either.  </li>
            <li>great !</li>
            <li>very impressed .</li>
            <li>However, wonderful blades.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>superb shave every time and no irritation</li>
            <li>They are not always perfect (nor are my shaving skills)</li>
            <li>Awesome blades.</li>
            <li>Very happy, will be sticking with these and throw the others out.</li>
            <li>Then I put the blade in my 1967 gillette slim and had another great shave.</li>
            <li>Great blades.</li>
            <li>Great blade.</li>
            <li>That’s a good thing.</li>
            <li>These have been consistently the best razors I have come across.  </li>
            <li>The comments about the blades made by the seller were very accurate.</li>
            <li>I chose when I needed to purchase more blades depended upon my mood at the moment of purchase.  </li>
            <li>Some were better than others, and some were m-u-c-h better than others, but by 2014, I had winnowed the field and settled into a &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; of five different brands of soaps, all of them excellent.  </li>
            <li>there is nothing better.</li>
            <li>(love love these)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best double blade I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Great blade for getting that much closer to your skin</li>
            <li>These blades give a very smooth, close, comfortable shave without skin</li>
            <li>popped one of these in a 1948 aristocrat and had an amazing first shave.  </li>
            <li>Kai is wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li>Great, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit neatly in any of my 10 razors.</li>
            <li>Those five soaps, sourced from exotic locales in Vienna, Austria, in Riverdale Park, Maryland, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in France, and in Italy, were among the soaps that also are most highly regarded by the on-line shaving communities of Shavenook and Badger &amp; Blade.  </li>
            <li>Formerly, I liked all of the top five soaps equally, but they now have a distinct order of priority; and the maxim that “you get what you pay for” has been debunked:  </li>
            <li>This is  by far the very best - it&#x27;s also the most expensive at more than 40 cents per blade.</li>
            <li>so far my favorite blade.</li>
            <li>Shave the thickness with the right blade</li>
            <li>Is this right?</li>
            <li>But the results are worth the effort:  the KAI blades shave my beard more closely and more smoothly (on MY face; your experience may vary) than any other double edge razor blade I ever have used, period.  </li>
            <li>I personally use a 1923 open comb Gillette and these blades pair nicely!</li>
            <li>I have used many different brands of blades.</li>
            <li>I wish I could more passes out of them, but my hair is coarse.</li>
            <li>Every time I got ready to shave, I had the luxury of choosing among them.  </li>
            <li>One of the five — the Italian one — was an early casualty and became a “formerly favorite” shaving soap; and the longer I shaved with KAI blades, others fell by the wayside.  </li>
            <li>but I find these to work better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>KAI stainless blades are an order of magnitude sharper than either the Gillette Silver Blue blades or the Polsilver Super Iridium blades.  </li>
            <li>For half a century, I had been lathering up daily, using a good badger brush ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Polsilver Super Iridium Double Edge Razor Blades]]</li>
            <li>When I started to shave with the KAIs, I quickly learned that they demand extra care when shaving.  </li>
            <li>They are not for beginners and the faint of heart; but they are extremely smooth for the experienced wet shaver.</li>
            <li>and the blade last enough for a few really great shaves.</li>
            <li>For about a year now, I have been using KAI razor blades as my first choice double edge razor blades.  </li>
            <li>wow !</li>
            <li>The KAI blades are so sharp and smooth that they forced me into analytical distinctions in slickness and protectiveness that I never before had detected among my top five shaving soaps.  </li>
            <li>KAI blades are not only excellent in themselves; they have forced me to reassess the various shaving soaps and shaving creams that I have been using for years, and so the average quality and enjoyment of my shave experiences is ascending.  </li>
            <li>Super Badger Shave Brush]]) and a very wide variety of purpose-made shaving soaps, to shave.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, slightly curvy hair and a sensitive neck, so having a sharp razor that doesn&#x27;t cause many cuts or ingrown hairs is nice to have.</li>
            <li>see the name Feather pop up frequently when looking at Kai reviews.  </li>
            <li>Sharp, smooth, and seems to last forever.  </li>
            <li>My first shave with the very first KAI blade out of the package a year ago forced me to re-evaluate, not only the blades that up</li>
            <li>Be aware, they are so sharp, you may not realized if and when you nick yourself.</li>
            <li>I have tried 5 major brands.</li>
            <li>I find that I can easily get three shaves from a single blade while the lesser expensive blades give me only one or two, so the cost just about evens out and the shave is much better.</li>
            <li>No frills blade its plain with no markings or graphics its just pretty straight froward solid product.</li>
            <li>over one hundred fifty shaves&#x27; experience with Feather Stainless blades and at least two dozen blades’ experience shaving with each of Rapira Swedish Supersteel,  and Gillette Platinum (the St, Petersburg version, not the “Super Platinum 7 O’Clock” blades from India) double edge blades.)  </li>
            <li>Clearly Kai are different than other blades in the gauge of steel they use (evident just by looking at the blades).</li>
            <li>Much sharper and long lasting.</li>
            <li>My preference has been Kai and Feather blades, however while both are very sharp the Kai blades seem more forgiving, and have a consistency over all areas of my face, including the areas which are more difficult due to terrain and whisker thickness.</li>

            <li> Best blades there are! Extremely sharp and I get at least 10 shaves per blade. I personally use a 1923 open comb Gillette and these blades pair nicely! They are not for beginners and the faint of heart; but they are extremely smooth for the experienced wet shaver. Be aware, they are so sharp, you may not realized if and when you nick yourself.</li>
            <li> These are the best DE blades on the market, period. They are also the most expensive, yet for the improved shave quality and the longer shave life of each blade it is money well spent. The comments about the blades made by the seller were very accurate. Clearly Kai are different than other blades in the gauge of steel they use (evident just by looking at the blades). My preference has been Kai and Feather blades, however while both are very sharp the Kai blades seem more forgiving, and have a consistency over all areas of my face, including the areas which are more difficult due to terrain and whisker thickness. These blades give a very smooth, close, comfortable shave without skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize each individual&#x27;s beard, skin, routine and experience may be different but this has been my experience.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, buy them in bulk and throw everything else out. I have a thick beard and these blades are just a pleasure to shave with.</li>
            <li> These blades are the best I&#x27;ve ever used .</li>
            <li> For about a year now, I have been using KAI razor blades as my first choice double edge razor blades.  Before that, I had settled into alternating between [[ASIN:B009XHQGY0 Gillette Silver Blue Double Edge Razor Blades]] and [[ASIN:B00MCLSFIY Polsilver Super Iridium Double Edge Razor Blades]], both of which are manufactured in the St. Petersburg, Russia, facility in which Procter &amp; Gamble has a majority interest.  Those two lines of razor blades are not identical, but they are very similar and they are priced similarly, and which between them I chose when I needed to purchase more blades depended upon my mood at the moment of purchase.  They are both excellent blades; I was not dissatisfied with either.  KAI stainless blades are an order of magnitude sharper than either the Gillette Silver Blue blades or the Polsilver Super Iridium blades.  When I started to shave with the KAIs, I quickly learned that they demand extra care when shaving.  A KAI blade can slice off a piece of your face so efficiently that you probably will not feel it, and might not even notice it until the lather turns red; long after I had thought that I had got my shaving technique down pat using other blades, I discovered that I had to refine my technique to use the KAI blades.  But the results are worth the effort:  the KAI blades shave my beard more closely and more smoothly (on MY face; your experience may vary) than any other double edge razor blade I ever have used, period.  (In addition to the two brands of blades noted above that I started with, I now have accumulated over one hundred fifty shaves&#x27; experience with Feather Stainless blades and at least two dozen blades’ experience shaving with each of Rapira Swedish Supersteel,  and Gillette Platinum (the St, Petersburg version, not the “Super Platinum 7 O’Clock” blades from India) double edge blades.)  My first shave with the very first KAI blade out of the package a year ago forced me to re-evaluate, not only the blades that up tothen I had been using, but also my best-of-breed shaving soaps that I had been lathering.  For half a century, I had been lathering up daily, using a good badger brush ([[ASIN:B003B3Q0UM Vulfix 2234s Super Badger Shave Brush]]) and a very wide variety of purpose-made shaving soaps, to shave.  Over time, I have tried a few shaving soaps so expensive that I hid the price from my spouse, sourced from places all around the world.  Some were better than others, and some were m-u-c-h better than others, but by 2014, I had winnowed the field and settled into a &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; of five different brands of soaps, all of them excellent.  Every time I got ready to shave, I had the luxury of choosing among them.  The KAI blades are so sharp and smooth that they forced me into analytical distinctions in slickness and protectiveness that I never before had detected among my top five shaving soaps.  Those five soaps, sourced from exotic locales in Vienna, Austria, in Riverdale Park, Maryland, in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in France, and in Italy, were among the soaps that also are most highly regarded by the on-line shaving communities of Shavenook and Badger &amp; Blade.  Formerly, I liked all of the top five soaps equally, but they now have a distinct order of priority; and the maxim that “you get what you pay for” has been debunked:  the priority in performance and the price levels of the soaps are uncorrelated.  One of the five — the Italian one — was an early casualty and became a “formerly favorite” shaving soap; and the longer I shaved with KAI blades, others fell by the wayside.  Although the Ebeneezer Scrooge in me will not permit me to throw an expensive, but only partially used, puck of soap in the trash bin, three of the five soaps have moved to a higher, less accessible shelf in the cabinet, to be retrieved only when I am feeling foolishly nostalgic, or — I can hope — as gifts to my grandsons to use as trainer soaps when they reach shaving age.  (The survivors:  the soaps from Maryland and Austria,)  Bottom line:  KAI blades are not only excellent in themselves; they have forced me to reassess the various shaving soaps and shaving creams that I have been using for years, and so the average quality and enjoyment of my shave experiences is ascending.  That’s a good thing.</li>
            <li> The sharpest blades I have ever used.</li>
            <li> These are sharp as anything else called as such, and without the discomfort of a machete, like the others are, Period! Shave the thickness with the right blade there is nothing better.</li>
            <li> wow ! great ! I have used dorco, derby , lord , crystal. popped one of these in a 1948 aristocrat and had an amazing first shave.  very impressed . Then I put the blade in my 1967 gillette slim and had another great shave. and the blade last enough for a few really great shaves. so far my favorite blade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about 7 months into wet shaving with the double edged blades. I have tried 5 major brands. This is  by far the very best - it&#x27;s also the most expensive at more than 40 cents per blade. I find that I can easily get three shaves from a single blade while the lesser expensive blades give me only one or two, so the cost just about evens out and the shave is much better. AND its&#x27; kinda neat shaving with a blade from a Samurai Sword manufacturer! BTW: my second choice is Feather and my value choice is Derby Extra.</li>
            <li> I have used many different brands of blades. I decided to take the plunge with Kai and I am SO impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give you an idea of my blade rotation:&lt;br /&gt;Astra (love love these)&lt;br /&gt;Personal Med Preps (I prefer Astra)&lt;br /&gt;Gilette Silver Blue (least favorite)&lt;br /&gt;Blue Bird (Discontinued !!! However, wonderful blades.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see the name Feather pop up frequently when looking at Kai reviews.  Some people say feather is the sharpest. Is this right? Who cares when they tug and pull your face to the point of being an unbearable shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HATE feather. Kai is wonderfully smooth. I don&#x27;t know whether or not it&#x27;s sharper than anything else. I find ALL razors to be just that. Razor sharp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A caveat; I seldom know when I should change or when I last changed blades while using Kai. If I could give this product 10 stars I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoothness and comfort are the name of the game and Kai is the winner hands down nothing but Blue Bird comes close. As always, YMMV. However, if you are comparing this to Feather, there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> already wrote my review on the single 5 pack set, still the finest shave I have ever found with these blades.&lt;br /&gt;Stocking up on these for the long haul.&lt;br /&gt;A superb shave every time and no irritation whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Blades last me at least 5 BBS shaves consistently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a head shaver and have tried a lot of different blades for the noggin. Feathers and Astras are sharp, but are aggressive for me. These are the sharpest, smoothest shaving blades that I have come across. I try others, but still go back to these as my everyday blade.</li>
            <li> These have been consistently the best razors I have come across.  I have thick, slightly curvy hair and a sensitive neck, so having a sharp razor that doesn&#x27;t cause many cuts or ingrown hairs is nice to have. They are not always perfect (nor are my shaving skills) but I find these to work better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great blades. I wish I could more passes out of them, but my hair is coarse. Great, I&#x27;ll definitely purchase from this company again.</li>
            <li> Awesome blades. Very sharp. Best double blade I&#x27;ve found. &amp; at this price. That&#x27;s enough blades to last all year.</li>
            <li> I had tried a previous sampler pack and used a variety of blades for a year or so. Saw this blade mentioned in another review, and these blow all the others away! Very happy, will be sticking with these and throw the others out. Much sharper and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Great blade for getting that much closer to your skin</li>
            <li> Next to the Feather blade these are number 2 blade followed by the personna med prep at number 3. The KAI is very sharp and will last me about 5 shaves. No frills blade its plain with no markings or graphics its just pretty straight froward solid product.</li>
            <li> The razor blades are extremely sharp but they seem larger than any other blade. They don&#x27;t fit neatly in any of my 10 razors. I would hesitate buying them and cannot recommend them.</li>
            <li> Great blade. Sharp, smooth, and seems to last forever.  Expensive price tag, but when you average it out over the number of shaves you get and factor in the quality, these blades are actually a bargain.</li>
