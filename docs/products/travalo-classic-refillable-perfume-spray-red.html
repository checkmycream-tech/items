            <li>Works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Great buy!</li>
            <li>Best thing ever invented!</li>
            <li>Great for on the go and travelling too!</li>
            <li>What a wonderful travel tool.  </li>
            <li>and they still work perfectly.</li>
            <li>Awesome for travel, gym or nights out.</li>
            <li>Great way to take cologne on the road.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so awesome and handy.</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Very suitable for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used these as gifts and it was loved by all including me</li>
            <li>Great quality item that allows you to take a travel amount of your favorite perfume with you in a lightweight, well sealed container</li>
            <li>Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>Love!  </li>
            <li>easy to us, light and perfect!</li>
            <li>nice spray.  </li>
            <li>to whoever invented it, i love it :)</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>After having a glass, roller-ball version of my favorite fragrance shatter in my purse, I went on the hunt for something more substantial.</li>
            <li>Dedicate one Travalo to one fragrance and just buy more if you need more.</li>
            <li>The spray comes out in a fine mist.</li>
            <li>Did not work at all,  I have one from a different seller and it works great.</li>
            <li>These are cleverly designed and work much better than cheaper ones that fill from the top.</li>
            <li>Travalo is perfect as you can fill it with the fragrance of your choice, which is especially convenient if your favorite fragrance doesn&#x27;t currently have a travel-sized version</li>
            <li>i was worried perfume would be wasted (leak) while refilling but works great.</li>
            <li>Have bought many of these over the last two years for myself and as gifts.</li>
            <li>took my own perfume without the heavy glass bottle.  </li>
            <li>I already traveled one trip with this, and it held more than enough cologne for an entire week.</li>
            <li>so useful since I travel extensively</li>
            <li>You pop the top off the perfume bottle, attach this item to the stick, and pump a few times.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this little thing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far no leaks.  </li>
            <li>So far this is 5 stars -</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a window to show you how much perfume is left in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Even after cleaning with alcohol, you&#x27;ll still smell the notes of your last fragrance, but now mixed with your new fragrance.</li>
            <li>However, I would suggest being a bit gentle with it, i.e. don&#x27;t throw them down.</li>

            <li> It takes fewer than 30 seconds to fill, is tiny enough for the smallest purse (just under 3&amp;#34; long), and doesn&#x27;t leak.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I waited so long to purchase one of these.</li>
            <li> A waste of money</li>

            <li> Cologne spilled everywhere adaptor does not fit common cologne bottles</li>

            <li> Great way to take cologne on the road.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  No problems with TSA.  Very suitable for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far no leaks.  However, I would suggest being a bit gentle with it, i.e. don&#x27;t throw them down.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work.  Cologne spilled everywhere adaptor does not fit common cologne bottles</li>
            <li> There is no way to fill this!  A waste of money</li>
            <li> this is genius for traveling! kudos to whoever invented it, i love it :)</li>
            <li> It serves its function and works well! I initially tested it by filling it with cologne and left it for about a week with tape aligned next to the cologne level to see if any leakage occurred. This was definitely not the case - the cologne was at the same initial level. I already traveled one trip with this, and it held more than enough cologne for an entire week. I was even using it after I returned from my trip for about a week or two. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Best thing ever invented! When my perfume bottle quit spraying after only 5 sprays I was so upset. Never thought I&#x27;d have a way to save my bottle of perfume. Great for on the go and travelling too!</li>
            <li> What a wonderful travel tool.  took my own perfume without the heavy glass bottle.  easy to us, light and perfect!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Great quality item that allows you to take a travel amount of your favorite perfume with you in a lightweight, well sealed container</li>
            <li> Did what it was supposed to do.</li>

            <li> I love these. After having a glass, roller-ball version of my favorite fragrance shatter in my purse, I went on the hunt for something more substantial. Travalo is perfect as you can fill it with the fragrance of your choice, which is especially convenient if your favorite fragrance doesn&#x27;t currently have a travel-sized version available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve purchased three of these (one for my mom) and have had them for about a year now and they still work perfectly. One suggestion: don&#x27;t swap fragrances within the same bottle. Even after cleaning with alcohol, you&#x27;ll still smell the notes of your last fragrance, but now mixed with your new fragrance. Dedicate one Travalo to one fragrance and just buy more if you need more.</li>
            <li> These are cleverly designed and work much better than cheaper ones that fill from the top.</li>
            <li> Love!  Awesome for travel, gym or nights out.</li>
