            <li>Got to me when it said it would be here and works amazing.</li>
            <li>The ink wasn&#x27;t amazing</li>
            <li>Amazing into to tat&#x27;s</li>
            <li>i have been doing tattoos now for about 9 yrs didnt have much money to buy a real good kit</li>
            <li>set well nice price</li>
            <li>workes awesome really like it</li>
            <li>I contacted the seller they seem really nice and said that they are sending me another machine.</li>
            <li>Nice set</li>
            <li>even the inks are pretty good!</li>
            <li>Everything works perfectly in my kit so far.</li>
            <li>i say this because my friend  had bought a kit  from  here  and was cheaper and his was better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with my machine.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s getting better and better :)</li>
            <li>Enjoying the tattoo machines.</li>
            <li>has some gangsta $100 dollar bills on motors :)</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I will be all set love it.</li>
            <li>the whole kit was great, except for the ink, i don&#x27;t know what happened with it</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I was pleased with everything else</li>
            <li>I do wish it came with more sinthetic skin and more shading needles.</li>
            <li>Guns are okay</li>
            <li>would give more stars if everything worked</li>
            <li>Sure I Read Everything About It.</li>
            <li>get  better ink tho machine  </li>
            <li>Will be returning and buying a better brand.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product</li>
            <li>Love the cost for the items I got</li>
            <li>the colors are bright and vibrant!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good starters kit if your looking for a first time kit</li>
            <li>ALSO if you have a complaint about the size of the inks... learn to read before you tattoo for the greater good of the world. :D</li>
            <li>the machines looked very cheap and the foot pedal was really cheap looking too.</li>
            <li>Do not attempt to free form it unless you are 100% absolutely positively confident with the design.</li>
            <li>0 stars cords break easy gun falls apart  </li>
            <li>Ink is strong and holds well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tested a couple inks on fruits and some of the run smoother than others, they are not the best but to me they are good enough for learning and practicing.</li>
            <li>But everything else was fine.</li>
            <li>and it works fine</li>
            <li>but both of the gun work fine.</li>
            <li>Everything works great the only problem I have with the kit s that the ink cap holder breaks to easily</li>
            <li>The power supply feels flimsy, but is quite precise.</li>
            <li>but it was cheap</li>
            <li>everything was great except for the pedal the only worked for alittle while also it through off sparks</li>
            <li>I noticed many people complained about the inks -- they aren&#x27;t the BEST quality.....</li>
            <li>the ink isnt that great but its ok to practice, when she is ready to do a real tatoo on real skin we will buy better ink.</li>
            <li>came super quick in the mail!</li>
            <li>I loved this product it works great, only thing is the ink should have been a little better</li>
            <li>I am an amateur at best, but what I&#x27;ve done and learned are completely adequate for a beginner.</li>
            <li>Works vary well pleased with the whole package</li>
            <li>Everything was good but the ink is not for human skin</li>
            <li>I recommend it to any one that wants to get started. :)</li>
            <li>only good for beginner.</li>
            <li>I love it and thanks again</li>
            <li>though i dont care much for coil machines now that ive really gotten into tattooing(rotary machines all the way love the 10.00 stealth clone!).</li>
            <li>Great for anyone starting out or even advanced artists most definitely recommend</li>
            <li>keep up the great prices thanks to all the sellers who made this possible</li>
            <li>when my tattoo kit arrived i was super exited, but when i opened it up</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>I ordered new ink of a different brand and it worked great, other than that it was a great product</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and product description was 100% accurate.</li>
            <li>Delivery was earlier than expected, which worked out perfect for us.</li>
            <li>It was more then we expected , everything u need to tattoo from top to bottom .</li>
            <li>Good kit , but had to rate a 2 because guns where not of quality and weren&#x27;t as proficient as expected .</li>
            <li>The ink is cheap and it will break u out with bumps I would love my money back</li>
            <li>This set was way worth 40</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>My favorite amazon order so far.</li>
            <li>I hope it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li>fast easy transaction, fast shipping, cool lil kit for beginners will buy again.</li>
            <li>thought other wise</li>
            <li>Machines was set up right out of the box.</li>
            <li>Except the worse and hope for the best, I like it alot pretty kool</li>
            <li>Great set but ink sucks</li>
            <li>Great for beginners like me (:&lt;br /&gt;Ink was not good tho but its right for the price .</li>
            <li>Standard, but everything worked great minus the power supply box.</li>
            <li>Everything was good but they broke my power supply when being shipped wondering if u can send the power supply back only to get new one</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTE RIP OFF!when</li>
            <li>I will have to upload some pictures very soon.</li>
            <li>so I guess I will survive thanks to YouTube videos.</li>
            <li>More than i expected.</li>
            <li>Everything shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>;...... btw the ink really, really suck</li>
            <li>am a fast learner tho</li>
            <li>I really appreciate it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>Cool only take 4 days</li>
            <li>love it now I just half to get some variety of needles</li>
            <li>This kit contains more than I expected, the designs on the guns were an unexpected surprise.</li>
            <li>We ordered some high quality inks, and are going to touch up with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great machine only if the ink bottles were a little bit bigger</li>
            <li>worked good  and can handle all day with no problems  all though one of my machine was broken</li>
            <li>so I had to order a new one.</li>
            <li>y live in venezuela and arrived headthy</li>
            <li>i now have a new tattoo...</li>
            <li>not even the one in the new picture!this is complete carp.never order from galaxycolor usa rip off artists!</li>
            <li>Very surprised at the quality of everything.</li>
            <li>Machinesz died super fast not worth waisting ur money on</li>
            <li>But It Clearly Says In The Description</li>
            <li>Bought this for my fiance for an early Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>It was delivered early witch was a surprise.</li>
            <li>My kit came complete.</li>
            <li>This was a very efficient get up tool to get back on my feet thank you, though I have been tattooing almost10 years it hurts to lose all you have</li>
            <li>now I&#x27;m back in business thanks to u guys.</li>
            <li>This Ink Highly Recomended For Use On The Practice Skin Only ..</li>
            <li>Works great despite the bad reviews about the ink</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t suggest to do with big major tattoos</li>
            <li>does not work worth a crap other than that all is good</li>
            <li>Consider buying new inks (this set comes with a lot of inks, so don&#x27;t worry about not having enough), but other than that you will make your money back 10 fold</li>

            <li> I was pleased with everything else</li>
            <li> I do wish it came with more sinthetic skin and more shading needles.</li>
            <li> Guns are okay</li>
            <li> would give more stars if everything worked</li>
            <li> Sure I Read Everything About It.</li>
            <li> get  better ink tho machine  </li>
            <li> Will be returning and buying a better brand.&lt;br /&gt;Terrible product</li>
            <li> Love the cost for the items I got</li>
            <li> the colors are bright and vibrant!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starters kit if your looking for a first time kit</li>
            <li> ALSO if you have a complaint about the size of the inks... learn to read before you tattoo for the greater good of the world. :D</li>
            <li> the machines looked very cheap and the foot pedal was really cheap looking too.</li>
            <li> Do not attempt to free form it unless you are 100% absolutely positively confident with the design.</li>
            <li> 0 stars cords break easy gun falls apart  </li>
            <li> Ink is strong and holds well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tested a couple inks on fruits and some of the run smoother than others, they are not the best but to me they are good enough for learning and practicing.</li>
            <li> But everything else was fine.</li>
            <li> and it works fine</li>
            <li> but both of the gun work fine.</li>
            <li> Everything works great the only problem I have with the kit s that the ink cap holder breaks to easily</li>
            <li> The power supply feels flimsy, but is quite precise.</li>
            <li> but it was cheap</li>
            <li> everything was great except for the pedal the only worked for alittle while also it through off sparks</li>
            <li> I noticed many people complained about the inks -- they aren&#x27;t the BEST quality.....</li>
            <li> the ink isnt that great but its ok to practice, when she is ready to do a real tatoo on real skin we will buy better ink.</li>
            <li> came super quick in the mail!</li>
            <li> I loved this product it works great, only thing is the ink should have been a little better</li>
            <li> I am an amateur at best, but what I&#x27;ve done and learned are completely adequate for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Works vary well pleased with the whole package</li>
            <li> Everything was good but the ink is not for human skin</li>
            <li> I recommend it to any one that wants to get started. :)</li>
            <li> only good for beginner.</li>
            <li> I love it and thanks again</li>
            <li> though i dont care much for coil machines now that ive really gotten into tattooing(rotary machines all the way love the 10.00 stealth clone!).</li>

            <li> keep up the great prices thanks to all the sellers who made this possible</li>

            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> I ordered new ink of a different brand and it worked great, other than that it was a great product</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and product description was 100% accurate.</li>
            <li> Delivery was earlier than expected, which worked out perfect for us.</li>
            <li> It was more then we expected , everything u need to tattoo from top to bottom .</li>
            <li> Good kit , but had to rate a 2 because guns where not of quality and weren&#x27;t as proficient as expected .</li>
            <li> The ink is cheap and it will break u out with bumps I would love my money back</li>
            <li> This set was way worth 40</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> My favorite amazon order so far.</li>
            <li> I hope it was worth the purchase</li>
            <li> fast easy transaction, fast shipping, cool lil kit for beginners will buy again.</li>
            <li> thought other wise</li>

            <li> Great for beginners like me (:&lt;br /&gt;Ink was not good tho but its right for the price .</li>
            <li> Standard, but everything worked great minus the power supply box.</li>
            <li> Everything was good but they broke my power supply when being shipped wondering if u can send the power supply back only to get new one</li>

            <li> We ordered some high quality inks, and are going to touch up with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great machine only if the ink bottles were a little bit bigger</li>
            <li> worked good  and can handle all day with no problems  all though one of my machine was broken</li>
            <li> so I had to order a new one.</li>
            <li> y live in venezuela and arrived headthy</li>
            <li> i now have a new tattoo...</li>
            <li> not even the one in the new picture!this is complete carp.never order from galaxycolor usa rip off artists!</li>
            <li> Very surprised at the quality of everything.</li>
            <li> Machinesz died super fast not worth waisting ur money on</li>
            <li> But It Clearly Says In The Description</li>
            <li> Bought this for my fiance for an early Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> It was delivered early witch was a surprise.</li>
            <li> My kit came complete.</li>
            <li> This was a very efficient get up tool to get back on my feet thank you, though I have been tattooing almost10 years it hurts to lose all you have</li>
            <li> now I&#x27;m back in business thanks to u guys.</li>
            <li> This Ink Highly Recomended For Use On The Practice Skin Only ..</li>
            <li> Works great despite the bad reviews about the ink</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t suggest to do with big major tattoos</li>
            <li> does not work worth a crap other than that all is good</li>
            <li> Consider buying new inks (this set comes with a lot of inks, so don&#x27;t worry about not having enough), but other than that you will make your money back 10 fold</li>
            <li> Decent little set up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one that was more expensive and this one gives the same results as the other one recommendable</li>
            <li> kit was missing tubes, and ink is worthless, but overall a good buy for the price!</li>
            <li> but they are not serious enough to leave any negative on this order all in all</li>
            <li> A few small minor adjustments and your ready to Rock!</li>
            <li> I received only 10 color inks, not even any black, and I did not receive a practice skin.</li>
            <li> it was empty.</li>
            <li> The machines work as expected.</li>
            <li> But there was absolutely no instructions on the disk.</li>
            <li> Not real ink!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy that I paid for overnight shipping for a item that is nothing more than a paper weight.</li>
            <li> Which I don&#x27;t have in any of my computers anymore from the dark</li>
            <li> Got the kit and did a few tats and for every one I did the ink didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Missing Allen wrench and instructions</li>
            <li> a need a few tips if anyonr can help me out</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Came with everything I needed all that I was not satisfied about is</li>
            <li> there was a few very small issues however</li>
            <li> Idk what happened to some other people&#x27;s package but mine just came in today and it came with everything shown in the picture and nothing&#x27;s broken or anything</li>
            <li> nothing broken packed tight.</li>
            <li> This ink sucks.</li>
            <li> Anyone who says &amp;#34;the DVD doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to use the gun if the couldn&#x27;t figure out it is a CD ROM, I havent tried it on a dvd player but figured since reviews tend to be negative because of moronic senseless people , I would throw it out there.</li>
            <li> The ink sucks ive done at lease 30 tattoos</li>
            <li> I can not complain for the price but are very small jajaja</li>
            <li> but they aren&#x27;t that bad for starting.</li>
            <li> The ink is horrible and the DVD came in Chinese can&#x27;t play it at all other then that everything came with it</li>
            <li> practice skin sucks though!</li>
            <li> Not happy with the fact when it got here</li>
            <li> but my pedal was broken</li>
            <li> some part is broken.</li>
            <li> The ink it comes with is terrible, highly recommend buying something else.</li>
            <li> power supply fails</li>
            <li> So a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> I wanted one of course, but they&#x27;re so expensive!</li>
            <li> Ink sucks terrible needles do not buy this product</li>
            <li> This set was terrible my power box kept skipping the gun are weak</li>
            <li> How bad do tattoos hurt thinking about doing it</li>
            <li> i was kinda disappointed.</li>
            <li> but like i said the transfer paper was a flop :(</li>
            <li> just a terrible buy wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone I just bought one from a diffrent company</li>
            <li> it is terrible</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great machine only if the ink bottles were a little bit bigger lol</li>
            <li> i have been doing tattoos now for about 9 yrs didnt have much money to buy a real good kit so gave this one a try and was amazed at how well it worked there was a few very small issues however but they are not serious enough to leave any negative on this order all in all was a very good buy and i would definately not hesitate to buy again keep up the great prices thanks to all the sellers who made this possible</li>
            <li> Great kit couldnt ask for any more</li>
            <li> 0 stars cords break easy gun falls apart  power supply fails just a terrible buy wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone I just bought one from a diffrent company and I bought this one last month</li>
            <li> still white &amp; blue lion produced. just changed packaging. if you dare to use the ink &amp; needles....good luck!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Is a good beginner kit but I don&#x27;t suggest to do with big major tattoos</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTE RIP OFF!when I ordered this kit it had two diffrent machines,diffrent power supply,and ink.they sent me a mini junk power supply not even the one in the new picture!this is complete carp.never order from galaxycolor usa rip off artists!</li>
            <li> when my tattoo kit arrived i was super exited, but when i opened it up i was kinda disappointed. the machines looked very cheap and the foot pedal was really cheap looking too. i say this because my friend  had bought a kit  from  here  and was cheaper and his was better. the machines looked bettter and  the foot pedal actually was one instead of one that looks like it may fall apart if i stepped on it. if there is any way i could exchange them i would be a lot more happy.</li>
            <li> AWESOME, BUT HAD TO USE A RUBBER BAND TO GET TO GO STRAIT AND NOT SIDE TO SIDE</li>
            <li> Both guns have to be adjusted constantly during use to maintain the desired speed.. The ink is useable but it fades a lot and doesn&#x27;t hold quite as I had hoped. But it all works.</li>
            <li> great for beginner.does nice works great. thank you</li>
            <li> Works great despite the bad reviews about the ink everything was there everything works the ink set well nice price I&#x27;m in love with my machine.</li>

            <li> It was a gift for my boyfriend ,and he loved it ! It was more then we expected , everything u need to tattoo from top to bottom . very Good</li>
            <li> Box contained all items in picture. Very surprised at the quality of everything. Have not used it yet but all electronics work. Only issue I have is one of the guns has some gangsta $100 dollar bills on motors :)</li>
            <li> Great machines just wish it came with instructions for beginners.</li>
            <li> Came with everything I needed all that I was not satisfied about is it came with one pair of gloves</li>
            <li> I bought it, for my son and he hasn&#x27;t stopped practicing yet!! I&#x27;m a happy shopper!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon.com</li>
            <li> How bad do tattoos hurt thinking about doing it</li>
            <li> Great for beginners like me (:&lt;br /&gt;Ink was not good tho but its right for the price .</li>
            <li> Came quickly. No issues with equipment.</li>
            <li> Good kit , but had to rate a 2 because guns where not of quality and weren&#x27;t as proficient as expected .</li>
            <li> Not happy with the fact when it got here the power supply didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Very nice starter kit</li>
            <li> Except the worse and hope for the best, I like it alot pretty kool thought other wise but I&#x27;m actually impressed.</li>
            <li> The tattoo machine didnt even work. It came with a DVD, but when I attempted to play the DVD...it was empty. I am sending it back immediately! Very unhappy that I paid for overnight shipping for a item that is nothing more than a paper weight.</li>
            <li> Came with everything but not the best quality machines booth guns and petal broke after one pice of art.other than that okay</li>
            <li> The ink isn&#x27;t wanting to stay in to where we have to keep doing it over and over</li>
            <li> Works vary well pleased with the whole package</li>
            <li> I will have to upload some pictures very soon. I got my boyfriend this kit for his birthday and he is having a blast. The kit comes with every thing you need to start tattooing. I noticed many people complained about the inks -- they aren&#x27;t the BEST quality..... but they aren&#x27;t that bad for starting. We ordered some high quality inks, and are going to touch up with those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before receiving this tattoo gun, I have never had a tattoo. I wanted one of course, but they&#x27;re so expensive! Now I have 6 beautiful tattoos that I couldn&#x27;t be happier with. Some advice for beginner tattoo&#x27;ers: Use stencils! Do not attempt to free form it unless you are 100% absolutely positively confident with the design. Even then, I would still stencil and seal on your tattoo area for the outline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, definitely buy if you&#x27;re thinking about it. Consider buying new inks (this set comes with a lot of inks, so don&#x27;t worry about not having enough), but other than that you will make your money back 10 fold and then some with the art you create.</li>
            <li> DVD won&#x27;t play, so without any written instructions don&#x27;t know how to assemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah so it is a CD-ROM... Which I don&#x27;t have in any of my computers anymore from the dark ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and no Allen wrenches to adjust, although I have a multi Allen wrench in my tool bag so I guess I will survive thanks to YouTube videos.</li>
            <li> Got to me when it said it would be here and works amazing. All in tac nothing broken packed tight.</li>
            <li> More than i expected.</li>
            <li> Awesome deal for the cost. Great beginners kit.</li>
            <li> love it now I just half to get some variety of needles and I will be all set love it.</li>
            <li> The transfer paper was a flop did not transfer everything else works great got it last week with everything you would ever need but like i said the transfer paper was a flop :(</li>
            <li> There is no damn manual for this thing.  The installation disc is in Asian so I can&#x27;t figure out how to install the Effen thing</li>
            <li> Not real ink! Do not use for skin!</li>
            <li> The ink is horrible and the DVD came in Chinese can&#x27;t play it at all other then that everything came with it</li>
            <li> Decent little set up. though i dont care much for coil machines now that ive really gotten into tattooing(rotary machines all the way love the 10.00 stealth clone!). comes with everything you need to get started. even the inks are pretty good! practice skin sucks though! If your wanting to learn this set up is for you! came super quick in the mail!</li>
            <li> The ink is garbage but the machines are great!! You get both the shader, liner, awesome needles and everything you need, including a DVD Rom that explains EVERYTHING. This is an awesome deal!!</li>
            <li> Good product and on time. Excellent! A++</li>
            <li> the whole kit was great, except for the ink, i don&#x27;t know what happened with it but both my wife and i got staph infection.  I ordered new ink of a different brand and it worked great, other than that it was a great product</li>
            <li> Recevied it on time n workes awesome really like it</li>
            <li> I loved this product it works great, only thing is the ink should have been a little better but it still works great!</li>
            <li> Everything was good but the ink is not for human skin it fade away  but everything else work</li>
            <li> its a piece of trash. the gun burnt out 5 minutes after using it</li>
            <li> Everything shipped fast. The inks don&#x27;t work great but the guns work good and is everything that is described. Great for a beginner.</li>
            <li> The ink is cheap and it will break u out with bumps I would love my money back</li>
            <li> This ink sucks. Got the kit and did a few tats and for every one I did the ink didn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> I like what I purchased.....</li>
            <li> I just got this today I&#x27;m supper happy with this. Like I was looking at a 100$ set and it had so mini complabts. This set was way worth 40 I recommend it to any one that wants to get started. :)</li>
            <li> The ink wasn&#x27;t amazing but it&#x27;s a good kit for starters</li>
            <li> I use it already and works great! I love it</li>
            <li> Missing Allen wrench and instructions</li>
            <li> I was pleased with everything else but my pedal was broken so I had to order a new one. But everything else was fine.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for beginners. It&#x27;s a good kit to get started with tattooing. Everything works perfectly in my kit so far. I&#x27;ve only tested a couple inks on fruits and some of the run smoother than others, they are not the best but to me they are good enough for learning and practicing. I do wish it came with more sinthetic skin and more shading needles. But considering the price this is a great kit. The guns, power supply and pedal work great!</li>
            <li> Ink sucks terrible needles do not buy this product it is terrible</li>
            <li> fast easy transaction, fast shipping, cool lil kit for beginners will buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good starters kit if your looking for a first time kit this is the one you want to get</li>
            <li> Guns are okay the ink was the weakest ever I had to but separate ink in order to actually succeed in getting the tattoo</li>
            <li> Kit is good everything pictured I got but DVD will not play and transfer paper does not work worth a crap other than that all is good would give more stars if everything worked</li>
            <li> This kit contains more than I expected, the designs on the guns were an unexpected surprise. Anyone who says &amp;#34;the DVD doesn&#x27;t work&amp;#34; shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to use the gun if the couldn&#x27;t figure out it is a CD ROM, I havent tried it on a dvd player but figured since reviews tend to be negative because of moronic senseless people , I would throw it out there. I haven&#x27;t used it yet, so I can&#x27;t say about its power quality etc. I would recommend it. ALSO if you have a complaint about the size of the inks... learn to read before you tattoo for the greater good of the world. :D</li>
            <li> It was a perfect gift.had everything that he needed in it</li>
            <li> Guns work great. Ink is strong and holds well. Very satisfied! Well worth the money</li>
            <li> great product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with shading needles</li>
            <li> I Just Ordered This And Before I Ordered It I Made Sure I Read Everything About It. I See Reviews Of People Saying The Ink Is Fading Out Of People&#x27;s Skin But It Clearly Says In The Description This Ink Highly Recomended For Use On The Practice Skin Only ..</li>
            <li> I only got 5 lining needles, but was I not supposed to get the shaders as well?...otherwise, good.</li>
            <li> I received quality items in a timely manner. The power supply feels flimsy, but is quite precise. The machines work as expected. The ink holds well. I am an amateur at best, but what I&#x27;ve done and learned are completely adequate for a beginner.</li>
            <li> Standard, but everything worked great minus the power supply box. Oh well &amp;#34;ya get whacha pay fo&amp;#34;...... btw the ink really, really suck a**</li>
            <li> Stop working no reason ... 😡😠</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with everything. I just got it yesterday(10/15/2014) and I&#x27;m more than happy with it. I&#x27;ve already done a tattoo on my boyfriend and I definitly recommend this to anyone who is looking for something like this. My favorite amazon order so far.</li>
            <li> Everything works great the only problem I have with the kit s that the ink cap holder breaks to easily</li>
            <li> Got my kit next day with everything included everything worked  no set up Instruxtions but I youtubed it and it works fine I would recommend it good deal good price</li>
            <li> Good kit to start of to tattoo get  better ink tho machine  worked good  and can handle all day with no problems  all though one of my machine was broken I contacted  the seller and let&#x27;s see what happens</li>
            <li> Everything was good but they broke my power supply when being shipped wondering if u can send the power supply back only to get new one</li>
            <li> All in all its great. It was delivered early witch was a surprise. The practice its work really good. Its a great kit for practicing. But one of my machines was broke. I contacted the seller they seem really nice and said that they are sending me another machine. I havent received it yet but its only been 2 days so i will let you know when i receive it...</li>

            <li> Nice set but the needles were recalled ... And defective equipment on one of the guns</li>
            <li> Machines was set up right out of the box. Just as described would buy again.</li>

            <li> Great tattoo kit I&#x27;ve had one that was more expensive and this one gives the same results as the other one recommendable</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. The power pack and the guns did not work.</li>
            <li> kit was missing tubes, and ink is worthless, but overall a good buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Im happy with my kit i now have a new tattoo...i didnt use the ink tho so i cant judge that but everythong else is great..happy</li>
            <li> The ink it comes with is terrible, highly recommend buying something else.</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s not like in the picture has some missed parts but I still give 5 stars for the price I think it&#x27;s alright</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought it would be but it was cheap so what can I say</li>
            <li> the guns are a great fit!! the colors are bright and vibrant!! all of it is a real great product!!</li>
            <li> This set was terrible my power box kept skipping the gun are weak</li>
            <li> this was a great deal</li>
            <li> Love the cost for the items I got but the DVD will not play. So a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great set but ink sucks</li>
            <li> The ink sucks ive done at lease 30 tattoos and I had people call me to tell me that the ink came out of there skin so I had to give there money back</li>
            <li> On time.. Easy to setup... Very happy amazing product! I came with everything I needed! awesome!!!!</li>
            <li> Got this to teach a friend techniques and it came with everything she needs to get started.</li>
            <li> its alright. some part is broken. but both of the gun work fine. only good for beginner.</li>
            <li> It did not work properly.</li>
            <li> I received only 10 color inks, not even any black, and I did not receive a practice skin. However the machines work great.</li>
            <li> I love it and thanks again now I&#x27;m back in business thanks to u guys. I really appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and product description was 100% accurate. Everything works great.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping everything was great except for the pedal the only worked for alittle while also it through off sparks</li>
            <li> very impressed and satisfied</li>
            <li> The guns worked great! Everything was in the box.  But there was absolutely no instructions on the disk. There was only pictures. Some of the pictures didn&#x27;t even load all the way or at all. Also the file names were in Japanese and the guns were not the same at all. They had different designs and shapes and the grip that you hold are different colors! The needles also hurt like hell!</li>
            <li> Great bundle for beginning tattooist. You should include assemble manual or demo video to teach the basics though.</li>
            <li> I had my kit for almost a month now and it already stopped working .</li>
            <li> My machine went out and I haven&#x27;t had for two weeks</li>
            <li> Idk what happened to some other people&#x27;s package but mine just came in today and it came with everything shown in the picture and nothing&#x27;s broken or anything, I&#x27;ll come back and let everyone know if I have any problems</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy it for myself</li>
            <li> Its a great kit....my daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doesn&#x27;t even work at all</li>
