            <li>Having received this for review, I&#x27;m quite excited, and I intend to continue to use it!</li>
            <li>My review: Nice mild scent.</li>
            <li>It had a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li>It had a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li>Skin feels very nice and soft!</li>
            <li>and I have been really happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>Much isn&#x27;t needed so it is a good value for it&#x27;s size  </li>
            <li>so you can easily measure the amount of product to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a nice texture, and it seemed like a good value for the amount you get - one bottle lasted me a couple of months with daily use in the morning.</li>
            <li>and I use this to help with my pores and my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love that it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>Serums are also great because their thinner consistency makes them absorb more quickly into the different layers of your skin.</li>
            <li>Miracalis Anti-Aging serum will smooth out fine lines and wrinkles, promote collagen production and make your skin look supple and youthful.</li>
            <li>It is fast and effective and I can already see my fine lines and wrinkles softening.</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin and many products cause reactions with eye irritation, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;~ Feel during application: light, moisturizing cream</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C attacks the free radicals in your body and does some hardcore damage management.</li>
            <li>But it is important to note that a vitamin c serum cannot replace your sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I received free product for the purpose of a review.</li>
            <li>I ORDERED ONE OF THOSE THINGS ON TV THAT THEY SAY DR OZ SAID WAS FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>Promotes healing and helps fight free radical damage, meaning it helps fight the signs of aging&lt;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unscented, which is ok, but I actually prefer a mild pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C serums are rich in anti-oxidants that repair and renew the cells and give the skin a healthier look.</li>
            <li>So far, I really love this anti aging wrinkle cream!</li>
            <li>Nice airless pump, dispenses exactly how much you want with ease.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:</li>
            <li>The serum is more of a mix of serum and a lotion, really creamy</li>
            <li>You can read my full review on the blog:</li>
            <li>I have been using this Anti-Aging Serum on my skin for about 3 weeks and it looks much brighter and more hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I have tried and have given out many anti aging serums over the past year, and this one is in my top 3 for sure!</li>
            <li>This could be a good choice for someone young who wants to maintain their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it absorbs really quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li>It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product hoping for results right away.  </li>
            <li>Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for this product, but didn&#x27;t fall in love with it.</li>
            <li>so I use my normal moisturizer over the serum and my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching a good product for a long time.  </li>
            <li>My skin absorbed the serum, and made a room for moisturizer and a foundation, so it served like a primer.</li>
            <li>my skin has felt more soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>my skin has felt more soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My skin absorbed the serum right away and left a nice glow on my skin.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for about a month now and saw results right away.  </li>
            <li>This container arrived rapidly, and i tried it right away.</li>
            <li>I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li>As an Esthetician 90% of the clients I see in for facials on a daily basis say they are concerned with aging skin, so I always recommend a great anti-aging serum, so when I got the chance to try out the Miracalis Anti-Aging Facial Serum</li>
            <li>made it very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This product reminds me of Skin Ceutical Products I have used in the past with great success, but with a much lower price.</li>
            <li>Had the fine lines disappeared on a clean skin, the future would show.</li>
            <li>love that the company has 100% money back guarantee on their product as well.</li>
            <li>I definitely think this has helped me look healthy and rested</li>
            <li>Tried for a few days, it feels pretty good.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the serum has subtle pleasant scent, and the price is surprisingly low for this kind of products.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried this product.</li>
            <li>(Thanks for stealing, sis!)</li>
            <li>That is pretty</li>
            <li>Here it is, when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I use it first thing in the morning after a shower, then add the Neutrogena Sunscreen SPF 110 before going out in daylight.  </li>
            <li>THE PRODUCTS WERE BETTER QUALITY &amp; THE EXACT SAME SIZE</li>
            <li>They also offer a 100% money back guarantee, which shows they know you will love this serum!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They also offer a 100% money back guarantee, which shows they know you will love this serum!&lt;br</li>
            <li>In just a few days time, I loved the differance it made.  </li>
            <li>Pseudoalteromonas ferment extract, hydrolyzed wheat and soy proteins, peptides, and retinol are a nice bunch of skin care active ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have a friend who just started using Miracalis anti-aging facial serum recently and loved it, so when I had the chance to try it and review it</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have bought something like this that really showed results.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling plump and full of life, but leaves it feeling soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>My skin especially around my eye area has looked more firm, and overall my skin has a great glow about it.</li>
            <li>My skin especially around my eye area has looked more firm, and overall my skin has a great glow about it.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face super soft, too.</li>
            <li>My face soaked this up on the first application,  It left a smooth texture for applying makeup or just going without makeup.  </li>
            <li>After application my skin feels moisturized, soft, smooth and even a little more toned.  </li>
            <li>I break out with this cream and it hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and this has helped me so much.  </li>
            <li>My skin loves it so much.</li>
            <li>skin is responding really well to this, too.</li>
            <li>Since I purchased this as a preemptive measure, I have not noticed the reduction in winkles (as I didn&#x27;t really have any).</li>
            <li>It is gentle and I have not had any irritation or redness with this problem.</li>
            <li>AND THEY REALLY DO MAKE MY SKIN FEEL</li>
            <li>Its very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vitamin A: Gently exfoliates the skin, in turn fighting age spots, wrinkles, and sun damage</li>
            <li>So far I really love this facial serum,  </li>
            <li>also love putting all the vitamins onto my skin which a lot of other products don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m calling this my new miracle serum!  </li>
            <li>I have been mainly using it on my neck and decollete</li>
            <li>Been using the product for a couple days and really like it so far!</li>
            <li>The difference between a facial serum and a moisturizer is, a serum leaves out the oily or creamy ingredients that are involved in a moisturizer and focuses on driving highly active amazing ingredients into your skin.</li>
            <li>I used the lotion after washing with my normal face wash.</li>
            <li>I used the lotion after washing with my normal face wash.</li>
            <li>then I apply my moisturizer as normal.</li>
            <li>then I apply my moisturizer as normal.</li>
            <li>: Itâ€™s compatible with my very sensitive, redness-prone, oily skin.</li>
            <li>After 1 week of use, I started to notice the fine lines slowly less visible.  </li>
            <li>love the fact that when this container is used up, the extremely concentrated formula means that when I buy it again, and I will, that it will last me, if my calculations are correct, nearly a year.</li>
            <li>Have a 1 yr old and a new born&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t been getting sleep</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only Miracalis Anti-Aging Serum a few days but love the results so far!</li>
            <li>But overall, I couldn&#x27;t tell that this did much for my skin one way or another.</li>
            <li>Soft and silky-smooth, with no oily or sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel silky smooth and does seem to firm my skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using this product and see how far it will take me.  </li>
            <li>SOFT AND</li>
            <li>I gave this Miracalis Anti Wrinkle Facial serum to my sister to try and she reports that while she has not tried serums before she is really liking the effect.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I gave this Miracalis Anti Wrinkle Facial serum to my sister-in-law to try and she reports that while she is really liking the effect.</li>
            <li>The lotion itself does not have much of a scent to speak of and it absorbed in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way, so I think this might be a new favorite for me.</li>
            <li>and I have really noticed that the skin in my decollete area looks smoother and more taut and a few of my sun spots have are also less</li>
            <li>Once again, as an Esthetician, I will debunk a common misconception- you absolutely DO need to still apply a moisturizer after your serum has absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>If you cannot afford a face lift, use Miracalis to at least reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this to all my friends and people that are looking for something to help slow signs of aging on the skin or those that want to be proactive and find something to use before they start getting fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I cleanse my skin as normal, then I pat dry and apply the Miracalis Anti-Aging Serum to my face, neck, and decollete.</li>
            <li>I cleanse my skin as normal, then I pat dry and apply the Miracalis Anti-Aging Serum to my face, neck, and decollete.</li>
            <li>So far, my wife really likes it, and I even put a little on the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>you first apply the Miracalis, it looks a little like butter.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>* Slightly matte skin, with slight reduction in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and dry</li>

            <li> Having received this for review, I&#x27;m quite excited, and I intend to continue to use it!</li>
            <li> My review: Nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> It had a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> It had a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very nice and soft!</li>
            <li> and I have been really happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> Much isn&#x27;t needed so it is a good value for it&#x27;s size  </li>
            <li> so you can easily measure the amount of product to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a nice texture, and it seemed like a good value for the amount you get - one bottle lasted me a couple of months with daily use in the morning.</li>
            <li> and I use this to help with my pores and my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I love that it absorbs quickly</li>
            <li> Serums are also great because their thinner consistency makes them absorb more quickly into the different layers of your skin.</li>
            <li> Miracalis Anti-Aging serum will smooth out fine lines and wrinkles, promote collagen production and make your skin look supple and youthful.</li>
            <li> It is fast and effective and I can already see my fine lines and wrinkles softening.</li>
            <li> very sensitive skin and many products cause reactions with eye irritation, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> /&gt;~ Feel during application: light, moisturizing cream</li>

            <li> Vitamin C attacks the free radicals in your body and does some hardcore damage management.</li>
            <li> But it is important to note that a vitamin c serum cannot replace your sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I received free product for the purpose of a review.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED ONE OF THOSE THINGS ON TV THAT THEY SAY DR OZ SAID WAS FABULOUS.</li>
            <li> Promotes healing and helps fight free radical damage, meaning it helps fight the signs of aging&lt;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unscented, which is ok, but I actually prefer a mild pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serums are rich in anti-oxidants that repair and renew the cells and give the skin a healthier look.</li>
            <li> So far, I really love this anti aging wrinkle cream!</li>
            <li> Nice airless pump, dispenses exactly how much you want with ease.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:</li>
            <li> The serum is more of a mix of serum and a lotion, really creamy</li>
            <li> You can read my full review on the blog:</li>
            <li> I have been using this Anti-Aging Serum on my skin for about 3 weeks and it looks much brighter and more hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I have tried and have given out many anti aging serums over the past year, and this one is in my top 3 for sure!</li>
            <li> This could be a good choice for someone young who wants to maintain their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it absorbs really quickly into the skin.  </li>
            <li> It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product hoping for results right away.  </li>
            <li> Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for this product, but didn&#x27;t fall in love with it.</li>
            <li> so I use my normal moisturizer over the serum and my skin has never been better.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching a good product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> My skin absorbed the serum, and made a room for moisturizer and a foundation, so it served like a primer.</li>
            <li> my skin has felt more soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> my skin has felt more soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbed the serum right away and left a nice glow on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and saw results right away.  </li>
            <li> This container arrived rapidly, and i tried it right away.</li>
            <li> I had to try it right away.</li>
            <li> As an Esthetician 90% of the clients I see in for facials on a daily basis say they are concerned with aging skin, so I always recommend a great anti-aging serum, so when I got the chance to try out the Miracalis Anti-Aging Facial Serum</li>
            <li> made it very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This product reminds me of Skin Ceutical Products I have used in the past with great success, but with a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Had the fine lines disappeared on a clean skin, the future would show.</li>
            <li> love that the company has 100% money back guarantee on their product as well.</li>
            <li> I definitely think this has helped me look healthy and rested</li>
            <li> Tried for a few days, it feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the serum has subtle pleasant scent, and the price is surprisingly low for this kind of products.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product.</li>
            <li> (Thanks for stealing, sis!)</li>
            <li> That is pretty</li>
            <li> Here it is, when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I use it first thing in the morning after a shower, then add the Neutrogena Sunscreen SPF 110 before going out in daylight.  </li>
            <li> THE PRODUCTS WERE BETTER QUALITY &amp; THE EXACT SAME SIZE</li>
            <li> They also offer a 100% money back guarantee, which shows they know you will love this serum!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They also offer a 100% money back guarantee, which shows they know you will love this serum!&lt;br</li>
            <li> In just a few days time, I loved the differance it made.  </li>
            <li> Pseudoalteromonas ferment extract, hydrolyzed wheat and soy proteins, peptides, and retinol are a nice bunch of skin care active ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have a friend who just started using Miracalis anti-aging facial serum recently and loved it, so when I had the chance to try it and review it</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have bought something like this that really showed results.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling plump and full of life, but leaves it feeling soft and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> My skin especially around my eye area has looked more firm, and overall my skin has a great glow about it.</li>
            <li> My skin especially around my eye area has looked more firm, and overall my skin has a great glow about it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my face super soft, too.</li>
            <li> My face soaked this up on the first application,  It left a smooth texture for applying makeup or just going without makeup.  </li>
            <li> After application my skin feels moisturized, soft, smooth and even a little more toned.  </li>
            <li> I break out with this cream and it hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and this has helped me so much.  </li>
            <li> My skin loves it so much.</li>
            <li> skin is responding really well to this, too.</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this as a preemptive measure, I have not noticed the reduction in winkles (as I didn&#x27;t really have any).</li>
            <li> It is gentle and I have not had any irritation or redness with this problem.</li>
            <li> AND THEY REALLY DO MAKE MY SKIN FEEL</li>
            <li> Its very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vitamin A: Gently exfoliates the skin, in turn fighting age spots, wrinkles, and sun damage</li>
            <li> So far I really love this facial serum,  </li>
            <li> also love putting all the vitamins onto my skin which a lot of other products don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m calling this my new miracle serum!  </li>
            <li> I have been mainly using it on my neck and decollete</li>
            <li> Been using the product for a couple days and really like it so far!</li>
            <li> The difference between a facial serum and a moisturizer is, a serum leaves out the oily or creamy ingredients that are involved in a moisturizer and focuses on driving highly active amazing ingredients into your skin.</li>
            <li> I used the lotion after washing with my normal face wash.</li>
            <li> I used the lotion after washing with my normal face wash.</li>
            <li> then I apply my moisturizer as normal.</li>
            <li> then I apply my moisturizer as normal.</li>
            <li> : Itâ€™s compatible with my very sensitive, redness-prone, oily skin.</li>
            <li> After 1 week of use, I started to notice the fine lines slowly less visible.  </li>
            <li> love the fact that when this container is used up, the extremely concentrated formula means that when I buy it again, and I will, that it will last me, if my calculations are correct, nearly a year.</li>
            <li> Have a 1 yr old and a new born&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t been getting sleep</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only Miracalis Anti-Aging Serum a few days but love the results so far!</li>
            <li> But overall, I couldn&#x27;t tell that this did much for my skin one way or another.</li>
            <li> Soft and silky-smooth, with no oily or sticky residue.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel silky smooth and does seem to firm my skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using this product and see how far it will take me.  </li>
            <li> SOFT AND</li>
            <li> I gave this Miracalis Anti Wrinkle Facial serum to my sister to try and she reports that while she has not tried serums before she is really liking the effect.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I gave this Miracalis Anti Wrinkle Facial serum to my sister-in-law to try and she reports that while she is really liking the effect.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself does not have much of a scent to speak of and it absorbed in a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so I think this might be a new favorite for me.</li>
            <li> and I have really noticed that the skin in my decollete area looks smoother and more taut and a few of my sun spots have are also less</li>
            <li> Once again, as an Esthetician, I will debunk a common misconception- you absolutely DO need to still apply a moisturizer after your serum has absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> If you cannot afford a face lift, use Miracalis to at least reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend this to all my friends and people that are looking for something to help slow signs of aging on the skin or those that want to be proactive and find something to use before they start getting fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cleanse my skin as normal, then I pat dry and apply the Miracalis Anti-Aging Serum to my face, neck, and decollete.</li>
            <li> I cleanse my skin as normal, then I pat dry and apply the Miracalis Anti-Aging Serum to my face, neck, and decollete.</li>
            <li> So far, my wife really likes it, and I even put a little on the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> you first apply the Miracalis, it looks a little like butter.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> * Slightly matte skin, with slight reduction in fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and dry</li>
            <li> I feel very soft, clear skin is still very little time to see results; the seguire using and writing within 28 days again.</li>
            <li> It looks brighter, firmer, tighter, and less old in general.</li>
            <li> Facial lines were visibly diminished, due to proper application.</li>
            <li> Well, with the miracalis, 1 tiny, tiny pump is enough to do half of my face.</li>
            <li> With the Serum one pump of it is all you need as it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 47 years old and have a few flare ups every now and then.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since the 8 of oct and my flare up have been few and far between.</li>
            <li> I work long hours, and sometime I get the &#x27;sunken&#x27; under my eye effect.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is odorless and sinks deeply into your skin leaving it softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The really helps those that are looking for a product that will help slow the signs of aging effecting their skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference in my skin but nothing major.</li>
            <li> Women stay out of Sun while you are young, and your skin will be less lined and aged.</li>
            <li> If you have any acne scars left from your previous breakout, youâ€™ll find them fading with regular application.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in April (on sale for $12) when I ran out of my other daily serum.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin</li>
            <li> I will say however that I have combination type skin of dry and oily</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Anti-Aging Serum:&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin, and since I have been using this serum I have noticed</li>
            <li> Anti-Aging Serum:&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin, and since I have been using this serum I have noticed</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this serum was not looking or feeling like usual light oil, rather like a thin whitish lotion.</li>
            <li> Less than a minute later after it warmed to the skin, melted and was rubbed in by me.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a month and am seeing a difference in less deep forehead wrinkles and skin.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL WITH THE PEOPLE THAT SEND YOU THOSE SAMPLES.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> use it with other anti-aging serums</li>
            <li> Did not see a visible as other reviews claimed.  </li>
            <li> I chose this product after researching some other anti-aging type products.</li>
            <li> With this serum, a little bit goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> THEN THE OTHER STUFF FROM DR OZ.</li>
            <li> Product was not worth buying.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to be making a difference but not quite as gargantuan as some of the reviews I have read in the past.</li>
            <li> It was delivered as promised, small jar but a little does go a long way.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum stimulates the synthesis of collagen in the skin which will give you a tighter, firmer and less sagged feel.</li>
            <li> AND THEY WERE LESS MONEY.</li>
            <li> AND  THEY COST LESS</li>
            <li> Needless to say, this particular serum doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my hands, or on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2/3 of the container but have stopped because it makes my skin feel uncomfortably tight and a bit itchy--</li>
            <li> When you hit 40, those annoying fine lines under your eyes start to show.  </li>
            <li> I can also feel the firming a few minutes after I out it in.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I let that sink in for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I let that sink in for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I have had some slight redness lately and it seems to help with that.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have only used this for a couple of days, I like the way it makes my skin feel, I will comment later on whether it does anything for the wrinkles and firmness. It was delivered as promised, small jar but a little does go a long way.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have a friend who just started using Miracalis anti-aging facial serum recently and loved it, so when I had the chance to try it and review it I jumped at the chance. With the Serum one pump of it is all you need as it goes a long way. It leaves the skin feeling plump and full of life, but leaves it feeling soft and not greasy at all. The really helps those that are looking for a product that will help slow the signs of aging effecting their skin. It really does work great and I would recommend this to all my friends and people that are looking for something to help slow signs of aging on the skin or those that want to be proactive and find something to use before they start getting fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that the company has 100% money back guarantee on their product as well.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any change on my skin whatsoever</li>
            <li> My review: Nice mild scent. My skin seems firmer and brighter although my 28 days is not up yet. Leaves my face super soft, too. I have had some slight redness lately and it seems to help with that. Good deal.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. It has definitely made my skin smoother and softer. I love that it absorbs quickly and I like the thinner consistency. It applies very easily.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin oily or greasy either. I love using this on my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, I really love this anti aging wrinkle cream! It is fast and effective and I can already see my fine lines and wrinkles softening. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Now I have the serum in my possession, I&#x27;ve just using it two days. I feel very soft, clear skin is still very little time to see results; the seguire using and writing within 28 days again.</li>
            <li> This product reminds me of Skin Ceutical Products I have used in the past with great success, but with a much lower price. After 2 weeks, I do see a decrease in lines, I hope to see more! A little bit goes a long way, so I think this might be a new favorite for me.</li>
            <li> This serum is great.  I am almost finished with my 2nd bottle.  I can&#x27;t speak for wrinkle reduction because I don&#x27;t have any although I do have &amp;#34;mature skin&amp;#34;.  Immediately  I noticed it smoothed out the texture of my skin... made it very soft and smooth.  I can also feel the firming a few minutes after I out it in.  My skin is sensitive and dry so I use my normal moisturizer over the serum and my skin has never been better.  I will continue to use this serum.</li>
            <li> Very light feel. Definitely makes my skin look younger and softer. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> use it with other anti-aging serums</li>
            <li> I break out with this cream and it hasn&#x27;t really done anything for me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in April (on sale for $12) when I ran out of my other daily serum. Based on the reviews, I had high hopes for this product, but didn&#x27;t fall in love with it. It has a nice texture, and it seemed like a good value for the amount you get - one bottle lasted me a couple of months with daily use in the morning. It&#x27;s unscented, which is ok, but I actually prefer a mild pleasant scent. Others don&#x27;t, so do what works best for you. But overall, I couldn&#x27;t tell that this did much for my skin one way or another. I may purchase it again if I don&#x27;t find something I like better, but I&#x27;m not rushing to buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 . Have a 1 yr old and a new born&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t been getting sleep and it was starting to show. I definitely think this has helped me look healthy and rested</li>
            <li> Product was not worth buying.  Did not see a visible as other reviews claimed.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Good serum, I like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a month now and saw results right away.  I would buy again but will still look for something better.&lt;br /&gt;It changes the look of your skin to a point but seems to stop working after using for awhile just maintains same effect does not continue to&lt;br /&gt;improve the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference in my skin but nothing major. I will probably order again if the sample I&#x27;m using now doesn&#x27;t pan out.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very nice and soft!</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? I&#x27;m a regular tester, so I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance (does it smell good? Are there artificial fragrances?): Odorless&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: light, moisturizing cream&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Soft and silky-smooth, with no oily or sticky residue. Very pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Itâ€™s compatible with my very sensitive, redness-prone, oily skin. The fact that itâ€™s a cream and not a gel base suggests it for dry and normal skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: I canâ€™t seem to find out.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: Nice airless pump, dispenses exactly how much you want with ease.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Slightly matte skin, with slight reduction in fine wrinkles. The matte effect is a blessing to the oily-skinned among us. Good makeup primer.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Pseudoalteromonas ferment extract, hydrolyzed wheat and soy proteins, peptides, and retinol are a nice bunch of skin care active ingredients. Itâ€™s not going to be any miracle, but quite good for your skin. This could be a good choice for someone young who wants to maintain their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> silky smooth, works wonderfully with my skin regimen</li>
            <li> Tried for a few days, it feels pretty good.</li>
            <li> There are no miracle serums!  This is a good product, and vitamin C does help!  Women stay out of Sun while you are young, and your skin will be less lined and aged.</li>
            <li> This container arrived rapidly, and i tried it right away. The size of a bottle is a usual one, with dispenser. Since serums had become a part of my daily skin treatment routine, i used to exercise the different brands. To my surprise, this serum was not looking or feeling like usual light oil, rather like a thin whitish lotion. Needless to say, this particular serum doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on my hands, or on my face. My skin absorbed the serum, and made a room for moisturizer and a foundation, so it served like a primer. Facial lines were visibly diminished, due to proper application. I applied the lotion again at night, under my night cream. Had the fine lines disappeared on a clean skin, the future would show. Additionally, the serum has subtle pleasant scent, and the price is surprisingly low for this kind of products.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I have really dry skin and this has helped me so much.  I have a healthy glow about me as well.  I will definitely purchase over and over.</li>
            <li> My wife was wanting a facial lotion that helped with wrinkles around her eyes. I chose this product after researching some other anti-aging type products. I chose this one for a few reasons, and I really like their customer support and satisfaction guarantee. So far, my wife really likes it, and I even put a little on the bags under my eyes. I can&#x27;t say for sure, since the 28 days aren&#x27;t up, but it seems to be working. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Feels nice on your skin.</li>
            <li> The bottle was attractive, despite a large sticker on the side. I used the lotion after washing with my normal face wash. It had a nice mild scent. I have sensitive skin and I had no adverse reactions. I was pleasantly surprised. It made my skin softer and moisturized well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried this product. It does seem to be making a difference but not quite as gargantuan as some of the reviews I have read in the past. I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I like your product. Makes your kin feel refreshed</li>
            <li> The cream comes in an adorable container which utilizes a pump to access the anti-aging serum.  I was excited to try this product hoping for results right away.  After my regular routine of washing my face I used about 2-3 pumps which I found ample enough to cover my facial skin and neck.  The lotion itself does not have much of a scent to speak of and it absorbed in a few minutes.  I did notice that my skin seemed tighter and firmer after it soaked in.  I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens at the end of 28 days of continued use.  Much isn&#x27;t needed so it is a good value for it&#x27;s size  *product was received for my 100% honest opinion.  I incorporate products into my day to day life and give my opinion only after I have checked it out for myself!</li>
            <li> Miracalis sent me the serum to test out for them for my blog, GlamRiver and I have been really happy with the results so far.  The serum is more of a mix of serum and a lotion, really creamy and it absorbs really quickly into the skin.  After application my skin feels moisturized, soft, smooth and even a little more toned.  I have been mainly using it on my neck and decollete and I have really noticed that the skin in my decollete area looks smoother and more taut and a few of my sun spots have are also less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;The Miracalis Anti-Aging Facial Serum is great choice if you are looking for a anti-aging serum that works!</li>
            <li> Having AwEsOmE results with the disappearance of my fine lines!!!!!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serums are rich in anti-oxidants that repair and renew the cells and give the skin a healthier look. Helps produce collagen â€“ Collagen binds the cells of our body. Vitamin C serum stimulates the synthesis of collagen in the skin which will give you a tighter, firmer and less sagged feel. It is a good first-step solution to treat the onset of wrinkles.Restores and regenerates â€“ Vitamin C attacks the free radicals in your body and does some hardcore damage management. If you have any acne scars left from your previous breakout, youâ€™ll find them fading with regular application. Protects you from the sun â€“ Getting overexposed to the sun can cause hyperpigmentation and sun spotting. A vitamin C serum will counteract any harmful effect of the sun and also decrease the chances of skin cancer by thickening the dermis layer. But it is important to note that a vitamin c serum cannot replace your sunscreen. The above copied from another site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 47 years old and have a few flare ups every now and then. I also have redness on my cheeks. I have been using this since the 8 of oct and my flare up have been few and far between. My redness on my cheeks has cleared up somewhat. They are not as red as they was when I started. My skin seems smoother and brighter since I have been using this. I am highly impressed with this serum. I would recommend this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
            <li> I got this anti-aging serum and I was in love immediately. It feels so good. It looks so good. My skin loves it so much. This stuff is amazing. My skin soaks it up. Seriously, it does. A little goes a long way. I am a pump-a-holic. I love to pump things into my hands. Lotion? Yes, please. Oh, no! Now I need 3 friends to give extra lotion to! Well, with the miracalis, 1 tiny, tiny pump is enough to do half of my face. More than 2 squirts and I am wasting it.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is responding really well to this, too. It looks brighter, firmer, tighter, and less old in general. I will take that.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that when this container is used up, the extremely concentrated formula means that when I buy it again, and I will, that it will last me, if my calculations are correct, nearly a year. I can deal with that.&lt;br /&gt;My sister stole a couple of pumps when she was over for a visit because I mentioned it to her on the phone. She told me that she used it because we had talked about it and that she wanted to try it after she saw me because my skin looked so nice. (Thanks for stealing, sis!) She said that when she saw me, my skin looked newer and younger. That is pretty awesome!&lt;br /&gt;When you first apply the Miracalis, it looks a little like butter.&lt;br /&gt;Like butter, it warms to the skin and soaks in. Here it is, when I first applied it. Less than a minute later after it warmed to the skin, melted and was rubbed in by me. Pretty Amazing! I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, gives your skin soft and bright look without the impression you are using some anti-aging product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This serum makes my skin feel nice and hydrated! The product does not ball up and instead absorbs nicely. Having received this for review, I&#x27;m quite excited, and I intend to continue to use it!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. Been using the product for a couple days and really like it so far! I have very sensitive skin and many products cause reactions with eye irritation, but so far so good! I&#x27;ll be looking for an eye product in this line next.</li>
            <li> So far I really love this facial serum,  It makes my skin feel silky smooth and does seem to firm my skin.  Really fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Since I purchased this as a preemptive measure, I have not noticed the reduction in winkles (as I didn&#x27;t really have any). I will say however that I have combination type skin of dry and oily and I had no problems using this product. I have not had any breakouts and I think my skin looks very smooth and beautiful. I&#x27;m using this product in combination with the moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This serum arrived rapidly. I had to try it right away. The size is a great size. The serum did not feel greasy on my hands and/or face. A lot of serums leave a greasy feel on your skin and make it difficult to apply your makeup. My skin absorbed the serum right away and left a nice glow on my skin. The appearance of facial lines were diminished.</li>
            <li> When you hit 40, those annoying fine lines under your eyes start to show.  I&#x27;ve been searching a good product for a long time.  After 1 week of use, I started to notice the fine lines slowly less visible.  I&#x27;ll continue using this product and see how far it will take me.  as of now, I&#x27;m a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Customer Satisfaction means the world to me.  When I ordered this, I had impeccable timing and friendly customer service answering questions I had about the product.  With this serum, a little bit goes a long way!  In just a few days time, I loved the differance it made.  I work long hours, and sometime I get the &#x27;sunken&#x27; under my eye effect.  I&#x27;m calling this my new miracle serum!  Thank you Miracalis!  You can read my full review on the blog:[...]</li>
            <li> This is a great product, goes on smooth and is not oily.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realy see any results</li>
            <li> I have tried and have given out many anti aging serums over the past year, and this one is in my top 3 for sure! The formula is moisturizing and so lovely. i&#x27;m 22 and I use this to help with my pores and my fine lines around my eyes. i recommend this for anyone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*i received this item for review, but all thoughts and opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I like that Miracalis has a pump dispenser serum so you can easily measure the amount of product to use.&lt;br /&gt;It is odorless and sinks deeply into your skin leaving it softer and smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love putting all the vitamins onto my skin which a lot of other products don&#x27;t have. It is gentle and I have not had any irritation or redness with this problem. I&#x27;ve only Miracalis Anti-Aging Serum a few days but love the results so far! I received free product for the purpose of a review.</li>
            <li> Goes on so smooth!  My face soaked this up on the first application,  It left a smooth texture for applying makeup or just going without makeup.  Miracalis products are the best!  Thank You!!!!!</li>
            <li> I Love it!  I use it first thing in the morning after a shower, then add the Neutrogena Sunscreen SPF 110 before going out in daylight.  Thank you: Brittania.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED ONE OF THOSE THINGS ON TV THAT THEY SAY DR OZ SAID WAS FABULOUS. I BOUGHT SAMPLES AND THEN GOT BILLED FOR THEM 2 WEEKS LATER. THE SERUM WAS GREAT AND THEY BILLED ME AGAIN AND DID NOT SEND OUT THE PRODUCTS THEY SAID THEY WERE BACKORDERED. BUT I SHOULD PAY FOR THEM.  MY BANK AND I CALLED THEM AND I AM GETTING A CREDIT, THEY LOOKED LIKE THESE BUT THESE ARE BETTER. . AND THEY WERE LESS MONEY. BE CAREFUL WITH THE PEOPLE THAT SEND YOU THOSE SAMPLES. I HAD TO FILE A DISPUTE. I ORDERED TWO TO MAKE SURE I WOULD NOT RUN OUT AS EVIDENCED BY EVERYTHING ELSE I BOUGHT. I LOVE AMAZON THEY HAVE EVERYTHING.AND I  TRUST AMAZON BUT NOT EVERYONE IS HONEST. I ORDERED THIS WITH THE CREAM AND EYE CREAM AND THE SPRITZ AND IT WORKS BETTER THEN THE OTHER STUFF FROM DR OZ. I BET HE DOES NOT KNOW THEY ARE USING HIS NAME. I BOUGHT 4 ITEMS 2 OR THEM X 2.  ALL OF IT X 2 - THE CREAM, SERUM, SPRITZ AND EYE CREAM. IS GREAT AND HAS HELPED MY SKING WITH STRESS LINES AND WHEN I DO NOT SLEEP WELL.  THE PRODUCTS WERE BETTER QUALITY &amp; THE EXACT SAME SIZE AND  THEY COST LESS AND THEY REALLY DO MAKE MY SKIN FEEL SOFT AND THOSE WONDERFUL LINES OF WISDOM SOMEHOW MANGE TO GO AWAY. I LOVE IT !</li>
            <li> I like this anti-wrinkle serum.  I think it has helped! It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  If you cannot afford a face lift, use Miracalis to at least reduce fine lines.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2/3 of the container but have stopped because it makes my skin feel uncomfortably tight and a bit itchy--even tried skipping a day while using it and got the same results.  Would like to get a refund to my account please.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product:):) my friend recommended it and I do not regret it:)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any results.  I purchase less expensive serum and it worked better for my skin.</li>
            <li> I gave this Miracalis Anti Wrinkle Facial serum to my sister to try and she reports that while she has not tried serums before she is really liking the effect.  She is applying it after her evening shower letting it sink in then applying the Best retinol night cream I also gave her.  She said her skin feels hydrated and that it feels smoother like the pores are smaller. She has not experienced any redness or other problems at this time.</li>

            <li> Definitely will buy this again. I have been using for a month and am seeing a difference in less deep forehead wrinkles and skin.</li>
            <li> Ive received this product for review its a great face product. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry. Its very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> These days everyone is concerned with how to prevent the signs of aging effecting their skin. As an Esthetician 90% of the clients I see in for facials on a daily basis say they are concerned with aging skin, so I always recommend a great anti-aging serum, so when I got the chance to try out the Miracalis Anti-Aging Facial Serum I was really skeptical since there are so many on the market. I have been using this Anti-Aging Serum on my skin for about 3 weeks and it looks much brighter and more hydrated!&lt;br /&gt;What is a serum and why do you need one?&lt;br /&gt;A facial serum is essentially a concentrated jar of goodness for your skin! The difference between a facial serum and a moisturizer is, a serum leaves out the oily or creamy ingredients that are involved in a moisturizer and focuses on driving highly active amazing ingredients into your skin. Think of a facial serum as a treatment instead of a moisturizer. Serums are also great because their thinner consistency makes them absorb more quickly into the different layers of your skin. Once again, as an Esthetician, I will debunk a common misconception- you absolutely DO need to still apply a moisturizer after your serum has absorbed into your skin.&lt;br /&gt;What Ingredients are in the Miracalis Anti-Aging Moisturizer and what are their benefits?&lt;br /&gt;D-Panthenol: Reduces inflammation and helps promote wound healing, it also helps restore the outer most layers of the skin. D-Panthenol is also great at hydrating the skin by reducing transepidermal water loss (dehydration of the skin)&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E: Promotes healing and helps fight free radical damage, meaning it helps fight the signs of aging&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A: Gently exfoliates the skin, in turn fighting age spots, wrinkles, and sun damage&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil: The best moisturizer your skin can get, Jojoba oil most closely resembles your skin&#x27;s own natural sebum. This oil is non-comedogenic (it won&#x27;t clog your pores &amp; make you break out!)&lt;br /&gt;The Miracalis Anti-Aging serum will smooth out fine lines and wrinkles, promote collagen production and make your skin look supple and youthful. In a clinical study 95% of volunteers saw increased suppleness in their skin in 28 days! They also offer a 100% money back guarantee, which shows they know you will love this serum!&lt;br /&gt;My experience using Miracalis Anti-Aging Serum:&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely dry skin, and since I have been using this serum I have noticed my skin has felt more soft and hydrated. I cleanse my skin as normal, then I pat dry and apply the Miracalis Anti-Aging Serum to my face, neck, and decollete. I let that sink in for a few minutes then I apply my moisturizer as normal. My skin especially around my eye area has looked more firm, and overall my skin has a great glow about it.
