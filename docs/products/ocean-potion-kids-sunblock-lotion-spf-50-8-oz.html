            <li>Great sun protection, no irritating scent.  </li>
            <li>Love that it is made in Cocoa Beach, FL.</li>
            <li>Love love Ocean Potion, it does not stain, absorbs easily and most importantly, it works!  </li>
            <li>It also smells great unlike most sunscreens and is low toxicity and the fact that it had Vitamin D3 for skin care is a bonus!</li>
            <li>and it is fine for my body on non-acne prone areas.  </li>
            <li>it is Oxybenzone free.  </li>
            <li>Was trying to buy cruelty free and not animal tested products</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and quickly and disappears.  </li>
            <li>Love this lotion, it goes on so easily, not thick, greasy, or sticky.</li>
            <li>It gets around 100 degrees F pretty regularly in the summertime, with a blazing bright sun.  </li>
            <li>We now use it on our entire family and can entrust a safe beach trip where everyone smells Ocean Potion yummy!</li>
            <li>The kids love that this is easy to rub in and does not leave them looking white.  </li>
            <li>much better for my kids than other with more chemicals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Ocean Potion in the past and had great results with sun protection.</li>
            <li>This sunblock has a pleasant scent, it goes on easily and absorbs smoothly leaving no white residue or excessive oil/grease on my skin.  </li>
            <li>and I still got a little burnt, but it does smell good and work on shorter occasions</li>
            <li>We first discovered this item at the Honolulu zoo.</li>
            <li>Wish I could find in local stores, but will continue to buy:)</li>
            <li>I purchased some different brands in the past, but this is the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I stopped trying to get tan a long time ago and now make sure that my skin is protected from the sun.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen has a great scent that my kids like enough to make using it less of a chore.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;s a real world example.  </li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen for my kids.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much cheaper it is here than the store..</li>
            <li>I really like this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>One of them has more sensitive skin with history of eczema and ended up with a mild red, dry rash on his cheeks after about a week of use, so we cannot use this on his face anymore.  </li>
            <li>The other one is just fine.  </li>
            <li>skin is very sensitive as well and extremely acne prone to almost all sunscreens (usually I am okay with Vanicream Sensitive, and EltaMD UV Clear which has micronized zinc).  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other sun blocks that are natural that cost $$$, and they all leave white residue or do not absorb well.  </li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve used many OP sunscreens in the past with no negative results, I would not recommend this sunscreen to others - especially children.</li>
            <li>Works really well, no tans or burns when kids use it properly.</li>
            <li>While this did protect me against sunburns, my entire body broke out in a super itchy rash on the 3rd day and only subsided when I switched to another brand.</li>
            <li>This specific sunscreen was toted as being sensitive for children and not containing oxybenzone.</li>
            <li>Protects extremely well, and is indeed very water resistant.  </li>
            <li>We recently went to Hawaii and used this daily on myself and my 7 year old.  </li>
            <li>As to efficacy, I have not noticed any particular burning or tanning after using this product but we tend to stay in the shade and cover up with long sleeves when the kids play outside (though they are outside about 3 hours a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Texture is just perfect!  Not too oily, not too think.  Perfectly glides onto my kids&#x27; skin and smells great!  discovered this in Jamaica and now only order this!</li>
            <li> We love Ocean Potion!  Protects extremely well, and is indeed very water resistant.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, and is very easy on the skin.  The fact it lacks all the harmful chemicals like parabens is of course a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s a real world example.  We&#x27;re currently living in Greece for a few years.  It gets around 100 degrees F pretty regularly in the summertime, with a blazing bright sun.  We used Ocean Potion all summer at the beach, and -- no burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is not a testimonial to this product&#x27;s effectiveness, I don&#x27;t know what is.</li>
            <li> Our kids loves it. We first discovered this item at the Honolulu zoo.</li>
            <li> The kids love that this is easy to rub in and does not leave them looking white.  I love that it does not have parabens or oxybenzone.</li>
            <li> Tgua brand is my favorite brand of sunblock. It smells great! I can&#x27;t find it in my area so I order bit online. It&#x27;s that great! We never burn with it.</li>
            <li> Great sun protection, no irritating scent.  Very good value for your money!</li>
            <li> I found this to be a good sunscreen for my children.  It does need to be reapplied often if they are in and out of the water.  I like it is Oxybenzone free.  It goes on well, and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen for my kids. It absorbs well and and has been good at protecting their skin from the sun. It is also rated a 3 on Environmental Working Group for low toxicity. I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> Our favorite sunblock! Goes on smooth, smells great, and never had a sunburn while using.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much cheaper it is here than the store.. It&#x27;s half the price and it smells so yummy!</li>
            <li> I have twins.  One of them has more sensitive skin with history of eczema and ended up with a mild red, dry rash on his cheeks after about a week of use, so we cannot use this on his face anymore.  The other one is just fine.  There is a nice fragrance to this product and it spreads easily.  As to efficacy, I have not noticed any particular burning or tanning after using this product but we tend to stay in the shade and cover up with long sleeves when the kids play outside (though they are outside about 3 hours a day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very sensitive as well and extremely acne prone to almost all sunscreens (usually I am okay with Vanicream Sensitive, and EltaMD UV Clear which has micronized zinc).  I used this on myself as well and it is fine for my body on non-acne prone areas.  I would not use it for acne prone areas.  I did have some breakouts on my chest and chin after usage, though nowhere as bad as with other brands.</li>
            <li> My family uses this when my sons have swim lessons.  It&#x27;s easy to apply, not greasy, and smells great.  My sons like it too!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this sunscreen. Love that it is made in Cocoa Beach, FL. Goes on feeling dry not greasy and lasts. Pleasant smell too.</li>
            <li> Love love Ocean Potion, it does not stain, absorbs easily and most importantly, it works!  Home run!</li>
            <li> Love the way the lotion smells! Wish I could find in local stores, but will continue to buy:)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best sunscreen out there. Very easy to spread. It doesn&#x27;t leave white marks. Very light scent. I use it for both my kid and me.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it works great too!</li>
            <li> I really like this sunscreen. I purchased some different brands in the past, but this is the best in my opinion.</li>
            <li> We had to make an emergency run while at the beach after our youngest child had a severe and scary reaction to the sunscreen that we had used on her (Banana Boat).  Her reaction was so bad that we had to give her oral steroids to clear it up.  After doing some research on the internet we found some key ingredients in sunscreen that often triggered these reactions and then went on a store run in search of a sunscreen without them.  We lucked up in finding this Ocean Potion and have used it since that trip 2 years ago with no reactions whatsoever.  We now use it on our entire family and can entrust a safe beach trip where everyone smells Ocean Potion yummy!</li>
            <li> I applied this twice over 3 hours of being in the sun and I still got a little burnt, but it does smell good and work on shorter occasions</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rated 3 on Ewg website for safety with 1 being the safest and 7 the worst.  It goes on smoothly and quickly and disappears.  Smells good.  Doesn&#x27;t make anyone cry.</li>
            <li> did not work on my child or mine face got all burned up. Was trying to buy cruelty free and not animal tested products so I went with this. Have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> great sun screen! much better for my kids than other with more chemicals. goes on well without being too thick or greasy. has a great smell too!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen has a great scent that my kids like enough to make using it less of a chore.  We have experienced great sunburn protection with this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Bought this sunscreen for my kids and I absolutely love it! It is the perfect consistency and rubbed in easily. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily at all! It also smells great unlike most sunscreens and is low toxicity and the fact that it had Vitamin D3 for skin care is a bonus! I will also be looking into Ocean potion for adults because I read it has anti-aging benefits as well as protection from the sun! Great brand and I will only use this from now on!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Ocean Potion in the past and had great results with sun protection. I ordered multiple tubes of the OP Kid&#x27;s sunblock for a recent trip, thinking that I&#x27;d find those same results. While this did protect me against sunburns, my entire body broke out in a super itchy rash on the 3rd day and only subsided when I switched to another brand. This specific sunscreen was toted as being sensitive for children and not containing oxybenzone. Since I&#x27;ve used many OP sunscreens in the past with no negative results, I would not recommend this sunscreen to others - especially children. Go forward, I&#x27;ll stick with my usual OP sunscreen!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion, it goes on so easily, not thick, greasy, or sticky. Works really well, no tans or burns when kids use it properly.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sunscreen!! I am so cautious of the kind of sunscreen my kids wear. I discovered this at the STL Zoo when I forgot to bring sunscreen earlier this summer. I love the fresh scent and feel confident that I am not slathering my kids up with a cancer causing product that will prevent them from getting cancer!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this sunblock.  I have very fair skin--in fact, I seem to glow!  I stopped trying to get tan a long time ago and now make sure that my skin is protected from the sun.  This sunblock has a pleasant scent, it goes on easily and absorbs smoothly leaving no white residue or excessive oil/grease on my skin.  We recently went to Hawaii and used this daily on myself and my 7 year old.  We did not burn at all.  The price of this product is great, and more importantly the EWG rating is a 3.  I have tried many other sun blocks that are natural that cost $$$, and they all leave white residue or do not absorb well.  I am very happy with this!</li>
