            <li>They arrived quickly, they are good quality</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  </li>
            <li>I will probably buy more of these.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and nice weight.</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>and I enjoy wearing them.</li>
            <li>but overall i am happy with it.</li>
            <li>I love this bracelet so much that I just bought the rest of them!</li>
            <li>I recharge it every now and then by setting it in the full moon&#x27;s light and sending it rieki energy.</li>
            <li>Love my karma bracelets, very stylish, light, been wearing it every single day.</li>
            <li>I liked it enough that I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the quality, as this is essentially a novelty bracelet in terms of the materials it is made with, and those aren&#x27;t known for lasting.</li>
            <li>Very pretty and well made.</li>
            <li>They are just pretty and goes all I wear!</li>
            <li>Well made and pretty bracelet</li>
            <li>Very nice bracelet not too big not too tight</li>
            <li>the photo shows the bead color as a little more darker then they are.</li>
            <li>I might  just have to place another order for  one and hopefully that one is in new condition</li>
            <li>So as far as working I have not seen any thing significant except the first few days when wearing it my wrist did tingle for a while.</li>
            <li>It was a bit big but pretty</li>
            <li>So far this product has held together.</li>
            <li>Also, this bracelet is not to big for me, and I love the colors blends in with my everyday clothes.</li>
            <li>The lovely symbols on the wooden beads are starting to wear down and become more faint, but the flexible band has neither snapped nor shot, and none of the beads have chipped or become discolored.</li>
            <li>It has held up quite well to near daily wearing over a period of months.</li>
            <li>I like this brand very much and owe a few of these different karma beads.</li>

            <li> This is going to sound crazy, but the minute I put this bracelet on my wrist, I got this weird feeling go throughout my arm and the inside of my body. I&#x27;m not sure if I am just over thinking this bracelet or something unexpected is about to happen. I love this bracelet so much that I just bought the rest of them! Hopefully good luck and miracles is coming my way. Also, this bracelet is not to big for me, and I love the colors blends in with my everyday clothes.</li>
            <li> Zorbitz has lovely beads!  They are just pretty and goes all I wear!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! Will shop again</li>
            <li> brings me great luck.  I lost it for two weeks and things stopped going my way.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it.  things have been looking up ever since.  I recharge it every now and then by setting it in the full moon&#x27;s light and sending it rieki energy.</li>
            <li> Very nice bracelet not too big not too tight just perfect... Hopefully i get some miracles my way soon... Thx again ðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> So far this product has held together. I wear different beads daily so it needs to with stand going to work and moving around a lot. These \\&quot;karma\\&quot; beads bring attention to themselves. I like this brand very much and owe a few of these different karma beads.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for someone who was going through a hard time. I found out it broken within two months. How embarrassing. I wish I hadn&#x27;t bought this for them.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and nice weight. I liked it enough that I ordered 2 more.</li>
            <li> Bracelet got here very fast and its very good quality! It looks perfect and the material is divine!</li>
            <li> Well made and pretty bracelet</li>
            <li> It broke an hour after I put it on.  I&#x27;m still picking up beads from the floor.</li>
            <li> Love my karma bracelets, very stylish, light, been wearing it every single day. Got one unexpected miracles and protection and balance for myself and for my best friend as a birthday gift.</li>
            <li> This is a bracelet made with beads of wood and semi-precious stone on a flexible band. It has held up quite well to near daily wearing over a period of months. The lovely symbols on the wooden beads are starting to wear down and become more faint, but the flexible band has neither snapped nor shot, and none of the beads have chipped or become discolored. I&#x27;m impressed with the quality, as this is essentially a novelty bracelet in terms of the materials it is made with, and those aren&#x27;t known for lasting. I will probably buy more of these.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly! I bought one for myself and one for a friend. I wear it everyday! Great product!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the bracelets that I purchased from Zorbitz.  They arrived quickly, they are good quality and I enjoy wearing them.</li>
            <li> These are nicely crafted I own two now this one and Luck I wear them both to help my Karma. I try to practice mantras daily and remove negative Karma. Won several lottery scratchers waiting on the BIG ONE so I can help self others and family. Will happen SOON within a 3 months I predict.</li>
            <li> Some of the jade from the bracelet was cracked.So as far as working I have not seen any thing significant except the first few days when wearing it my wrist did tingle for a while.I might  just have to place another order for  one and hopefully that one is in new condition and I will take from there.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made.</li>
            <li> It was a bit big but pretty and I just expect to see a luck atmosphere surrounding.</li>
            <li> beautiful. the photo shows the bead color as a little more darker then they are. and on the wooden beads some of the symbols you can&#x27;t see. but overall i am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Bracelet is beautiful. Service was excellent</li>
            <li> Broke a day after I got it</li>
