            <li>I really loved it</li>
            <li>My daughter who is extremely fair found out about this product through a youtube video.</li>

            <li>My fair skin is a combination type</li>
            <li>The product smells great and has a nice texture.</li>

            <li>It is soooo cute!  </li>
            <li>Really loved it and gonna buy more</li>
            <li>but it was not as nice.  </li>
            <li>It turns matte when it dries, effectively controlling sebum levels.&lt;br /&gt;-my</li>
            <li>/&gt;and is nice with my Revlon powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>really liked the packaging.</li>
            <li>It almost sounded too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite BB cream.  </li>
            <li>My favorite makeup.</li>
            <li>its cute being in a jello-mold like glass container.</li>
            <li>I hope that they make more color shades that can work for all skin colors.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging, color, design, adorable.</li>
            <li>I read many of the reviews, before ordering this.  </li>
            <li>Im in love.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product so cheap and receive this product very quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-the product goes on so smoothly and blends into my skin, cancelling out redness and covering my imperfections.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and airy, but covers well.  </li>
            <li>Holika is great, and wears well, with its integrity diminished only after 6 hrs of wear.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a lovely soft finish and my skin feels so smooth even when I wash it off!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this product so quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Loreal true match compact makeup</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite BB cream.</li>
            <li>and i love how natural it looks on my skin!</li>
            <li>It has pretty decent coverage, more so than some BB creams.</li>
            <li>If your skin is white or pale, NO.1 color would be your best choice for BB cream.</li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, it works better with moisturizer first.</li>
            <li>The coverage is a lot more than I thought it would be and it leaves skin matte all day long!  </li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, just took a little while to come from Korea</li>
            <li>It really applies well to my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the consistency of the product, but I did not like that it gave me a pasty looking appearance once dried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, its bigger that what i expected and the coverage is even better!</li>
            <li>Very natural looking and lasts forever!</li>
            <li>I am an undermake addict, this product doesnt hurt your skincare when others even high end chemical products do.</li>
            <li>But my skin is oily, so it might wear longer on normal or drier skin.  </li>
            <li>but right now it definitely doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The bb cream i got was the new version</li>
            <li>I am very pale and most bb creams I&#x27;ve tried look too orange</li>
            <li>I was really wanting to like this bb cream, but I ended up having to give it away to friends of mine who had very pale, light skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it was an old one</li>
            <li>but you have to have pale skin because it&#x27;s light color.</li>
            <li>It was good coverage for me and lasted long and actually matched my pale skin!!</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as how I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tone is a little light, but I found that adding bronzer for a bit of shadowing makes it perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>Feels so nice on your skin, but is a little pale even for me.</li>
            <li>only complaint is that the color is too light--</li>
            <li>I was worried the lightest shade might still be still be too dark, because I have really pale skin, and many of the &amp;#34;porcelain&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;alabaster&amp;#34; shades of other foundations show a marked difference to my face and throat, or tend to darken to an orange tint.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that it clung to some of my dry patches, but that can be fixed.</li>

            <li> I however was so disappointed because both shades were too light for my skin.</li>
            <li> or it was not original, but after reading some blogs and feedbacks from this bb cream and A-poly, i realized i was</li>

            <li> This unfortunately a shade or two too dark for NW10 skin tones.</li>
            <li> However, I find that the beauty blender included helps to distribute a thin coat of the BB cream</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This unfortunately a shade or two too dark for NW10 skin tones. Maybe once summer is over it will match but right now it definitely doesn&#x27;t. It has held up well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I honestly really loved this! It was good coverage for me and lasted long and actually matched my pale skin!!</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as how I expected. It really applies well to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The tone is a little light, but I found that adding bronzer for a bit of shadowing makes it perfect!!&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I really loved it but you have to have pale skin because it&#x27;s light color. Really loved it and gonna buy more</li>
            <li> This is my favorite BB cream.  I was out of of this cream so i tried a couples of different BB creAm but it was not as nice.  This is great for oily skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! Feels so nice on your skin, but is a little pale even for me. But all you have to do it fix this is powder your face with a darker color. Sometimes even though I already have it on my face to will put it on. That&#x27;s how good it feels on the skin!</li>
            <li> Best BB cream I&#x27;ve ever tried. I am very pale and most bb creams I&#x27;ve tried look too orange but this one is great. It gives my skin a lovely soft finish and my skin feels so smooth even when I wash it off! The only thing is that it clung to some of my dry patches, but that can be fixed. I love it so much!</li>
            <li> My daughter who is extremely fair found out about this product through a youtube video. The girl in the video&lt;br /&gt;was Korean and wanted to have pale skin. I have spent a lot of $$ on foundation prior to this, and it never matched my daughters skin tone. This is an amazing product, just took a little while to come from Korea</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite BB cream. This is now a staple item in my every day makeup and i love how natural it looks on my skin! All i use it this bb cream and a bit of bronzer and im good to go for my face! Holika Holika also has the cutest packaging. Defiantly going to repurchase.</li>
            <li> I like this product:&lt;br /&gt;-cute packaging! It&#x27;s a jelly mold&lt;br /&gt;-the spatula is hygienic&lt;br /&gt;-the product goes on so smoothly and blends into my skin, cancelling out redness and covering my imperfections. It turns matte when it dries, effectively controlling sebum levels.&lt;br /&gt;-my only complaint is that the color is too light-- it looks stark white on my face! However, I find that the beauty blender included helps to distribute a thin coat of the BB cream evenly-- probably because it absorbs most of the product :( You win some, you lose some.</li>
            <li> I got my bb cream today! (13 days after it was shipped)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the beginning i was a little afraid because the packaging was kind of different. I got the one with polka dot pattern! I thought it was an old one or it was not original, but after reading some blogs and feedbacks from this bb cream and A-poly, i realized i was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;The bb cream i got was the new version and it is original!!!! I&#x27;m so happy because i got perfectly what i expected!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, its bigger that what i expected and the coverage is even better! I&#x27;ve been using the Loreal true match compact makeup and i have to say this bb cream has better coverage!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite makeup. Cooling gel feeling that dries to a neutral matte tone. Very natural looking and lasts forever! If you have dry skin, it works better with moisturizer first. Good for paler skin.</li>
            <li> My fair skin is a combination type so I had heard this had moisturizing qualities&lt;br /&gt;and I only use it for rare times when a random spot pops up. It works as expected&lt;br /&gt;and is nice with my Revlon powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t need any other after having this c:</li>
            <li> I bought both #1 and #2 aqua petit jelly because I wasn&#x27;t sure what color would work best for me. I was so excited to receive this product so quickly. I however was so disappointed because both shades were too light for my skin. I was hoping that if I let the bb cream settle on my face and let it oxidize, it would get darker, but it did not :0(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the packaging. its cute being in a jello-mold like glass container. I liked the consistency of the product, but I did not like that it gave me a pasty looking appearance once dried. I was really wanting to like this bb cream, but I ended up having to give it away to friends of mine who had very pale, light skin. I hope that they make more color shades that can work for all skin colors.</li>

            <li> It is soooo cute!  And it works great!  The coverage is a lot more than I thought it would be and it leaves skin matte all day long!  Seems to heal, mositurize and make you beautiful!!  I have very fair skin and it looks great on me.  I was afraid since it was designed for asian skin it may be a bit dark but it&#x27;s not, its perfect!  Very happy.</li>
            <li> After using it in a while, I think it will be added to my must-have list for make up. I am an undermake addict, this product doesnt hurt your skincare when others even high end chemical products do. If your skin is white or pale, NO.1 color would be your best choice for BB cream.</li>
            <li> I read many of the reviews, before ordering this.  It almost sounded too good to be true.  But this is an excellent foundation!  It&#x27;s light and airy, but covers well.  I was worried the lightest shade might still be still be too dark, because I have really pale skin, and many of the &amp;#34;porcelain&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;alabaster&amp;#34; shades of other foundations show a marked difference to my face and throat, or tend to darken to an orange tint.  Holika is great, and wears well, with its integrity diminished only after 6 hrs of wear.  But my skin is oily, so it might wear longer on normal or drier skin.  My only complaint was the length of time it took to get it.  Don&#x27;t expect it any sooner than the stated ETA.</li>
            <li> Im in love. Came faster yhan ever expected too. ❤️ Works like lotion.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I watched MP&#x27;s makeup video and she recommended this BB cream. I was so excited to find this product so cheap and receive this product very quickly. I however was so disappointed because the product too thick and block the pores and made the skin dryness. And I don&#x27;t know how to do with the rest cream. And I guess it made me allergy.</li>
