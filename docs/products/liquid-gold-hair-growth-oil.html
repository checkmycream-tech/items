            <li>This products works very good and keeps my hair and scalp moisturized</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just not at all ideal for mornings or on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the oils, I take hair growth supplement pills ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li>this stuff work great...</li>
            <li>why its four stars lol</li>
            <li>but the aroma of it is great.  </li>
            <li>A great product.</li>
            <li>So, I tried using hair powder, like Joan Rivers Great Hair Day and Toppik.  </li>

            <li>Product is good.  </li>
            <li>The smell wasn&#x27;t good either</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the way the creator of liquidgoldhair doesn&#x27;t push her products on her customers and they have a wonderful staff there to answer any question regarding hair care, even if it is unrelated to the products.</li>
            <li>I smells good too</li>
            <li>I am still waiting for good results.</li>

            <li>I think this is a good sign.  </li>
            <li>I have also heard good things about their products.</li>
            <li>Over all a good product.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t see any good results..</li>
            <li>Great product:-)</li>

            <li>Love this product def buying more saw results within the 1st week if using it!!</li>
            <li>I love this oil!  </li>
            <li>But I LOVE THE RESULTS!</li>
            <li>My hair has never looked so healthy!</li>
            <li>Its more mositurized and manageable!</li>
            <li>It defiantly made my hair feel healthier :-)!</li>
            <li>It leaves an interesting smell after is washed it out !</li>
            <li>Worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair, this is a keeper!</li>
            <li>Very excited Bout this product !</li>
            <li>Amazing, Amazing, Amazing...</li>
            <li>AMAZING...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have to say I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li>It smells nice..</li>
            <li>loved it for a while, hair does grow, but believe it causes scalp breakout and it was recommended to a friend and it was to strong her hair</li>
            <li>It works great after first time use.</li>
            <li>It is according on what you need a strong head of hair or nice smelling hair.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>My hair loves the attention it gets from using these products.  :-)</li>
            <li>Love this oil have seen a improvement in my hair</li>
            <li>Product didn&#x27;t work, Shinmen works better, comes in an oral vitamin and liquid drops.</li>
            <li>but, I will take more than one bottle to do the trick.</li>
            <li>I have started using jbco and that seems a lot better.</li>
            <li>I started using it that day, so in 5 weeks I will know if it provided hair growth quicker and more than the Vitamin E oil and Murad</li>
            <li>I love all the oils that&#x27;s in it, but I now have more breakage.</li>
            <li>I make sure I keep a bottle in my frige.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to shake well while using because the sulfur settles at the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li>I personally love this product.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Love this product i recommend it to anyone trying to grow there hair</li>
            <li>I will be buying more</li>
            <li>am thinking to dilute it with oil just to be able to finish the bottle out.</li>
            <li>I now going into my third week of using this product and am so happy !</li>
            <li>I CAN DEFINIELY DEAL WITH THAT!:)</li>
            <li>With doing one length blunt cuts I have noticed more thicker ends.</li>
            <li>then I&#x27;ll be switching to more natural/organic items.</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>have been using the bald spot treatment for about 6 weeks, I made sure to follow their regimen, after I put the oil on my scalp I would massage my scalp for 5 minutes, it takes me awhile since I have a lot of bald spots.  </li>
            <li>so im sure this wont work.</li>
            <li>so I just make sure I moisturize my hair on the days I use it</li>
            <li>Love this product</li>
            <li>so I decided that I would not be able to use the product.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>You would most definetly get an inch a month with this.</li>
            <li>It smells the best on the second day after its used.</li>
            <li>I like being able to pick and choose what method to use so</li>
            <li>Hmmm I love the smell..</li>
            <li>Love this hair oil.</li>
            <li>was a better option for application.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and it does make your hair grow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not at all pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>this really works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because this product is really that amazing or because my scalp and hair absolutely love sulfur which is very potent in the oil blend.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very excited to try it.</li>
            <li>but I plan on relaxing maybe tomorrow so that I&#x27;ll be able to accurately track my growth.</li>
            <li>Great for natural hair.  </li>
            <li>But after using this for a month I have to say I&#x27;m glad I purchased, happy with the results and will definitely be repurchasing.  </li>
            <li>Some days after application, the scent is so strong and nauseating</li>
            <li>Strong smell .</li>
            <li>the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong for 5 mins but fades away.</li>
            <li>SULFUR, yes, it is has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair is growing quicker than normal and I am very happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing so far.  </li>
            <li>My hair was actually a whole inch SHORTER than when I first started!!!!</li>
            <li>This stuff works great will buy again only had it a week had a hair cut now</li>
            <li>The downside about it is that it is very oily and it makes your head feel really warm from lights.</li>
            <li>Lightly scented.</li>
            <li>It says to conditioner wash and sulfate free wash the hair.</li>
            <li>Then I&#x27;ve tried sulfate free, I got the say yes to carrots</li>
            <li>B00B5OM58U Hair Growth Essentials + FREE Maximum Strength Biotin Tablets]]) to help balance out.</li>
            <li>This is a really good product if you have natural hair.  </li>
            <li>and so far so good</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>My her love this oil so much I&#x27;m going to buy more soon</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping! !!</li>
            <li>The sulfur odor is mild, and more of an undernote, with a mildly spicy topnote.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product so far.</li>
            <li>&amp; im pretty sure my hair just grew almost a 1/4 of an inch</li>
            <li>The money is worth it!</li>
            <li>Did not see any significant growth with this product.  </li>
            <li>What makes onion beneficial is probably its significant sulfur content.  </li>
            <li>It is a very heavy oil; best used at night and cover hair with a satin scarf.  </li>
            <li>work great on my hair because I have really dry scalp</li>
            <li>Im looking forward to more positive results</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of the main ingredients.! :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve so far experienced an increase in my normal hair growth.</li>
            <li>so nicely you would not believe that I was damn near bald on the edges.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the trying stage - hope all the rave reviews turn out to be true and it does for me what it did for others.  </li>
            <li>The seller included a 10% off coupon for the next order - good deal.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t think this product is good at all.</li>
            <li>This product works great but the odor is a little strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and from the first application I could feel its stimulating qualities.</li>
            <li>It did help tremendously with growth.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t expect quick results.</li>
            <li>The oil does absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li>The Green Magic hair cream is good</li>
            <li>love it, will use for the entire family.love it, love it, love it, love it, will recommend for my entire family.</li>
            <li>However the shipping cost to the UK is high and you end up paying more for shipping than the product itself.</li>
            <li>leave that solution on all shower (as long as you can) than end with a good detangling conditioner on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great oil it has slowed down my husbands hair loss.</li>
            <li>My hair grows out straight before it starts to curl, so it was very easy to tell how much it has grown.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work and smell was strong.</li>
            <li>I will definitely give this product a couple more months to see what happens!</li>
            <li>In a month my hair grew enough to be able to get box braids !</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing use it once saw a different in my hair in a weeks time</li>
            <li>Even though the essential oils in the blend are supposed to prevent drying, the sulfur may still have some drying effects and therefore you might want to keep grease or oil handy just in case.</li>
            <li>So far ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried MTG, Wild Growth Oil and Boundless Tresses ,but this is the best of all of those oils!</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>My favorite hair growth product thus far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase though.</li>
            <li>Other then that its a good product.</li>
            <li>I am currently transitioning and have been keeping my hair in protective styles (cornrows or wigs w/braids underneath) and the applicator tip makes this product very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>It would be great on someone with coarse hair, but should not be used daily.</li>
            <li>Its very very fort.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s good to just use a little bit on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I had such high hopes, even liked it on fb and all.</li>
            <li>I love this product and 4 oz isn&#x27;t enough!!!</li>
            <li>I have about a inch all ready growing on me!</li>
            <li>Liquid Gold Hair Growth Oil Sulfur based and upon first use my hair began to fall out.</li>
            <li>I found it well-priced and effective, and I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when this bottle&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li>My hair is getting much thicker from taking them !</li>
            <li>And sure enough within a week my hair grew 1/2 an inch.</li>
            <li>i have not even received this product yet, but after purchasing i realized that this product is made for african-american women, they have a different hair texture that can soak up more oils</li>
            <li>First off my hair sheds allot.</li>
            <li>That could and most likely is the problem.</li>
            <li>When I first started using liquid gold hair growth oil</li>
            <li>Maybe I need more practice getting it on properly.</li>
            <li>What I notice the most is at my temples where my hair was thinning, I now see hair coming back in</li>
            <li>ok I came back just to let you know</li>
            <li>First off</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care if old ladies aren&#x27;t supposed to look good with long hair.</li>
            <li>But within the first week I realized that this stuff was really working very fast.  </li>
            <li>I found it they are very dehydrating on hair if you don&#x27;t moisturize first.</li>
            <li>Not really sure what I was expecting, but this oil does a good job of moisturizing my hair.  </li>
            <li>My only downside is the strong smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice my hair growing faster, maybe...</li>
            <li>but i can REALLY see a difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li>: my hair is chemically treated (light blonde), so i waited 2 weeks after processing as suggested...</li>
            <li>product arrived on the very day</li>
            <li>I wonder if the sulfur is to much for my hair.</li>
            <li>However, it is very oily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>my hair grow really fast with this product</li>
            <li>Too much will make you have headaches.</li>
            <li>, I think I used a bit too much per application.</li>
            <li>Well I&#x27;ve tried co-washing and my hair gets really oily faster when I do.</li>
            <li>it seems really drying to hair.</li>
            <li>and I may have added too much per week and at a time.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and I got it before I was expecting.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference while using this product.</li>
            <li>Well it&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
            <li>If you use too much, you&#x27;ll get headaches.</li>
            <li>The oil really softened up my roots.  </li>
            <li>Use too much and you will go to bed with a greasy head of hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very depressed with my hair</li>
            <li>Liquidhairgold has many other products to choose from that do not have sulfur that may work for you.</li>
            <li>Although my nape ( where I was completely bald) isn&#x27;t quite long enough to be braided yet it is well covered by my braided extentions and will be able to be braide within a month!</li>
            <li>I can most definitely see that the product works, my hair feels a lot thicker than it did from last month.</li>
            <li>I am trying to use my shampoo with the sulfates and go to sulfate free stuff because I want thicker hair, or I&#x27;ll at least try going sulfate free for a while to see if there is any difference.   </li>
            <li>and I will most definitely be coming back with another review!!!</li>
            <li>There is a mild sensation for about ten minutes after use to let you know that it is working.  </li>
            <li>The smell was a bit strong the first few applications, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>
            <li>Except mine arrived without the easy application top, came with regular cap, hard to apply.</li>
            <li>Will reorder again and highly recommending to purchase this item.</li>
            <li>I do have high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li>My hairline is growing in and i can see a little more thickness on my crown.</li>
            <li>, however I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of growth as of yet, so lets just give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>The scent takes a little getting used to, but I&#x27;m sure with consistent use you will barely notice it.  </li>
            <li>This took me by surprise after first use, and I had to really work on my silver to get the silver shine back.  </li>
            <li>I use a sodium laureth sulfate shampoo, the less harsh sulfate.n using it up and by then I&#x27;ll be happy and no longer need it.</li>
            <li>i am also using coconut oil in my hair everyday which is keeping it moisturized &amp; soft... to prevent dryness from sulfur too ! :)</li>
            <li>it does seem to be working, only thing i think is my skin sensitive, i broke out a lil around side burns and in head here and there-it does say like anything else do an allergy test first, to me it works!</li>
            <li>Although it smells nice it felt a little gritty to me.</li>
            <li>but I can always tell when I have new growth my hair is shoulder length</li>
            <li>but I feel like I have gotten some new growth</li>
            <li>Bt overall I really live this product !!!</li>
            <li>and I usually braid it for the most part and put the oil on every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li>ok so im not sure</li>
            <li>WOW !  </li>
            <li>It helps make my hair feel soft and look healthier!</li>
            <li>The hair growth was the exact same amount as when I didn&#x27;t use the oil.  </li>
            <li>When using this product make sure you are either outside or away from other people.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t seen any growth, but again, with consistent use I&#x27;d probably be reporting different results.</li>
            <li>insted of half inch grow three fourth and healthy.</li>
            <li>stay clear of this product</li>
            <li>It came with clear, understandable, step by step instructions on how to use the product.</li>
            <li>I was transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.  </li>
            <li>so i can let you guys in on if it really works or not ...be back soon!</li>
            <li>Im a natural girl</li>
            <li>(My hair is natural as in Afro-descent natural.)</li>
            <li>baking soda mixed with 2 cups water to wash, I do that fast and than rinse with 2tbs apple cider vininger to two cups of water&#x3D;</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and mananageable.</li>
            <li>I got this for naturally growing out my hair.</li>
            <li>I am still researching all the natural supplements that are out there.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles for myself and two for my aunt and my mom.</li>
            <li>It defines my natural curls.  </li>
            <li>Smells good, but not sure about the results as I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li>are good for growing hair, but the smell would be difficult to tolerate.  </li>
            <li>My hair personally gets dry very quickly when using different products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve received growth all over, especially in my temple area which is the main reason I purchased this oil.</li>
            <li>but so far i have no other complaints.</li>
            <li>Though sulfur allergies are rare and the hair and scalp typically benefit from sulfur, if you have any worries that sulfur may aggravate your scalp in any way, *</li>
            <li>Because it is sooooo uneven, I need to grow my hair out quickly.  </li>
            <li>The oil appears to be clear with yellow specks from the sulfur.</li>
            <li>Have not use it long enough to see if it really helps my hair to grow.  </li>
            <li>I asked a former friend of mine to shape me up and she scalped me completely bald</li>
            <li>My 4B hair is short and natural</li>
            <li>and I have extra sensitive skin and seem to be allergic to everything.  </li>
            <li>I have seen growth, but I&#x27;ve also been taking hair vitamins with extra biotin and using Wild Growth hair oil.</li>
            <li>Overall I would keep using it to keep my roots soft and scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li>Using the pills when I&#x27;m on the go and the oil when I have extra time has really made an improvement in my overall physical appearance in my face and nails.</li>
            <li>It is rich, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I try to use it right after my shower, after my hair has air dried.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it three stars but other than the smell it really works.</li>
            <li>I personally mix it with some olive oil as my scalp becomes sensitive when I use it as is on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I want to add that after washing and conditioning my hair the following day it had increased shine and manageability, and decreased frizz and flyaways, looking and behaving like healthy hair.</li>
            <li>in  will not last as long because i already have some new growth coming in, but</li>
            <li>When I looked at the box it clearly shows it will only work on hair loss in the middle and back of your head.</li>
            <li>But, on the other hand if the sulfur content is high enough to &#x27;antique&#x27; silver, it should do wonders for growing hair.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very greasy even if you put a little bit in your head.</li>

            <li> This products works very good and keeps my hair and scalp moisturized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not at all ideal for mornings or on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the oils, I take hair growth supplement pills ([[ASIN:</li>
            <li> this stuff work great...</li>
            <li> why its four stars lol</li>
            <li> but the aroma of it is great.  </li>
            <li> A great product.</li>
            <li> So, I tried using hair powder, like Joan Rivers Great Hair Day and Toppik.  </li>

            <li> Product is good.  </li>
            <li> The smell wasn&#x27;t good either</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the way the creator of liquidgoldhair doesn&#x27;t push her products on her customers and they have a wonderful staff there to answer any question regarding hair care, even if it is unrelated to the products.</li>
            <li> I smells good too</li>
            <li> I am still waiting for good results.</li>
            <li> Smells good to me.</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>

            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s good for me.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good sign.  </li>
            <li> I have also heard good things about their products.</li>
            <li> Over all a good product.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t see any good results..</li>
            <li> Great product:-)</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this product def buying more saw results within the 1st week if using it!!</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  </li>
            <li> But I LOVE THE RESULTS!</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so healthy!</li>
            <li> Its more mositurized and manageable!</li>
            <li> It defiantly made my hair feel healthier :-)!</li>
            <li> It leaves an interesting smell after is washed it out !</li>
            <li> Worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair, this is a keeper!</li>
            <li> Very excited Bout this product !</li>
            <li> Amazing, Amazing, Amazing...</li>
            <li> AMAZING...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to say I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> It smells nice..</li>
            <li> loved it for a while, hair does grow, but believe it causes scalp breakout and it was recommended to a friend and it was to strong her hair</li>
            <li> It works great after first time use.</li>
            <li> It is according on what you need a strong head of hair or nice smelling hair.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> My hair loves the attention it gets from using these products.  :-)</li>
            <li> Love this oil have seen a improvement in my hair</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work, Shinmen works better, comes in an oral vitamin and liquid drops.</li>
            <li> but, I will take more than one bottle to do the trick.</li>
            <li> I have started using jbco and that seems a lot better.</li>
            <li> I started using it that day, so in 5 weeks I will know if it provided hair growth quicker and more than the Vitamin E oil and Murad</li>
            <li> I love all the oils that&#x27;s in it, but I now have more breakage.</li>
            <li> I make sure I keep a bottle in my frige.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to shake well while using because the sulfur settles at the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I personally love this product.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Love this product i recommend it to anyone trying to grow there hair</li>
            <li> I will be buying more</li>
            <li> am thinking to dilute it with oil just to be able to finish the bottle out.</li>
            <li> I now going into my third week of using this product and am so happy !</li>
            <li> I CAN DEFINIELY DEAL WITH THAT!:)</li>
            <li> With doing one length blunt cuts I have noticed more thicker ends.</li>
            <li> then I&#x27;ll be switching to more natural/organic items.</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> have been using the bald spot treatment for about 6 weeks, I made sure to follow their regimen, after I put the oil on my scalp I would massage my scalp for 5 minutes, it takes me awhile since I have a lot of bald spots.  </li>
            <li> so im sure this wont work.</li>
            <li> so I just make sure I moisturize my hair on the days I use it</li>
            <li> Love this product</li>
            <li> so I decided that I would not be able to use the product.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> You would most definetly get an inch a month with this.</li>
            <li> It smells the best on the second day after its used.</li>
            <li> I like being able to pick and choose what method to use so</li>
            <li> Hmmm I love the smell..</li>
            <li> Love this hair oil.</li>
            <li> was a better option for application.  </li>
            <li> I love this product and it does make your hair grow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> this really works wonders!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because this product is really that amazing or because my scalp and hair absolutely love sulfur which is very potent in the oil blend.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very excited to try it.</li>
            <li> but I plan on relaxing maybe tomorrow so that I&#x27;ll be able to accurately track my growth.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair.  </li>
            <li> But after using this for a month I have to say I&#x27;m glad I purchased, happy with the results and will definitely be repurchasing.  </li>
            <li> Some days after application, the scent is so strong and nauseating</li>
            <li> Strong smell .</li>
            <li> the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong for 5 mins but fades away.</li>
            <li> SULFUR, yes, it is has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair is growing quicker than normal and I am very happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing so far.  </li>
            <li> My hair was actually a whole inch SHORTER than when I first started!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great will buy again only had it a week had a hair cut now</li>
            <li> The downside about it is that it is very oily and it makes your head feel really warm from lights.</li>
            <li> Lightly scented.</li>
            <li> It says to conditioner wash and sulfate free wash the hair.</li>
            <li> Then I&#x27;ve tried sulfate free, I got the say yes to carrots</li>
            <li> B00B5OM58U Hair Growth Essentials + FREE Maximum Strength Biotin Tablets]]) to help balance out.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product if you have natural hair.  </li>
            <li> and so far so good</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> My her love this oil so much I&#x27;m going to buy more soon</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping! !!</li>
            <li> The sulfur odor is mild, and more of an undernote, with a mildly spicy topnote.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product so far.</li>
            <li> &amp; im pretty sure my hair just grew almost a 1/4 of an inch</li>
            <li> The money is worth it!</li>
            <li> Did not see any significant growth with this product.  </li>
            <li> What makes onion beneficial is probably its significant sulfur content.  </li>
            <li> It is a very heavy oil; best used at night and cover hair with a satin scarf.  </li>
            <li> work great on my hair because I have really dry scalp</li>
            <li> Im looking forward to more positive results</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the main ingredients.! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve so far experienced an increase in my normal hair growth.</li>
            <li> so nicely you would not believe that I was damn near bald on the edges.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the trying stage - hope all the rave reviews turn out to be true and it does for me what it did for others.  </li>
            <li> The seller included a 10% off coupon for the next order - good deal.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think this product is good at all.</li>
            <li> This product works great but the odor is a little strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and from the first application I could feel its stimulating qualities.</li>
            <li> It did help tremendously with growth.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t expect quick results.</li>
            <li> The oil does absorb quickly.  </li>
            <li> The Green Magic hair cream is good</li>
            <li> love it, will use for the entire family.love it, love it, love it, love it, will recommend for my entire family.</li>
            <li> However the shipping cost to the UK is high and you end up paying more for shipping than the product itself.</li>
            <li> leave that solution on all shower (as long as you can) than end with a good detangling conditioner on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil it has slowed down my husbands hair loss.</li>
            <li> My hair grows out straight before it starts to curl, so it was very easy to tell how much it has grown.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work and smell was strong.</li>
            <li> I will definitely give this product a couple more months to see what happens!</li>
            <li> In a month my hair grew enough to be able to get box braids !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing use it once saw a different in my hair in a weeks time</li>
            <li> Even though the essential oils in the blend are supposed to prevent drying, the sulfur may still have some drying effects and therefore you might want to keep grease or oil handy just in case.</li>
            <li> So far ok.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried MTG, Wild Growth Oil and Boundless Tresses ,but this is the best of all of those oils!</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li> My favorite hair growth product thus far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase though.</li>
            <li> Other then that its a good product.</li>
            <li> I am currently transitioning and have been keeping my hair in protective styles (cornrows or wigs w/braids underneath) and the applicator tip makes this product very easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> It would be great on someone with coarse hair, but should not be used daily.</li>
            <li> Its very very fort.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s good to just use a little bit on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes, even liked it on fb and all.</li>
            <li> I love this product and 4 oz isn&#x27;t enough!!!</li>
            <li> I have about a inch all ready growing on me!</li>
            <li> Liquid Gold Hair Growth Oil Sulfur based and upon first use my hair began to fall out.</li>
            <li> I found it well-priced and effective, and I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when this bottle&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> My hair is getting much thicker from taking them !</li>
            <li> And sure enough within a week my hair grew 1/2 an inch.</li>
            <li> i have not even received this product yet, but after purchasing i realized that this product is made for african-american women, they have a different hair texture that can soak up more oils</li>
            <li> First off my hair sheds allot.</li>
            <li> That could and most likely is the problem.</li>
            <li> When I first started using liquid gold hair growth oil</li>
            <li> Maybe I need more practice getting it on properly.</li>
            <li> What I notice the most is at my temples where my hair was thinning, I now see hair coming back in</li>
            <li> ok I came back just to let you know</li>
            <li> First off</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care if old ladies aren&#x27;t supposed to look good with long hair.</li>
            <li> But within the first week I realized that this stuff was really working very fast.  </li>
            <li> I found it they are very dehydrating on hair if you don&#x27;t moisturize first.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what I was expecting, but this oil does a good job of moisturizing my hair.  </li>
            <li> My only downside is the strong smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice my hair growing faster, maybe...</li>
            <li> but i can REALLY see a difference in the condition of my hair.</li>
            <li> : my hair is chemically treated (light blonde), so i waited 2 weeks after processing as suggested...</li>
            <li> product arrived on the very day</li>
            <li> I wonder if the sulfur is to much for my hair.</li>
            <li> However, it is very oily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> my hair grow really fast with this product</li>
            <li> Too much will make you have headaches.</li>
            <li> , I think I used a bit too much per application.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;ve tried co-washing and my hair gets really oily faster when I do.</li>
            <li> it seems really drying to hair.</li>
            <li> and I may have added too much per week and at a time.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and I got it before I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference while using this product.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s very moisturizing</li>
            <li> If you use too much, you&#x27;ll get headaches.</li>
            <li> The oil really softened up my roots.  </li>
            <li> Use too much and you will go to bed with a greasy head of hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very depressed with my hair</li>
            <li> Liquidhairgold has many other products to choose from that do not have sulfur that may work for you.</li>
            <li> Although my nape ( where I was completely bald) isn&#x27;t quite long enough to be braided yet it is well covered by my braided extentions and will be able to be braide within a month!</li>
            <li> I can most definitely see that the product works, my hair feels a lot thicker than it did from last month.</li>
            <li> I am trying to use my shampoo with the sulfates and go to sulfate free stuff because I want thicker hair, or I&#x27;ll at least try going sulfate free for a while to see if there is any difference.   </li>
            <li> and I will most definitely be coming back with another review!!!</li>
            <li> There is a mild sensation for about ten minutes after use to let you know that it is working.  </li>
            <li> The smell was a bit strong the first few applications, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it</li>
            <li> Except mine arrived without the easy application top, came with regular cap, hard to apply.</li>
            <li> Will reorder again and highly recommending to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I do have high expectations for this product.  </li>
            <li> My hairline is growing in and i can see a little more thickness on my crown.</li>
            <li> , however I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of growth as of yet, so lets just give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> The scent takes a little getting used to, but I&#x27;m sure with consistent use you will barely notice it.  </li>
            <li> This took me by surprise after first use, and I had to really work on my silver to get the silver shine back.  </li>
            <li> I use a sodium laureth sulfate shampoo, the less harsh sulfate.n using it up and by then I&#x27;ll be happy and no longer need it.</li>
            <li> i am also using coconut oil in my hair everyday which is keeping it moisturized &amp; soft... to prevent dryness from sulfur too ! :)</li>
            <li> it does seem to be working, only thing i think is my skin sensitive, i broke out a lil around side burns and in head here and there-it does say like anything else do an allergy test first, to me it works!</li>
            <li> Although it smells nice it felt a little gritty to me.</li>
            <li> but I can always tell when I have new growth my hair is shoulder length</li>
            <li> but I feel like I have gotten some new growth</li>
            <li> Bt overall I really live this product !!!</li>
            <li> and I usually braid it for the most part and put the oil on every 2 or 3 days.</li>
            <li> ok so im not sure</li>
            <li> WOW !  </li>
            <li> It helps make my hair feel soft and look healthier!</li>
            <li> The hair growth was the exact same amount as when I didn&#x27;t use the oil.  </li>
            <li> When using this product make sure you are either outside or away from other people.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any growth, but again, with consistent use I&#x27;d probably be reporting different results.</li>
            <li> insted of half inch grow three fourth and healthy.</li>
            <li> stay clear of this product</li>
            <li> It came with clear, understandable, step by step instructions on how to use the product.</li>
            <li> I was transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.  </li>
            <li> so i can let you guys in on if it really works or not ...be back soon!</li>
            <li> Im a natural girl</li>
            <li> (My hair is natural as in Afro-descent natural.)</li>
            <li> baking soda mixed with 2 cups water to wash, I do that fast and than rinse with 2tbs apple cider vininger to two cups of water&#x3D;</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and mananageable.</li>
            <li> I got this for naturally growing out my hair.</li>
            <li> I am still researching all the natural supplements that are out there.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles for myself and two for my aunt and my mom.</li>
            <li> It defines my natural curls.  </li>
            <li> Smells good, but not sure about the results as I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> are good for growing hair, but the smell would be difficult to tolerate.  </li>
            <li> My hair personally gets dry very quickly when using different products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received growth all over, especially in my temple area which is the main reason I purchased this oil.</li>
            <li> but so far i have no other complaints.</li>
            <li> Though sulfur allergies are rare and the hair and scalp typically benefit from sulfur, if you have any worries that sulfur may aggravate your scalp in any way, *</li>
            <li> Because it is sooooo uneven, I need to grow my hair out quickly.  </li>
            <li> The oil appears to be clear with yellow specks from the sulfur.</li>
            <li> Have not use it long enough to see if it really helps my hair to grow.  </li>
            <li> I asked a former friend of mine to shape me up and she scalped me completely bald</li>
            <li> My 4B hair is short and natural</li>
            <li> and I have extra sensitive skin and seem to be allergic to everything.  </li>
            <li> I have seen growth, but I&#x27;ve also been taking hair vitamins with extra biotin and using Wild Growth hair oil.</li>
            <li> Overall I would keep using it to keep my roots soft and scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li> Using the pills when I&#x27;m on the go and the oil when I have extra time has really made an improvement in my overall physical appearance in my face and nails.</li>
            <li> It is rich, and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I try to use it right after my shower, after my hair has air dried.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it three stars but other than the smell it really works.</li>
            <li> I personally mix it with some olive oil as my scalp becomes sensitive when I use it as is on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I want to add that after washing and conditioning my hair the following day it had increased shine and manageability, and decreased frizz and flyaways, looking and behaving like healthy hair.</li>
            <li> in  will not last as long because i already have some new growth coming in, but</li>
            <li> When I looked at the box it clearly shows it will only work on hair loss in the middle and back of your head.</li>
            <li> But, on the other hand if the sulfur content is high enough to &#x27;antique&#x27; silver, it should do wonders for growing hair.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very greasy even if you put a little bit in your head.</li>
            <li> The sulfur content is high enough to turn silver black.  </li>
            <li> After two weeks I saw about half an inch which is double my normal rate of growth.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks my hair (which was a 2 TO 1.5 inch twa) had grown another half an inch all over and where i was completely BALD in the back !</li>
            <li> i usually dont write reviews but this desevers one, i have been using this for two weeks straight</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use it long enough to see results...</li>
            <li> But, it makes my natural curls look so much healthier and less frizzy than usual.</li>
            <li> For bald areas you should wear your hair natural and less pulling from braids and pony tails.</li>
            <li> I will suggest using this product but if your hair is dry, try a natural moisturizing product such as coconut/jojoba oil a half hr before use.</li>
            <li> I use it few times in a week only, not everyday .</li>
            <li> would recommend this product to anyone with unprocessed African American hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to really say if this product works or not because I haven&#x27;t been consistent with it, but I&#x27;m going to try it for at least a month to see if it works, then I&#x27;ll update again.</li>
            <li> My scalp got a little itchy after using the oil, but that may again have been due to too much product.</li>
            <li> The scent may be a little intolerable for sensitive noses.</li>
            <li> Earlier than expected.. Just started using it..its a bit greasy</li>
            <li> Within a few months, my hair in the crown has actually grown long enough to do my two-strand twists (hair in that area was literally too short to grab!)  </li>
            <li> I figure I&#x27;ll leave it on as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on and off for a long time, I don&#x27;t want my scalp getting used to it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing smell, but I find that it takes so long to absorb that it needs to be done at night.</li>
            <li> My hair normally only grows half an inch in an entire month!</li>
            <li> Only issue is if you do any chemical process, you have to wait two weeks before and after, due to drying effects from the sulfur.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t linger too long!</li>
            <li> The only other con is these braids I have</li>
            <li> I will also use other oils on my hair when I&#x27;m using this to get extra benefit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll come back and update if I experience any growth or any other issues...</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product for very long</li>
            <li> I  THINK IT MADE MY HAIR DRY</li>
            <li> I have Caucasian hair that has been falling out a lot especially in the last few months.  </li>
            <li> I was using this everyday because I just did the big chop, and am in a rush to get my hair back on track.</li>
            <li> I didnt see no new growth besides what I already experience.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t want to use it every single day because I heard that your body gets used to it after a while</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;sulfur based\\&quot; big label right on the product photo is supposed to warn about the foul smell, but in any case, the smell literally makes me ill.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry.</li>
            <li> i wash my hair every 3rd day ,do towel dry few drop of oil take in my hand and massage scalp .and</li>
            <li> I purchased liquid gold a little over 9 wks ago and have been using it only Mondays, Wednesday&#x27;s, and Fridays.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while before results appear but they definitely occur.</li>
            <li> It have a bad smell but its okay after a while.</li>
            <li> I am not sure about the growth properties because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough</li>
            <li> I have spent years and thousands of dollars trying to get my hair to grow&#x3D;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still only using a few drops each time.</li>
            <li> But I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair, I have medium/fine type of hair, and it can look thin if I don&#x27;t have a blunt cut.</li>
            <li> Delivery was faster than expected.</li>
            <li> I think ill purchase it again, and this time measure my success.</li>
            <li> I did like that it wasn&#x27;t greasy or thick but as far as growing hair, any hair growth was negligible.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that strong or unpleasant considering the fact that it contains sulfur.</li>
            <li> Their has been at least 2 1/2 inch growth and it has thickened over last month, slow and steady</li>
            <li> I started using this product and noticed my hair finally getting longer despite my bad habit, as did my mom and a close friend, and seeing actual growth has become an incentive for me to really try and stop myself from messing with the ends!</li>
            <li> It works and I may continue to buy it, but I have to wash my hair each night while using it due to how oily it is.</li>
            <li> the other days I use 2 tbs.</li>
            <li> In the future, I may try applying a small amount once a day and washing twice a week.</li>
            <li> When in the house i recommend you turn on the fan or else your room will be smelling, but other than that it gets the job done, i look forward to buying another bottle once</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> I will be taking other vitamins and supplements, like algae and other stuff</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was hesitant about purchasing this item due to it being sulfur based</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it every other or two days and</li>
            <li> I suggest using a bandana or a shower cap to keep from rubbing off on your pillows or other bedding too.</li>
            <li> Other people also complained about the smell after I put it on, even just a tiny bit dime-sized drop.</li>
            <li> gross and the smell is hard to wash out and DO NOT USE ON COLOR TREAYED HAIR it will wash it out.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have to be used daily, but using it once a week won&#x27;t benefit you any, or at least not substantially.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve cut back on using this the bumps seem to have slowly begun to go away.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t leave my hair badly dried but it was a little dry.</li>
            <li> and my hair is just starting to slow down on falling out.</li>
            <li> Weights the hair down.</li>
            <li> Due to surgeries and stress it was chunking off in clumps...!</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> so my hair wouldn&#x27;t look so oily, but based on what other reviews say to use (just a few drops)</li>
            <li> I will subject this product too anyone.</li>
            <li> Some of it is less than 1/4 of an inch, while the rest is 6 inches.  </li>
            <li> I had half an inch of growth within 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> My hair grew a inch longer in three and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> I lose a lot less hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about one month and can see slight growth on the length of my hair.  </li>
            <li> Not a good look especialy for a female!</li>
            <li> My hair growth ranges every month from a half a inch to a little over a little over a half a inch every month.</li>
            <li> This product show a little progress</li>
            <li> I do like this oil using a little</li>
            <li> t&#x27;s a little too sticky for my taste.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying to my scalp</li>
            <li> Putting it around my edges has made my forehead break out in little bumps.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my hair seems a little fuller, healthier and about 1/4 inch longer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vitamin E oil actually grows hair out quickly, but due to a RECONSTRUCTOR disaster (which followed the use of a horrible shampoo), a lot of my hair broke off.  </li>
            <li> My hair is broken off in the middle</li>
            <li> I been using this oil in my nape area for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil a few weeks ago and started using it after I shaved off all my hair.</li>
            <li> Also dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Also my hair dried out.  </li>
            <li> or i just wasted $13.:</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday</li>
            <li> I ordered mine a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had short hair for years, and I&#x27;m tired of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and my hairs grown about an inch or two.</li>
            <li> every evening just massage few minute with finger</li>
            <li> I see a little grey strain growing in the thin places around my hair line</li>
            <li> I usually put it on in the evening and keep it on for a few hrs.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use the oil because I have had very little shedding and breaking since using this oil, but NO GROWTH generated by this oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think the smell is bad at all.  </li>
            <li> im not satisfied one bit.</li>
            <li> a small fro</li>
            <li> Realizing that the reviews are likely fake, I don&#x27;t expect any hair growth, BUT....</li>
            <li> well my hair would NOT grow past a certian point and it just stayed at that lenght for years and years ....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my scalp everyday!</li>
            <li> I try to use it for a least a few weeks then lay off of it for a while.</li>
            <li> Not sure if worked because I didn&#x27;t do a before and after length check.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure what to do.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad as for growth to early to tell just been using it for a few days.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much growth, and I was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get directly on the scalp, and it also has a burning sensation.</li>
            <li> My hair typically grows very slowly, however after applying this to my scalp, it sprouts like a weed within a two week period.</li>
            <li> The smell is strong but in my opinion, it does not smell awful.</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;medicine-y&amp;#34; at all -- at least not to me and my family.  </li>
            <li> This product does stimulate growth but it also makes ur hair shead or at least mine did:-(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using it for almost a month now and have nothing negative to say.</li>
            <li> It works slowly.  </li>
            <li> the smell is not too bad especially with the whipped ginger cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that bad though ,but my hair is definitely healthier since I started using this product .</li>
            <li> A few years ago I picked up a bad nervous habit of pulling the split ends off my hair, and over time that&#x27;s caused a lot of damage, negated any hair growth &amp; even shortened my hair in some places, and made it uneven.</li>
            <li> If you are having problems with bald or broken off areas</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because i did notice growth but whats the point if its just gonna give you thin shedding hair.</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t look so thin any longer.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil for approximately three weeks now.  </li>
            <li> It smells bad, but mainly very difficult to get directly on the scalp in the problem  areas.</li>
            <li> This product gave me really bad headaches and my hair began to shed excessively.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical because I never thought an oil would grow my hair</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting off 14 inches of hair and got home decided that I absolutely hated how short my hair was.</li>
            <li> Then, I wash it out the next morning because the smell is just god awful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be washing my hair everyday, because it&#x27;s not good for the scalp, and I don&#x27;t even have oily scalp or skin, but this product makes it look awful...</li>
            <li> I like the way it smells, but my hair looks dirty.</li>
            <li> If it works, I&#x27;ll put up with dirty looking hair when I&#x27;m not going anywhere.</li>
            <li> this doesnt smell as bad as MTG</li>
            <li> Besides that, it smells really bad.</li>
            <li> , my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like the smell :(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I had bad allergic reaction and the product didn&#x27;t do what it suppose to do!!  </li>
            <li> Smells terrible and  remover the silver and gold of my jewlery</li>
            <li> It smells terrible when you put it on your hair.</li>
            <li> The smell was awful, but I was already warned about that.</li>
            <li> The smell is awful....</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is just perfect. I use it few times in a week only, not everyday . and I see my hair Has grow a lot. I&#x27;ll keep using this. Love it</li>
            <li> Earlier than expected.. Just started using it..its a bit greasy</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I was transitioning from relaxed to natural hair.  I noticed some breakage in my crown and temple areas.  I purchased this oil and began using it immediately.  Within a few months, my hair in the crown has actually grown long enough to do my two-strand twists (hair in that area was literally too short to grab!)  I really don&#x27;t think the smell is bad at all.  My hair doesn&#x27;t smell &amp;#34;medicine-y&amp;#34; at all -- at least not to me and my family.  Since I am completely transitioned  to natural now (yaaaay....and no big chop needed) I still use the growth oil in previously trouble areas.  My temples have grown in so nicely you would not believe that I was damn near bald on the edges.  This growth oil not only made my hair grow, but it also eliminated breakage and healthier and stronger hair.  I will definitely purchase this AND the whipped ginger cream again. My hair loves the attention it gets from using these products.  :-)</li>
            <li> used it as people had discussed in youtube videos. I found that it was way too oily and wieghed dowm my daughter and my hair. But it does smell good.</li>
            <li> it smells like i just got a perm ewe. gross and the smell is hard to wash out and DO NOT USE ON COLOR TREAYED HAIR it will wash it out. im not satisfied one bit.</li>
            <li> product don&#x27;t work, use for 4 month no result.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the \\&quot;sulfur based\\&quot; big label right on the product photo is supposed to warn about the foul smell, but in any case, the smell literally makes me ill. Other people also complained about the smell after I put it on, even just a tiny bit dime-sized drop.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product today so hopefully it works so i can let you guys in on if it really works or not ...be back soon!</li>
            <li> My hair is broken off in the middle and I usually braid it for the most part and put the oil on every 2 or 3 days. I&#x27;ve seen good results. If you are having problems with bald or broken off areas I would suggest this product. For bald areas you should wear your hair natural and less pulling from braids and pony tails. It may take a while to grow back but you will see results. Just give it time.</li>
            <li> Good product. Except mine arrived without the easy application top, came with regular cap, hard to apply. Other then that its a good product.</li>
            <li> I been using this oil in my nape area for a few weeks now I like the feel of the oil but I still don&#x27;t have growth I will use till gone</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not sure about the results as I have not used it long enough.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, have been using this product 4 times a week. Very satisfied with the product so far.Will update results</li>
            <li> Love this oil have seen a improvement in my hair</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice my hair growing faster, maybe...?&lt;br /&gt;However, every time I apply it, it makes my hair look like I haven&#x27;t showered in years. I can&#x27;t be washing my hair everyday, because it&#x27;s not good for the scalp, and I don&#x27;t even have oily scalp or skin, but this product makes it look awful...&lt;br /&gt;Also, my boyfriend doesn&#x27;t like the smell :(</li>
            <li> I Do Not Like The Smell, But I LOVE THE RESULTS!</li>
            <li> I have not been using this product for very long but i can REALLY see a difference in the condition of my hair. My hairline is growing in and i can see a little more thickness on my crown. I will definitely give this product a couple more months to see what happens!</li>
            <li> Hey, not overnight but in app 3 months I have hair where I haven&#x27;t had it for years, this works!!</li>
            <li> Product is good.  It works slowly.  One must be patient with this product.  After 3 bottles, I started to see signs of growth.</li>
            <li> This product does work, it is greasy so you can&#x27;t apply and then go out.  I usually put it on in the evening and keep it on for a few hrs.  My hair has never looked so healthy!</li>
            <li> The product was great !!!!!</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t work, Shinmen works better, comes in an oral vitamin and liquid drops.</li>
            <li> I had bad allergic reaction and the product didn&#x27;t do what it suppose to do!!  The smell wasn&#x27;t good either</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for about a month on my daughter&#x27;s hair....her hair seems to be growing a lil, like a 1/2 inch growth. Its more mositurized and manageable! Im looking forward to more positive results</li>
            <li> This is a really good product if you have natural hair.  It did help tremendously with growth.  Only issue is if you do any chemical process, you have to wait two weeks before and after, due to drying effects from the sulfur.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great will buy again only had it a week had a hair cut now a small fro</li>
            <li> ok so im not sure but maybe im over reacting... i just started using this oil 1 week ago &amp; im pretty sure my hair just grew almost a 1/4 of an inch....  WOW !  Im going to take a picture today of my hair &amp; i will review again in 1 month...  im going to try your amaka oil too ! can&#x27;t wait !&lt;br /&gt;ps: my hair is chemically treated (light blonde), so i waited 2 weeks after processing as suggested... i am also using coconut oil in my hair everyday which is keeping it moisturized &amp; soft... to prevent dryness from sulfur too ! :)</li>
            <li> I love this product and 4 oz isn&#x27;t enough!!! It definitely works and smells like peppermint I&#x27;ve been using it every night since I recieved it in the mail! It helps make my hair feel soft and look healthier! I will be ordering again but the 8 oz refill next! The money is worth it! And it helps my hair growth too!</li>
            <li> The product looks like it&#x27;s beginning to work but, I will take more than one bottle to do the trick.</li>
            <li> Weights the hair down.</li>
            <li> This product did not grow my hair, instead it thinned it out and broke off my ends. My hair was actually a whole inch SHORTER than when I first started!!!! I have started using jbco and that seems a lot better. I had such high hopes, even liked it on fb and all. The smell didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> This product show a little progress I see a little grey strain growing in the thin places around my hair line I will subject this product too anyone.</li>
            <li> Final update: I get my relaxer in 2 days.  I have used this oil for 4 weeks. The hair growth was the exact same amount as when I didn&#x27;t use the oil.  I will continue to use the oil because I have had very little shedding and breaking since using this oil, but NO GROWTH generated by this oil.&lt;br /&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E oil actually grows hair out quickly, but due to a RECONSTRUCTOR disaster (which followed the use of a horrible shampoo), a lot of my hair broke off.  Some of it is less than 1/4 of an inch, while the rest is 6 inches.  Because it is sooooo uneven, I need to grow my hair out quickly.  I ordered this product based upon the recommendation of another website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that I am hesistant about the hair growth claims.  Most of the reviews on their website were written on August 30, 2012, which means they likely are fake.  In addition, one reviewer claims she started using the product September 27th, but the review was dated August 30th.  Realizing that the reviews are likely fake, I don&#x27;t expect any hair growth, BUT....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product arrived on the very day I got a relaxer.  I started using it that day, so in 5 weeks I will know if it provided hair growth quicker and more than the Vitamin E oil and Murad I have been using.  I will update and upgrade my review if the hair growth occurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update #1: It has been about 3 weeks.  I have not seen miraculous hair growth.  I think it has grown about 1/4 of an inch.</li>
            <li> I wonder if the sulfur is to much for my hair. I love all the oils that&#x27;s in it, but I now have more breakage. I was using it 3x&#x27;s a week.</li>
            <li> I just have a week with it and I am putting it Mondays wendsdays and Fridays and so far so good I have about a inch all ready growing on me!</li>
            <li> I massage my scalp with this oil.  I make sure I keep a bottle in my frige.  Something is making my hair grow this must be it.  I do like this oil using a little the smell is not too bad especially with the whipped ginger cream.  thank you.</li>
            <li> I purchased liquid gold a little over 9 wks ago and have been using it only Mondays, Wednesday&#x27;s, and Fridays. My hair grew from line one on my t-shirt to line 5 in these 9 wks. I will continue to use the product until March and will update again about my growth journey. I love this product!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil a few weeks ago and started using it after I shaved off all my hair. I was skeptical because I never thought an oil would grow my hair but it does work. I had half an inch of growth within 2 weeks. My hair grows out straight before it starts to curl, so it was very easy to tell how much it has grown. The oil appears to be clear with yellow specks from the sulfur. However, it is very oily. I apply the oil on my scalp and massage and the oil that gets on my hair gives a beady appearance. Almost as if the oil doesn&#x27;t dissolve well on hair. I ended up hair to wrap my head with a scarf to soak up the oil before heading out the house unless I use it at night. It works and I may continue to buy it, but I have to wash my hair each night while using it due to how oily it is. Make sure to shake well while using because the sulfur settles at the bottom of the bottle. The smell is strong but in my opinion, it does not smell awful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the trying stage - hope all the rave reviews turn out to be true and it does for me what it did for others.  The seller included a 10% off coupon for the next order - good deal.</li>
            <li> It defiantly made my hair feel healthier :-)! It leaves an interesting smell after is washed it out ! Great product:-) if you can&#x27;t leave it in  your hair at work like me .. Use peppermint oil to disguise the smell! It&#x27;s not that bad though ,but my hair is definitely healthier since I started using this product .</li>
            <li> This product has a smell to it so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it three stars but other than the smell it really works. My hair grew a inch longer in three and a half weeks. Results are different per person but it works for me.</li>
            <li> I personally love this product. My hair typically grows very slowly, however after applying this to my scalp, it sprouts like a weed within a two week period. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because this product is really that amazing or because my scalp and hair absolutely love sulfur which is very potent in the oil blend. The scent may be a little intolerable for sensitive noses. Some days after application, the scent is so strong and nauseating I want to rinse my hair out which is the only reason why I gave this product four stars instead of five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product should be applied on a regular basis to achieve results. It doesn&#x27;t have to be used daily, but using it once a week won&#x27;t benefit you any, or at least not substantially. Even though the essential oils in the blend are supposed to prevent drying, the sulfur may still have some drying effects and therefore you might want to keep grease or oil handy just in case. I don&#x27;t have any problems with drying, but hey, everyone is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warning: this product may not be for everyone. Though sulfur allergies are rare and the hair and scalp typically benefit from sulfur, if you have any worries that sulfur may aggravate your scalp in any way, *stay clear of this product*. You don&#x27;t want to risk hair fallout. Liquidhairgold has many other products to choose from that do not have sulfur that may work for you. I purchase my products off of the site. I really enjoy the way the creator of liquidgoldhair doesn&#x27;t push her products on her customers and they have a wonderful staff there to answer any question regarding hair care, even if it is unrelated to the products. Now *that* is what I call customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: this review is a customer review. I am in no way linked to the liquidhairgold creator or franchise whatsoever</li>
            <li> I rated this product a one because of the fact that I did not see my results withing four weeks, I do not admire its smell, and I did not receive the Essentials Blend Oil. Instead they gave me the Sulfur Based Oil.</li>
            <li> I did like that it wasn&#x27;t greasy or thick but as far as growing hair, any hair growth was negligible.  I&#x27;d have to say I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the results.</li>
            <li> Strong smell . Bt overall I really live this product !!! ☺️👏👏</li>
            <li> I am using this product all the time.  See results after several use.  Will reorder again and highly recommending to purchase this item.</li>
            <li> Im a natural girl but I can always tell when I have new growth my hair is shoulder length but I want to be bra strap length and I  thought maybe this product would help it helped with sealing in moisture and prepping for my twist outs but I didn&#x27;t care for it</li>
            <li> this doesnt smell as bad as MTG but so far i have no other complaints. Im using 2 times a day in combination with MTG and Eqyss Mega Tek. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil it has slowed down my husbands hair loss.</li>
            <li> Its very very fort.  Smells terrible and  remover the silver and gold of my jewlery</li>
            <li> t&#x27;s a little too sticky for my taste. i don&#x27;t like the odor.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my hair feel. I smells good too</li>
            <li> I am still waiting for good results. Smells good to me.</li>
            <li> I had to wait a while for the product as it came from overseas but it actually came before its estimated arrival date. It&#x27;s easy to apply and from the first application I could feel its stimulating qualities. I&#x27;ve so far experienced an increase in my normal hair growth. After two weeks I saw about half an inch which is double my normal rate of growth. I&#x27;m very happy with this increase.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> It works great after first time use. The downside about it is that it is very oily and it makes your head feel really warm from lights.</li>
            <li> It smells nice..the sulfur is not over powering</li>
            <li> Did not see any significant growth with this product.  Also dried my hair out.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> My hair personally gets dry very quickly when using different products. This product didn&#x27;t leave my hair badly dried but it was a little dry. I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks and I&#x27;m already seeing some results.  I will suggest using this product but if your hair is dry, try a natural moisturizing product such as coconut/jojoba oil a half hr before use.</li>
            <li> Love this product i recommend it to anyone trying to grow there hair</li>
            <li> I add it to my &#x27;hair growth concotion&#x27; and it is working wonders!</li>
            <li> So far ok.  Hope  to see results by end of bottle.</li>
            <li> this stuff work great...the smell is strong. But this stuff made my hair grow and, im  still using this product. When im done with this I will be buying more</li>
            <li> loved it for a while, hair does grow, but believe it causes scalp breakout and it was recommended to a friend and it was to strong her hair fell out. It would be great on someone with coarse hair, but should not be used daily.</li>
            <li> my hair grow really fast with this product</li>
            <li> Good product.  Not too heavy.  Lightly scented.</li>
            <li> I brought this item because I heard some good reviews about it. It have a bad smell but its okay after a while. Too much will make you have headaches. I didnt see no new growth besides what I already experience. I wiuldnt buy it again</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product. It does what it says. I personally mix it with some olive oil as my scalp becomes sensitive when I use it as is on a daily basis. It still does the job. (My hair is natural as in Afro-descent natural.) I have a dry/itchy scalp and it has helped some. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 6 to 8 months. I am have my hair highlighted...well my hair would NOT grow past a certian point and it just stayed at that lenght for years and years .... UNTIL I STARTED USING THIS PRODUCT!!! My hair has grown about 5 inches in the time I have been using this-- I have tried everything...This is the stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it 2-3 times a week only wash it out when I have to shampoo only 2-4 times a month... the other days I use 2 tbs. baking soda mixed with 2 cups water to wash, I do that fast and than rinse with 2tbs apple cider vininger to two cups of water&#x3D; leave that solution on all shower (as long as you can) than end with a good detangling conditioner on the ends of my hair. Amazing, Amazing, Amazing...I have spent years and thousands of dollars trying to get my hair to grow&#x3D; THIS IS THE KEY! AMAZING...</li>
            <li> Liquid Gold Hair Growth Oil Sulfur based and upon first use my hair began to fall out. It has been three weeks since I used this product and my scalp is breaking out and my hair is just starting to slow down on falling out. I do not recommend using this product! I have cried from all the hair loss.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I picked up a bad nervous habit of pulling the split ends off my hair, and over time that&#x27;s caused a lot of damage, negated any hair growth &amp; even shortened my hair in some places, and made it uneven. I started using this product and noticed my hair finally getting longer despite my bad habit, as did my mom and a close friend, and seeing actual growth has become an incentive for me to really try and stop myself from messing with the ends! I applied 2-3 times a week at nights, then washed it out in the morning so my hair wouldn&#x27;t look so oily, but based on what other reviews say to use (just a few drops), I think I used a bit too much per application. My scalp got a little itchy after using the oil, but that may again have been due to too much product. In the future, I may try applying a small amount once a day and washing twice a week. The smell is mild and not at all unpleasant. I found it well-priced and effective, and I&#x27;ll definitely be getting more when this bottle&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> In four weeks i saw results!! Just hate the oily feeling and smell of it lol that why its four stars lol</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry. This products works very good and keeps my hair and scalp moisturized</li>
            <li> This product gave me really bad headaches and my hair began to shed excessively. I gave it one star because i did notice growth but whats the point if its just gonna give you thin shedding hair. MY opinion Don&#x27;t Buy.</li>
            <li> This product does stimulate growth but it also makes ur hair shead or at least mine did:-(&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking to dilute it with oil just to be able to finish the bottle out.</li>
            <li> I asked a former friend of mine to shape me up and she scalped me completely bald all the way to bottom my ears!  Not a good look especialy for a female! SMH......I ordered this oil and received it within two days! I started using it immediately and although this oil is a llttle smelly it doesn&#x27;t linger too long! I&#x27;ve been using it on my scalp everyday! My 4B hair is short and natural so I wash it  about three times a week to avoid build up! Within a week I was no longer bald in the back! Within two weeks my hair (which was a 2 TO 1.5 inch twa) had grown another half an inch all over and where i was completely BALD in the back ! My hair normally only grows half an inch in an entire month! I now going into my third week of using this product and am so happy ! I hope that this product is around  forever! I Luv it! BTW  I&#x27;ve tried MTG, Wild Growth Oil and Boundless Tresses ,but this is the best of all of those oils! CAUTION if you are allergic to sulfur don&#x27;t use! It&#x27;s one of the main ingredients.! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 5/06/13 I just reordered another bottle today! In a month my hair grew enough to be able to get box braids ! Although my nape ( where I was completely bald) isn&#x27;t quite long enough to be braided yet it is well covered by my braided extentions and will be able to be braide within a month! I also started taking Natrol biotin 10,000mg ! My hair is getting much thicker from taking them ! Like I said before, the oil is kinda stinky but this oil works! The only other con is these braids I have in  will not last as long because i already have some new growth coming in, but I CAN DEFINIELY DEAL WITH THAT!:)</li>
            <li> I just began using this product so I don&#x27;t know how it works yet but the aroma of it is great.  It makes my hair so soft and mananageable. I would recommend this to a friend because it makes my hair easier to work with.</li>
            <li> I can most definitely see that the product works, my hair feels a lot thicker than it did from last month. My only downside is the strong smell. When using this product make sure you are either outside or away from other people. The smell is strong for 5 mins but fades away. When in the house i recommend you turn on the fan or else your room will be smelling, but other than that it gets the job done, i look forward to buying another bottle once im done.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what I was expecting, but this oil does a good job of moisturizing my hair.  The scent takes a little getting used to, but I&#x27;m sure with consistent use you will barely notice it.  A little goes a long way!  Haven&#x27;t seen any growth, but again, with consistent use I&#x27;d probably be reporting different results.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t think this product is good at all. It smells terrible when you put it on your hair. It gives me a headache. i did not see any signs of growth while using this product.</li>
            <li> UPDATE I use this stuff every so often. I try to use it right after my shower, after my hair has air dried. I try to use it for a least a few weeks then lay off of it for a while. I do notice my hair is growing when using this stuff. I braid my hair, I&#x27;ll either do two side french braids or a regular french braid and then I&#x27;ll sleep with a satin sleep cap on. I figure I&#x27;ll leave it on as long as I can. I will also use other oils on my hair when I&#x27;m using this to get extra benefit. My hair loves avocado oil, so I put this on my roots and avocado on the rest of my hair. I&#x27;m still only using a few drops each time. I do notice when I&#x27;m using this stuff I lose a lot less hair. But I don&#x27;t want to use it every single day because I heard that your body gets used to it after a while and you lose the benefit. But I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of hair, I have medium/fine type of hair, and it can look thin if I don&#x27;t have a blunt cut. With doing one length blunt cuts I have noticed more thicker ends. I stopped co washing my hair because it just doesn&#x27;t work for me and I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in how this performs. I am trying to use my shampoo with the sulfates and go to sulfate free stuff because I want thicker hair, or I&#x27;ll at least try going sulfate free for a while to see if there is any difference.   I got this for naturally growing out my hair. My hair growth ranges every month from a half a inch to a little over a little over a half a inch every month. I finally figured out that my scalp doesn&#x27;t like cones, like dimethicone and amodimethicone, well anything with cone at the end. I found it they are very dehydrating on hair if you don&#x27;t moisturize first. I&#x27;m using up all my cone items then I&#x27;ll be switching to more natural/organic items. So I don&#x27;t want to use this with cones on my scalp. I do notice when I use this overnight my pillow smells like this stuff. So I have to put a sleeping cap on. With this stuff my hair grows really fast, like a inch or so every month when I&#x27;ve used it for a few months in a row without using cones. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff on and off for a long time, I don&#x27;t want my scalp getting used to it. It says to conditioner wash and sulfate free wash the hair. Well I&#x27;ve tried co-washing and my hair gets really oily faster when I do. Then I&#x27;ve tried sulfate free, I got the say yes to carrots and I don&#x27;t mind it, but it seems really drying to hair. I use a sodium laureth sulfate shampoo, the less harsh sulfate.n using it up and by then I&#x27;ll be happy and no longer need it. I will be taking other vitamins and supplements, like algae and other stuff that&#x27;s good for me. I am still researching all the natural supplements that are out there. I do put organic coconut oil in my hair and scalp after I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I ended up cutting off 14 inches of hair and got home decided that I absolutely hated how short my hair was. So I went online and looked at what I could do to make my hair grow faster. I found the liquid gold. And sure enough within a week my hair grew 1/2 an inch. Of course that&#x27;s not a lot and I don&#x27;t expect quick results. However, I do know that it is helping. I have been using it for almost a month now and have nothing negative to say. It does not leave my hair oily or greasy. I love the scent. So far so good and I will continue using it until my hair is longer.</li>
            <li> My her love this oil so much I&#x27;m going to buy more soon</li>
            <li> A great product. It feels wonderful on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have Caucasian hair that has been falling out a lot especially in the last few months.  I went to a Dermatologist and she told me to use men&#x27;s Rogaine. When I looked at the box it clearly shows it will only work on hair loss in the middle and back of your head. Not on patchy spots. So, I tried using hair powder, like Joan Rivers Great Hair Day and Toppik.  These help when you need to go out and hide thinning hair.  But, I wanted to find a permanent solution to my hair problem.  I found Liquid Gold.  have been using the bald spot treatment for about 6 weeks, I made sure to follow their regimen, after I put the oil on my scalp I would massage my scalp for 5 minutes, it takes me awhile since I have a lot of bald spots.  And I co-washed my hair(Washing your hair with hair conditioner.)  I haven&#x27;t seen much growth, and I was disappointed.  But, one day I noticed that all the sulfur was on the bottom of the bottle.  I wondered if this is maybe why my hair hasn&#x27;t grown.  I decided to give it another try, I now shake the bottle up, each time I use it.  Also my hair dried out.  After going back to their site, I read about each product. And found out you should use the Amaka Oil for moisture.  So, I ordered the it, to use as a deep conditioner. I called the the company and left a message, they returned my call within the 24 hour time period they promised.  And I also had another question that I emailed to them yesterday.  They responded within one day.  I think this is a good sign.  I have also heard good things about their products. I&#x27;m going to try again and see what happens.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad as for growth to early to tell just been using it for a few days. Will update later</li>
            <li> Delivery was faster than expected. It came with clear, understandable, step by step instructions on how to use the product. Although I can only comment on the order portion of the product bc I haven&#x27;t had an opportunity to use it long enough to see results...I would like to add that people who complain about the smell obviously can not read or understand what is in the product! SULFUR, yes, it is has a strong smell. Don&#x27;t buy the product then complain about it when it doesn&#x27;t smell like flowers...c&#x27;mon!</li>
            <li> work great on my hair because I have really dry scalp and it help a lot it been two weeks I have been using this hair product and I can notice some hair growth.</li>
            <li> i have not even received this product yet, but after purchasing i realized that this product is made for african-american women, they have a different hair texture that can soak up more oils so im sure this wont work. im dissapointed that its not specified in the description. i need to figure out how to return this or i just wasted $13.:(</li>
            <li> I have to admit I was hesitant about purchasing this item due to it being sulfur based and I have extra sensitive skin and seem to be allergic to everything.  But after using this for a month I have to say I&#x27;m glad I purchased, happy with the results and will definitely be repurchasing.  I didn&#x27;t have any reactions to the sulfur.  I am currently transitioning and have been keeping my hair in protective styles (cornrows or wigs w/braids underneath) and the applicator tip makes this product very easy to apply.  The smell was a bit strong the first few applications, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me/not noticeable.  The oil does absorb quickly.  Another happy customer!!</li>
            <li> First off my hair sheds allot. Due to surgeries and stress it was chunking off in clumps...! i was going bald. My hairdresser said changing diet and taking care of hair is automatic growth. Granted that may of helped but I put this in my head on hair as instructed, i stopped washing my hair as often and haven&#x27;t colored it or used harmful products in a month . Their has been at least 2 1/2 inch growth and it has thickened over last month, slow and steady it does seem to be working, only thing i think is my skin sensitive, i broke out a lil around side burns and in head here and there-it does say like anything else do an allergy test first, to me it works!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve been using it every other or two days and so far it&#x27;s okay.  It is a little drying to my scalp so I just make sure I moisturize my hair on the days I use it and it&#x27;s fine.  I&#x27;ll come back and update if I experience any growth or any other issues...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this everyday but I think it helps to keep my dandruff in control.  I like the ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does not grow hair, it only adds oil to your scalp.</li>
            <li> The sulfur in this product irritated my scalp. I&#x27;m guessing that I didn&#x27;t clarify enough and I may have added too much per week and at a time. Great ingredients nonetheless!</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to get directly on the scalp, and it also has a burning sensation. It smells bad, but mainly very difficult to get directly on the scalp in the problem  areas. Do not like this product at all!!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work and smell was strong.</li>
            <li> I ordered mine a few days ago. I haven&#x27;t received it in the mail yet but I&#x27;m very excited to try it. I&#x27;m African-american and I&#x27;m 3 months and 4 days post relaxer but I plan on relaxing maybe tomorrow so that I&#x27;ll be able to accurately track my growth. I cannot wait to try this out and I will most definitely be coming back with another review!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this to help with my hair growth but I think the sulfur is causing me to break out. Putting it around my edges has made my forehead break out in little bumps. I never get acne so I&#x27;m guessing this is the cause of it. I have seen growth, but I&#x27;ve also been taking hair vitamins with extra biotin and using Wild Growth hair oil. Since I&#x27;ve cut back on using this the bumps seem to have slowly begun to go away. I&#x27;ll start using this only once a week, and keep everyone updated. I&#x27;d never used anything with sulfur in it, so I didn&#x27;t know how my skin would react. I was using this everyday because I just did the big chop, and am in a rush to get my hair back on track. That could and most likely is the problem. Shipping was fast, and I got it before I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I have my hair in braids. I used this product and my hair sprouted under my braids. I cleanse my scalp to avoid buildup! And use tea tree oil to prevent drying. Love this product</li>
            <li> Although it smells nice it felt a little gritty to me. I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference while using this product.</li>
            <li> Well it&#x27;s very moisturizing and I like the scent, however I haven&#x27;t seen a lot of growth as of yet, so lets just give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to really say if this product works or not because I haven&#x27;t been consistent with it, but I&#x27;m going to try it for at least a month to see if it works, then I&#x27;ll update again. Besides that, it smells really bad. Even the bottle itself smells like rotten eggs. In the morning, I wash it out with a cleansing conditioner. Also, it&#x27;s good to just use a little bit on your scalp. If you use too much, you&#x27;ll get headaches.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair greasy feeling, would recommend using it at night. It really only made my hair thicker, not longer.</li>
            <li> When I first started using liquid gold hair growth oil I thought it was just my imagination that my hair was growing at an exponential rate. But within the first week I realized that this stuff was really working very fast.  There is a mild sensation for about ten minutes after use to let you know that it is working.  My hair is growing quicker than normal and I am very happy with the results I&#x27;m seeing so far.  Worked better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used on my hair, this is a keeper!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to know if it works. I like the way it smells, but my hair looks dirty. Maybe I need more practice getting it on properly. I don&#x27;t care if old ladies aren&#x27;t supposed to look good with long hair. I&#x27;ve had short hair for years, and I&#x27;m tired of it. If it works, I&#x27;ll put up with dirty looking hair when I&#x27;m not going anywhere. There&#x27;s always hats!</li>
            <li> the delivery was great.  The product work as stated.  I will continue to use this product.  With continous use, I am looking forward to the results i am looking for</li>
            <li> I swear by this product. So far, I&#x27;ve ordered two bottles for myself and two for my aunt and my mom. The smell is a bit overbearing. I massage this into my hair before bed, wrap it in a silk scarf and sleep with it. Then, I wash it out the next morning because the smell is just god awful. Lol! But, it makes my natural curls look so much healthier and less frizzy than usual. I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months and my hairs grown about an inch or two. My favorite hair growth product thus far.</li>
            <li> Not sure if worked because I didn&#x27;t do a before and after length check. The smell was awful, but I was already warned about that. I think ill purchase it again, and this time measure my success.</li>
            <li> The oil really softened up my roots.  I am not sure about the growth properties because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough but I feel like I have gotten some new growth so I am hopeful it is working.  Overall I would keep using it to keep my roots soft and scalp moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen some hair growth. You&#x27;ll have to keep using it to see a lot of growth. Over all a good product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s does a great job I have seen results 😀</li>
            <li> The smell is awful.... I sent a request to the seller to exchange the product for the essential oil formula but still have not received a response.  The smell lingered for a while after I washed my hair so I decided that I would not be able to use the product.</li>
            <li> i usually dont write reviews but this desevers one, i have been using this for two weeks straight and i have seen results</li>
            <li> I love this product. You would most definetly get an inch a month with this. It smells the best on the second day after its used. I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Not worth your money.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! !! Will order again</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing use it once saw a different in my hair in a weeks time</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I&#x27;ve recommended it to family &amp; friends.</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair.  It is a very heavy oil; best used at night and cover hair with a satin scarf.  I use it both day &amp; night.  Gives my hair the sheen &amp; texture I was looking for.  It defines my natural curls.  Would recommend Liquid Gold Hair Growth Oil.  Have not use it long enough to see if it really helps my hair to grow.  Will post an update when I order my next bottle.  Oh yeah, it smells nice too!</li>
            <li> This product works great but the odor is a little strong. It is according on what you need a strong head of hair or nice smelling hair.</li>
            <li> I like the hair growth oil. It doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing smell, but I find that it takes so long to absorb that it needs to be done at night. I suggest using a bandana or a shower cap to keep from rubbing off on your pillows or other bedding too. It takes a little while before results appear but they definitely occur. It was probably 3 weeks before I noticed any difference. It&#x27;s just not at all ideal for mornings or on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of the oils, I take hair growth supplement pills ([[ASIN:B00B5OM58U Hair Growth Essentials + FREE Maximum Strength Biotin Tablets]]) to help balance out. Not only do these promote growth, but also strength. The biotin is a standard supplement known for helping not only hair, but nail and skin as well. The strength benefits are the biggest thing. Using the pills when I&#x27;m on the go and the oil when I have extra time has really made an improvement in my overall physical appearance in my face and nails. I like being able to pick and choose what method to use so if you&#x27;re looking to not only grow your hair but strengthen it as well, you could probably benefit from the same type of routine.</li>
            <li> Hmmm I love the smell..but I didn&#x27;t see any good results..I  THINK IT MADE MY HAIR DRY AND I DON&#x27;T LIKE HOW OILY IT IS</li>
            <li> Love this product def buying more saw results within the 1st week if using it!! Very excited Bout this product !</li>
            <li> Love this hair oil. It increased my hair thickness and i like the smell. However the shipping cost to the UK is high and you end up paying more for shipping than the product itself. For these reason I&#x27;m reluctant to repurchase it again The Green Magic hair cream is good but i prefer the oil. If this product is sold in the UK i would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for almost a month now and it definitely does what it says it&#x27;ll do! I&#x27;ve received growth all over, especially in my temple area which is the main reason I purchased this oil. It does take a while to absorb which is why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars. It&#x27;s definitely worth the purchase though.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about one month and can see slight growth on the length of my hair.  What I notice the most is at my temples where my hair was thinning, I now see hair coming back in so it doesn&#x27;t look so thin any longer. Did not expect that and am very happy with this product.  Maybe the sulfur smell might bother some people, doesn&#x27;t bother me, it goes away after a while, but who cares.  It works so I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> i wash my hair every 3rd day ,do towel dry few drop of oil take in my hand and massage scalp .and dryhair with hair dryer and style . every evening just massage few minute with finger .i grow my hair insted of half inch grow three fourth and healthy. just after massage dont brush for while</li>
            <li> I just started using this product.  I had read onions are good for growing hair, but the smell would be difficult to tolerate.  What makes onion beneficial is probably its significant sulfur content.  So, I ordered this product.  The sulfur odor is mild, and more of an undernote, with a mildly spicy topnote.  It is rich, and a little goes a long way.  I discovered putting drops on my fingers and massaging into my scalp was a better option for application.  Use too much and you will go to bed with a greasy head of hair.  Precaution:  remove sterling silver earrings and rings prior to use.  The sulfur content is high enough to turn silver black.  This took me by surprise after first use, and I had to really work on my silver to get the silver shine back.  But, on the other hand if the sulfur content is high enough to &#x27;antique&#x27; silver, it should do wonders for growing hair.  I do have high expectations for this product.  It might be a 5 star product, but it is too soon to say.  I wanted to get the silver info out there now because no such precaution comes with the product.  I want to add that after washing and conditioning my hair the following day it had increased shine and manageability, and decreased frizz and flyaways, looking and behaving like healthy hair.</li>
            <li> ok I came back just to let you know I brought another bottle in march 2013.  I love this product and it does make your hair grow.</li>
            <li> this really works wonders!!!! love it, will use for the entire family.love it, love it, love it, love it, will recommend for my entire family.</li>
            <li> I have been using the oil for approximately three weeks now.  I apply it 3 times a week and massage it in well (sometimes I bend over while massaging so that my blood runs to my head to further stimulate my follicles.  I have noticed that my hair seems a little fuller, healthier and about 1/4 inch longer.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone with unprocessed African American hair.  The smell isn&#x27;t that strong or unpleasant considering the fact that it contains sulfur.</li>
            <li> I bought this item and I&#x27;m going to tell you I&#x27;m not at all pleased with this product. First off it&#x27;s very greasy even if you put a little bit in your head. Second I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month now and I&#x27;ve seen no results at all ! I&#x27;m very depressed with my hair it&#x27;s been the same length for over a year and I&#x27;m not sure what to do. Disappointed. Not even my bangs grew with this product.</li>
