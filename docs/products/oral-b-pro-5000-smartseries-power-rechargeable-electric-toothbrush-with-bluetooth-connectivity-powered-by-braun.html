            <li>Excellent product, I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I have great bright teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Oral B for many years and know it is the best product in its class...</li>
            <li>Makes oral care fun!!!!</li>
            <li>The product is great, I love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing does a great job.</li>
            <li>It feels good using it and it does a good job as a powered</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>My Teeth are now spoiled ( in a good way ).</li>
            <li>I must say that this toothbrush is just as good as the Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li>They are just really good cleaning everything in your mouth.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve loved for years and this costs a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all... a great electric toothbrush, with a handy app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all... a great electric toothbrush, with a handy app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have to learn how to use it by trial and error,then its quite good.</li>
            <li>but in the end it is just a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Keep up the good work guys.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>Arrived on time in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Went from a spin brush to this and my teeth and gums have never looked or felt so good.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been wanting a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>but the delivery service is not as good as the product is.</li>
            <li>I suppose that would be good if you have a child you need to police because they lie about brushing their teeth, but I don&#x27;t need this feature.</li>
            <li>I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for 20+ years and have loved the product all that time.  </li>
            <li>That seems like a good idea, and it seems to work.</li>
            <li>and I got a good deal on this.  </li>
            <li>The choice of speeds is also a good feature that both family members use.</li>
            <li>I loved my Rotodent which died after 10 years.</li>
            <li>It works good, but way overpriced for what you&#x27;re using it for.</li>
            <li>I wish I had this when I was kid, I would have loved to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li>but, since it appeared to be made sturdier and had some features that I loved, I decided to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries I recommend it over the Pursonic for it&#x27;s superior toothbrush features and how it has improved my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries I recommend it over the Pursonic for it&#x27;s superior toothbrush features and how it has improved my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>Good brush, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get in between the teeth as well as described.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush</li>
            <li>Good feel and size.</li>
            <li>The brush seems to do a really good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li>The app us nor good.</li>
            <li>They examine you to see if you are doing a good job or not.</li>
            <li>why am I debating whether the Bluetooth is a good idea?  </li>
            <li>Item is good.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say how good that works</li>
            <li>Good job</li>
            <li>and I have a good experience of it.</li>
            <li>in all, this is a good toothbrush</li>
            <li>Does work good.</li>
            <li>Paired with the Crest ProHealth toothpaste, perfect clean teeth.</li>
            <li>toothbrush works exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>The app may be a nice tool for those learning how to brush their teeth, however it&#x27;s an amusing gimmick for experienced brushers.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my son he is very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Ive always been an oral b fan; really great toothbrush love the vibration where it tells you when ur 30 seconds is done, kinda pricey though</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used all the speeds yet, but very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>very glad I did and feel like my teeth are just cleaner.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, but can think of a couple improvements that would make it a great tool.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used and well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Excellent makes brushing fun</li>

            <li>The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush is effective at brushing and promoting good brushing habits.  </li>
            <li>I had originally loved the Pursonic ultrasonic toothbrush when it worked and liked that it turned off automatically after 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Excellent cleaning and form, fit, function with more bells and whistles than anyone should ever need.</li>
            <li>: Price is great; Cleans teeth very nice giving you that fresh from the dentist&#x27;s office feel&lt;</li>
            <li>Braun Oral-B&#x27;s Pro 5000 SmartSeries electric toothbrush is very sophisticated and cleans effectively and gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>An amazing purchase.</li>
            <li>The bluetooth feature is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>These brushes are on the market and have stayed in the market at many price points because they work, people like them and feel they get good results with them.</li>
            <li>is that you become your own source of peer pressure to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li>bluetooth app is nice but not a necessity.</li>
            <li>This would be a nice gift.</li>
            <li>The application then tracks all of these, providing of course you use them honestly.  </li>
            <li>There are no forums or an effective Q&amp;A section to answer user questions.  </li>
            <li>There are no forums or an effective Q&amp;A section to answer user questions.  </li>
            <li>The toothbrush has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>The brush compartments comes handy for storage.</li>
            <li>I think those are nice features.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice having the brush head tray for the 2 of us that use it, and the travel case (holds to brush heads).</li>
            <li>It also comes with a charger and a charging station (the rechargeable battery lasts up to 10 days based on two, two-minute brushings a day) as well as a handy travel case.  </li>
            <li>It does not have an ultrasonic feature, which I liked on the Pursonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It does not have an ultrasonic feature, which I liked on the Pursonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>It comes with a travel case that protects the handle and 2 brushes nicely tucked to the case so the brush doesn&#x27;t get squeezed or pressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My wife used sonicare but loves to use mine(with her own head).</li>
            <li>but it is a nice feature if you travel with your electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Why pay for something that you can determine on your own?</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is nice.  </li>
            <li>So nice, yes.  </li>
            <li>So nice, yes.  </li>
            <li>iphone app makes the cleanings more effective and helps keep me on a good cleaning schedule.</li>
            <li>iphone app makes the cleanings more effective and helps keep me on a good cleaning schedule.</li>
            <li>This is a high-end, really effective toothbrush.</li>
            <li>spoke to my dentist&#x27;s office and the hygienist said her patients had really good results with the top of the line Oral-B toothbrushes, so she recommended it.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush my mouth always feels clean and with Bluetooth it is like a toy.</li>
            <li>After many more day I still don&#x27;t see my session synced on app and also app does not shows it connected anymore with brush instead is show a manual start/stop button!</li>
            <li>However, I am sincerely impressed with the brushing action of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Much more effective than others.  </li>
            <li>Brushing is easier &amp; more effective with my Oral</li>
            <li>However, I do not think you should spend more money for something that claims to have these amazing features and</li>
            <li>Liked most of the features of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Great powerful toothbrush, but bluetooth isn&#x27;t stable.  </li>
            <li>Bluetooth is meant to bind together a pretty good toothbrush with a smartphone application to make a superior user experience.  </li>
            <li>Bluetooth is meant to bind together a pretty good toothbrush with a smartphone application to make a superior user experience.  </li>
            <li>Nice to now have the best of both after my leap forward several generations of Oral-B</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just not as good (in my opinion) as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush I think this product is very nice.</li>
            <li>I love geeky stuff and what&#x27;s geekier than a toothbrush with bluetooth??</li>
            <li>A truism about change is that to effect change you must be able to measure what you want to change.</li>
            <li>not anything more than an 99 cent egg timer could do for you with a non-powered brush.</li>
            <li>If that is the case you may be the person that enjoys this product more than anyone else.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush (and toothbrushes like it)</li>
            <li>love the travel case this brush comes with.</li>
            <li>the idea of using your phone and the app to brush your teeth better is a non-starter for you then, please, still purchase a powered handle just get a quality one without the BT.</li>
            <li>but it will do everything better than a $2 non-powered brush</li>
            <li>love the travel case this brush comes with.</li>
            <li>the idea of using your phone and the app to brush your teeth better is a non-starter for you then, please, still purchase a powered handle just get a quality one without the BT.</li>
            <li>but it will do everything better than a $2 non-powered brush</li>
            <li>My wife and I both love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased that there is another company competing against Sonicare.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I downloaded the app to my iPhone 5s and it hooked up with the toothbrush instantly, and worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>but it sure beats staring at yourself in the mirror for 2+ minutes and truly makes the brushing session go by in a jiff.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Telling you where you need to spend more time.  </li>
            <li>believe this might be appealing to kids as well.  </li>
            <li>in more ways than one.</li>
            <li>I love my Oral-B Pro 5000.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if they enhance the app it would be entice me to use it more.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been an Oral-B electric toothbrush owner for many years</li>
            <li>It is much better than 5000.  </li>
            <li>Love using it with my iPhone.</li>
            <li>So glad my dentist recommended  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush, but considering what I know now about the app</li>
            <li>After so many days of continuous usage he earns badges.  </li>
            <li>Much better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>I feel like the electric brush covers more surface area.</li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;m doing better and my mouth feels cleaner after each brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some things I would like to see implemented better would be:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to find the app in the iOS market -</li>
            <li>and in fact charging a lot more ?</li>
            <li>For the price it should have come with more than one Brush head.</li>
            <li>I have had better.</li>
            <li>As anyone who uses Oral B electric toothbrushes know, they&#x27;re great and get the job done at a reasonable price for head replacement vs sonicare.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I love gadgets so tinkering with all of the settings was mildly entertaining.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I listened.</li>
            <li>I have been satisfied</li>
            <li>We bought this toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li>also love the travel case.  </li>
            <li>You need to memorize the order of the options and pay attention to how many times you push the button.  </li>
            <li>Love the bluetooth connection...</li>
            <li>love the toothbrush and will buy another when this one wears out in 10 years.</li>
            <li>I was able to go over each tooth with that rotation power.  </li>
            <li>I love how it prompts you to go from quadrant to quadrant.  </li>
            <li>I have not yet been able to pairing the toothbrush with my Samsung S5 and the application.  </li>
            <li>Even though the app and the brush as not formally paired, the application seems to be able to communicate with the brush.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m ok with doing that.</li>
            <li>It would just be creative thinking on the app design side.</li>
            <li>I love using this toothbrush</li>
            <li>You need to use an app to change the settings which include timers (more than 1), speed/intensity, and order of functions.  </li>
            <li>Just what my dentist always pleads me to do in order to keep my teeth in their best shape possible...</li>
            <li>Love the updated Smartphone function.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that I can read the news while brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>I love it; however shop around, it was over-priced.  </li>
            <li>Who uses the bluetooth...and what more does the tongue cleaner do?</li>
            <li>Because you can&#x27;t use the toothbush and track on more than one smartphone.</li>
            <li>More power.</li>
            <li>We just hope that the battery life on this one is better.</li>
            <li>Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li>I love the vibrating timer which helps to ensure brushing is maximized.  </li>
            <li>I love the travel case that comes with it.</li>
            <li>app is interesting.  </li>
            <li>Mostly out of laziness on my part.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is more reliable</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>so I knew I had to invest in a top of the line toothbrush to help</li>
            <li>Each time I keep getting a better model.</li>
            <li>I love this one.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Just wish I could get a splash guard...:)</li>
            <li>This is much more convenient as I often have to spit out the excess toothpaste and saliva that collects in my mouth</li>
            <li>The Oral-B toothbrush heads have also more variety and seem to get between my teeth better.  </li>
            <li>to cleans my teeth better since my teeth are now stain-free.  </li>
            <li>and it met or exceeded my expectations in most categories.for</li>

            <li>They love them.</li>
            <li>- This may not be an issue for most as I have a &amp;#34;smaller mouth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This can be interesting if and when it works.  </li>
            <li>so you get the most of your 2-minute brushing.</li>
            <li>One more thing to sync to your phone.</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The product page uses the word “Bluetooth” more than 25 times and, at the time of this review, mentions ZERO times anything about Bluetooth 4.0.  </li>
            <li>We got this to replace a sonic care that died after 3 years and we both think we like the feel of the Oral better.</li>
            <li>The motor is much better in this unit than the cheaper versions.  </li>
            <li>but it has turned brushing into an informative and enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>I love the app and the statistics.</li>
            <li>(provided you purchase more heads), a travel case, a stand which is also where the unit charges, and a cover for the tray where you place the heads.</li>
            <li>A beep would be better and would not prolong my brushing.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to figure out which mode I am in without turning on the brush and brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li>Most ask if you have been brushing and flossing and take your word for it.</li>
            <li>battery lasts for almost 2 weeks, even though I brush more than the 2 minute minimum they recommend.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, unless they included replacement brush heads, which they recommend you change every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She said my gums and teeth never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful brush, nice flexibility on the settings, no real reason to use the Bluetooth unless you desire to change settings.as been 90 days since you have replaced your brush.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful brush, nice flexibility on the settings, no real reason to use the Bluetooth unless you desire to change settings.</li>
            <li>In a bathroom where so many germs float, shouldn&#x27;t the brush come with a cover?&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>Fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love the toothbrush itself but putting a holder without the brushes is deceitful to me.</li>
            <li>Love the toothbrush and makes my teeth feel cleaner....</li>
            <li>Works much better than the Sonicare we had before.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>It okay,</li>
            <li>I would give this toothbrush more stars if I could use the app.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning leaves your mouth feeling like a trip to the dentist office more than a manual brush.</li>
            <li>Bluetooth connection to your phone is interesting but</li>
            <li>That said, it really does do a great job cleaning.</li>
            <li>I have been using a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush, which I&#x27;ve been very happy with, but this one is quite different.</li>
            <li>and I have been quite pleased with that one.</li>
            <li>However, that said, it does a better  job of cleaning your teeth than most battery powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, comfortable grip in my hand.</li>
            <li>This brush is drastically better in almost every way.  </li>
            <li>Third, which makes this the best thing ever, is bluetooth.  </li>
            <li>Maybe after insurance pays off I will be able to purchase another one of these...</li>
            <li>like so many probably do -- not paid attention at all while brushing and just let my thoughts wander until the rogue thoughts turn to a realization that I must have been doing this brushing thing for a while and that I should probably stop to go watch</li>
            <li>five more minutes of TV before bed.  </li>
            <li>And there are more entertaining benefits to the Bluetooth aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth look noticeably better after use.</li>
            <li>This model is better than the 1000 I had before.  </li>
            <li>You have to brush well and the right way in order to keep your teeth in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to brush well and the right way in order to keep your teeth in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The x-hair toothbrush head gives an amazing feeling of clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was recommended by my dentist who is very happy to see my gums healthy after a long battle with gum disease</li>
            <li>so you get the kind of clean</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t a wonderful job cleaning, it is pretty quiet, the settings are great, and my teeth feel extremely clean.</li>
            <li>I love that it pulses when it’s time to change quadrant and pulses more strongly when I’ve reached my target</li>
            <li>My teeth is very clean.</li>
            <li>First, it does a good job at tracking everything.  </li>
            <li>The new design is not that great, it does not seal well to protect when cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good but not as good as my former model.</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold, and the overall brushing experience is a very pleasant one, and a satisfying one as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is comfortable to hold, and the overall brushing experience is a very pleasant one, and a satisfying one as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Had the Triumph before this, and honestly liked it better as it had the timer right on the face of the handle.  </li>
            <li>My teeth never felt so clean!</li>
            <li>If you want to brush your teeth more often or more effectively you have to figure out some way of measuring what you are doing now to make positive changes.</li>
            <li>Awesome as I expected it would be.</li>
            <li>I expected to be impressed with the features on this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Kind of fun,</li>
            <li>Feels really good, cleans really well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Cleans very well and battery life is good for 5 days after fully charged.</li>
            <li>I found after using this toothbrush that I already have good brushing technique and the app didn&#x27;t really do much for me.  </li>
            <li>I found after using this toothbrush that I already have good brushing technique and the app didn&#x27;t really do much for me.  </li>
            <li>if he is applying too much pressure, when it is time to move on to another area of the mouth, and of course signals the end of the optimum two minute brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first purchased when I was getting braces to ensure I&#x27;d get a good clean.  </li>
            <li>In any case, even without the odd bluetooth connection to a phone, the toothbrush itself is very nice and a good substitute or even alternative to a Sonicare.</li>
            <li>The original Pro 5000 displayed brushing time and I suspect not too many of us often refer to it.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and cleans my teeth so well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to recharge and three people easily use this one toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It connected to her phone easily</li>
            <li>The app was easy to use (but I balked at the information on my that it wanted).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a way to easily tell what cleaning mode without having to use the app.</li>
            <li>The app is easy to use and reminds you to floss and brush your tongue.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush is easy to charge and click onto the stand.</li>
            <li>However, I do not think you should spend more money for something that claims to have these amazing features and really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Easy use.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Downloading the app was easy.</li>
            <li>Unlike the more basic models, I&#x27;m also happy it comes with a travel case.  </li>
            <li>users commented about the vibration being too strong.  </li>
            <li>I thought that would make the cleaning action better, but I find it&#x27;s not as good.  </li>
            <li>It works really good highly recommended</li>
            <li>its easy to use and bluetooth works fine.</li>
            <li>While I refuse to download and use phone app that goes along with this item (it acts for access to way too much information), I am very pleased with the toothbrush itself.  </li>
            <li>Used Soniccare for years and tried this one due to the good reviews but just not as good as the sonic care.</li>
            <li>Evidently the product no longer includes the handy timer.  </li>
            <li>Along with the free Oral-B app it has helped me keep track of my brushing habits, improve them and even make sure I am doing it right!</li>
            <li>If you want to be sure you get the best job done on your teeth at home, every day, then this might be worth the due diligence to you.</li>
            <li>Have had an Oral B toothbrush for probably 15 years and always loved it - it was just time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Yes, motorized brushes have been around a while, but this is a fine example of how improved they have become and the advancement of maintaining oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess I wont be able to enjoy the full experience of this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>The toothbrush itself is fine.</li>
            <li>tOOTH BRUSH SEEMS FINE</li>
            <li>Works fine, but I can&#x27;t get the battery to charge fully.</li>
            <li>It worked fine.</li>
            <li>But combining my waterpic with this thing makes them feel like they&#x27;ve been finely polished, and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is a component of using the tooth brush if you have your smart phone handy to watch the timer and sync up your progress.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush may seem a little spendy but it is an amazing investment and keeps you and your dentist happy.</li>
            <li>Oral-B app is a huge 32mb in size.</li>
            <li>Oral-B app is a huge 32mb in size.</li>
            <li>Others might find it useful and interesting but</li>
            <li>By downloading a free app, it will connect with your Smartphone so you can keep track of your brushing progress.  </li>
            <li>To work with the free app on your phone.  </li>
            <li>This is a great gift for any kid or teen.</li>
            <li>Fairly quiet, does a great job.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush looks great in white.</li>
            <li>Pros:  comfortable design.  </li>
            <li>Why are they scrimping and being cheap...</li>
            <li>Shows cheap manufacturing</li>
            <li>However, I found the ProWhite 4000 model to be more powerful.  </li>
            <li>The programmers did not consider this important.  </li>
            <li>But this is more powerful than a $1 brush so</li>
            <li>Great electric toothbrush and a low price!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, the toothbrush is comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
            <li>I do like the idea that I can customize the routine to fit suggestions from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this should be available now.  </li>
            <li>I do like the idea that I can customize the routine to fit suggestions from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think this should be available now.  </li>
            <li>The app primarily shows the timer with the associated quadrants one should be brushing during that period of time.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>friends laugh at me for having a toothbrush that syncs bluetooth with my phone, but it has def made a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li>I have had no problem getting the Oral-B toothbrush head to go in every available tooth surface.  </li>
            <li>I bought this on the recommendation of my dentists hygienist, who pointed out that these Oral-B toothbrushes are about as close as is available to what you see in the dentist office,&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would suggest that they see what is available as these can be pricey.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of cleaning my teeth, but the corresponding bluetooth App on my iPhone is such a joke</li>
            <li>So I have no idea what the light is for.  </li>
            <li>Once you use a great electric brush like this one, you&#x27;ll never go back to manual.</li>
            <li>Either mode will communicate with you through a stuttering sound and feel.</li>
            <li>The item, when upright in its charger, doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my bathroom sink counter at all - which is nice.</li>
            <li>It is absolutely worth either price, but the lower the better, of course.  </li>
            <li>The more measurable something is the more amenable to change</li>
            <li>The best feature is that the brush lights up red when you apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li>travel case is very basic, but nice and a nice feature.  </li>
            <li>Battery life has been good so far over 8 months.</li>
            <li>It seems to be doing a good job so far.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this especially if you have children as this is the perfect toothbrush to train them for some great oral hygiene habits (especially if they enhance the companion app).</li>
            <li>Oral-B is very nicely made from a combination of glossy and rubberized white plastic.  </li>
            <li>very powerful</li>
            <li>All the power to you; it really does clean teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li>All the power to you; it really does clean teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li>This Oral-B brush has fantastic ratings and was really excited about it.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so smooth and clean after each brushing.  </li>
            <li>The new one is great much improved..</li>
            <li>It feels good in the hand and pairing it to the phone is easy enough, if you have bluetooth connectivity at the</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re familiar with the PRO 5000/7000 series of toothbrushes</li>
            <li>The original price seems to be $159.99.</li>
            <li>Enjoying my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I noticed whiter teeth and a more polished look within the first week.  </li>
            <li>Its function is rich.</li>
            <li>An investment into my oral health and definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>Thus, I was originally taken aback by the Oral-B Pro 5000 when it did not shut off automatically when it reached 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in tracking your progress, then you will love this feature.</li>
            <li>in all, I would say the actual brushing without the bells and whistles gives you a wonderful, clean mouth better than a regular, manual toothbrush can.  </li>
            <li>in all, I would say the actual brushing without the bells and whistles gives you a wonderful, clean mouth better than a regular, manual toothbrush can.  </li>
            <li>After the first use, I could feel the improvement in the brush technology, and have been enjoying the feeling of clean teeth.</li>
            <li>(well, she likes me and loves how clean my teeth are).  </li>
            <li>all I care about it whether or not my teeth are clean or not.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The second best feature to the cleaning performance of this brush is its professional timer.</li>
            <li>My teeth are exceptionally clean and shiny after using this brush.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the Bluetooth feature yet but so far, the rest of the essential functions works great!</li>
            <li>My teeth have never felt so clean-</li>
            <li>it makes me feel really clean and refreshed every use.  </li>
            <li>I now look forward to brushing - just to feel how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li>I feel like my teeth get really clean.</li>
            <li>It gives me just from the dentist clean teeth.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt my mouth so clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s equivalent to dentist office clean, without all of the uncomfortableness and pain.</li>
            <li>this clean</li>
            <li>Although courteous over the phone, no one at Oral B was able to give me answers on why my brush and app are not working properly.</li>
            <li>Something special that they follow along with.  </li>
            <li>It make sense to give each tooth special attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really doesnt clean yor teeth any better with it.</li>
            <li>The Sonicare is a high pitched vibration while the Oral-B has more of a pulsating sound...</li>
            <li>Was able to get it at a very reasonable price, $79.99, so it was worth purchasing this version.  </li>
            <li>However, I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars because this toothbrush has many features but only two buttons, and the instructions included with the toothbrush aren&#x27;t very good at teaching you how to use the different functions.</li>
            <li>Holds a long charge,  cleans greatly and the app is fun.</li>
            <li>It did take a full 24 hrs (about) to charge, which I did before I even turned it on.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s cool and neat but</li>
            <li>cool thing about all of that</li>
            <li>I thought the bluetooth connection feature would be cool</li>
            <li>Ever since I started using the Oral-B Pro 4000s and above, my dental hygenist has loved me</li>
            <li>My teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also has Bluetooth, which isn&#x27;t as cool of an add on as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>I feel like I can finally give a good review of this product since we&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now.  </li>
            <li>For the tech savvy or tooth enthusiast, this is a cool gadget.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>Overall a good tooth brush.</li>
            <li>It can also be affixed to a mirror, but too many of my wife&#x27;s magnification mirrors have crashed for that to engender much confidence, either.  </li>
            <li>so it was a good way to try some different brush heads)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop running my tongue over me super clean teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>It could have lasted longer, but it wasnt going at full speed</li>
            <li>even more so that you have to read the whole manual to understand how to access them because the 5000 doesn&#x27;t have a display.</li>
            <li>This is a hyped up product full of gadgets that the world doesn&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a full week without recharging, and still going.</li>
            <li>This is also true about the Feedback function.</li>
            <li>This is also true about the Feedback function.</li>
            <li>The app seems more like a gimmick than a real asset to the process of brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li>The Pursonic customer support was honest and did repair it for free including free shipping and returned it about 3 weeks later.  </li>
            <li>I also love that I can turn the Oral-B toothbrush on or off at will and it remains ready to be turned on again for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the toothbrush head for the Oral-B is much sturdier and is constructed much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the default setting for both toothbrushes as that setting seems to provide a good brushing for my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>the Oral-B is much sturdier and is constructed much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the default setting for both toothbrushes as that setting seems to provide a good brushing for my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>Good tooth brush but the Bluetooth connectivity and App do not work properly.  </li>
            <li>but it really encourages me to brush my teeth, my tongue and floss much more often.  </li>
            <li>(if you stop brushing for more than 30 seconds...to talk to someone or spit, the whole session resets).  </li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about the Pro 5000 is that it seems to be more powerful than my former model which is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Getting to the reality of it, the unit is quite solid, feels good in the hand, in a great base station, and most importantly does a great job cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I love this new toothbrush!</li>
            <li>I love my new toothbrush!</li>
            <li>She loves her Oral-B 5000 Smart Series!!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t do this for the first couple of years with my first Pro 5000 and the accumulated, hidden sludge is best not described.  </li>
            <li>Brush works better than the older model I have</li>
            <li>The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush, mostly made in Germany, 100% more plaque than regular manual tooth brushing.</li>
            <li>The old unit I had was much more comfortable for me to use, it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker</li>
            <li>You have to sync it with your smartphone for it to work properly and guide you into better habits for brushing where you need it most.</li>
            <li>The Pro 5000 is Bluetooth capable which pretty much means it has its own app that is available for your Apple or Android device.</li>
            <li>This is my very first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The app will also record how often and how long you brush for and the brush will retain 20 sessions if you don&#x27;t start the app each time you brush, so if you want a log of your brushing habits, then it would be good for this</li>
            <li>Without the app there&#x27;s not much else to say about it because I cannot really take advantage of many of the most interesting features.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing the dentist compliment him on his new habits instead of telling him he needs to brush more, too.</li>
            <li>love the new brush mechanically</li>
            <li>I noticed that the latest Sonicare unit had a completely new brush head design...</li>
            <li>I was happy with the performance and product life of the previous model, so I stuck with it for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great, just like my previous Oral-B&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is great for when I travel - I don&#x27;t have to take the whole charging platform - even for a week long trip.  </li>
            <li>My final analysis is to save the money for the better toothbrush--the 4000!</li>
            <li>I kept thinking that it isn’t my first time brushing!</li>
            <li>Only 3 more days to get the 30-day &amp;#34;award&amp;#34; from the phone app!</li>
            <li>First, the motor is quieter and seemingly works better than the more basic models.  </li>
            <li>You can feel the clean and tartar being brushed away, strong brush but not so strong as the pulsonix ones which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>apparently the more advanced model comes with this happy face timer and offers different brushing modes.</li>
            <li>My many years old electric toothbrush no longer worked, I needed a replacement &amp; like this model much!!</li>
            <li>Just a little history, my son is a complete joy most of the time.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t use the features since its too much effort to try and guess which will fit your needs.</li>
            <li>This one is a huge improvement - lighter, easier to maneuver, has lights that tell you if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure, plus syncs with an app that can track/analyze your brushing habits.  </li>
            <li>However, they don&#x27;t know what they are missing and what a great job it does on your teeth and gums and keeps a record of it in the process.  </li>
            <li>The handle is comfortable, and I really like the brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Briefly, wins one and two are a no brainer.</li>
            <li>It is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality powered toothbrushes are well worth the investment.ome miscellaneous</li>
            <li>It is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quality powered toothbrushes are well worth the investment.</li>
            <li>They do a fabulous job cleaning, keeping tartar levels low and keeping gums healthy.  </li>
            <li>My life could not be more complete.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re getting the 5 brush modes, a vibration and light-flash pattern every 25% into the cycle and the immensely satisfying finish that the &#x27;3D Action&#x27; brush head oscillation and pulsation provides.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the upgrade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to catch up on some current events while going through the two minute routine.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting from a &amp;#34;smart toothbrush&amp;#34; but this isn&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember how long I had the first one, but it&#x27;s the best part of ten years.  </li>
            <li>shame and fun in brushing teeth.</li>
            <li>For the next day it would turn on on its own.</li>
            <li>: For what it’s worth, my firmware version is: SW-Version 05, P-Version: 01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B App – 2 stars&lt;br /&gt;I’m</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, it noticeably works better and gives me a cleaner feeling than my old electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li>I have had over $20k worth of work put into my teeth</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>but this one is still worth buying.</li>
            <li>The Bluetooth sync is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li>However if you could not get it at a reasonable price, I would skip the Bluetooth functionality and purchase one that is a bit more reasonable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth $100 premium, you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth $100 premium, you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the circular shape of the head, it seems easier and more natural of a shape</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to bring your phone every time you brush, it would be far better.</li>
            <li>sounds, it&#x27;s truly a nice tool to ensure you are using the brush properly.</li>
            <li>The accompanying app can be useful.</li>
            <li>This is really useful and non-intrustive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluetooth app and functionality.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it particularly useful to me -</li>
            <li>I think I would have liked this a lot if I had actually gotten to try it.  </li>
            <li>Bluetooth, I must admit, is really pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This would be a good gift or purchase for someone who doesn&#x27;t have the benefit of a good dentist who tells me what I am doing wrong or right.  </li>
            <li>I frankly think that if its too powerful that can probably have an adverse effect on the enamel of your teeth, so right now</li>
            <li>The nice thing versus my older model is when it&#x27;s fully charged, the blue light turns</li>
            <li>This same exact model has been used by me for many years and has helped tremendously in keeping my teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is the perfect compliment to my Bluetooth toilet that tells my smartphone how close to the center I am peeing each day.  </li>
            <li>I now brush my teeth perfectly and hit every tooth the exact same amount of time each day, and I always pee within 98% accuracy of the center of the bowl.  </li>
            <li>It is just as good as any other Oral-b electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t noticed how much or how gradually the original Triumph 5000 was fading.  </li>
            <li>I chose the 5000 due to the bluetooth, which the 7000 does not have (surprisingly).  </li>
            <li>Yeah right.</li>
            <li>So, if you use it right before bed, it needs to recharge a bit afterward...</li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t open the app the brush will store the session in it&#x27;s own memory and will then sync that session with the first phone that it connects to.  </li>
            <li>However, if you don&#x27;t open the app the brush will store the session in it&#x27;s own memory and will then sync that session with the first phone that it connects to.  </li>
            <li>Really  gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do which is a good thing, Bluetooth part is a bit gimmicky but does motivate you to brush for a full 2 minutes twice a day</li>
            <li>I love the travel case, easy to clean and holds the parts tight (and I lugged it around a suitcase from hotel to hotel for about 4 days.</li>
            <li>Android phone App is very large.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning performance of the Oral-B is high and leaves my teeth squeaky clean and my breath fresh.  </li>
            <li>Lastly, it has a bright red indicator light to let you know when you are pushing too hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing how long 2 minutes</li>
            <li>I am glad to say I never spent the money on the optional device.  </li>
            <li>Like any electric toothbrush virgin, I bled the first time (gross I know – but that was kind of funny).</li>
            <li>I have tried other power brushes before, and this is pretty good at reaching all teeth with comfort to the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dentist gives me a new toothbrush for free every 6 months when I go in to see him.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The one odd thing to note with this newest model is that it flashes ridiculously bright when it&#x27;s charging.  </li>
            <li>The brush head spins super fast and even though it alerts you every 30 secs it will keep on after the 2 minute mark.</li>
            <li>It could be handy if I had memory issues, but really, if I forgot whether I brushed, I&#x27;d just go brush</li>
            <li>Honestly, this has a lot of power and my teeth feel so much cleaner than they do when using just a regular toothbrush!  </li>
            <li>an added perk, if you start getting lolled into a morning stupor while brushing your teeth and spend too much time in one area, the brush wakes you up with bursts of slowing vibrating pulses and a gentle yellowish light to let you know to move on.</li>
            <li>Its kind of expensive but the battery stays charged for about a week which is good if you travel.  </li>
            <li>At this price I am only buying one brush for the whole family and each of us would then have our own heads.  </li>
            <li>At this price I am only buying one brush for the whole family and each of us would then have our own heads.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the Oral-B Pro 5000 is a great toothbrush, I&#x27;d say go for a cheaper power toothbrush if you don&#x27;t care about all the various potential functionalities.</li>
            <li>If you live the US you won&#x27;t be able to download the app, since is only available for the US app store.</li>
            <li>The old Oral-B charger was approved for 100-230v 50/60Hz great for foreign travel.</li>
            <li>seemed to work well for the first 1.5 years...</li>
            <li>B0019ZEVZU Sonicare ]], the Healthy White model,</li>
            <li>how many times you brushed your teeth per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I brush each quadrant for 30 seconds (the built in timer on the toothbrush tells you when your 30 seconds are up by doing a funny rotation of the toothbrush head).  </li>
            <li>I was worried at first when it took well over a day for the battery to fully charge.</li>
            <li>The brush comes with Oral-B&#x27;s advanced brush head, but you can separately order brush heads for sensitive gums, teeth whitening and braces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After two more times and a total of 3 minutes, the brush turns off and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus there are many different heads to choose from to cater to every need.  </li>
            <li>and I love that I can now track if she&#x27;s actually brushing.</li>
            <li>It not only cleans your teeth, but makes your gums feel better.  </li>
            <li>I played with the bluetooth feature a grand total of 2 times and then lost interest in it.  </li>
            <li>was also interested in the &amp;#34;brushing too hard&amp;#34; feature.</li>
            <li>In the pamphlet that was provided with the product, it mentioned that you&#x27;re suppose to get more than one brush head for different kinds of brushing.</li>
            <li>They could do away with the news and local weather feature and add features around which section as a user you send most of your brushing time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We use the basic mode most often.  </li>
            <li>Well I wanted to review this app on android since I recently switched my phone from iOS to Android Motorola latest gen phone.</li>
            <li>After connected first time, it worked and synced well on Android</li>
            <li>After using the toothbrush for close to 3 months, I have never been able to synchronize my off-line brushing sessions with the application even though I’m trying different ways to pair the app with the brush.  </li>
            <li>pretty gut.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric brush</li>
            <li>If the indicator was on the back of the unit, I&#x27;d be able to see it in the mirror while I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my first one.</li>
            <li>The brush will sync with more than one phone, so if everyone remembers to open the app every time they brush, then it will work and the data will all be logged correctly for each user.  </li>
            <li>So if my wife wakes up first and brushes her teeth without connecting her phone, then I connect my phone and start brushing</li>
            <li>The brush will sync with more than one phone, so if everyone remembers to open the app every time they brush, then it will work and the data will all be logged correctly for each user.  </li>
            <li>So if my wife wakes up first and brushes her teeth without connecting her phone, then I connect my phone and start brushing</li>
            <li>the brush itself is first class all the way</li>
            <li>and my teeth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s only one brush head in the packaging, but it is compatible with most Oral-B refills.</li>
            <li>The construction and build quality are first rate</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t figured out the polishing and whitening mode (which is why I bought that thing in the first place) because I got irritated after flipping through 20+ pages.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>I have an earlier version of this product and love it.</li>
            <li>Be aware the product is not as it is described.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought \\&quot;who needs a Bluetooth enabled toothbrush\\&quot; ( we will ignore all the puns about Bluetooth and toothbrush)?  </li>
            <li>it is a really neat feature!</li>
            <li>I now like this feature better because I often take extra time to brush my front lower teeth where I tend to get tartar and stains.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t have enough apps to scroll through already, now we have one for brushing our teeth as well :)&lt;</li>
            <li>you put too much pressure on your brush, a red pressure sensor light will light up.</li>
            <li>If you want the 3-speed settings, two minute timers, etc, I say buy a different brand of brush that better explains how to use the features of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>are all thinking that the idea of a Bluetooth toothbrush is funny</li>
            <li>I will  refer my friends and most likely will be a return customer whenever the opportunity arises.</li>
            <li>The first brush I bought with toothbrush holder etc.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!!  </li>
            <li>It works very well!</li>
            <li>Overall, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It is my first time to use electric tooth brush</li>
            <li>Frankly, I have too many devices already to worry about connecting to blue tooth, trying to figure out the readings.</li>
            <li>love the blue tooth app, I did not want a device on the wall.</li>
            <li>Normally, I do not write reviews unless I&#x27;m absolutely sold on something, or if its something I feel the need to warm people about.  </li>
            <li>It is far superior to a regular high quality</li>
            <li>App works fine, but it&#x27;s more trouble to have to always have the phone at hand or remember to download you brushing data.  </li>
            <li>Your mouth does feel very clean after the actual brushing.</li>
            <li>It seems to clean maybe better than the Sonicare, and if you press too hard the brush pauses and vibrates and lights up, so you really know to press lightly.</li>
            <li>The new travel cases are huge, the older models had a nicer slim case which worked</li>
            <li>I use a waterpic before every brush, and even with the old manual brush method they felt clean after.  </li>
            <li>I had an earlier version of this toothbrush that lasted over 10 years, which gave me such a good impression of the brand that I didn&#x27;t even consider another.</li>
            <li>It really cleans my teeth and is much more thorough than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Love that the brush changes color to Red to indicate too much pressure.</li>
            <li>As far as the Bluetooth and app - I guess it&#x27;s a nifty feature for some people and might be handy for those teaching their children how to brush properly.</li>
            <li>What can the difference between those things really be?&amp;#34;  You may actually find a mode that you&#x27;ll stick with, believing that one of the &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; motions of the brush is better than the others.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it on a regular or deep clean right now, but can&#x27;t be sure since I started pressing the button to change the settings and have no idea now what it is on.  </li>
            <li>Statistics and achievements are also provided so one can see how they&#x27;re doing over time, and receive positive reinforcement.</li>

            <li>/&gt;About eight years ago, a couple of years after getting my first powered brush, my then-GF told me she couldn&#x27;t understand how I kept my teeth so much whiter than hers</li>
            <li>/&gt;About eight years ago, a couple of years after getting my first powered brush, my then-GF told me she couldn&#x27;t understand how I kept my teeth so much whiter than hers</li>
            <li>I love that it tells her how long to brush and in which areas.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re getting ready to go to his first dentist appointment since switching to this</li>
            <li>What I really noticed is that my teeth and gums  felt cleaner after using the Oral-B for the first time....</li>
            <li>: I got my teeth cleaned for the first time since getting this and the dental hygienist said that whatever this toothbrush was doing for me, it was really working.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For someone like me, the 4000 model or 3000 models, which have the same fast brushing speeds, would be good enough.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For someone like me, the 4000 model or 3000 models, which have the same fast brushing speeds, would be good enough.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from the old school and thought I could do just as well with the  tried and true toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I just needed a good electronic toothbrush with a small counter footprint</li>
            <li>But I rarely look at the displays because I&#x27;m focused on getting all the nooks and crannies between my teeth, which currently require enough focus that I can&#x27;t do that and read effectively.  </li>
            <li>good features include the 5 different modes you can select (Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening and Deep Clean), the indicator light if you press too hard, the fact it stays charged for 10 days (have not tested this yet), the nice charger, the ability to program the brush through the app, and the travel</li>
            <li>(kind of cool the first few brushes, but then get old and useless)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one has a lot of features, the one I like best is the pressure sensor that visually lights up red when pressing to hard is very useful.  </li>
            <li>We previously were using the Oral-B Triumph and were happy with that toothbrush, but this new on far exceeds the Triumph.</li>
            <li>On Deep Clean mode, I begin brushing in the left top quadrant of my mouth.</li>
            <li>first impressions of the Oral-B 5000 was that it made a different sound than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li>Also, if you answer the post-brushing questions incorrectly (easy to do at 4 AM) you can&#x27;t go back and alter them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, if you answer the post-brushing questions incorrectly (easy to do at 4 AM) you can&#x27;t go back and alter them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can easily tell when it is time to move to the next quadrant by watching the app.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used battery powered toothbrushes in the past, but found that they really didn&#x27;t do a good job of tooth cleaning.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend and worth the extra for the indicator light.</li>
            <li>The one provided with this model, a large circular shaped head, seems to be a compromise between the two I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li>This mode doesn&#x27;t ship with the smart controller.</li>
            <li>However, even without the Bluetooth technology, this SmartSeries is not so smart.</li>
            <li>In this instance, this will be the fact that I am absolutely, 100% positively, sold on this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>One day, in a not so distant future, these brushes will have SIRI like conversations with us and when that happens - I for one, welcome our new power toothbrush Overlords.</li>
            <li>Note about the charger: if your bathroom is like mine – a large opening in front of your bed that looks straight into your sink with no door, charge the toothbrush in another room.</li>
            <li>Honestly I tend to brush a little longer as I am finishing reading an article.</li>
            <li>Of the five modes available I checked out Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, and Tongue Cleaning.  </li>
            <li>As far as the cleaning power goes, it gives a very noticible clean and the charge lasts for about 5 days with normal 2x day cleaning</li>
            <li>I make sure to brush in front of the mirror to see the light and it helps me to not brush so hard.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m actually amazed it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>An advanced feature of this brush is that it lights up red when you put too much pressure on your gums or teeth.</li>
            <li>After the session the app congratulates you on mission accomplished or gives you a frowny if you didn&#x27;t go the whole way</li>
            <li>you play modern video games?</li>
            <li>I have come to really enjoy this smaller per tooth focusable shape and size with the Oral-</li>
            <li>I have come to really enjoy this smaller per tooth focusable shape and size with the Oral-</li>
            <li>It worked very well</li>
            <li>I purchased the Sonicare Diamondclean and I am much much much</li>
            <li>At the end of 45 seconds the brush makes an audible stutter and flashes a light to let me know to move to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li>It looks very futuristic and modern.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The most interesting update to the 5000 series is the utilization of Bluetooth technology that allows your brush to sync up with your smartphone to monitor current brushing progress, measure the last 6 months of your brushing history and intuitively make a series of adjustments to the device itself that truly personalizes your individual brushing experience.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not take much counter space, and is very organized with all the parts and brush heads etc.</li>
            <li>real motivation for getting this toothbrush was to give to my tween to help her record her brushing sessions.</li>
            <li>The Bluetooth connection with my Android phone works very well.</li>
            <li>If you really want an app running every time you brush your teeth, then maybe the 5000 is for you.  </li>
            <li>He can&#x27;t stop telling me how much he loves it.</li>
            <li>Teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I wish had had purchased it; however, this one works very well.</li>
            <li>I cannot really think of a valid reason for that.  </li>
            <li>People thought I was nuts, spending so much $$ on a toothbrush for a child.</li>
            <li>Did you apply too much pressure with brushing?</li>
            <li>The brush makes my teeth feel so much cleaner and even though the Bluetooth is a bit of a overkill</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just too much technology and connectivity.</li>
            <li>So I really have no way of selecting brushing mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works but is very noisy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see myself ever depending on the Blutooth stuff for much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t really use the Bluetooth feature as much.  </li>
            <li>We got the whitening ones but don&#x27;t like those as much.  </li>
            <li>Does not work at all, feels like Chinese cheap product.</li>
            <li>I’m putting this here instead of in the toothbrush section, because this doesn’t really impact the use of the brush.  </li>
            <li>the price of the toothbrush, Braun’s reputation for quality, and Braun’s attempt at migrating consumers away from Philips’ Sonicare brand, I expected more from this purchase.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;m really hurt by the fact that this item was not what was advertised.  </li>
            <li>I know that doesn&#x27;t seem like much</li>
            <li>The app does get me into going thru the whole 9 yards of brushing for two minutes....</li>
            <li>The brush head vibrates at a much lower frequency than the Sonicare, giving the teeth the feeling of being in a lopsided washing machine during spin cycle.</li>
            <li>I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I have had it for 1 year now and it works very well.</li>
            <li>It cleans your teeth very well.</li>
            <li>The only way to gauge the time is with vibrations and a light flash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a bit of a pain to remember to bring my phone to the bathroom, unlock the phone, start the app, then start brushing every time.  </li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s a triple pressure sensor that lights up if you&#x27;re using too much pressure on your gums.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>it flashes a red light and reduces speed</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me.  </li>
            <li>During the brushing routine, you can set your screen to see just a straight timer, or 3D teeth mode which highlights a quadrant of your mouth that you should be brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I wish the app would record how much time I am spending in each area/tooth.  </li>
            <li>The usefulness of this would be that I would know what areas I am neglecting or spending too much time on.  </li>
            <li>only flaw I found was the ability for the toothbrush to remember my sessions when I did not have my phone available.  </li>

            <li>only flaw I found was the ability for the toothbrush to remember my sessions when I did not have my phone available.  </li>
            <li>In addition to the CrossAction brush head that is included, six additional brush heads are available for various purposes.  </li>
            <li>While this is occurring, the toothbrush will alert the user if too much pressure is being applied.  </li>
            <li>Product works very well.  </li>
            <li>(by not applying to much pressure etc.)</li>
            <li>The Oral-B comes with a plastic travel case but the case is very bulky</li>
            <li>The Oral-B comes with a plastic travel case but the case is very bulky</li>
            <li>The blue light blinks while charging</li>
            <li>; if it detects you are putting to much pressure on your teeth or gums.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like for</li>
            <li>the toothbrush will stop spinning and a yellow light will come on.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>really do like the tooth brush</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I was hesitant to spend this much in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>and I did not see any red light.</li>
            <li>As if your dentist would really start studying that.</li>
            <li>really doesn&#x27;t.ean that it is a quality job.</li>
            <li>really find the fact that I can track my brushing and flossing has increased my frequency.</li>

            <li>This device makes as much noise as a lawnmower.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li>Really like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- Much noisier than my girlfriend&#x27;s Sonicare&lt;br</li>
            <li>the red led light is on.</li>
            <li>I would not have expected that an electric toothbrush could be so much better than a manual one.</li>
            <li>It can save you so much time in the morning and night.</li>
            <li>i really like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This requires you to have your phone with you and ready in order to take advantage of this feature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus with the Pro 5000 is much improved brush head storage.</li>
            <li>Feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would need it, but man -- I feel like I&#x27;ve accomplished something after I&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li>The phone app is kind of gimmicky</li>
            <li>Although, I can definitely see where the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush can be a handy training tool which my current sonicare toothbrush doesn&#x27;t provide.  </li>

            <li>As far as the battery goes, read the manual, follow the proper instructions, and you will get the most out it.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush, on its own, is very effective and motivates me to at least brush for 2 minutes per session and lets me know when I’m pressing too hard against my gums.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s located right where my thumb naturally rest.  </li>
            <li>This is probably only useful if you really want to track how long you brush, or to make sure that a child is brushing enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This particular Oral-B Pro 5000 can be connected to your blue tooth, if you have that available.</li>
            <li>I also spend a little unscheduled time in whitening mode after the focused care - made very, very easy by pushing the select button and seeing the mode change on the app till I get to whitening mode.</li>
            <li>My Oral B was long overdue for a replacement and I was contemplating getting the 7000 series but settled for this as it was not over the top expensive and I must say I am Happy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m also not particularly interested in the Bluetooth feature, and found that though you can disable it when you turn it on, it re-enables after you turn it off and on again, which is goofy.</li>
            <li>It does little beeps and awards for consistently using it, which is rewarding.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m MUCH more consistent about doing the entire routine than ever before, and I never &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; and tell the phone app that I&#x27;ve flossed when I haven&#x27;t, because I&#x27;d only be cheating</li>
            <li>you want accountability and friendly reminders - you have to get the blue tooth model.  </li>
            <li>However for an experienced user such as myself, the app is more or less gimmicky.  </li>
            <li>However for an experienced user such as myself, the app is more or less gimmicky.  </li>
            <li>When set to Deep Clean (3 minutes of brushing), disable the 2-minute end-of-brushing mark and set it at 3 minutes instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The time indicator on the app is always set to 2:00 even when both the app and the toothbrush know that I will be doing what Oral-B calls a Deep Clean</li>
            <li>I was using it only 3 weeks, went to my dental appointment and the hygienist complemented me on the fact that there was no plaque to clean.</li>
            <li>And the deep clean mode?</li>
            <li>I actually feel my teeth really clean</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Usually &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; gadgets work to motivate me, party because they&#x27;re fun to use and partly because I love tracking data.  </li>
            <li>(that is push mode one time to get to deep clean, two times to get to gum massage, etc.).</li>
            <li>Not hardly!  </li>
            <li>I actually bought this toothbrush for my husband, as I already have my own Oral-B power toothbrush, and the first time he used it, he splattered toothpaste all over the bathroom because he couldn&#x27;t figure out how to control speed and other functionalities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>far as the toothbrush itself, the Oral-B Pro 5000 works great, but I wish a second and different brush head had been included so I could alternate like I do with the one I am using now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, what all didn&#x27;t touch the red light has been bright, don&#x27;t know how to guarantee in China, alas, since can from recognize unlucky, isn&#x27;t it</li>
            <li>If the power brush with Bluetooth and my smartphone could interact and identify potential problem areas before I needed a dentist, THAT would be cool.</li>
            <li>The app will also keep track of your brushing consistency, encouraging you to brush for a full 2 minutes twice daily.  </li>
            <li>If this is your first electric toothbrush, you may want to start out brushing in the sensitive mode until your mouth adjusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If this is your first electric toothbrush, you may want to start out brushing in the sensitive mode until your mouth adjusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, while it cleans your teeth much better than a manual brush, it might make you forget to clean the other parts of your mouth, like on and around your tongue, the space between your gums and your lips/cheek, etc... which can still leave your breath less than fresh.</li>
            <li>The initial charge took a full 24 hours, but that was indicated in the instructions.</li>
            <li>I have used bulkier toothbrushes in the past, and this one has nice contours.  </li>
            <li>Total gimmick, making it a good toothbrush (as I prefer the rotary heads) way more expensive</li>
            <li>A series of 3 blue lights flash during recharging which is anywhere between 30 to 45 minutes before reaching full charge and the lights go off.</li>
            <li>The battery charge indicator has been updated with a new led-light display pattern but everything else is familiar and same.</li>
            <li>The choice to replace was vindicated on using the new one: what a difference in power!  </li>
            <li>No Bluetooth feature unless you have (relatively) new phone!</li>
            <li>i need a new toothbrush and this one fits the bill!</li>
            <li>Using the app, it&#x27;s easy to gauge time spent on each tooth and side to get even brushing throughout.  </li>
            <li>There is a more expensive model with better travel capabilities.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t particularly want to.</li>
            <li>Especially with a personal hygiene product many people travel with.</li>
            <li>When I replaced that older model with the 5000</li>
            <li>Mostly gimmicky features meant to look good on a box or commercial.</li>
            <li>Upgraded from older Braun that was no longer holding change after 5 years.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am glad I got the tooth brush because it cleans my teeth well, but I wish the toothbrush head was smaller and that the brush displayed settings on it instead of just on your smartphone or device.</li>
            <li>I had the older Triumph series for 7 years.</li>
            <li>With the apps limitation to one user, and its focused purpose, the app may not be a compelling reason to purchase this product for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing is accomplished by setting the rotating brush head on the tooth, moving from one to the next.  </li>
            <li>I am replacing an older &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type toothbrush that is reaching the end of it&#x27;s life span.</li>
            <li>Oral B is trying to cleverly omit this requirement for Bluetooth 4.0 from their marketing.  </li>
            <li>This is the main reason why I feel this brush will not work for me for travelling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would given it 2-stars to the product because of the charging voltage since I purchased the product mainly for travelling, but the brush performs better than my previous model and performs well when I use it at home.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the idea of having my device in the bathroom close to water when I brush.</li>
            <li>I talked to my dentist about this particular toothbrush and his answer</li>
            <li>That stand-alone SmartSeries do-hickey does present a more prominent reminder of brushing duration, and does have an inoffensive little beep every fifteen seconds to spur you on, (or signal, \\&quot;enough already\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, I am already using a high tech device that used to be a manual device for me, I don&#x27;t need to add an app to keep track of my brushing habits.  </li>
            <li>High quality.  </li>
            <li>Switched to Oral-B from Sonicare about 10 years ago and have missed the high frequency cleaning of the gums of the Philips system.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>high fives all around.</li>
            <li>This brush is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>High Quality.</li>
            <li>Given that I&#x27;m a little of a data nerd, the reason I bought the Pro 5000 is so that I would force myself to do a better job brushing my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>If someone brushes for 2 minutes, it does not mean that it is a quality job.</li>
            <li>It angles the brush a little more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, Oral-B&#x27;s inclusion of smart networking on their new brushes is a very promising start (the features currently offered through the synced app is just the beginning) and I look forward to experiencing the expansion and evolution of this particular service.</li>

            <li>Kind of hard to imagine sharing a toothbrush, even the electronic variety, via swapping brush heads.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>That is far too much pressure for your teeth.</li>
            <li>i used it once so far and dont really plan on using it.  </li>
            <li>My old one died and until I bought this, I didn&#x27;t know how much I missed.</li>
            <li>Works really well compared to my now 7 year old Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li>With the 2 minute Mode, it gives a short stuttering sound and a green light when you are done with the two minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Oral-B 3D White rechargable toothbrush prior and it did good, but I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing till I turned this baby on the first time.</li>
            <li>As it is, it pretty much just works to create a diary of when I brushed.</li>
            <li>I like to use the normal mode followed by 30 seconds of whitening in the morning, and extended cleaning and 30 seconds of gum massaging at night.  </li>
            <li>This makes sure you truly are brushing long enough.  </li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t use anything but the normal mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only you can decide whether this is worth the price of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Only you can decide whether this is worth the price of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Then I started to think about it and realized this might be a useful tool for monitoring my Sons brushing, so I attached an extra head and loaded up the app and gave him a lesson in using it.  </li>
            <li>the app is useful, but I can see improvements that will hopefully be introduced into future models.</li>
            <li>the app is useful, but I can see improvements that will hopefully be introduced into future models.</li>
            <li>It seems that the handle is not properly sealed and the water get in and create rust that cab be seen through the clear plastic at the top back of the handle.</li>
            <li>Use it everyday and have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s necessarily worth the money to get a brush with 5 different speeds/modes</li>
            <li>cause they all seem pretty much the same to me</li>
            <li>preferred mode is Deep Clean, but if you are new to power brushes you&#x27;ll want to start at Sensitive, move to Daily Clean and then move to Deep Clean for your daily regime to avoid bleeding gums, etc (as you&#x27;ll read about in some reviews).</li>
            <li>whole reason I bought this brush was to find out how time I brushed and missed, but it appeared it&#x27;s better to get guide brush not smart series because they are dumb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While brushing the app will keep you informed and entertained with featured content such as top news stories, local weather or a slideshow of pics from your personal albums amongst many other options.</li>
            <li>and I get an easy way to monitor that he has really brushed his teeth properly.  </li>
            <li>The Bluetooth connection to the app is extremely simple and easy to use if you want to have your phone in next to you while brushing.</li>
            <li>Everyone brushes their teeth unequally based on a number of factors including things like if you are right handed or left</li>
            <li>Everyone brushes their teeth unequally based on a number of factors including things like if you are right handed or left</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Oral-B app is a large component of the Pro 5000 Bluetooth toothbrush, and will only work with one smart phone connection.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it seems to charge quickly and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>You can change the order/programming via the Bluetooth (that is have regular clean first by default, deep clean second, gum massage third, etc.)</li>
            <li>Great idea but very poorly executed.</li>
            <li>So basically it is a good overall tooth brush for the sale price but not worth the extra cost for the Bluetooth connectivity and app.</li>
            <li>so I started looking for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve upgrade as the new models came out, but want to give the Oral-B Series a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to just try something new which was the reason for buying the Oral-B 5000.</li>
            <li>I needed a new toothbrush anyway and the bluetooth feature intrigued me.  </li>
            <li>The new one is 100-130v 50/60Hz could fry the charger overseas.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try to replace this and try a new one just in case the one I have is defective.</li>
            <li>we live in Singapore so we have to buy converter.</li>
            <li>The brush still feels new after a month of use.</li>
            <li>Sure beats the manual toothbrush, really helps that it alerts you if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>I bought it for my 98 yr old Mother, at the suggestion of her new dentist!  </li>
            <li>But I only charge when the unit shows a red light.  </li>
            <li>I feel a much deeper clean from my previous, cheaper electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li>You can see your WiFi very busy while using the App, which in my mind it shouldn&#x27;t be doing</li>
            <li>Naturally, I needed something different in my routine and this toothbrush sounded like the right thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>if I bought the new Sonicare I would need to buy brush heads for my wife&#x27;s old Sonicare and the new brushes for the new Sonnicare...</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted about five years before physically falling apart.</li>
            <li>My first Sonicare lasted about five years before physically falling apart.</li>
            <li>This was evident when the app alerted me to the fact the my volume needed to be turned up to detect proper brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>At her age I didn&#x27;t know how she would adjust, so I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>The manufacturer was very helpful in attempting over the phone fixes, but the handle is apparently defective.</li>
            <li>that said I was almost tempted to take off a star because my first impressions of the Bluetooth hookup was that it was just a big gimmick!  </li>
            <li>You know you&#x27;re an adult when you buy yourself a TOOTHBRUSH for Christmas!</li>
            <li>Wow, Bluetooth technology!</li>
            <li>but it seems pretty short to me.  </li>
            <li>You have to use a Bluetooth device to change settings and so it is a nice companion device but not good as a stand alone device</li>
            <li>was that he likes the old fashioned toothbrush!</li>
            <li>There are different types of bristles in the head, which I suppose clean in different ways.</li>
            <li>in the end I&#x27;m going to keep the brush as I&#x27;m really quite happy with it&#x27;s performance as an electric toothbrush, and the bluetooth feature doesn&#x27;t really add any additional cost (I believe it&#x27;s actually the same price as the non-bluetooth Pro 5000), but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll actually be using the bluetooth feature several weeks from now.e else.  </li>

            <li>There are also different settings for sensitive gums, whitening and deep clean, as well as a two-minute timer that pulses every 30 seconds (</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool interface, but, truthfully, it feels a little too gimmicky for my use.  </li>
            <li>Takes a little getting used to, but I think it will work fine.</li>
            <li>it back to customer service and got a new handle instead (fast service).</li>
            <li>Personally I like the vigorous motion more than the Sonicare I used previously for over 8 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It syncs quickly to my iPhone 6 and it even displays news on the bottom that you can scroll through and read, which is pretty cool if you&#x27;re bored while you brush.  </li>
            <li>While you&#x27;re brushing the app pretty much gives you the same info that you get with the smart guide that Oral B has included with their toothbrushes for a while now (although it does also include news headlines, weather information, and upcoming calendar appointments) but frankly,when I first got my triumph brush I think I used the smart guide for all of about a week and then managed to lose it in the back of a bathroom cabinet, so I&#x27;m not sure I really see myself continuing to open up the app every time I brush my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Oral-B 5000 Smart Series with Bluetooth is definitely several notches up in the bells and whistles department.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the little motivation tricks it displays.  </li>
            <li>Smart Toothbrushes are definitely still in their early days.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stat junkies in search of another data source to feed into their quantified lifestyle will also appreciate the 6 months of brushing history the app stores that pinpoints a variety of data sets including moments when you were brushing too hard, your flossing/mouthwash/tongue cleaning patterns amongst many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They just seem to do a better job of getting stuff out of those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>The new toothbrush has quite a few bells and whistles that were probably not even considered for a toothbrush when my original one was manufactured.</li>
            <li>Only 3 more days to get the 30-day &amp;#34;award&amp;#34; from the phone app!she saw little curves where the rotating brush was grinding the soft part of my teeth at the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When first turned on, it starts in Daily Clean (regular) mode and each push of the button takes it to the next mode (Deep, Sensitive, Whitening, Massage and Tongue Cleaning).</li>
            <li>I found I have to open my mouth much wider than I did with my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The reason is clear why they leave this out:  </li>
            <li>What this device and that app give you is customizable timers, tracking progress over time, a history of activity (condensed), reminders (I didn&#x27;t bother with this), gentle condemnation, rewards and the current brushing mode.</li>
            <li>With the Sonicare handles I&#x27;d just use them until they completely discharged.</li>
            <li>With the Sonicare handles I&#x27;d just use them until they completely discharged.</li>
            <li>The problem that I had with this brush is it&#x27;s so LOUD.</li>
            <li>but it was just too loud.</li>
            <li>When I put this model on the charging stand, the blue flashing light filled the bathroom, so much so that it was disturbing me in my bedroom.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant about spending money on an electric toothbrush since my old fashioned way of brushing has worked for almost 40 years.  </li>
            <li>I have completely retrained my brushing habits because of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I figured that maybe my old one breaking was an anomaly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a gift for my 9 year old son when it was on a lightning deal.  </li>
            <li>far as cleaning goes, this brush is tops.</li>
            <li>It would be a lot easier to have the features the app and Bluetooth promise built into the toothbrush proper to simplify the brushing process, but I guess we aren&#x27;t there in tech yet or Oral-B wants to drive up app downloads.</li>
            <li>I have used a traditional toothbrush my whole life and had no problem transitioning to this.  </li>
            <li>and we also bought some sensitive brush heads.  </li>
            <li>since there is not guide comes with this brush I had to rely on vibrate mode and complete the session disconnected!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li>This 5000 model has additional action--</li>
            <li>That goal is far from being reached.  </li>
            <li>That goal is far from being reached.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;too much pressure&#x27; sensor is also helpful, and the lights on the brush turn red to let you</li>
            <li>I replaced an old electric toothbrush with this.</li>
            <li>My old oral b braun professional care I got from Costco in 07 was in need of a replacement.  </li>
            <li>I get the floss action oral b brush head.</li>
            <li>Braun, Triumph Professional Care 9000.</li>
            <li>The triumph was in the same price range as this brush, so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any difference in brushing performance.  </li>
            <li>This brush is also noticeably lighter than my old triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>brush head boasts 3D action--</li>
            <li>found it worked very well, encouraging me to brush for the entire alloted time.  </li>
            <li>The brush is on the loud side, but is tolerable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Get the old version of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Oral-B has chosen the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; charger for this model instead of the &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; model charger that offers 110~240VAC input voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They mention a green light</li>
            <li>but I never saw the green light on while brushing.</li>
            <li>Now, the toothbrush comes set in the Professional Mode.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush connected seamlessly with my phone, Galaxy 4S, utilizing the Oral-B app.  </li>
            <li>already had old model.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be so loud.  </li>
            <li>For this price you can&#x27;t give a family at least one more brush head?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really utilize any of the extra modes, but they&#x27;re there</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve done it before while teaching our five-year old to brush.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The five different mode settings and the tooth-cleaning ability of this premium toothbrush is really the reason why you should buy it.  </li>
            <li>importantly, there&#x27;s no light indicator to tell which mode you are on or the sequence of the modes.</li>
            <li>brush head is round with this model versus the Sonicare&#x27;s more traditional rectangle shaped head.</li>
            <li>brush head is round with this model versus the Sonicare&#x27;s more traditional rectangle shaped head.</li>
            <li>After MILLIONS of years of human evolution and tooth brushing of various degrees and success, people can&#x27;t figure out with all of the information out there from professionals just how to brush their teeth??  </li>
            <li>Actually it&#x27;s kinda fun to open each time.  </li>
            <li>on the bluetooth side, the functionality is not as exciting as I would&#x27;ve expected.</li>
            <li>So you get a trophy for all sorts of silly stuff that reinforces good brushing</li>
            <li>I just hit a new high of having flossed 27 days in a row, where I used to be an occasional flosser.  </li>
            <li>I just hit a new high of having flossed 27 days in a row, where I used to be an occasional flosser.  </li>
            <li>Finally, always knowing that everyone--I mean everyone--I have talked to saying their Dentist recommended Sonicare... not to mention my own.</li>
            <li>and I was quite surprised that my teeth felt noticeably cleaner than when I brushed with my old triumph brush, even though I was using the exact same brush head.  </li>
            <li>other thing worth noting is that it doesn&#x27;t work well to share the brush with someone else.  </li>
            <li>Plus, after a few weeks, I stopped logging my brushes, because it really doesn&#x27;t serve very much of a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I find this one to be just as good as any other but not worth the extra $$ for the extra features.</li>
            <li>This is the most ridiculous feature of them all.</li>
            <li>We bought one main toothbrush and several heads for everyone in the family so we can all use it.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get this particular item because it was advertised to have 3 brushes and it only came with one.  </li>
            <li>fact, I had the same problem regarding a lack of instructions when I first got my Oral-B power tooth brush last year.</li>
            <li>initially started by alternating between the electric toothbrush and my regular one because it hurt my gums at first.</li>
            <li>The sensor can sense when I put too much pressure and it flashes a red light on the base of the brush, obviously my favorite feature of the whole thing because it solves my issue.</li>
            <li>Finally the app allows you to customize how long you would like to brush in certain areas (i.e., you can add time to each quadrant) so that you can concentrate on that particular quadrant longer if required.  </li>
            <li>Finally the app allows you to customize how long you would like to brush in certain areas (i.e., you can add time to each quadrant) so that you can concentrate on that particular quadrant longer if required.  </li>
            <li>Other than that the result (clean teeth) is the same.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, especially for the price I paid!</li>
            <li>The brush head I was using was only 4 or 6 weeks old, so I just put my existing brush head on the new toothbrush</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to see that Oral-B has upgraded the 5000 SmartSeries power toothbrush with a decent smartphone app and ditched the previously included, cumbersome Smartguide device (a small wifi device with limited functionality that displayed the time and a countdown clock of your brushing</li>
            <li>They are literally learning how to brush and will get in the habit of it for when they are in situations where they only have a normal brush.  </li>
            <li>Well first of there is not way to bring your old sessions from other devices</li>
            <li>Hooks up to your smart phone and shows you a timer and a picture of a mouth, but it doesn&#x27;t correlate to your mouth and the directions aren&#x27;t very clear on how to use it other than a timer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>One day, in a not so distant future, these brushes will have SIRI like conversations with us and when that happens - I for one, welcome our new power toothbrush Overlords.adventure game for kids that only allows progress as they brush each</li>
            <li>feel like adding some useful bluetooth functionality, or at least the ability to edit the entries after to add flossing/tongue or something, would add practically zero cost, since it already has a smart chip on it, and it already connects with the phone.</li>
            <li>I love that the LED turns red when I’m pressing too hard against my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li>I quickly got the sense that &#x27;geez, now I don&#x27;t even put my phone down when I brush!&#x27;  </li>
            <li>The apps drawback is that you can not export the user data which would be needed when you get a new phone - I lost all my historical data/awards.</li>
            <li>So either my technique of manual brushing was that bad, or, this toothbrush is really that good.  </li>
            <li>Since sessions are only record when the app is present, it isn&#x27;t going to work very well for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can watch the timer on your phone, which helps when you&#x27;re first getting used to it, and it stores the times you brushed and for how long, and, after setting it up before hand, you can tell it if you flossed and cleaned your tongue.</li>
            <li>Finally, the feeling of precise control is missing.</li>
            <li>I expect this unit to last a pretty long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s time to move to the next quadrant, the brush will flash a green light and intermittently stop and start a couple times.  </li>
            <li>: iPhone 4S and later included this BT version (the OralB app also requires you to run iOS 6 or later), but Android was much slower to adopt BT 4.0.</li>
            <li>Every 30 seconds, it stutters and supposedly a green light comes on to let you know you need to move to the next quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li>This is my second Oral B toothbrush , my teeth feel so much cleaner when I use this toothbrush instead of the traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Granted, the model I have is much cheaper with only basic functionalities.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this toothbrush system, especially to those families with kids who would really utilize the Bluetooth connectivity.e others.  </li>

            <li>In my opinion, most people are too busy in the morning and too tired at night to worry about this.</li>
            <li>The 5000 seems to have a little more power but only as long as you don&#x27;t press on it.</li>
            <li>I used the Triumph professional care with a smart guide for 6 years, and cannot use any other toothbrush after getting used to this one.</li>
            <li>Other than that the product works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I was a little excited to finally have the opportunity.  </li>
            <li>Another major annoyance is the Christmas Tree indicator for battery charging.</li>
            <li>I did have to replace mine within the first day, since the battery indicators LED was dead -- but that&#x27;s not a big deal thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li>My only complaint, which is the reason for a 4 stars rating, is that it takes more than a full day to fully charge the battery inside the handle (from flashing red to three green battery indicator).</li>
            <li>The power it offers to the head is sufficient to clean without me having to push hard or brush vigorously on my home.</li>
            <li>At first I was a little concerned about letting my toothbrush and phone talk since they have so much intimate knowledge regarding my breath and where my mouth has been but so far the gossip has been minimal.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find any information on how to troubleshoot or try to address the connectivity problem because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any information in regard to this problem on the manufacturer&#x27;s site on generally on the internet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The app also will display news, sports, etc articles while you&#x27;re brushing, and you can select the general categories it will display.  </li>
            <li>Because it is not easy to change modes, I just keep it on regular clean.</li>
            <li>It has 5 brushing modes (regular, extended, sensitive, whitening, and massaging).  </li>
            <li>apparently I can see the brushing mode with the mobile phone app.</li>
            <li>I plan to use the extra whitening modes and such but its not clearly marked (only useful part of the bluetooth app.  </li>
            <li>If you want this to be a conversation piece at the next dinner party you probably miss the automated posting of your cleaning pattern on Facebook and the direct video streaming from your gums to Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Our old Oral-B finally bit the dust.</li>
            <li>The iOS app is neat, except that it means I have to have my phone in the bathroom near water splashes and such.</li>
            <li>Bought as a replacement for a ten year old one.</li>
            <li>Not what I expected too much to do</li>
            <li>I bought what I thought was the same for my husband one tooth brush, what a pain finding the correct toothbrushes and you can&#x27;t buy one at a time that I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>The storage area on my former model tended to develop  mold quickly and was difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>so you can recharge before it stops in the middle of your brushing like my old one did.  </li>
            <li>I found that screen completely unnecessary, although kids might like it (which might motivate them to brush better).  </li>
            <li>Which is kind of lame, because a tooth brush is not a matter of national security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but the rest is a huge failure.</li>
            <li>The whole thing is a 21st century experience with all the waterproof electronics, blue, yellow and red lights and all.</li>
            <li>I imagine that these initial batch of trophies are just the beginning and future updates will add new engagement loops (eg - unlock &#x27;x&#x27; trophy and get a free brush head) and perhaps offer demographic-specific activities such as an adventure game for kids that only allows progress as they brush each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stat junkies in search of another data source to feed into their quantified lifestyle will also appreciate the 6 months of brushing history the app stores that pinpoints a variety of data sets including moments when you were brushing too hard, your flossing/mouthwash/tongue cleaning patterns amongst many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean and brushes hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li>LOUD and I mean LOUD; bluetooth connection is not near as cool as I thought it would be</li>
            <li>Helps me to brush properly with the red light when I press too hard against my gums and with the green light every 30 seconds to tell me how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the notification light for when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li>I had thought that would be too much scrubbing and cause my gums to recede, but I found that this slight rotation action just causes the bristles, which are angled different ways, to flex against the gums.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush replaced an Oral B Triumph electric toothbrush that was several years old and starting to show a lot of wear.  </li>
            <li>how well I brushed them, an added app is really not going to make much difference.  </li>
            <li>It the app is not active, it doesn&#x27;t notice if you&#x27;ve brushed.</li>
            <li>I had a 8 year old basic oral b, I consider switching to the sonicare, but read comparison studies that said this did the same job for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush base can easily be used by more than one individual, we share amongst two people.  </li>
            <li>So unless you want to know how long you brushed your teeth for a week ago,  you can actually care for your teeth without the Bluetooth ever being used with the extra benefit on not getting toothpaste spray on your smart phone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased the Oral-B Pro 5000 Smart Series toothbrush when my Pursonic ultrasonic toothbrush suddenly broke when it&#x27;s on/off button jammed after only 3 months</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like and wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the extra money on was the smart series.</li>
            <li>I upgraded to the 5000 series and the clean I received is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In general, it&#x27;s a motivating tool that serves a solid purpose.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the blue tooth at all, I&#x27;m using the Oral B cross action brush and it does a terrific job.</li>
            <li>A long stuttering sign indicates that your 2 minute time for the Professional Mode is done.  </li>
            <li>However, be warned that the toothbrush head (cross action) that it comes with is currently not out for individual sale.</li>
            <li>Disappointed I did not read the product description well enough to see that it did not come with monitor - have not been able to purchase separately and think it would be a necessary enhancement for full utilization of toothbrush.</li>
            <li>This can be helpful if you are busy or prone to not brushing long enough.</li>
            <li>brushing&lt;br /&gt;Designed for single usersh is on the loud side, but is tolerable</li>
            <li>My pre teen daughter, on the other hand is, and she still gives trouble to brush and clean her teeth properly.</li>
            <li>hers is actually somewhat slimmer but otherwise just as good as mine but less expensive.</li>
            <li>In particular, the bluetooth connectivity becomes unuseful and it&#x27;s difficult to know which brushing mode is being used, so I only use the \\&quot;daily clean mode\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think it really is a great gift idea for a techie type person or a gadget person, but for the average person, like myself, the idea of a toothbrush telling me when to brush and how often to brush and when I have brushed in the past is just a waste of time in which case a less expensive Oral-B toothbrush would be more appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He thought it was silly to stand there and brush with a smart phone that really does not do much as far as helping you.</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I am very happy with my Sonicare and probably wouldn&#x27;t have even bothered with this Oral-B but for the bluetooth integration.</li>

            <li> I have been using a Sonicare for many years and have to say I still like it best.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product, I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have great bright teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Oral B for many years and know it is the best product in its class...</li>
            <li> Makes oral care fun!!!!</li>
            <li> The product is great, I love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing does a great job.</li>
            <li> It feels good using it and it does a good job as a powered</li>
            <li> and I loved it.</li>
            <li> My Teeth are now spoiled ( in a good way ).</li>
            <li> I must say that this toothbrush is just as good as the Sonicare products.  </li>
            <li> They are just really good cleaning everything in your mouth.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve loved for years and this costs a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all... a great electric toothbrush, with a handy app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all... a great electric toothbrush, with a handy app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have to learn how to use it by trial and error,then its quite good.</li>
            <li> but in the end it is just a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Keep up the good work guys.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Went from a spin brush to this and my teeth and gums have never looked or felt so good.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been wanting a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> but the delivery service is not as good as the product is.</li>
            <li> I suppose that would be good if you have a child you need to police because they lie about brushing their teeth, but I don&#x27;t need this feature.</li>
            <li> I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for 20+ years and have loved the product all that time.  </li>
            <li> That seems like a good idea, and it seems to work.</li>
            <li> and I got a good deal on this.  </li>
            <li> The choice of speeds is also a good feature that both family members use.</li>
            <li> I loved my Rotodent which died after 10 years.</li>
            <li> It works good, but way overpriced for what you&#x27;re using it for.</li>
            <li> I wish I had this when I was kid, I would have loved to brush my teeth.  </li>
            <li> but, since it appeared to be made sturdier and had some features that I loved, I decided to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> If you can afford the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries I recommend it over the Pursonic for it&#x27;s superior toothbrush features and how it has improved my teeth and gums.  </li>

            <li> The brush seems to do a really good job of cleaning.</li>
            <li> The app us nor good.</li>
            <li> They examine you to see if you are doing a good job or not.</li>
            <li> why am I debating whether the Bluetooth is a good idea?  </li>
            <li> Item is good.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say how good that works</li>

            <li> and I have a good experience of it.</li>
            <li> in all, this is a good toothbrush</li>

            <li> Paired with the Crest ProHealth toothpaste, perfect clean teeth.</li>
            <li> toothbrush works exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> The app may be a nice tool for those learning how to brush their teeth, however it&#x27;s an amusing gimmick for experienced brushers.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son he is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Ive always been an oral b fan; really great toothbrush love the vibration where it tells you when ur 30 seconds is done, kinda pricey though</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used all the speeds yet, but very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> very glad I did and feel like my teeth are just cleaner.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, but can think of a couple improvements that would make it a great tool.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Excellent makes brushing fun</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job cleaning, and I love that it has a travel kit.</li>

            <li> The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush is effective at brushing and promoting good brushing habits.  </li>
            <li> I had originally loved the Pursonic ultrasonic toothbrush when it worked and liked that it turned off automatically after 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning and form, fit, function with more bells and whistles than anyone should ever need.</li>
            <li> : Price is great; Cleans teeth very nice giving you that fresh from the dentist&#x27;s office feel&lt;</li>
            <li> Braun Oral-B&#x27;s Pro 5000 SmartSeries electric toothbrush is very sophisticated and cleans effectively and gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pricey, but I really love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I switch!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> First of all my 5 star rating is based on the Toothbrush itself and the excellent job it does at cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and I am glad it was this!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!</li>

            <li> and I love it!.</li>
            <li> An amazing purchase.</li>
            <li> The bluetooth feature is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> These brushes are on the market and have stayed in the market at many price points because they work, people like them and feel they get good results with them.</li>
            <li> is that you become your own source of peer pressure to brush your teeth.</li>
            <li> bluetooth app is nice but not a necessity.</li>
            <li> This would be a nice gift.</li>
            <li> The application then tracks all of these, providing of course you use them honestly.  </li>

            <li> The toothbrush has a nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li> The brush compartments comes handy for storage.</li>
            <li> I think those are nice features.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is nice having the brush head tray for the 2 of us that use it, and the travel case (holds to brush heads).</li>
            <li> It also comes with a charger and a charging station (the rechargeable battery lasts up to 10 days based on two, two-minute brushings a day) as well as a handy travel case.  </li>
            <li> It does not have an ultrasonic feature, which I liked on the Pursonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It does not have an ultrasonic feature, which I liked on the Pursonic toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It comes with a travel case that protects the handle and 2 brushes nicely tucked to the case so the brush doesn&#x27;t get squeezed or pressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife used sonicare but loves to use mine(with her own head).</li>
            <li> but it is a nice feature if you travel with your electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why pay for something that you can determine on your own?</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is nice.  </li>
            <li> So nice, yes.  </li>

            <li> iphone app makes the cleanings more effective and helps keep me on a good cleaning schedule.</li>
            <li> This is a high-end, really effective toothbrush.</li>
            <li> spoke to my dentist&#x27;s office and the hygienist said her patients had really good results with the top of the line Oral-B toothbrushes, so she recommended it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush my mouth always feels clean and with Bluetooth it is like a toy.</li>
            <li> After many more day I still don&#x27;t see my session synced on app and also app does not shows it connected anymore with brush instead is show a manual start/stop button!</li>
            <li> However, I am sincerely impressed with the brushing action of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Much more effective than others.  </li>
            <li> Brushing is easier &amp; more effective with my Oral</li>
            <li> However, I do not think you should spend more money for something that claims to have these amazing features and</li>
            <li> Liked most of the features of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Great powerful toothbrush, but bluetooth isn&#x27;t stable.  </li>
            <li> Bluetooth is meant to bind together a pretty good toothbrush with a smartphone application to make a superior user experience.  </li>
            <li> Bluetooth is meant to bind together a pretty good toothbrush with a smartphone application to make a superior user experience.  </li>
            <li> Nice to now have the best of both after my leap forward several generations of Oral-B</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just not as good (in my opinion) as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush I think this product is very nice.</li>
            <li> I love geeky stuff and what&#x27;s geekier than a toothbrush with bluetooth??</li>
            <li> A truism about change is that to effect change you must be able to measure what you want to change.</li>
            <li> not anything more than an 99 cent egg timer could do for you with a non-powered brush.</li>
            <li> If that is the case you may be the person that enjoys this product more than anyone else.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush (and toothbrushes like it)</li>
            <li> love the travel case this brush comes with.</li>
            <li> the idea of using your phone and the app to brush your teeth better is a non-starter for you then, please, still purchase a powered handle just get a quality one without the BT.</li>
            <li> but it will do everything better than a $2 non-powered brush</li>
            <li> love the travel case this brush comes with.</li>

            <li> My wife and I both love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased that there is another company competing against Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I downloaded the app to my iPhone 5s and it hooked up with the toothbrush instantly, and worked flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> but it sure beats staring at yourself in the mirror for 2+ minutes and truly makes the brushing session go by in a jiff.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Telling you where you need to spend more time.  </li>
            <li> believe this might be appealing to kids as well.  </li>
            <li> in more ways than one.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B Pro 5000.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if they enhance the app it would be entice me to use it more.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been an Oral-B electric toothbrush owner for many years</li>
            <li> It is much better than 5000.  </li>
            <li> Love using it with my iPhone.</li>
            <li> So glad my dentist recommended  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush, but considering what I know now about the app</li>
            <li> After so many days of continuous usage he earns badges.  </li>
            <li> Much better than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> I feel like the electric brush covers more surface area.</li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m doing better and my mouth feels cleaner after each brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some things I would like to see implemented better would be:&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to find the app in the iOS market -</li>
            <li> and in fact charging a lot more ?</li>
            <li> For the price it should have come with more than one Brush head.</li>
            <li> I have had better.</li>
            <li> As anyone who uses Oral B electric toothbrushes know, they&#x27;re great and get the job done at a reasonable price for head replacement vs sonicare.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I love gadgets so tinkering with all of the settings was mildly entertaining.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I listened.</li>
            <li> I have been satisfied</li>
            <li> We bought this toothbrush and love it.  </li>
            <li> also love the travel case.  </li>
            <li> You need to memorize the order of the options and pay attention to how many times you push the button.  </li>
            <li> Love the bluetooth connection...</li>
            <li> love the toothbrush and will buy another when this one wears out in 10 years.</li>
            <li> I was able to go over each tooth with that rotation power.  </li>
            <li> I love how it prompts you to go from quadrant to quadrant.  </li>
            <li> I have not yet been able to pairing the toothbrush with my Samsung S5 and the application.  </li>
            <li> Even though the app and the brush as not formally paired, the application seems to be able to communicate with the brush.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m ok with doing that.</li>
            <li> It would just be creative thinking on the app design side.</li>
            <li> I love using this toothbrush</li>
            <li> You need to use an app to change the settings which include timers (more than 1), speed/intensity, and order of functions.  </li>
            <li> Just what my dentist always pleads me to do in order to keep my teeth in their best shape possible...</li>
            <li> Love the updated Smartphone function.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that I can read the news while brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I love it; however shop around, it was over-priced.  </li>
            <li> Who uses the bluetooth...and what more does the tongue cleaner do?</li>
            <li> Because you can&#x27;t use the toothbush and track on more than one smartphone.</li>
            <li> More power.</li>
            <li> We just hope that the battery life on this one is better.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush.</li>
            <li> I love the vibrating timer which helps to ensure brushing is maximized.  </li>
            <li> I love the travel case that comes with it.</li>
            <li> app is interesting.  </li>
            <li> Mostly out of laziness on my part.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is more reliable</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> so I knew I had to invest in a top of the line toothbrush to help</li>
            <li> Each time I keep getting a better model.</li>
            <li> I love this one.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Just wish I could get a splash guard...:)</li>
            <li> This is much more convenient as I often have to spit out the excess toothpaste and saliva that collects in my mouth</li>
            <li> The Oral-B toothbrush heads have also more variety and seem to get between my teeth better.  </li>
            <li> to cleans my teeth better since my teeth are now stain-free.  </li>
            <li> and it met or exceeded my expectations in most categories.for</li>

            <li> They love them.</li>
            <li> - This may not be an issue for most as I have a &amp;#34;smaller mouth&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This can be interesting if and when it works.  </li>
            <li> so you get the most of your 2-minute brushing.</li>
            <li> One more thing to sync to your phone.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The product page uses the word “Bluetooth” more than 25 times and, at the time of this review, mentions ZERO times anything about Bluetooth 4.0.  </li>
            <li> We got this to replace a sonic care that died after 3 years and we both think we like the feel of the Oral better.</li>
            <li> The motor is much better in this unit than the cheaper versions.  </li>
            <li> but it has turned brushing into an informative and enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> I love the app and the statistics.</li>
            <li> (provided you purchase more heads), a travel case, a stand which is also where the unit charges, and a cover for the tray where you place the heads.</li>
            <li> A beep would be better and would not prolong my brushing.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to figure out which mode I am in without turning on the brush and brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> Most ask if you have been brushing and flossing and take your word for it.</li>
            <li> battery lasts for almost 2 weeks, even though I brush more than the 2 minute minimum they recommend.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, unless they included replacement brush heads, which they recommend you change every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She said my gums and teeth never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful brush, nice flexibility on the settings, no real reason to use the Bluetooth unless you desire to change settings.as been 90 days since you have replaced your brush.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful brush, nice flexibility on the settings, no real reason to use the Bluetooth unless you desire to change settings.</li>
            <li> In a bathroom where so many germs float, shouldn&#x27;t the brush come with a cover?&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love the toothbrush itself but putting a holder without the brushes is deceitful to me.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush and makes my teeth feel cleaner....</li>
            <li> Works much better than the Sonicare we had before.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> It okay,</li>
            <li> I would give this toothbrush more stars if I could use the app.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning leaves your mouth feeling like a trip to the dentist office more than a manual brush.</li>
            <li> Bluetooth connection to your phone is interesting but</li>
            <li> That said, it really does do a great job cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush, which I&#x27;ve been very happy with, but this one is quite different.</li>
            <li> and I have been quite pleased with that one.</li>
            <li> However, that said, it does a better  job of cleaning your teeth than most battery powered toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, comfortable grip in my hand.</li>
            <li> This brush is drastically better in almost every way.  </li>
            <li> Third, which makes this the best thing ever, is bluetooth.  </li>
            <li> Maybe after insurance pays off I will be able to purchase another one of these...</li>
            <li> like so many probably do -- not paid attention at all while brushing and just let my thoughts wander until the rogue thoughts turn to a realization that I must have been doing this brushing thing for a while and that I should probably stop to go watch</li>
            <li> five more minutes of TV before bed.  </li>
            <li> And there are more entertaining benefits to the Bluetooth aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teeth look noticeably better after use.</li>
            <li> This model is better than the 1000 I had before.  </li>
            <li> You have to brush well and the right way in order to keep your teeth in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to brush well and the right way in order to keep your teeth in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The x-hair toothbrush head gives an amazing feeling of clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was recommended by my dentist who is very happy to see my gums healthy after a long battle with gum disease</li>
            <li> so you get the kind of clean</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t a wonderful job cleaning, it is pretty quiet, the settings are great, and my teeth feel extremely clean.</li>
            <li> I love that it pulses when it’s time to change quadrant and pulses more strongly when I’ve reached my target</li>
            <li> My teeth is very clean.</li>
            <li> First, it does a good job at tracking everything.  </li>
            <li> The new design is not that great, it does not seal well to protect when cleaning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good but not as good as my former model.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold, and the overall brushing experience is a very pleasant one, and a satisfying one as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to hold, and the overall brushing experience is a very pleasant one, and a satisfying one as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Had the Triumph before this, and honestly liked it better as it had the timer right on the face of the handle.  </li>
            <li> My teeth never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> If you want to brush your teeth more often or more effectively you have to figure out some way of measuring what you are doing now to make positive changes.</li>
            <li> Awesome as I expected it would be.</li>
            <li> I expected to be impressed with the features on this electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Kind of fun,</li>
            <li> Feels really good, cleans really well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Cleans very well and battery life is good for 5 days after fully charged.</li>
            <li> I found after using this toothbrush that I already have good brushing technique and the app didn&#x27;t really do much for me.  </li>
            <li> I found after using this toothbrush that I already have good brushing technique and the app didn&#x27;t really do much for me.  </li>
            <li> if he is applying too much pressure, when it is time to move on to another area of the mouth, and of course signals the end of the optimum two minute brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first purchased when I was getting braces to ensure I&#x27;d get a good clean.  </li>
            <li> In any case, even without the odd bluetooth connection to a phone, the toothbrush itself is very nice and a good substitute or even alternative to a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The original Pro 5000 displayed brushing time and I suspect not too many of us often refer to it.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and cleans my teeth so well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to recharge and three people easily use this one toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It connected to her phone easily</li>
            <li> The app was easy to use (but I balked at the information on my that it wanted).  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a way to easily tell what cleaning mode without having to use the app.</li>
            <li> The app is easy to use and reminds you to floss and brush your tongue.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is easy to charge and click onto the stand.</li>
            <li> However, I do not think you should spend more money for something that claims to have these amazing features and really doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Easy use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Downloading the app was easy.</li>
            <li> Unlike the more basic models, I&#x27;m also happy it comes with a travel case.  </li>
            <li> users commented about the vibration being too strong.  </li>
            <li> I thought that would make the cleaning action better, but I find it&#x27;s not as good.  </li>
            <li> It works really good highly recommended</li>
            <li> its easy to use and bluetooth works fine.</li>
            <li> While I refuse to download and use phone app that goes along with this item (it acts for access to way too much information), I am very pleased with the toothbrush itself.  </li>
            <li> Used Soniccare for years and tried this one due to the good reviews but just not as good as the sonic care.</li>
            <li> Evidently the product no longer includes the handy timer.  </li>
            <li> Along with the free Oral-B app it has helped me keep track of my brushing habits, improve them and even make sure I am doing it right!</li>
            <li> If you want to be sure you get the best job done on your teeth at home, every day, then this might be worth the due diligence to you.</li>
            <li> Have had an Oral B toothbrush for probably 15 years and always loved it - it was just time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Yes, motorized brushes have been around a while, but this is a fine example of how improved they have become and the advancement of maintaining oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess I wont be able to enjoy the full experience of this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is fine.</li>
            <li> tOOTH BRUSH SEEMS FINE</li>
            <li> Works fine, but I can&#x27;t get the battery to charge fully.</li>
            <li> It worked fine.</li>
            <li> But combining my waterpic with this thing makes them feel like they&#x27;ve been finely polished, and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is a component of using the tooth brush if you have your smart phone handy to watch the timer and sync up your progress.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush may seem a little spendy but it is an amazing investment and keeps you and your dentist happy.</li>
            <li> Oral-B app is a huge 32mb in size.</li>
            <li> Oral-B app is a huge 32mb in size.</li>
            <li> Others might find it useful and interesting but</li>
            <li> By downloading a free app, it will connect with your Smartphone so you can keep track of your brushing progress.  </li>
            <li> To work with the free app on your phone.  </li>
            <li> This is a great gift for any kid or teen.</li>
            <li> Fairly quiet, does a great job.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush looks great in white.</li>
            <li> Pros:  comfortable design.  </li>
            <li> Why are they scrimping and being cheap...</li>
            <li> Shows cheap manufacturing</li>
            <li> However, I found the ProWhite 4000 model to be more powerful.  </li>
            <li> The programmers did not consider this important.  </li>
            <li> But this is more powerful than a $1 brush so</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush and a low price!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, the toothbrush is comfortable to hold and use.  </li>
            <li> I do like the idea that I can customize the routine to fit suggestions from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this should be available now.  </li>
            <li> I do like the idea that I can customize the routine to fit suggestions from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think this should be available now.  </li>
            <li> The app primarily shows the timer with the associated quadrants one should be brushing during that period of time.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> friends laugh at me for having a toothbrush that syncs bluetooth with my phone, but it has def made a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> I have had no problem getting the Oral-B toothbrush head to go in every available tooth surface.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on the recommendation of my dentists hygienist, who pointed out that these Oral-B toothbrushes are about as close as is available to what you see in the dentist office,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would suggest that they see what is available as these can be pricey.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning my teeth, but the corresponding bluetooth App on my iPhone is such a joke</li>
            <li> So I have no idea what the light is for.  </li>
            <li> Once you use a great electric brush like this one, you&#x27;ll never go back to manual.</li>
            <li> Either mode will communicate with you through a stuttering sound and feel.</li>
            <li> The item, when upright in its charger, doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my bathroom sink counter at all - which is nice.</li>
            <li> It is absolutely worth either price, but the lower the better, of course.  </li>
            <li> The more measurable something is the more amenable to change</li>
            <li> The best feature is that the brush lights up red when you apply too much pressure.</li>
            <li> travel case is very basic, but nice and a nice feature.  </li>
            <li> Battery life has been good so far over 8 months.</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing a good job so far.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this especially if you have children as this is the perfect toothbrush to train them for some great oral hygiene habits (especially if they enhance the companion app).</li>
            <li> Oral-B is very nicely made from a combination of glossy and rubberized white plastic.  </li>
            <li> very powerful</li>
            <li> All the power to you; it really does clean teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li> All the power to you; it really does clean teeth nicely.  </li>
            <li> This Oral-B brush has fantastic ratings and was really excited about it.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so smooth and clean after each brushing.  </li>
            <li> The new one is great much improved..</li>
            <li> It feels good in the hand and pairing it to the phone is easy enough, if you have bluetooth connectivity at the</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re familiar with the PRO 5000/7000 series of toothbrushes</li>
            <li> The original price seems to be $159.99.</li>
            <li> Enjoying my first electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I noticed whiter teeth and a more polished look within the first week.  </li>
            <li> Its function is rich.</li>
            <li> An investment into my oral health and definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Thus, I was originally taken aback by the Oral-B Pro 5000 when it did not shut off automatically when it reached 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in tracking your progress, then you will love this feature.</li>
            <li> in all, I would say the actual brushing without the bells and whistles gives you a wonderful, clean mouth better than a regular, manual toothbrush can.  </li>
            <li> in all, I would say the actual brushing without the bells and whistles gives you a wonderful, clean mouth better than a regular, manual toothbrush can.  </li>
            <li> After the first use, I could feel the improvement in the brush technology, and have been enjoying the feeling of clean teeth.</li>
            <li> (well, she likes me and loves how clean my teeth are).  </li>
            <li> all I care about it whether or not my teeth are clean or not.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The second best feature to the cleaning performance of this brush is its professional timer.</li>
            <li> My teeth are exceptionally clean and shiny after using this brush.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Bluetooth feature yet but so far, the rest of the essential functions works great!</li>
            <li> My teeth have never felt so clean-</li>
            <li> it makes me feel really clean and refreshed every use.  </li>
            <li> I now look forward to brushing - just to feel how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth get really clean.</li>
            <li> It gives me just from the dentist clean teeth.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never felt my mouth so clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s equivalent to dentist office clean, without all of the uncomfortableness and pain.</li>
            <li> this clean</li>
            <li> Although courteous over the phone, no one at Oral B was able to give me answers on why my brush and app are not working properly.</li>
            <li> Something special that they follow along with.  </li>
            <li> It make sense to give each tooth special attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really doesnt clean yor teeth any better with it.</li>
            <li> The Sonicare is a high pitched vibration while the Oral-B has more of a pulsating sound...</li>
            <li> Was able to get it at a very reasonable price, $79.99, so it was worth purchasing this version.  </li>
            <li> However, I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars because this toothbrush has many features but only two buttons, and the instructions included with the toothbrush aren&#x27;t very good at teaching you how to use the different functions.</li>
            <li> Holds a long charge,  cleans greatly and the app is fun.</li>
            <li> It did take a full 24 hrs (about) to charge, which I did before I even turned it on.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s cool and neat but</li>
            <li> cool thing about all of that</li>
            <li> I thought the bluetooth connection feature would be cool</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using the Oral-B Pro 4000s and above, my dental hygenist has loved me</li>
            <li> My teeth feel super clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also has Bluetooth, which isn&#x27;t as cool of an add on as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can finally give a good review of this product since we&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now.  </li>
            <li> For the tech savvy or tooth enthusiast, this is a cool gadget.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> Overall a good tooth brush.</li>
            <li> It can also be affixed to a mirror, but too many of my wife&#x27;s magnification mirrors have crashed for that to engender much confidence, either.  </li>
            <li> so it was a good way to try some different brush heads)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop running my tongue over me super clean teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> It could have lasted longer, but it wasnt going at full speed</li>
            <li> even more so that you have to read the whole manual to understand how to access them because the 5000 doesn&#x27;t have a display.</li>
            <li> This is a hyped up product full of gadgets that the world doesn&#x27;t need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a full week without recharging, and still going.</li>
            <li> This is also true about the Feedback function.</li>
            <li> This is also true about the Feedback function.</li>
            <li> The app seems more like a gimmick than a real asset to the process of brushing teeth.  </li>
            <li> The Pursonic customer support was honest and did repair it for free including free shipping and returned it about 3 weeks later.  </li>
            <li> I also love that I can turn the Oral-B toothbrush on or off at will and it remains ready to be turned on again for 30 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the toothbrush head for the Oral-B is much sturdier and is constructed much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the default setting for both toothbrushes as that setting seems to provide a good brushing for my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> the Oral-B is much sturdier and is constructed much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the default setting for both toothbrushes as that setting seems to provide a good brushing for my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> Good tooth brush but the Bluetooth connectivity and App do not work properly.  </li>
            <li> but it really encourages me to brush my teeth, my tongue and floss much more often.  </li>
            <li> (if you stop brushing for more than 30 seconds...to talk to someone or spit, the whole session resets).  </li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about the Pro 5000 is that it seems to be more powerful than my former model which is probably a good thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Getting to the reality of it, the unit is quite solid, feels good in the hand, in a great base station, and most importantly does a great job cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I love this new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> She loves her Oral-B 5000 Smart Series!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do this for the first couple of years with my first Pro 5000 and the accumulated, hidden sludge is best not described.  </li>
            <li> Brush works better than the older model I have</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush, mostly made in Germany, 100% more plaque than regular manual tooth brushing.</li>
            <li> The old unit I had was much more comfortable for me to use, it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker</li>
            <li> You have to sync it with your smartphone for it to work properly and guide you into better habits for brushing where you need it most.</li>
            <li> The Pro 5000 is Bluetooth capable which pretty much means it has its own app that is available for your Apple or Android device.</li>
            <li> This is my very first electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The app will also record how often and how long you brush for and the brush will retain 20 sessions if you don&#x27;t start the app each time you brush, so if you want a log of your brushing habits, then it would be good for this</li>
            <li> Without the app there&#x27;s not much else to say about it because I cannot really take advantage of many of the most interesting features.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing the dentist compliment him on his new habits instead of telling him he needs to brush more, too.</li>
            <li> love the new brush mechanically</li>
            <li> I noticed that the latest Sonicare unit had a completely new brush head design...</li>
            <li> I was happy with the performance and product life of the previous model, so I stuck with it for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great, just like my previous Oral-B&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is great for when I travel - I don&#x27;t have to take the whole charging platform - even for a week long trip.  </li>
            <li> My final analysis is to save the money for the better toothbrush--the 4000!</li>
            <li> I kept thinking that it isn’t my first time brushing!</li>
            <li> Only 3 more days to get the 30-day &amp;#34;award&amp;#34; from the phone app!</li>
            <li> First, the motor is quieter and seemingly works better than the more basic models.  </li>
            <li> You can feel the clean and tartar being brushed away, strong brush but not so strong as the pulsonix ones which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> apparently the more advanced model comes with this happy face timer and offers different brushing modes.</li>
            <li> My many years old electric toothbrush no longer worked, I needed a replacement &amp; like this model much!!</li>
            <li> Just a little history, my son is a complete joy most of the time.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t use the features since its too much effort to try and guess which will fit your needs.</li>
            <li> This one is a huge improvement - lighter, easier to maneuver, has lights that tell you if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure, plus syncs with an app that can track/analyze your brushing habits.  </li>
            <li> However, they don&#x27;t know what they are missing and what a great job it does on your teeth and gums and keeps a record of it in the process.  </li>
            <li> The handle is comfortable, and I really like the brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Briefly, wins one and two are a no brainer.</li>
            <li> It is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality powered toothbrushes are well worth the investment.ome miscellaneous</li>
            <li> It is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quality powered toothbrushes are well worth the investment.</li>
            <li> They do a fabulous job cleaning, keeping tartar levels low and keeping gums healthy.  </li>
            <li> My life could not be more complete.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re getting the 5 brush modes, a vibration and light-flash pattern every 25% into the cycle and the immensely satisfying finish that the &#x27;3D Action&#x27; brush head oscillation and pulsation provides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the upgrade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to catch up on some current events while going through the two minute routine.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting from a &amp;#34;smart toothbrush&amp;#34; but this isn&#x27;t worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember how long I had the first one, but it&#x27;s the best part of ten years.  </li>
            <li> shame and fun in brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> For the next day it would turn on on its own.</li>
            <li> : For what it’s worth, my firmware version is: SW-Version 05, P-Version: 01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B App – 2 stars&lt;br /&gt;I’m</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, it noticeably works better and gives me a cleaner feeling than my old electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and powerful.</li>
            <li> I have had over $20k worth of work put into my teeth</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> but this one is still worth buying.</li>
            <li> The Bluetooth sync is pretty cool too.</li>
            <li> However if you could not get it at a reasonable price, I would skip the Bluetooth functionality and purchase one that is a bit more reasonable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth $100 premium, you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth $100 premium, you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the circular shape of the head, it seems easier and more natural of a shape</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to bring your phone every time you brush, it would be far better.</li>
            <li> sounds, it&#x27;s truly a nice tool to ensure you are using the brush properly.</li>
            <li> The accompanying app can be useful.</li>
            <li> This is really useful and non-intrustive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluetooth app and functionality.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it particularly useful to me -</li>
            <li> I think I would have liked this a lot if I had actually gotten to try it.  </li>
            <li> Bluetooth, I must admit, is really pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This would be a good gift or purchase for someone who doesn&#x27;t have the benefit of a good dentist who tells me what I am doing wrong or right.  </li>
            <li> I frankly think that if its too powerful that can probably have an adverse effect on the enamel of your teeth, so right now</li>
            <li> The nice thing versus my older model is when it&#x27;s fully charged, the blue light turns</li>
            <li> This same exact model has been used by me for many years and has helped tremendously in keeping my teeth and gums clean.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the perfect compliment to my Bluetooth toilet that tells my smartphone how close to the center I am peeing each day.  </li>
            <li> I now brush my teeth perfectly and hit every tooth the exact same amount of time each day, and I always pee within 98% accuracy of the center of the bowl.  </li>
            <li> It is just as good as any other Oral-b electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t noticed how much or how gradually the original Triumph 5000 was fading.  </li>
            <li> I chose the 5000 due to the bluetooth, which the 7000 does not have (surprisingly).  </li>
            <li> Yeah right.</li>
            <li> So, if you use it right before bed, it needs to recharge a bit afterward...</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t open the app the brush will store the session in it&#x27;s own memory and will then sync that session with the first phone that it connects to.  </li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t open the app the brush will store the session in it&#x27;s own memory and will then sync that session with the first phone that it connects to.  </li>
            <li> Really  gets your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do which is a good thing, Bluetooth part is a bit gimmicky but does motivate you to brush for a full 2 minutes twice a day</li>
            <li> I love the travel case, easy to clean and holds the parts tight (and I lugged it around a suitcase from hotel to hotel for about 4 days.</li>
            <li> Android phone App is very large.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning performance of the Oral-B is high and leaves my teeth squeaky clean and my breath fresh.  </li>
            <li> Lastly, it has a bright red indicator light to let you know when you are pushing too hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing how long 2 minutes</li>
            <li> I am glad to say I never spent the money on the optional device.  </li>
            <li> Like any electric toothbrush virgin, I bled the first time (gross I know – but that was kind of funny).</li>
            <li> I have tried other power brushes before, and this is pretty good at reaching all teeth with comfort to the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dentist gives me a new toothbrush for free every 6 months when I go in to see him.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The one odd thing to note with this newest model is that it flashes ridiculously bright when it&#x27;s charging.  </li>
            <li> The brush head spins super fast and even though it alerts you every 30 secs it will keep on after the 2 minute mark.</li>
            <li> It could be handy if I had memory issues, but really, if I forgot whether I brushed, I&#x27;d just go brush</li>
            <li> Honestly, this has a lot of power and my teeth feel so much cleaner than they do when using just a regular toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> an added perk, if you start getting lolled into a morning stupor while brushing your teeth and spend too much time in one area, the brush wakes you up with bursts of slowing vibrating pulses and a gentle yellowish light to let you know to move on.</li>
            <li> Its kind of expensive but the battery stays charged for about a week which is good if you travel.  </li>
            <li> At this price I am only buying one brush for the whole family and each of us would then have our own heads.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;While the Oral-B Pro 5000 is a great toothbrush, I&#x27;d say go for a cheaper power toothbrush if you don&#x27;t care about all the various potential functionalities.</li>
            <li> If you live the US you won&#x27;t be able to download the app, since is only available for the US app store.</li>
            <li> The old Oral-B charger was approved for 100-230v 50/60Hz great for foreign travel.</li>
            <li> seemed to work well for the first 1.5 years...</li>
            <li> B0019ZEVZU Sonicare ]], the Healthy White model,</li>
            <li> how many times you brushed your teeth per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I brush each quadrant for 30 seconds (the built in timer on the toothbrush tells you when your 30 seconds are up by doing a funny rotation of the toothbrush head).  </li>
            <li> I was worried at first when it took well over a day for the battery to fully charge.</li>
            <li> The brush comes with Oral-B&#x27;s advanced brush head, but you can separately order brush heads for sensitive gums, teeth whitening and braces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After two more times and a total of 3 minutes, the brush turns off and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus there are many different heads to choose from to cater to every need.  </li>
            <li> and I love that I can now track if she&#x27;s actually brushing.</li>
            <li> It not only cleans your teeth, but makes your gums feel better.  </li>
            <li> I played with the bluetooth feature a grand total of 2 times and then lost interest in it.  </li>
            <li> was also interested in the &amp;#34;brushing too hard&amp;#34; feature.</li>
            <li> In the pamphlet that was provided with the product, it mentioned that you&#x27;re suppose to get more than one brush head for different kinds of brushing.</li>
            <li> They could do away with the news and local weather feature and add features around which section as a user you send most of your brushing time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We use the basic mode most often.  </li>
            <li> Well I wanted to review this app on android since I recently switched my phone from iOS to Android Motorola latest gen phone.</li>
            <li> After connected first time, it worked and synced well on Android</li>
            <li> After using the toothbrush for close to 3 months, I have never been able to synchronize my off-line brushing sessions with the application even though I’m trying different ways to pair the app with the brush.  </li>
            <li> pretty gut.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric brush</li>
            <li> If the indicator was on the back of the unit, I&#x27;d be able to see it in the mirror while I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my first one.</li>
            <li> The brush will sync with more than one phone, so if everyone remembers to open the app every time they brush, then it will work and the data will all be logged correctly for each user.  </li>
            <li> So if my wife wakes up first and brushes her teeth without connecting her phone, then I connect my phone and start brushing</li>

            <li> So if my wife wakes up first and brushes her teeth without connecting her phone, then I connect my phone and start brushing</li>
            <li> the brush itself is first class all the way</li>
            <li> and my teeth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s only one brush head in the packaging, but it is compatible with most Oral-B refills.</li>
            <li> The construction and build quality are first rate</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t figured out the polishing and whitening mode (which is why I bought that thing in the first place) because I got irritated after flipping through 20+ pages.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li> I have an earlier version of this product and love it.</li>
            <li> Be aware the product is not as it is described.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought \\&quot;who needs a Bluetooth enabled toothbrush\\&quot; ( we will ignore all the puns about Bluetooth and toothbrush)?  </li>
            <li> it is a really neat feature!</li>
            <li> I now like this feature better because I often take extra time to brush my front lower teeth where I tend to get tartar and stains.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t have enough apps to scroll through already, now we have one for brushing our teeth as well :)&lt;</li>
            <li> you put too much pressure on your brush, a red pressure sensor light will light up.</li>
            <li> If you want the 3-speed settings, two minute timers, etc, I say buy a different brand of brush that better explains how to use the features of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> are all thinking that the idea of a Bluetooth toothbrush is funny</li>
            <li> I will  refer my friends and most likely will be a return customer whenever the opportunity arises.</li>
            <li> The first brush I bought with toothbrush holder etc.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!!  </li>
            <li> It works very well!</li>
            <li> Overall, I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> It is my first time to use electric tooth brush</li>
            <li> Frankly, I have too many devices already to worry about connecting to blue tooth, trying to figure out the readings.</li>
            <li> love the blue tooth app, I did not want a device on the wall.</li>
            <li> Normally, I do not write reviews unless I&#x27;m absolutely sold on something, or if its something I feel the need to warm people about.  </li>
            <li> It is far superior to a regular high quality</li>
            <li> App works fine, but it&#x27;s more trouble to have to always have the phone at hand or remember to download you brushing data.  </li>
            <li> Your mouth does feel very clean after the actual brushing.</li>
            <li> It seems to clean maybe better than the Sonicare, and if you press too hard the brush pauses and vibrates and lights up, so you really know to press lightly.</li>
            <li> The new travel cases are huge, the older models had a nicer slim case which worked</li>
            <li> I use a waterpic before every brush, and even with the old manual brush method they felt clean after.  </li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this toothbrush that lasted over 10 years, which gave me such a good impression of the brand that I didn&#x27;t even consider another.</li>
            <li> It really cleans my teeth and is much more thorough than a standard toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Love that the brush changes color to Red to indicate too much pressure.</li>
            <li> As far as the Bluetooth and app - I guess it&#x27;s a nifty feature for some people and might be handy for those teaching their children how to brush properly.</li>
            <li> What can the difference between those things really be?&amp;#34;  You may actually find a mode that you&#x27;ll stick with, believing that one of the &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; motions of the brush is better than the others.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it on a regular or deep clean right now, but can&#x27;t be sure since I started pressing the button to change the settings and have no idea now what it is on.  </li>
            <li> Statistics and achievements are also provided so one can see how they&#x27;re doing over time, and receive positive reinforcement.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Provides positive reinforcement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Provides positive reinforcement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;About eight years ago, a couple of years after getting my first powered brush, my then-GF told me she couldn&#x27;t understand how I kept my teeth so much whiter than hers</li>
            <li> /&gt;About eight years ago, a couple of years after getting my first powered brush, my then-GF told me she couldn&#x27;t understand how I kept my teeth so much whiter than hers</li>
            <li> I love that it tells her how long to brush and in which areas.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re getting ready to go to his first dentist appointment since switching to this</li>
            <li> What I really noticed is that my teeth and gums  felt cleaner after using the Oral-B for the first time....</li>
            <li> : I got my teeth cleaned for the first time since getting this and the dental hygienist said that whatever this toothbrush was doing for me, it was really working.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For someone like me, the 4000 model or 3000 models, which have the same fast brushing speeds, would be good enough.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For someone like me, the 4000 model or 3000 models, which have the same fast brushing speeds, would be good enough.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from the old school and thought I could do just as well with the  tried and true toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I just needed a good electronic toothbrush with a small counter footprint</li>
            <li> But I rarely look at the displays because I&#x27;m focused on getting all the nooks and crannies between my teeth, which currently require enough focus that I can&#x27;t do that and read effectively.  </li>
            <li> good features include the 5 different modes you can select (Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening and Deep Clean), the indicator light if you press too hard, the fact it stays charged for 10 days (have not tested this yet), the nice charger, the ability to program the brush through the app, and the travel</li>
            <li> (kind of cool the first few brushes, but then get old and useless)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This one has a lot of features, the one I like best is the pressure sensor that visually lights up red when pressing to hard is very useful.  </li>
            <li> We previously were using the Oral-B Triumph and were happy with that toothbrush, but this new on far exceeds the Triumph.</li>
            <li> On Deep Clean mode, I begin brushing in the left top quadrant of my mouth.</li>
            <li> first impressions of the Oral-B 5000 was that it made a different sound than the Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Also, if you answer the post-brushing questions incorrectly (easy to do at 4 AM) you can&#x27;t go back and alter them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, if you answer the post-brushing questions incorrectly (easy to do at 4 AM) you can&#x27;t go back and alter them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can easily tell when it is time to move to the next quadrant by watching the app.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used battery powered toothbrushes in the past, but found that they really didn&#x27;t do a good job of tooth cleaning.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend and worth the extra for the indicator light.</li>
            <li> The one provided with this model, a large circular shaped head, seems to be a compromise between the two I&#x27;ve used before.  </li>
            <li> This mode doesn&#x27;t ship with the smart controller.</li>
            <li> However, even without the Bluetooth technology, this SmartSeries is not so smart.</li>
            <li> In this instance, this will be the fact that I am absolutely, 100% positively, sold on this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> One day, in a not so distant future, these brushes will have SIRI like conversations with us and when that happens - I for one, welcome our new power toothbrush Overlords.</li>
            <li> Note about the charger: if your bathroom is like mine – a large opening in front of your bed that looks straight into your sink with no door, charge the toothbrush in another room.</li>
            <li> Honestly I tend to brush a little longer as I am finishing reading an article.</li>
            <li> Of the five modes available I checked out Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, and Tongue Cleaning.  </li>
            <li> As far as the cleaning power goes, it gives a very noticible clean and the charge lasts for about 5 days with normal 2x day cleaning</li>
            <li> I make sure to brush in front of the mirror to see the light and it helps me to not brush so hard.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m actually amazed it has made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> An advanced feature of this brush is that it lights up red when you put too much pressure on your gums or teeth.</li>
            <li> After the session the app congratulates you on mission accomplished or gives you a frowny if you didn&#x27;t go the whole way</li>
            <li> you play modern video games?</li>
            <li> I have come to really enjoy this smaller per tooth focusable shape and size with the Oral-</li>
            <li> I have come to really enjoy this smaller per tooth focusable shape and size with the Oral-</li>
            <li> It worked very well</li>
            <li> I purchased the Sonicare Diamondclean and I am much much much</li>
            <li> At the end of 45 seconds the brush makes an audible stutter and flashes a light to let me know to move to the next quadrant.</li>
            <li> It looks very futuristic and modern.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The most interesting update to the 5000 series is the utilization of Bluetooth technology that allows your brush to sync up with your smartphone to monitor current brushing progress, measure the last 6 months of your brushing history and intuitively make a series of adjustments to the device itself that truly personalizes your individual brushing experience.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not take much counter space, and is very organized with all the parts and brush heads etc.</li>
            <li> real motivation for getting this toothbrush was to give to my tween to help her record her brushing sessions.</li>
            <li> The Bluetooth connection with my Android phone works very well.</li>
            <li> If you really want an app running every time you brush your teeth, then maybe the 5000 is for you.  </li>
            <li> He can&#x27;t stop telling me how much he loves it.</li>
            <li> Teeth feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I wish had had purchased it; however, this one works very well.</li>
            <li> I cannot really think of a valid reason for that.  </li>
            <li> People thought I was nuts, spending so much $$ on a toothbrush for a child.</li>
            <li> Did you apply too much pressure with brushing?</li>
            <li> The brush makes my teeth feel so much cleaner and even though the Bluetooth is a bit of a overkill</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just too much technology and connectivity.</li>
            <li> So I really have no way of selecting brushing mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works but is very noisy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see myself ever depending on the Blutooth stuff for much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t really use the Bluetooth feature as much.  </li>
            <li> We got the whitening ones but don&#x27;t like those as much.  </li>
            <li> Does not work at all, feels like Chinese cheap product.</li>
            <li> I’m putting this here instead of in the toothbrush section, because this doesn’t really impact the use of the brush.  </li>
            <li> the price of the toothbrush, Braun’s reputation for quality, and Braun’s attempt at migrating consumers away from Philips’ Sonicare brand, I expected more from this purchase.  </li>
            <li> the price of the toothbrush, Braun’s reputation for quality, and Braun’s attempt at migrating consumers away from Philips’ Sonicare brand, I expected more from this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hurt by the fact that this item was not what was advertised.  </li>
            <li> I know that doesn&#x27;t seem like much</li>
            <li> The app does get me into going thru the whole 9 yards of brushing for two minutes....</li>
            <li> The brush head vibrates at a much lower frequency than the Sonicare, giving the teeth the feeling of being in a lopsided washing machine during spin cycle.</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have had it for 1 year now and it works very well.</li>
            <li> It cleans your teeth very well.</li>
            <li> The only way to gauge the time is with vibrations and a light flash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a bit of a pain to remember to bring my phone to the bathroom, unlock the phone, start the app, then start brushing every time.  </li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s a triple pressure sensor that lights up if you&#x27;re using too much pressure on your gums.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> it flashes a red light and reduces speed</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me.  </li>
            <li> During the brushing routine, you can set your screen to see just a straight timer, or 3D teeth mode which highlights a quadrant of your mouth that you should be brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I wish the app would record how much time I am spending in each area/tooth.  </li>
            <li> The usefulness of this would be that I would know what areas I am neglecting or spending too much time on.  </li>
            <li> only flaw I found was the ability for the toothbrush to remember my sessions when I did not have my phone available.  </li>

            <li> In addition to the CrossAction brush head that is included, six additional brush heads are available for various purposes.  </li>
            <li> While this is occurring, the toothbrush will alert the user if too much pressure is being applied.  </li>
            <li> Product works very well.  </li>

            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like for</li>
            <li> the toothbrush will stop spinning and a yellow light will come on.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> really do like the tooth brush</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was hesitant to spend this much in a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> and I did not see any red light.</li>
            <li> As if your dentist would really start studying that.</li>
            <li> really doesn&#x27;t.ean that it is a quality job.</li>
            <li> really find the fact that I can track my brushing and flossing has increased my frequency.</li>

            <li> This device makes as much noise as a lawnmower.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> Really like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- Much noisier than my girlfriend&#x27;s Sonicare&lt;br</li>
            <li> the red led light is on.</li>
            <li> I would not have expected that an electric toothbrush could be so much better than a manual one.</li>
            <li> It can save you so much time in the morning and night.</li>
            <li> i really like the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This requires you to have your phone with you and ready in order to take advantage of this feature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus with the Pro 5000 is much improved brush head storage.</li>
            <li> Feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would need it, but man -- I feel like I&#x27;ve accomplished something after I&#x27;m done brushing.  </li>
            <li> The phone app is kind of gimmicky</li>
            <li> Although, I can definitely see where the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush can be a handy training tool which my current sonicare toothbrush doesn&#x27;t provide.  </li>

            <li> The toothbrush, on its own, is very effective and motivates me to at least brush for 2 minutes per session and lets me know when I’m pressing too hard against my gums.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s located right where my thumb naturally rest.  </li>
            <li> This is probably only useful if you really want to track how long you brush, or to make sure that a child is brushing enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This particular Oral-B Pro 5000 can be connected to your blue tooth, if you have that available.</li>
            <li> I also spend a little unscheduled time in whitening mode after the focused care - made very, very easy by pushing the select button and seeing the mode change on the app till I get to whitening mode.</li>
            <li> My Oral B was long overdue for a replacement and I was contemplating getting the 7000 series but settled for this as it was not over the top expensive and I must say I am Happy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also not particularly interested in the Bluetooth feature, and found that though you can disable it when you turn it on, it re-enables after you turn it off and on again, which is goofy.</li>
            <li> It does little beeps and awards for consistently using it, which is rewarding.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m MUCH more consistent about doing the entire routine than ever before, and I never &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; and tell the phone app that I&#x27;ve flossed when I haven&#x27;t, because I&#x27;d only be cheating</li>
            <li> you want accountability and friendly reminders - you have to get the blue tooth model.  </li>
            <li> However for an experienced user such as myself, the app is more or less gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> However for an experienced user such as myself, the app is more or less gimmicky.  </li>
            <li> When set to Deep Clean (3 minutes of brushing), disable the 2-minute end-of-brushing mark and set it at 3 minutes instead.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The time indicator on the app is always set to 2:00 even when both the app and the toothbrush know that I will be doing what Oral-B calls a Deep Clean</li>
            <li> I was using it only 3 weeks, went to my dental appointment and the hygienist complemented me on the fact that there was no plaque to clean.</li>
            <li> And the deep clean mode?</li>
            <li> I actually feel my teeth really clean</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Usually &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; gadgets work to motivate me, party because they&#x27;re fun to use and partly because I love tracking data.  </li>
            <li> (that is push mode one time to get to deep clean, two times to get to gum massage, etc.).</li>
            <li> Not hardly!  </li>
            <li> I actually bought this toothbrush for my husband, as I already have my own Oral-B power toothbrush, and the first time he used it, he splattered toothpaste all over the bathroom because he couldn&#x27;t figure out how to control speed and other functionalities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> far as the toothbrush itself, the Oral-B Pro 5000 works great, but I wish a second and different brush head had been included so I could alternate like I do with the one I am using now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , what all didn&#x27;t touch the red light has been bright, don&#x27;t know how to guarantee in China, alas, since can from recognize unlucky, isn&#x27;t it</li>
            <li> If the power brush with Bluetooth and my smartphone could interact and identify potential problem areas before I needed a dentist, THAT would be cool.</li>
            <li> The app will also keep track of your brushing consistency, encouraging you to brush for a full 2 minutes twice daily.  </li>
            <li> If this is your first electric toothbrush, you may want to start out brushing in the sensitive mode until your mouth adjusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If this is your first electric toothbrush, you may want to start out brushing in the sensitive mode until your mouth adjusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, while it cleans your teeth much better than a manual brush, it might make you forget to clean the other parts of your mouth, like on and around your tongue, the space between your gums and your lips/cheek, etc... which can still leave your breath less than fresh.</li>
            <li> The initial charge took a full 24 hours, but that was indicated in the instructions.</li>
            <li> I have used bulkier toothbrushes in the past, and this one has nice contours.  </li>
            <li> Total gimmick, making it a good toothbrush (as I prefer the rotary heads) way more expensive</li>
            <li> A series of 3 blue lights flash during recharging which is anywhere between 30 to 45 minutes before reaching full charge and the lights go off.</li>
            <li> The battery charge indicator has been updated with a new led-light display pattern but everything else is familiar and same.</li>
            <li> The choice to replace was vindicated on using the new one: what a difference in power!  </li>
            <li> No Bluetooth feature unless you have (relatively) new phone!</li>
            <li> i need a new toothbrush and this one fits the bill!</li>
            <li> Using the app, it&#x27;s easy to gauge time spent on each tooth and side to get even brushing throughout.  </li>
            <li> There is a more expensive model with better travel capabilities.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t particularly want to.</li>
            <li> Especially with a personal hygiene product many people travel with.</li>
            <li> When I replaced that older model with the 5000</li>
            <li> Mostly gimmicky features meant to look good on a box or commercial.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from older Braun that was no longer holding change after 5 years.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am glad I got the tooth brush because it cleans my teeth well, but I wish the toothbrush head was smaller and that the brush displayed settings on it instead of just on your smartphone or device.</li>
            <li> I had the older Triumph series for 7 years.</li>
            <li> With the apps limitation to one user, and its focused purpose, the app may not be a compelling reason to purchase this product for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing is accomplished by setting the rotating brush head on the tooth, moving from one to the next.  </li>
            <li> I am replacing an older &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type toothbrush that is reaching the end of it&#x27;s life span.</li>
            <li> Oral B is trying to cleverly omit this requirement for Bluetooth 4.0 from their marketing.  </li>
            <li> This is the main reason why I feel this brush will not work for me for travelling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would given it 2-stars to the product because of the charging voltage since I purchased the product mainly for travelling, but the brush performs better than my previous model and performs well when I use it at home.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the idea of having my device in the bathroom close to water when I brush.</li>
            <li> I talked to my dentist about this particular toothbrush and his answer</li>
            <li> That stand-alone SmartSeries do-hickey does present a more prominent reminder of brushing duration, and does have an inoffensive little beep every fifteen seconds to spur you on, (or signal, \\&quot;enough already\\&quot;).  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, I am already using a high tech device that used to be a manual device for me, I don&#x27;t need to add an app to keep track of my brushing habits.  </li>
            <li> High quality.  </li>
            <li> Switched to Oral-B from Sonicare about 10 years ago and have missed the high frequency cleaning of the gums of the Philips system.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> high fives all around.</li>
            <li> This brush is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> High Quality.</li>
            <li> Given that I&#x27;m a little of a data nerd, the reason I bought the Pro 5000 is so that I would force myself to do a better job brushing my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> If someone brushes for 2 minutes, it does not mean that it is a quality job.</li>
            <li> It angles the brush a little more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, Oral-B&#x27;s inclusion of smart networking on their new brushes is a very promising start (the features currently offered through the synced app is just the beginning) and I look forward to experiencing the expansion and evolution of this particular service.</li>

            <li> Kind of hard to imagine sharing a toothbrush, even the electronic variety, via swapping brush heads.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by how much I like this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> That is far too much pressure for your teeth.</li>
            <li> i used it once so far and dont really plan on using it.  </li>
            <li> My old one died and until I bought this, I didn&#x27;t know how much I missed.</li>
            <li> Works really well compared to my now 7 year old Braun toothbrush.</li>
            <li> With the 2 minute Mode, it gives a short stuttering sound and a green light when you are done with the two minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Oral-B 3D White rechargable toothbrush prior and it did good, but I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing till I turned this baby on the first time.</li>
            <li> As it is, it pretty much just works to create a diary of when I brushed.</li>
            <li> I like to use the normal mode followed by 30 seconds of whitening in the morning, and extended cleaning and 30 seconds of gum massaging at night.  </li>
            <li> This makes sure you truly are brushing long enough.  </li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t use anything but the normal mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only you can decide whether this is worth the price of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Only you can decide whether this is worth the price of the toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Then I started to think about it and realized this might be a useful tool for monitoring my Sons brushing, so I attached an extra head and loaded up the app and gave him a lesson in using it.  </li>
            <li> the app is useful, but I can see improvements that will hopefully be introduced into future models.</li>
            <li> the app is useful, but I can see improvements that will hopefully be introduced into future models.</li>
            <li> It seems that the handle is not properly sealed and the water get in and create rust that cab be seen through the clear plastic at the top back of the handle.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s necessarily worth the money to get a brush with 5 different speeds/modes</li>
            <li> cause they all seem pretty much the same to me</li>
            <li> preferred mode is Deep Clean, but if you are new to power brushes you&#x27;ll want to start at Sensitive, move to Daily Clean and then move to Deep Clean for your daily regime to avoid bleeding gums, etc (as you&#x27;ll read about in some reviews).</li>
            <li> whole reason I bought this brush was to find out how time I brushed and missed, but it appeared it&#x27;s better to get guide brush not smart series because they are dumb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While brushing the app will keep you informed and entertained with featured content such as top news stories, local weather or a slideshow of pics from your personal albums amongst many other options.</li>
            <li> and I get an easy way to monitor that he has really brushed his teeth properly.  </li>
            <li> The Bluetooth connection to the app is extremely simple and easy to use if you want to have your phone in next to you while brushing.</li>
            <li> Everyone brushes their teeth unequally based on a number of factors including things like if you are right handed or left</li>
            <li> Everyone brushes their teeth unequally based on a number of factors including things like if you are right handed or left</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Oral-B app is a large component of the Pro 5000 Bluetooth toothbrush, and will only work with one smart phone connection.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it seems to charge quickly and the charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> You can change the order/programming via the Bluetooth (that is have regular clean first by default, deep clean second, gum massage third, etc.)</li>
            <li> Great idea but very poorly executed.</li>
            <li> So basically it is a good overall tooth brush for the sale price but not worth the extra cost for the Bluetooth connectivity and app.</li>
            <li> so I started looking for a new toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve upgrade as the new models came out, but want to give the Oral-B Series a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I decided to just try something new which was the reason for buying the Oral-B 5000.</li>
            <li> I needed a new toothbrush anyway and the bluetooth feature intrigued me.  </li>
            <li> The new one is 100-130v 50/60Hz could fry the charger overseas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try to replace this and try a new one just in case the one I have is defective.</li>
            <li> we live in Singapore so we have to buy converter.</li>
            <li> The brush still feels new after a month of use.</li>
            <li> Sure beats the manual toothbrush, really helps that it alerts you if you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 98 yr old Mother, at the suggestion of her new dentist!  </li>
            <li> But I only charge when the unit shows a red light.  </li>
            <li> I feel a much deeper clean from my previous, cheaper electronic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> You can see your WiFi very busy while using the App, which in my mind it shouldn&#x27;t be doing</li>
            <li> Naturally, I needed something different in my routine and this toothbrush sounded like the right thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> if I bought the new Sonicare I would need to buy brush heads for my wife&#x27;s old Sonicare and the new brushes for the new Sonnicare...</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted about five years before physically falling apart.</li>
            <li> My first Sonicare lasted about five years before physically falling apart.</li>
            <li> This was evident when the app alerted me to the fact the my volume needed to be turned up to detect proper brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> At her age I didn&#x27;t know how she would adjust, so I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> The manufacturer was very helpful in attempting over the phone fixes, but the handle is apparently defective.</li>
            <li> that said I was almost tempted to take off a star because my first impressions of the Bluetooth hookup was that it was just a big gimmick!  </li>
            <li> You know you&#x27;re an adult when you buy yourself a TOOTHBRUSH for Christmas!</li>
            <li> Wow, Bluetooth technology!</li>
            <li> but it seems pretty short to me.  </li>
            <li> You have to use a Bluetooth device to change settings and so it is a nice companion device but not good as a stand alone device</li>
            <li> was that he likes the old fashioned toothbrush!</li>
            <li> There are different types of bristles in the head, which I suppose clean in different ways.</li>
            <li> in the end I&#x27;m going to keep the brush as I&#x27;m really quite happy with it&#x27;s performance as an electric toothbrush, and the bluetooth feature doesn&#x27;t really add any additional cost (I believe it&#x27;s actually the same price as the non-bluetooth Pro 5000), but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll actually be using the bluetooth feature several weeks from now.e else.  </li>

            <li> There are also different settings for sensitive gums, whitening and deep clean, as well as a two-minute timer that pulses every 30 seconds (</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool interface, but, truthfully, it feels a little too gimmicky for my use.  </li>
            <li> Takes a little getting used to, but I think it will work fine.</li>
            <li> it back to customer service and got a new handle instead (fast service).</li>
            <li> Personally I like the vigorous motion more than the Sonicare I used previously for over 8 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It syncs quickly to my iPhone 6 and it even displays news on the bottom that you can scroll through and read, which is pretty cool if you&#x27;re bored while you brush.  </li>
            <li> While you&#x27;re brushing the app pretty much gives you the same info that you get with the smart guide that Oral B has included with their toothbrushes for a while now (although it does also include news headlines, weather information, and upcoming calendar appointments) but frankly,when I first got my triumph brush I think I used the smart guide for all of about a week and then managed to lose it in the back of a bathroom cabinet, so I&#x27;m not sure I really see myself continuing to open up the app every time I brush my teeth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Oral-B 5000 Smart Series with Bluetooth is definitely several notches up in the bells and whistles department.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the little motivation tricks it displays.  </li>
            <li> Smart Toothbrushes are definitely still in their early days.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stat junkies in search of another data source to feed into their quantified lifestyle will also appreciate the 6 months of brushing history the app stores that pinpoints a variety of data sets including moments when you were brushing too hard, your flossing/mouthwash/tongue cleaning patterns amongst many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They just seem to do a better job of getting stuff out of those hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> The new toothbrush has quite a few bells and whistles that were probably not even considered for a toothbrush when my original one was manufactured.</li>
            <li> Only 3 more days to get the 30-day &amp;#34;award&amp;#34; from the phone app!she saw little curves where the rotating brush was grinding the soft part of my teeth at the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When first turned on, it starts in Daily Clean (regular) mode and each push of the button takes it to the next mode (Deep, Sensitive, Whitening, Massage and Tongue Cleaning).</li>
            <li> I found I have to open my mouth much wider than I did with my old toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The reason is clear why they leave this out:  </li>
            <li> What this device and that app give you is customizable timers, tracking progress over time, a history of activity (condensed), reminders (I didn&#x27;t bother with this), gentle condemnation, rewards and the current brushing mode.</li>
            <li> With the Sonicare handles I&#x27;d just use them until they completely discharged.</li>
            <li> With the Sonicare handles I&#x27;d just use them until they completely discharged.</li>
            <li> The problem that I had with this brush is it&#x27;s so LOUD.</li>
            <li> but it was just too loud.</li>
            <li> When I put this model on the charging stand, the blue flashing light filled the bathroom, so much so that it was disturbing me in my bedroom.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant about spending money on an electric toothbrush since my old fashioned way of brushing has worked for almost 40 years.  </li>
            <li> I have completely retrained my brushing habits because of this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I figured that maybe my old one breaking was an anomaly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my 9 year old son when it was on a lightning deal.  </li>
            <li> far as cleaning goes, this brush is tops.</li>
            <li> It would be a lot easier to have the features the app and Bluetooth promise built into the toothbrush proper to simplify the brushing process, but I guess we aren&#x27;t there in tech yet or Oral-B wants to drive up app downloads.</li>
            <li> I have used a traditional toothbrush my whole life and had no problem transitioning to this.  </li>
            <li> and we also bought some sensitive brush heads.  </li>
            <li> since there is not guide comes with this brush I had to rely on vibrate mode and complete the session disconnected!&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> This 5000 model has additional action--</li>
            <li> That goal is far from being reached.  </li>
            <li> That goal is far from being reached.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;too much pressure&#x27; sensor is also helpful, and the lights on the brush turn red to let you</li>
            <li> I replaced an old electric toothbrush with this.</li>
            <li> My old oral b braun professional care I got from Costco in 07 was in need of a replacement.  </li>
            <li> I get the floss action oral b brush head.</li>
            <li> Braun, Triumph Professional Care 9000.</li>
            <li> The triumph was in the same price range as this brush, so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any difference in brushing performance.  </li>
            <li> This brush is also noticeably lighter than my old triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> brush head boasts 3D action--</li>
            <li> found it worked very well, encouraging me to brush for the entire alloted time.  </li>
            <li> The brush is on the loud side, but is tolerable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Get the old version of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Oral-B has chosen the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; charger for this model instead of the &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; model charger that offers 110~240VAC input voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They mention a green light</li>
            <li> but I never saw the green light on while brushing.</li>
            <li> Now, the toothbrush comes set in the Professional Mode.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush connected seamlessly with my phone, Galaxy 4S, utilizing the Oral-B app.  </li>
            <li> already had old model.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be so loud.  </li>
            <li> For this price you can&#x27;t give a family at least one more brush head?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really utilize any of the extra modes, but they&#x27;re there</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve done it before while teaching our five-year old to brush.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The five different mode settings and the tooth-cleaning ability of this premium toothbrush is really the reason why you should buy it.  </li>
            <li> importantly, there&#x27;s no light indicator to tell which mode you are on or the sequence of the modes.</li>
            <li> brush head is round with this model versus the Sonicare&#x27;s more traditional rectangle shaped head.</li>
            <li> brush head is round with this model versus the Sonicare&#x27;s more traditional rectangle shaped head.</li>
            <li> After MILLIONS of years of human evolution and tooth brushing of various degrees and success, people can&#x27;t figure out with all of the information out there from professionals just how to brush their teeth??  </li>
            <li> Actually it&#x27;s kinda fun to open each time.  </li>
            <li> on the bluetooth side, the functionality is not as exciting as I would&#x27;ve expected.</li>
            <li> So you get a trophy for all sorts of silly stuff that reinforces good brushing</li>
            <li> I just hit a new high of having flossed 27 days in a row, where I used to be an occasional flosser.  </li>
            <li> I just hit a new high of having flossed 27 days in a row, where I used to be an occasional flosser.  </li>
            <li> Finally, always knowing that everyone--I mean everyone--I have talked to saying their Dentist recommended Sonicare... not to mention my own.</li>
            <li> and I was quite surprised that my teeth felt noticeably cleaner than when I brushed with my old triumph brush, even though I was using the exact same brush head.  </li>
            <li> other thing worth noting is that it doesn&#x27;t work well to share the brush with someone else.  </li>
            <li> Plus, after a few weeks, I stopped logging my brushes, because it really doesn&#x27;t serve very much of a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I find this one to be just as good as any other but not worth the extra $$ for the extra features.</li>
            <li> This is the most ridiculous feature of them all.</li>
            <li> We bought one main toothbrush and several heads for everyone in the family so we can all use it.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get this particular item because it was advertised to have 3 brushes and it only came with one.  </li>
            <li> fact, I had the same problem regarding a lack of instructions when I first got my Oral-B power tooth brush last year.</li>
            <li> initially started by alternating between the electric toothbrush and my regular one because it hurt my gums at first.</li>
            <li> The sensor can sense when I put too much pressure and it flashes a red light on the base of the brush, obviously my favorite feature of the whole thing because it solves my issue.</li>
            <li> Finally the app allows you to customize how long you would like to brush in certain areas (i.e., you can add time to each quadrant) so that you can concentrate on that particular quadrant longer if required.  </li>
            <li> Finally the app allows you to customize how long you would like to brush in certain areas (i.e., you can add time to each quadrant) so that you can concentrate on that particular quadrant longer if required.  </li>
            <li> Other than that the result (clean teeth) is the same.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, especially for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> The brush head I was using was only 4 or 6 weeks old, so I just put my existing brush head on the new toothbrush</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to see that Oral-B has upgraded the 5000 SmartSeries power toothbrush with a decent smartphone app and ditched the previously included, cumbersome Smartguide device (a small wifi device with limited functionality that displayed the time and a countdown clock of your brushing</li>
            <li> They are literally learning how to brush and will get in the habit of it for when they are in situations where they only have a normal brush.  </li>
            <li> Well first of there is not way to bring your old sessions from other devices</li>
            <li> Hooks up to your smart phone and shows you a timer and a picture of a mouth, but it doesn&#x27;t correlate to your mouth and the directions aren&#x27;t very clear on how to use it other than a timer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One day, in a not so distant future, these brushes will have SIRI like conversations with us and when that happens - I for one, welcome our new power toothbrush Overlords.adventure game for kids that only allows progress as they brush each</li>
            <li> feel like adding some useful bluetooth functionality, or at least the ability to edit the entries after to add flossing/tongue or something, would add practically zero cost, since it already has a smart chip on it, and it already connects with the phone.</li>
            <li> I love that the LED turns red when I’m pressing too hard against my teeth and gums.  </li>
            <li> I quickly got the sense that &#x27;geez, now I don&#x27;t even put my phone down when I brush!&#x27;  </li>
            <li> The apps drawback is that you can not export the user data which would be needed when you get a new phone - I lost all my historical data/awards.</li>
            <li> So either my technique of manual brushing was that bad, or, this toothbrush is really that good.  </li>
            <li> Since sessions are only record when the app is present, it isn&#x27;t going to work very well for that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can watch the timer on your phone, which helps when you&#x27;re first getting used to it, and it stores the times you brushed and for how long, and, after setting it up before hand, you can tell it if you flossed and cleaned your tongue.</li>
            <li> Finally, the feeling of precise control is missing.</li>
            <li> I expect this unit to last a pretty long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s time to move to the next quadrant, the brush will flash a green light and intermittently stop and start a couple times.  </li>
            <li> : iPhone 4S and later included this BT version (the OralB app also requires you to run iOS 6 or later), but Android was much slower to adopt BT 4.0.</li>
            <li> Every 30 seconds, it stutters and supposedly a green light comes on to let you know you need to move to the next quadrant of your mouth.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B toothbrush , my teeth feel so much cleaner when I use this toothbrush instead of the traditional toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Granted, the model I have is much cheaper with only basic functionalities.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this toothbrush system, especially to those families with kids who would really utilize the Bluetooth connectivity.e others.  </li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this toothbrush system, especially to those families with kids who would really utilize the Bluetooth connectivity.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, most people are too busy in the morning and too tired at night to worry about this.</li>
            <li> The 5000 seems to have a little more power but only as long as you don&#x27;t press on it.</li>
            <li> I used the Triumph professional care with a smart guide for 6 years, and cannot use any other toothbrush after getting used to this one.</li>
            <li> Other than that the product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I was a little excited to finally have the opportunity.  </li>
            <li> Another major annoyance is the Christmas Tree indicator for battery charging.</li>
            <li> I did have to replace mine within the first day, since the battery indicators LED was dead -- but that&#x27;s not a big deal thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, which is the reason for a 4 stars rating, is that it takes more than a full day to fully charge the battery inside the handle (from flashing red to three green battery indicator).</li>
            <li> The power it offers to the head is sufficient to clean without me having to push hard or brush vigorously on my home.</li>
            <li> At first I was a little concerned about letting my toothbrush and phone talk since they have so much intimate knowledge regarding my breath and where my mouth has been but so far the gossip has been minimal.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find any information on how to troubleshoot or try to address the connectivity problem because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any information in regard to this problem on the manufacturer&#x27;s site on generally on the internet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The app also will display news, sports, etc articles while you&#x27;re brushing, and you can select the general categories it will display.  </li>
            <li> Because it is not easy to change modes, I just keep it on regular clean.</li>
            <li> It has 5 brushing modes (regular, extended, sensitive, whitening, and massaging).  </li>
            <li> apparently I can see the brushing mode with the mobile phone app.</li>
            <li> I plan to use the extra whitening modes and such but its not clearly marked (only useful part of the bluetooth app.  </li>
            <li> If you want this to be a conversation piece at the next dinner party you probably miss the automated posting of your cleaning pattern on Facebook and the direct video streaming from your gums to Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Our old Oral-B finally bit the dust.</li>
            <li> The iOS app is neat, except that it means I have to have my phone in the bathroom near water splashes and such.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for a ten year old one.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected too much to do</li>
            <li> I bought what I thought was the same for my husband one tooth brush, what a pain finding the correct toothbrushes and you can&#x27;t buy one at a time that I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> The storage area on my former model tended to develop  mold quickly and was difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> so you can recharge before it stops in the middle of your brushing like my old one did.  </li>
            <li> I found that screen completely unnecessary, although kids might like it (which might motivate them to brush better).  </li>
            <li> Which is kind of lame, because a tooth brush is not a matter of national security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the rest is a huge failure.</li>
            <li> The whole thing is a 21st century experience with all the waterproof electronics, blue, yellow and red lights and all.</li>
            <li> I imagine that these initial batch of trophies are just the beginning and future updates will add new engagement loops (eg - unlock &#x27;x&#x27; trophy and get a free brush head) and perhaps offer demographic-specific activities such as an adventure game for kids that only allows progress as they brush each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stat junkies in search of another data source to feed into their quantified lifestyle will also appreciate the 6 months of brushing history the app stores that pinpoints a variety of data sets including moments when you were brushing too hard, your flossing/mouthwash/tongue cleaning patterns amongst many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean and brushes hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> LOUD and I mean LOUD; bluetooth connection is not near as cool as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> Helps me to brush properly with the red light when I press too hard against my gums and with the green light every 30 seconds to tell me how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the notification light for when you are brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> I had thought that would be too much scrubbing and cause my gums to recede, but I found that this slight rotation action just causes the bristles, which are angled different ways, to flex against the gums.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush replaced an Oral B Triumph electric toothbrush that was several years old and starting to show a lot of wear.  </li>
            <li> how well I brushed them, an added app is really not going to make much difference.  </li>
            <li> It the app is not active, it doesn&#x27;t notice if you&#x27;ve brushed.</li>
            <li> I had a 8 year old basic oral b, I consider switching to the sonicare, but read comparison studies that said this did the same job for 1/2 the price.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush base can easily be used by more than one individual, we share amongst two people.  </li>
            <li> So unless you want to know how long you brushed your teeth for a week ago,  you can actually care for your teeth without the Bluetooth ever being used with the extra benefit on not getting toothpaste spray on your smart phone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Pro 5000 Smart Series toothbrush when my Pursonic ultrasonic toothbrush suddenly broke when it&#x27;s on/off button jammed after only 3 months</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like and wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the extra money on was the smart series.</li>
            <li> I upgraded to the 5000 series and the clean I received is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In general, it&#x27;s a motivating tool that serves a solid purpose.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the blue tooth at all, I&#x27;m using the Oral B cross action brush and it does a terrific job.</li>
            <li> A long stuttering sign indicates that your 2 minute time for the Professional Mode is done.  </li>
            <li> However, be warned that the toothbrush head (cross action) that it comes with is currently not out for individual sale.</li>
            <li> Disappointed I did not read the product description well enough to see that it did not come with monitor - have not been able to purchase separately and think it would be a necessary enhancement for full utilization of toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This can be helpful if you are busy or prone to not brushing long enough.</li>
            <li> brushing&lt;br /&gt;Designed for single usersh is on the loud side, but is tolerable</li>
            <li> My pre teen daughter, on the other hand is, and she still gives trouble to brush and clean her teeth properly.</li>
            <li> hers is actually somewhat slimmer but otherwise just as good as mine but less expensive.</li>
            <li> In particular, the bluetooth connectivity becomes unuseful and it&#x27;s difficult to know which brushing mode is being used, so I only use the \\&quot;daily clean mode\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think it really is a great gift idea for a techie type person or a gadget person, but for the average person, like myself, the idea of a toothbrush telling me when to brush and how often to brush and when I have brushed in the past is just a waste of time in which case a less expensive Oral-B toothbrush would be more appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He thought it was silly to stand there and brush with a smart phone that really does not do much as far as helping you.</li>
            <li> The other aspect of the blue tooth is that it will report how often and much time I spent brushing my teeth.</li>
            <li> I had an older model for about 10 years and always wanted the little device that is sold separately to mount in the bathroom and watch while I brushed my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t store the handle on the charging base the travel case is very handy</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t store the handle on the charging base the travel case is very handy</li>
            <li> One is professional and the other is the 2 minute mode.</li>
            <li> I had my hygiene appointment within 3 weeks of receiving, and was complimented on the absence of tartar.</li>
            <li> It keeps track of how long you&#x27;ve brushed, flossed, and cleaned your tongue, all while giving you the daily news and temperature outside.</li>
            <li> Though my previous brush still works, it was time for a new one as after 10 years it wouldn&#x27;t charge as well.  </li>
            <li> fewer than half of devices in use have the new Bluetooth 4.0</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll tell you when you brushed, how long, keeps track of if you flossed, brushed your tongue, mouthwash, etc.  </li>
            <li> the built-in features tell me when I&#x27;ve brushed for long enough.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is just too much hassle for the small amount of additional information provided.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure how helpful the bluetooth feature really is, though.  </li>
            <li> The small and angled head allows you to access the rear teeth and the inside of your teeth much easier.</li>
            <li> Item battery does not last that long.</li>
            <li> Affixing the SmartSeries gizmo to an adjacent wall would seem to invite leaving paint circle disfigurement - the adhesive ring doesn&#x27;t appear substantial enough to maintain adhesion bathroom humidity for too long.  </li>
            <li> 2nd one I have, battery life lasts a long time and recommended by dentist.</li>
            <li> While the toothbrush is charging it will glow blue on and off ALL NIGHT LONG.</li>
            <li> When on, the app will record how long you brushed for and store that stat.  </li>
            <li> App keeps track of how long you brushed your teeth.  </li>
            <li> not as good as the soniccare :(</li>
            <li> Oral-B has had a feature like this before, in the form of a separate little display, but having it built into a Smartphone is new, and convenient.  </li>
            <li> The head is too large, if you have wisdom teeth back there, they will be hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> The heads are not too bad at around $7 each, which isn&#x27;t cheap but seems reasonable.</li>
            <li> Sorry to sound like a shill for Sonicare, it&#x27;s just my only mode of comparison.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until it arrived that it offers less than its predecessor, Oral B,</li>
            <li> I missed the indicator lights on my old power toothbrush, but it only took a few brushings to adapt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received only 1 brush, in the package, expected about 4 different bristles..  </li>
            <li> That is really the most annoying design flaw for</li>
            <li> The brush does light up when you brush too hard, but my daughter is a lazy brusher so not necessary for us.</li>
            <li> Even though it may appear the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush is designed for a family of four, it is meant as a personal hygiene device for a single user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When set to 3 minutes (what Oral-b calls Deep Clean or 2 minutes + 1), the toothbrush wants me to change at the following rate: (Quad-1) after 30 seconds, (Quad-2)</li>
            <li> Not sure the remote timer and clock are necessary or much of a smiley-face feature, (despite the smiley-face on the read out).  </li>
            <li> Apparently the features of the phone give diagrams, charts, and other info that you can show the dentist.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I am happy with the tooth brushing performance, am a little disappointed with the associated app feature.</li>
            <li> It alerts you if you are putting too much pressure or brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> Very similar to other model, just lighter and a few new features.</li>
            <li> Call me crazy, but I find that there is much more to life than the bluetoothbrush.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time so there is no need to do that.</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time so there is no need to do that.</li>
            <li> The charge seems to hold for days, but it does take a long time to charge.</li>
            <li> Recharging a discharged toothbrush takes a long time, close to 48 hours for me.  </li>
            <li> If I was buying again, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have spent the extra money ($40) for the bluetooth connectivity, and would&#x27;ve gone with the Pro 4000.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take her long to get use to it</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time</li>
            <li> is how long will it keep working  for the price that I paid.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a LONG time after being charged.</li>
            <li> so you can see how you are doing over the long run.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not yet tested just how long the battery lasts between charges.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to switch to an electric toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> The timer lets you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time, and the head selection is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not loud for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious what the phone app would add, but I don&#x27;t have the patience or motivation to pursue it further.</li>
            <li> But I said it a long time ago when I wrote a review for the voice-activated grocery list machine that you put on the fridge...</li>
            <li> Holds a charge for a long time</li>
            <li> As far as features like the Bluetooth to sync with the app are pretty useless.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d only have to sync with your phone about every two weeks or so, but frankly, I&#x27;m not entirely certain why I&#x27;d want a log of how often I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my purchase of previous Oral Pro 5000 series, I had received a total of 4 different bristles in the package.</li>
            <li> Bluetooth, really I mean who wants to sync their brush to the phone and watch the phone while brushing.  </li>
            <li> I like it, although I have a stock of small circular brushes in my drawer and will continue to use them when this new one wears</li>
            <li> /&gt;This model comes with a different head than the traditional small circular Oral-B head and also different than the newer oval shaped head with a vibrating tip.  </li>
            <li> And other options to either remind or assure you are brushing properly.  </li>
            <li> but takes a LONG time to recharge the battery -- over 30 hours!</li>
            <li> Gives you a timer and some other basic data, but not all that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Only gave it a &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; due to the bluetooth claims.  </li>
            <li> Except the tongue cleaning mood which is different from the other moods, I feel like the other four are the same function.</li>
            <li> While it does have some sensors to stop you from brushing too hard, its mainly just a timer with some recommended brushing instructions</li>
            <li> The charging base is nice and small, so very portable for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That’s very strange in this era of crowd-sourcing help and answers.  </li>
            <li> That’s very strange in this era of crowd-sourcing help and answers.  </li>
            <li> Either pay the extra $20 to get the next model up, or save yourself the trouble (and money) and get an lower model number.  </li>
            <li> I use to have the older Oral-B PC1000, so at least I have a comparable.  </li>

            <li> It senses when I briefly interrupt my brushing and resumes where I left off, I senses when I’m done brushing and when I press too hard on my gums (the screen on the smartphone turns red), etc.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> It tracks total and session average time by the day, week and month as well as</li>

            <li> However, if you find an Oral B that comes without bluetooth and is priced cheaper, I would go for the toothbrush without bluetooth because the Oral-B bluetooth feature is not worth extra money.</li>

            <li> I have trouble with brushing too hard and this brush lets me know with the red light when I&#x27;m brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> It has gone down in price over the last two months from over $100 to just below $80, and I hope that trend continues.  </li>
            <li> The small brush head took a little getting used to, but I really like it now.  </li>
            <li> The Oral B 4000 does the same job for much less, without the necessity of having your iPhone on the bathroom sink every time you brush.  </li>
            <li> it was possible, not sure what would be the future impact with version updates.</li>
            <li> The portable case should be bigger,  not enough room for a small toothpaste tube.</li>
            <li> I only used it for less than one day because using it is too onerous for what it provides.  </li>
            <li> I only used it for less than one day because using it is too onerous for what it provides.  </li>
            <li> On this one, that button has been moved slightly, and I find that I&#x27;m constantly inadvertently pushing it while brushing.  </li>
            <li> We have a toothbrush that brushes our teeth for us, and tells us when, how long, and communicates with other devices.  </li>
            <li> However the app has a very limited usefulness.  </li>
            <li> If you were to put it on the wall the little lid over your brush storage area would not open.  </li>
            <li> However, once up and running and after a few days of use, I have to admit its performance seems equal to the [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not much that has changed with the brush itself.</li>
            <li> you wait till it&#x27;s empty</li>
            <li> It lights up green to remind you to move to a different quadrant in your mouth and lights up again when it&#x27;s been 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Everything works as expected.</li>
            <li> When set to 2 minutes, each quadrant takes 30 seconds (4 x 30 sec &#x3D; 120 sec).  </li>
            <li> Instead, I expected that I would be reminded to change quadrant after 45 seconds and that end-of-job indicator would vibrate at</li>
            <li> Exellent toothbrush minus the blutooth -it</li>
            <li> All started out well, however after a few days, maybe it was because of the Lollipop upgrade to Android, the Oral-B app timer, which starts when you start brushing and stops when you stop brushing, would stop in the middle of brushing.  </li>
            <li> However, the bluetooth functionality is very spotty and frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li> Battery shorted out after only a few months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about what I expected.</li>
            <li> For all intents and purposes I would describe the app as an activity monitor with some fluff built in.  </li>
            <li> The Oral-B toothbrush also provides a few additional settings (mine came with 5 different modes) from the Pursonic toothbrush in case you need them.  </li>
            <li> The Pursonic also came with a few different setting and, probably came with all the settings you need.  </li>

            <li> The Pursonic also came with a few different setting and, probably came with all the settings you need.  </li>
            <li> I also thought it was too rough.  </li>
            <li> My kids use this handle again and it gets wet</li>
            <li> Also, when handling an electric toothbrush you need to be careful not to have it turned on unless it is in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Caution for buyers who do not live in the U.S.!!</li>
            <li> The app is CRAP, seems like 3rd grade app developed by very much reputed brand.&lt;br /&gt;1)</li>
            <li> And if you are not gentle enough with the placement of the brush, it will glow red and slow down the pulsations.</li>
            <li> ; The toothbrush storage is simpler, less difficult to keep clean than my previous device.</li>
            <li> Minor complaint, but why not move it to a spot not so likely to get pushed?</li>
            <li> that demonstrates a promising embrace of networked user engagement practices in the otherwise mundane and forgettable task of your daily tooth hygiene.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous Oral-B that finally gave up after a few years.  </li>
            <li> I usually brush 2x daily.</li>
            <li> This brush cleans my teeth extremely well</li>
            <li> I, personally, am not interested in the app.</li>
            <li> In other words, the clock will start with my brushing session for say 10 seconds, then it will reset to 2:00.  </li>
            <li> The toothbrush might be waterproof but my phone definitely isn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m not sure I like the idea of keeping it on my sink where it can get splattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other apps record events while in the background, why not this one?&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cleans extremely well</li>
            <li> It cleans my teeth extremely well without making my gums sore.</li>
            <li> Other times, it won&#x27;t turn on when I need to use it.  </li>
            <li> However she did warn me not to press too hard at the gumline, as she saw little curves where the rotating brush was grinding the soft part of my teeth at the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the previous model, I never really used the lower button that changes the speed/cadence of the brush head.  </li>
            <li> These badges may add some positive reinforcement, but are largely useless.  </li>
            <li> Granted after a few months it seemed the motor got a little weak but not to much.</li>
            <li> She wants me to move the station to one of the other 2 bathrooms but out of principle of buying this expensive product I refuse to leave the room just to brush my teeth.</li>
            <li> It seems much easier to operate as such (less revisiting parts of my mouth that feel dirty still).  </li>
            <li> But the smart Bluetooth features are useless.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing like being recognized for your hard work but who&#x27;s going to know that you spent a little extra time on your teeth or haven&#x27;t missed a day in six months?</li>
            <li> It tells him what part of his mouth to brush next and warns him if he&#x27;s pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> For example, when you brush too hard it blinks red.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare for years, but recently my dentist recommended this model to me because it has a sensor that tells you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Also, the size of the head makes it hard to slip around and into the mouth, it gets caught on my cheek every time I try to go the the back teeth</li>
            <li> Yeah, but if you skip it the app will know and your average time will drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> About my only complaint is that the app is a bit intrusive and of course it&#x27;s another device to plugin and charge.  </li>
            <li> My hands are wet, and I&#x27;m not touching my phone when my hands are dripping wet.</li>
            <li> Not only does this toothbrush keep me accountable, it tells me: when it is time to change the brush head, when I&#x27;m late brushing my teeth that day (brunch brusher), reminds me of my upcoming dentist appt.</li>
            <li> So, here&#x27;s a very short video to show that, at least with the toothbrush and SmartGuide that I have, they do work together.</li>
            <li> This app and BT communication synchronize with the app&#x27;s timer so you can count up or down to the recommended two minute mark.</li>
            <li> lots of money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I figured, if it works, think of all of the dentist bills we will avoid down the road.</li>
            <li> Should have gone with one mode down without Bluetooth.</li>
            <li> I had to ask myself if the Sonicare had been going down hill for months, and, therefore, was not doing the teeth cleaning that it should have been doing.</li>
            <li> Even when you strip it down to one category (let&#x27;s say, weather)</li>
            <li> I tried this by biting down on the head</li>
            <li> Like that it shows when the battery is getting down there</li>
            <li> One time it updated my profile with the missing session, the other time it did not.  </li>
            <li> One time it updated my profile with the missing session, the other time it did not.  </li>
            <li> I picked this up when it was over half price.</li>
            <li> The brush holder I had previously was built in and had the ability to drop in the head and close it.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned the 3000.</li>
            <li> it will sync up the previous sessions.  </li>
            <li> Included price was actually less.</li>
            <li> Since a typical rechargeable battery lasts about 500 charging cycles and the battery runs about 5 days once it&#x27;s fully charged for me</li>
            <li> Since the main reason for getting this toothbrush was the Bluetooth capability, it seems rather an expensive mistake to have bought a Bluetooth brush that doesn&#x27;t work reliably with Bluetooth.  </li>
            <li> It then synchronizes the next time the app is used while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is when sharing the brush with someone else or multiple devices with the app.  </li>
            <li> Save a few bucks, even if it did work it&#x27;s not really a useful feature.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my girl its her First one she crazy about it</li>
            <li> Had experience with the base model for the past 2 years and decided to step up and buy one of the top models.  </li>
            <li> You have to press hard enough to slow the motor down for</li>
            <li> Just little accomplishments you can achieve?</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I may have gone for the far less expensive 1000 model.</li>
            <li> It is fine on this regard, but the &amp;#34;newsfeed&amp;#34; is extremely annoying.</li>
            <li> The app tells you if you are pressing the brush too hard, but the brush also lights up red to tell you that you are pressing too hard.  </li>
            <li> I get awards, it tracks the time I spent, provides news in the AM while I&#x27;m brushing, yells at me if I brush too hard, etc.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped that this would make brushing fun or identify bad habits I have with teeth brushing...</li>
            <li> the app is only for apple or android;(( I haven&#x27;t used the different modes either because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t know which one I&#x27;m using without the bluetooth feature.  </li>
            <li> I have always disliked vibration and even tho is vibrates my teeth</li>
            <li> Additionally, you&#x27;ll get one round toothbrush</li>
            <li> The handle is heavy to hold.  </li>
            <li> This Oral B 5000 with Bluetooth  is a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Now I just spot check his teeth a few times a week and can give him a pat on the head with &amp;#34;Great job, Kiddo,&amp;#34; every time.</li>
            <li> Quite frankly, after a few days I didn&#x27;t bother to haul my phone into the bathroom to see what the report was.  </li>
            <li> I have to admit I started ignoring the quadrant reminders after a few days, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I happen to be a few days away from getting two fillings for cavities.</li>
            <li> However it is rather harsh.</li>
            <li> Sometimes stopping the brush for a few seconds then restarting will correct this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After having used it for a few days</li>
            <li> Have had for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> I believe the app would download all brushing sessions to each device because it would think it was missing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I believe the app would download all brushing sessions to each device because it would think it was missing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It took me a few days to figure everything out on this one.  </li>
            <li> does the job it is made for, but there are a few things I&#x27;ll mention.&lt;br /&gt;Bluetooth - Don&#x27;t bother, it never works.</li>
            <li> And it is really not comfortable because you dont know which mode</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not fit</li>
            <li> They feel as though I went to the dentist for a cleaning everyday.</li>
            <li> Just seemed like a gimmicky feature to me.  </li>
            <li> this model as it is too delicate for wet environment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Expect to use the Bluetooth app a few times and then stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is not a cheap brush.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday to store my brush in</li>
            <li> The bluetooth feature for Oral-B does work seamlessly with my samsung s4 smart phone but had very silly and useless features.  </li>
            <li> The bluetooth feature for Oral-B does work seamlessly with my samsung s4 smart phone but had very silly and useless features.  </li>
            <li> As pointed out by other android users, android app sucks.</li>
            <li> Very few people know what the Oral-B Pro 5000 is, much less have one.  </li>
            <li> What is nice about this model is you can get rid of the unnecessary plastic and just set the brush on the small base which takes up very little room on the counter.  </li>
            <li> , I would not buy this model again but a simplier (less expensive), as it will do the same job.</li>
            <li> I have poured money down the drain with dentist bills because I had been brushing too hard all along.</li>
            <li> However, the brushing experience of this device is pretty bad by my standards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had trouble with the Bluetooth, but it&#x27;s pointless.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to the electric toothbrush game.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t find the Bluetooth useful, this product is a big, very expensive, disappointment.</li>
            <li> But the few unremovable black stains on the white rubber handle is truly disappointing.</li>
            <li> I usually brush my teeth a bit longer.</li>
            <li> I do not want to buy an expensive one with a lot of internal storage just to replace it in 12 months.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t have movie star pearly white teeth</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t have movie star pearly white teeth</li>
            <li> Sad to say, I can&#x27;t test the app out because it requires Bluetooth 4.0 and my phone, an iPhone 4, only has Bluetooth 2.0.  </li>
            <li> When it fails I&#x27;ll switch back to my $5 one.</li>
            <li> No more manual brush for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No real difference in operation and its a craps shoot regarding the poor quality batteries.  </li>
            <li> So I tried the usual ones without success.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> So I find myself having to use a manual brush for these areas, since the small head of the electric brush does not hold the toothpaste for use in this stage of brushing.</li>
            <li> so I am not sure if I will use it when I travel.  </li>
            <li> so I am not sure if I will use it when I travel.  </li>
            <li> I had a prior version of this brush for almost a decade, and it just started to fail.  </li>
            <li> My friends thought I was silly for choosing a blue tooth tooth brush.  </li>
            <li> Almost as if using some small power tool.  </li>
            <li> she said why she never bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> Though a bit expensive, my only regret is not buying it sooner.</li>
            <li> If it could stream data from past brushings</li>
            <li> I think in the past I have --</li>
            <li> Very frustrating given the cost of this purchase especially when the session drops out after 5 seconds and I get a message I should try to brush longer!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have written, the bluetooth connection to my iPhone is completely unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> When the grid crashes those in &#x27;need&#x27; of that app are going to be in serious trouble...</li>
            <li> Now, I brush for what I know is at least two minutes, if not more.  </li>
            <li> This is a terrible idea, just put a display back on the front of the brush like the older models.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
            <li> The brush bristles are very stiff and hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the oval shaped head to be too hard on my gums.  </li>
            <li> Will probably get one for myself as well since I have receding gums from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> Yes, the toothbrush flashes when you brush too hard.</li>
            <li> you press too hard (in your toothbrush&#x27;s opinion)</li>
            <li> The toothbrush has a pressure sensor to alert you if you are pushing too hard.</li>
            <li> It also tells you when you are pushing too hard</li>
            <li> I do like that the toothbrush lights up if you brush too hard.</li>
            <li> I find the tendency for apps to be huge very annoying.</li>
            <li> I find the tendency for apps to be huge very annoying.</li>
            <li> negative is that it runs on 110-130 voltage which means I need a voltage converter</li>
            <li> /&gt;Please fix it before it&#x27;s too late and ruin your product</li>
            <li> One negative for the Oral-B toothbrush is the bluetooth feature that comes with the toothbrush.  </li>

            <li> My wife goes crazy when I brush my teeth just before going to bed and 3 blue lights are flashing for up to 45 minutes in the darkness of the room.</li>
            <li> You &amp;#62;may&amp;#60; have Bluetooth 4.0 if you’re running at least Android 4.3 (released July 2013).&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  </li>
            <li> However, the negative aspects of this toothbrush outweigh the positives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pressure sensor is, like other reviewers say, fairly useless since you have to press really hard for it to go</li>
            <li> This is a lazy person&#x27;s dream!  </li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to me because he said that I brush too hard with a normal brush and it wears away the base of my enamel.</li>
            <li> Seriously???  </li>
            <li> Seriously, who needs Bluetooth, an app or anything besides some toothpaste and a toothbrush to brush their teeth?  </li>
            <li> I have a horrible sense of time and apparently only brushed my teeth before this toothbrush for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> would give 5 stars if the charging time wasn&#x27;t so ridiculously</li>
            <li> I even downloaded the (as ridiculous as this sounds) Bluetooth app for my iPhone, hoping that it would have an indicator.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely ridiculous considering it cost over $100.</li>
            <li> I also noted that the brush heads for the Oral-B are somewhat less expensive...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, unless you are going to take advantage of the Bluetooth accessibility, I would find a less expensive Oral-B.</li>
            <li> This is just plain dumb product design!</li>
            <li> It was bad enough when the CIA put the mind-reading chip in my skull.</li>
            <li> Now that I know how incompetent Oral-B customer service is, I will never purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Compared to the Panasonic Electric Toothbrush it is unwieldy, noisy, and just plain uncomfortable...</li>
            <li> but was disappointed in several features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed that it came with only one brush.</li>
            <li> It is hard to imagine an idea that lends itself to silly overkill criticism like putting BT into a toothbrush handle.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the damn thing also kicks in when you press too hard on a tooth.</li>
            <li> Tired?</li>
            <li> Too tired to brush?</li>

            <li> Oral-B has stepped up their game and now is competitive in electric toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Confused about how they make the price.&lt;br /&gt;The pressure sensor seems not working.....</li>
            <li> Adults might find it to be unnecessary.</li>
            <li> though it would sync the broken session (stored on brush) details in App</li>
            <li> But the problem is that it&#x27;s a poor process.</li>
            <li> If you want to track your kids then stand behind them and watch them.</li>
            <li> app also contains silly things like Achievement badges which are awarded after repeated uses, based on the activity and the time you do it (for instance if you brush your teeth at least 7 times between 3 AM and 6 AM you get a badge).  </li>
            <li> I like the toothbrush itself but the Bluetooth is flaky and the blue lights are annoying.</li>
            <li> I thought the cover tray was poorly done since you just place it over the toothbrush heads.</li>
            <li> I find the stuttering experience annoying since it suddenly stops what I am trying to do.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an improvement over a manual brush, but, for me, not a great powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Three months is broken</li>
            <li> I thought he was ridiculous for wanting a toothbrush this expensive, but he loves it</li>
            <li> I’ve had the app stop recording in the middle of sessions and give me the very disappointed face that I didn’t brush for at least 2 minutes when in fact I was still brushing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other Oral B toothbrush heads are interchangeable with the base of this</li>
            <li> I hate the film on your teeth that gathers after you eat and this tooth brush keeps that way down.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was wrong</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to try this brush since I&#x27;m not that tech savvy.</li>
            <li> I noticed flossing isn&#x27;t as difficult either.  </li>
            <li> The bluetooth feature is useless.  </li>
            <li> It does not have those useless features and it is lighter.</li>
            <li> The Bluetooth thing is laughable though.  </li>
            <li> sorry I purchased this model.</li>
            <li> Bells and whistles that I find useless.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 5 months of use it stop working.</li>
            <li> Two night ago and randomly shut off on me while using.</li>
            <li> However, I found the following very annoying defects for a product</li>
            <li> The replacement heads is expensive but you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed, however, that the design of the handle was not more thought out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ill have to read the manual and go from there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the absolutely useless features built (and charged for) in that made me angry and</li>
            <li> I was not nearly as impressed with this unit as I hoped to be.</li>
            <li> One thing I do not like about this toothbrush is at random times</li>
            <li> So for me, this is a useless feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bluetooth is just a useless gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Toothbrush does not function as advertised, app is useless and doesn&#x27;t function with the brush handle.  </li>
            <li> and I was really skeptical</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Oral-B Pro 5000 if you are looking for a professional-level automatic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> this gadget is expensive, and that&#x27;s why I use it instead of a piece of paper.  </li>
            <li> but I must admit as silly as the Bluetooth capability and an app ..for my toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Without the display, it is almost impossible to tell which brushing mode you are on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought a product as bad as this.</li>
            <li> This is crazy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Just truly disappointed my busted.</li>
            <li> I like the case that came with it, but was disappointed that it does not accommodate the charger and cord, just two brushes &amp; the handle.  </li>
            <li> If you think this is stupid, do yourself a favor and get the 4000.</li>
            <li> yes, it totally worthless</li>
            <li> The charging base can be remove from the 4 slot toothbrush holder.  </li>
            <li> So all the fancy crap that comes along is worthless.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s really annoying at night.</li>
            <li> However the Bluetooth is worthless.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this toothbrush!  </li>
            <li> Very annoying.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible tooth brush.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought this at Walmart for $99 in April 2015. I love the travel case, easy to clean and holds the parts tight (and I lugged it around a suitcase from hotel to hotel for about 4 days. It did take a full 24 hrs (about) to charge, which I did before I even turned it on. The brush head spins super fast and even though it alerts you every 30 secs it will keep on after the 2 minute mark. I usually brush my teeth a bit longer. I&#x27;ve used the Oral-B 3D White rechargable toothbrush prior and it did good, but I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing till I turned this baby on the first time. It&#x27;s been a week and I still haven&#x27;t had to charge it. I usually brush 2x daily. I&#x27;ll update when I do finally charge it.</li>
            <li> seemed to work well for the first 1.5 years...after that it hasn&#x27;t worked correctly (won&#x27;t sync with the timer, timer jumps around during middle of a brushing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did seem to have great results when visiting the dentist.</li>
            <li> Win number one is using a good quality powered toothbrush like this one versus a non-powered brush. It is far superior to a regular high quality toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win number two is the Oral-B brush itself. It feels good using it and it does a good job as a powered toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Win number three is the BT and android app integration. This is the big win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Briefly, wins one and two are a no brainer. These brushes are on the market and have stayed in the market at many price points because they work, people like them and feel they get good results with them. I&#x27;ve personally been using a powered brush since sometime in 2004 I think. Back then I bought one of the [[ASIN:B007ZN5ATQ Sonicare]] brushes. I used that until it finally actually broke apart sometime in 2009. In 2009 I got another [[ASIN:B0019ZEVZU Sonicare ]], the Healthy White model, and I still have it only putting it aside to test this Oral-B brush for Vine. I am very happy with my Sonicare and probably wouldn&#x27;t have even bothered with this Oral-B but for the bluetooth integration. I love geeky stuff and what&#x27;s geekier than a toothbrush with bluetooth?? lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which brings us to win number three. Bluetooth integration. It is hard to imagine an idea that lends itself to silly overkill criticism like putting BT into a toothbrush handle. But! It is genius! A truism about change is that to effect change you must be able to measure what you want to change. The more measurable something is the more amenable to change it becomes. If you want to brush your teeth more often or more effectively you have to figure out some way of measuring what you are doing now to make positive changes. Oral-B&#x27;s app and BT enabled handle takes that principle to an awesome place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These powered brushes, the two I&#x27;ve owned, have vibrate timers built-in to prod you to move to the next zone of teeth. That&#x27;s fine. This app and BT communication synchronize with the app&#x27;s timer so you can count up or down to the recommended two minute mark. That&#x27;s cool and neat but not anything more than an 99 cent egg timer could do for you with a non-powered brush. What this device and that app give you is customizable timers, tracking progress over time, a history of activity (condensed), reminders (I didn&#x27;t bother with this), gentle condemnation, rewards and the current brushing mode. Wow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I added 20 seconds of focused care to my front teeth. That begins as soon as the default 2 minute timer is up. I also spend a little unscheduled time in whitening mode after the focused care - made very, very easy by pushing the select button and seeing the mode change on the app till I get to whitening mode. After the session the app congratulates you on mission accomplished or gives you a frowny if you didn&#x27;t go the whole way heh. It tracks total and session average time by the day, week and month as well as how many times you brushed your teeth per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool thing about all of that is that you become your own source of peer pressure to brush your teeth. Tired? Too tired to brush? Yeah, but if you skip it the app will know and your average time will drop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you play modern video games? You know how lots of games have trophies of some sort? Just little accomplishments you can achieve? This app has them too. So you get a trophy for all sorts of silly stuff that reinforces good brushing habits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe none of that applies to you because you are a nut about brushing your teeth. If that is the case you may be the person that enjoys this product more than anyone else. There&#x27;s nothing like being recognized for your hard work but who&#x27;s going to know that you spent a little extra time on your teeth or haven&#x27;t missed a day in six months? Nobody. Nobody, that is, until now - now you get an app that recognizes and rewards your diligence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sold? I hope so. I love this toothbrush (and toothbrushes like it) and I think you will too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some miscellaneous stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care what the mfg says. Do not store the handle on the plugged-in charger. My first Sonicare lasted about five years before physically falling apart. My second one has lasted five years and is still going. I read through some of those reviews before writing this review and there were plenty that mentioned the handle just stopped working. Don&#x27;t constantly charge your handle by storing it on the plugged-in charging base. The charge lasts a long time so there is no need to do that. With the Sonicare handles I&#x27;d just use them until they completely discharged. With this handle, because of the tracking app, I use it for six days and set it on the charging base the same day every week. I recommend you do that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the travel case this brush comes with. The handle has a push in spot and the head has a push in spot. Since I don&#x27;t store the handle on the charging base the travel case is very handy and I use it every day. Great value added item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is round with this model versus the Sonicare&#x27;s more traditional rectangle shaped head. I have come to really enjoy this smaller per tooth focusable shape and size with the Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B app is a huge 32mb in size. I find the tendency for apps to be huge very annoying. Phone technology improves so often I do not want to buy an expensive one with a lot of internal storage just to replace it in 12 months. Apps like this make it a hassle to manage which fat bloated app to keep or uninstall. Oral-B should work to improve that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the idea of using your phone and the app to brush your teeth better is a non-starter for you then, please, still purchase a powered handle just get a quality one without the BT. It is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About eight years ago, a couple of years after getting my first powered brush, my then-GF told me she couldn&#x27;t understand how I kept my teeth so much whiter than hers lol. I smoke and drink coffee - she doesn&#x27;t. That was the best testimony I ever heard about the benefits of owning and using a good quality handle like this one. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t have movie star pearly white teeth and I don&#x27;t think one of these brushes alone with do that for you but it will do everything better than a $2 non-powered brush will do times infinity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quality powered toothbrushes are well worth the investment.ome miscellaneous stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care what the mfg says.

            <li> My wife and I both love this toothbrush. An amazing purchase.</li>
            <li> My 2nd Oral B tooth brush ....  Takes a little getting used to, but I think it will work fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Sonicare toothbrush for over a decade and I loved it. The battery was starting to get weaker and weaker so I started looking for a new toothbrush. This Oral-B brush has fantastic ratings and was really excited about it. I thought the bluetooth connection feature would be cool but it wasn&#x27;t. The problem that I had with this brush is it&#x27;s so LOUD. I felt like I had a lawnmower in my mouth. It worked very well but it was just too loud. I couldn&#x27;t stand it so I returned it. I purchased the Sonicare Diamondclean and I am much much much happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Price is great; Cleans teeth very nice giving you that fresh from the dentist&#x27;s office feel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: LOUD and I mean LOUD; bluetooth connection is not near as cool as I thought it would be</li>
            <li> My Teeth are now spoiled ( in a good way ). Will never go back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Ever since I started using the Oral-B Pro 4000s and above, my dental hygenist has loved me (well, she likes me and loves how clean my teeth are).  They do a fabulous job cleaning, keeping tartar levels low and keeping gums healthy.  I only use the standard brushing mode on these models (the 5000 comes with five modes).  I brush each quadrant for 30 seconds (the built in timer on the toothbrush tells you when your 30 seconds are up by doing a funny rotation of the toothbrush head).  Two minutes later, voila, my teeth are clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 4000 model  simply has a built in timer and multiple modes.  The last 5000 I had provided an external screen which kept track of your brushing progress.  I found that screen completely unnecessary, although kids might like it (which might motivate them to brush better).  On this 5000, that screen has been replaced by a Bluetooth connection and a phone app to allow your phone to do the thing the external screen once did.  Sad to say, I can&#x27;t test the app out because it requires Bluetooth 4.0 and my phone, an iPhone 4, only has Bluetooth 2.0.  It wouldn&#x27;t matter.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This model comes with a different head than the traditional small circular Oral-B head and also different than the newer oval shaped head with a vibrating tip.  I&#x27;ve found the oval shaped head to be too hard on my gums.  The one provided with this model, a large circular shaped head, seems to be a compromise between the two I&#x27;ve used before.  I like it, although I have a stock of small circular brushes in my drawer and will continue to use them when this new one wears out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one odd thing to note with this newest model is that it flashes ridiculously bright when it&#x27;s charging.  If you keep your brush on your recharging stand all the time when it&#x27;s not in use, you probably won&#x27;t notice this.  But I only charge when the unit shows a red light.  When I put this model on the charging stand, the blue flashing light filled the bathroom, so much so that it was disturbing me in my bedroom.  I&#x27;ve since moved my once a week charging to the laundry room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone like me, the 4000 model or 3000 models, which have the same fast brushing speeds, would be good enough.  If you want the deep cleaning mode and Bluetooth, spend the extra money and get a 5000.bathroom, so much so that it was disturbing me in my bedroom.

            <li> Up until receiving this toothbrush I had only purchased Sonicare products.  I must say that this toothbrush is just as good as the Sonicare products.  Oral-B has stepped up their game and now is competitive in electric toothbrushes.  The power of the brush head is terrific and I like the smaller rounded head of the brush rather then the oblong shape of the Sonic brushes.  I feel like I can get further into the back of my mouth with the smaller and rounder brushes.  I have not tried the Bluetooth app yet and I don&#x27;t think that I will.  In my opinion, I am already using a high tech device that used to be a manual device for me, I don&#x27;t need to add an app to keep track of my brushing habits.  Others might find it useful and interesting but all I care about it whether or not my teeth are clean or not.  This brush cleans my teeth extremely well and I am pleased that there is another company competing against Sonicare.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It is easy to use and cleans my teeth so well. I hate the film on your teeth that gathers after you eat and this tooth brush keeps that way down. My teeth feel super clean. I have always disliked vibration and even tho is vibrates my teeth it doesn&#x27;t ping around in my head. It is easy to recharge and three people easily use this one toothbrush. The brushes last for quite a while and even tho they are a mint to replace you can find deals on amazon or Costco. I have two of these and my daughters use theirs to brush there braces. They are just really good cleaning everything in your mouth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is the perfect compliment to my Bluetooth toilet that tells my smartphone how close to the center I am peeing each day.  I now brush my teeth perfectly and hit every tooth the exact same amount of time each day, and I always pee within 98% accuracy of the center of the bowl.  My life could not be more complete.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised by how much I like this toothbrush. I was worried at first when it took well over a day for the battery to fully charge. However, once up and running and after a few days of use, I have to admit its performance seems equal to the [[ASIN:B0052JN7XG Philips Sonicare HX9332/05 DiamondClean Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush, White]] that I&#x27;ve loved for years and this costs a lot less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like my more expensive power toothbrush, this Oral-B has different cleaning modes. When first turned on, it starts in Daily Clean (regular) mode and each push of the button takes it to the next mode (Deep, Sensitive, Whitening, Massage and Tongue Cleaning). I missed the indicator lights on my old power toothbrush, but it only took a few brushings to adapt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred mode is Deep Clean, but if you are new to power brushes you&#x27;ll want to start at Sensitive, move to Daily Clean and then move to Deep Clean for your daily regime to avoid bleeding gums, etc (as you&#x27;ll read about in some reviews). The brush comes with Oral-B&#x27;s advanced brush head, but you can separately order brush heads for sensitive gums, teeth whitening and braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second best feature to the cleaning performance of this brush is its professional timer. On Deep Clean mode, I begin brushing in the left top quadrant of my mouth. At the end of 45 seconds the brush makes an audible stutter and flashes a light to let me know to move to the next quadrant. After two more times and a total of 3 minutes, the brush turns off and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has Bluetooth, which isn&#x27;t as cool of an add on as I&#x27;d hoped. If the power brush with Bluetooth and my smartphone could interact and identify potential problem areas before I needed a dentist, THAT would be cool. As it is, it pretty much just works to create a diary of when I brushed. It could be handy if I had memory issues, but really, if I forgot whether I brushed, I&#x27;d just go brush again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also in the box was a functional, utilitarian travel case, a charging cord and stand with a four brush holder. If I had to give an improvement opportunity, I would suggest offering a lower priced identical model, except without the Bluetooth.nal, utilitarian travel case, a charging cord and stand with a four brush holder.

            <li> Braun Oral-B&#x27;s Pro 5000 SmartSeries electric toothbrush is very sophisticated and cleans effectively and gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B is very nicely made from a combination of glossy and rubberized white plastic.  It feels great in the hand and balances well.  It looks very futuristic and modern.  Included with the Braun is a charging base/toothbrush caddy and a brittle plastic travel case (speaking of traveling, the battery lasts up to 10 days on a charge).  Additionally, you&#x27;ll get one round toothbrush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a toothbrush, the Oral-B is loaded with features.  It has 5 brushing modes (regular, extended, sensitive, whitening, and massaging).  It also has a built-in interval timer to let you know when 30 seconds have passed so you can move to the next quadrant of your mouth.  Lastly, it has a bright red indicator light to let you know when you are pushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The highlight feature of this Oral-B is its built-in Bluetooth.  By downloading a free app, it will connect with your Smartphone so you can keep track of your brushing progress.  Oral-B has had a feature like this before, in the form of a separate little display, but having it built into a Smartphone is new, and convenient.  I downloaded the app to my iPhone 5s and it hooked up with the toothbrush instantly, and worked flawlessly.  While you&#x27;re brushing your teeth you can check out the news stories that appear at the bottom of the app or switch over to your browser, and it will remember your progress.  The app will also keep track of your brushing consistency, encouraging you to brush for a full 2 minutes twice daily.  You can even use the app to disable some of the brushing modes that you don&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning performance of the Oral-B is high and leaves my teeth squeaky clean and my breath fresh.  I like to use the normal mode followed by 30 seconds of whitening in the morning, and extended cleaning and 30 seconds of gum massaging at night.  I&#x27;ve never had any issues with bleeding or sensitivity using the Oral-B either.  I, however, have been using some sort of electric toothbrush for years.  If this is your first electric toothbrush, you may want to start out brushing in the sensitive mode until your mouth adjusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a great electric toothbrush, with a handy app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02/26/2015 Update: When I stream audio from my iPhone to a Bluetooth speaker, while I&#x27;m using the Oral-B app, the app freaks out and keeps resetting.  It only happens when I stream Bluetooth audio, so I don&#x27;t stream Bluetooth audio when I brush my teeth anymore.th bleeding or sensitivity using the Oral-B either.  I, however, have been using some sort of electric toothbrush for years.  If this is your first electric toothbrush, you may want to start out brushing in the sensitive mode until your mouth adjusts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... a great electric toothbrush, with a handy app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;02/26/2015 Update: When I stream audio from my iPhone to a Bluetooth speaker, while I&#x27;m using the Oral-B app, the app freaks out and keeps resetting.  It only happens when I stream Bluetooth audio, so I don&#x27;t stream Bluetooth audio when I brush my teeth anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to see that Oral-B has upgraded the 5000 SmartSeries power toothbrush with a decent smartphone app and ditched the previously included, cumbersome Smartguide device (a small wifi device with limited functionality that displayed the time and a countdown clock of your brushing cycle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re familiar with the PRO 5000/7000 series of toothbrushes there&#x27;s not much that has changed with the brush itself. The battery charge indicator has been updated with a new led-light display pattern but everything else is familiar and same. You&#x27;re getting the 5 brush modes, a vibration and light-flash pattern every 25% into the cycle and the immensely satisfying finish that the &#x27;3D Action&#x27; brush head oscillation and pulsation provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most interesting update to the 5000 series is the utilization of Bluetooth technology that allows your brush to sync up with your smartphone to monitor current brushing progress, measure the last 6 months of your brushing history and intuitively make a series of adjustments to the device itself that truly personalizes your individual brushing experience. While brushing the app will keep you informed and entertained with featured content such as top news stories, local weather or a slideshow of pics from your personal albums amongst many other options. Sounds frivolous, yes? I initially thought so but it sure beats staring at yourself in the mirror for 2+ minutes and truly makes the brushing session go by in a jiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s also the addition of gamification features via the inclusion of 40 trophies (eg - &#x27;7 Day Brushing Streak&#x27;) that demonstrates a promising embrace of networked user engagement practices in the otherwise mundane and forgettable task of your daily tooth hygiene. I imagine that these initial batch of trophies are just the beginning and future updates will add new engagement loops (eg - unlock &#x27;x&#x27; trophy and get a free brush head) and perhaps offer demographic-specific activities such as an adventure game for kids that only allows progress as they brush each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stat junkies in search of another data source to feed into their quantified lifestyle will also appreciate the 6 months of brushing history the app stores that pinpoints a variety of data sets including moments when you were brushing too hard, your flossing/mouthwash/tongue cleaning patterns amongst many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Oral-B&#x27;s inclusion of smart networking on their new brushes is a very promising start (the features currently offered through the synced app is just the beginning) and I look forward to experiencing the expansion and evolution of this particular service. One day, in a not so distant future, these brushes will have SIRI like conversations with us and when that happens - I for one, welcome our new power toothbrush Overlords.adventure game for kids that only allows progress as they brush each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stat junkies in search of another data source to feed into their quantified lifestyle will also appreciate the 6 months of brushing history the app stores that pinpoints a variety of data sets including moments when you were brushing too hard, your flossing/mouthwash/tongue cleaning patterns amongst many others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Oral-B&#x27;s inclusion of smart networking on their new brushes is a very promising start (the features currently offered through the synced app is just the beginning) and I look forward to experiencing the expansion and evolution of this particular service.

            <li> At first I was a little concerned about letting my toothbrush and phone talk since they have so much intimate knowledge regarding my breath and where my mouth has been but so far the gossip has been minimal.</li>
            <li> We are taking technology for granted these days.  We have a toothbrush that brushes our teeth for us, and tells us when, how long, and communicates with other devices.  Yes, motorized brushes have been around a while, but this is a fine example of how improved they have become and the advancement of maintaining oral health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting to the reality of it, the unit is quite solid, feels good in the hand, in a great base station, and most importantly does a great job cleaning.  I have tried other power brushes before, and this is pretty good at reaching all teeth with comfort to the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But why on earth do we need it to be bluetooth?  To work with the free app on your phone.  It is basically recording your brushing habits. Telling you where you need to spend more time.  It alerts you if you are putting too much pressure or brushing too hard.  And other options to either remind or assure you are brushing properly.  I admit the 2 minute timer helps, because let&#x27;s face it, we sometimes just brush enough and go.  This makes sure you truly are brushing long enough.  It&#x27;s amazing how long 2 minutes is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this might be appealing to kids as well.  Something special that they follow along with.  They are literally learning how to brush and will get in the habit of it for when they are in situations where they only have a normal brush.  Plus there are many different heads to choose from to cater to every need.  Changing a constantly used head every three months is not such a big deal for all the work it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not take much counter space, and is very organized with all the parts and brush heads etc. It&#x27;s worth the upgrade.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate this toothbrush!  Compared to the Panasonic Electric Toothbrush it is unwieldy, noisy, and just plain uncomfortable...lots of money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Seriously???  People &#x27;need&#x27; an app to brush their teeth??  After MILLIONS of years of human evolution and tooth brushing of various degrees and success, people can&#x27;t figure out with all of the information out there from professionals just how to brush their teeth??  When the grid crashes those in &#x27;need&#x27; of that app are going to be in serious trouble...in more ways than one.</li>
            <li> My dentist gives me a new toothbrush for free every 6 months when I go in to see him.  Seems to work well.  Only one cavity in 44 years and it was tiny.  Seriously, who needs Bluetooth, an app or anything besides some toothpaste and a toothbrush to brush their teeth?  This is crazy!</li>
            <li> I purchased 4 units for my family but no one is connected bluetooth. The Company does not help and in fact the problem is not resolved for several months</li>
            <li> It was bad enough when the CIA put the mind-reading chip in my skull. What I thought was just another Bluetooth toothbrush was actually a food sampling apparatus that collects data on the food I have eaten and transmits it to the government. BEWARE!</li>
            <li> Bought one with $99.99. Price drops to $79.99 within a week of purchase.... The original price seems to be $159.99. Confused about how they make the price.&lt;br /&gt;The pressure sensor seems not working..... Maybe I was wrong</li>
            <li> I love this new toothbrush! I have trouble with brushing too hard and this brush lets me know with the red light when I&#x27;m brushing too hard. I feel a much deeper clean from my previous, cheaper electronic toothbrush. The charge seems to hold for days, but it does take a long time to charge. The travel case is perfect too! Highly recommend and worth the extra for the indicator light.</li>
            <li> I love my Oral-B Pro 5000.  My teeth feel so smooth and clean after each brushing.  I like the added Bluetooth​ app too.  Actually it&#x27;s kinda fun to open each time.  It tracks my process and shows me news, photos of the day, weather.  It&#x27;s nice to catch up on some current events while going through the two minute routine.  Honestly I tend to brush a little longer as I am finishing reading an article.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical to try this brush since I&#x27;m not that tech savvy. My pre teen daughter, on the other hand is, and she still gives trouble to brush and clean her teeth properly. This is perfect for her. I love that it tells her how long to brush and in which areas. You can select what type of cleaning you&#x27;d like and I picked daily cleaning for her. The brush does light up when you brush too hard, but my daughter is a lazy brusher so not necessary for us. It connected to her phone easily and I love that I can now track if she&#x27;s actually brushing. This is a great gift for any kid or teen. Adults might find it to be unnecessary.</li>
            <li> Get the non-bluetooth version and save $10.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife on her dentist&#x27;s recommendation.  It works great and she loves it.  I&#x27;m going to order one for myself next.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about spending money on an electric toothbrush since my old fashioned way of brushing has worked for almost 40 years.  However, I am sincerely impressed with the brushing action of this toothbrush.  It not only cleans your teeth, but makes your gums feel better.  I noticed flossing isn&#x27;t as difficult either.  The small brush head took a little getting used to, but I really like it now.  I haven&#x27;t used the Blue tooth features yet, but can&#x27;t wait to try those out.</li>
            <li> Great product. My husband loves it. I will buy it again without any second thoughts.</li>
            <li> The product is great, I love it!</li>
            <li> I have completely retrained my brushing habits because of this toothbrush.  I played with the bluetooth feature a grand total of 2 times and then lost interest in it.  Maybe if they enhance the app it would be entice me to use it more.  I HIGHLY recommend this especially if you have children as this is the perfect toothbrush to train them for some great oral hygiene habits (especially if they enhance the companion app).</li>
            <li> I picked this up when it was over half price. It is just as good as any other Oral-b electric toothbrush. I got it because of the bluetooth feature. I thought it was would be neat to have an app on my phone to record my brushings and a monitor to see if I was brushing well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I am happy with the tooth brushing performance, am a little disappointed with the associated app feature. I was under the impression that the toothbrush itself would store brushing sessions to be recorded on the app. It does not. If you don&#x27;t have the app open and running when you brush, your session is not recorded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a &amp;#34;programmable&amp;#34; feature where you can set the standard 2 min. of brushing or adjust it and add extra time for concentration in key areas you or your dentist has identified need extra attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also interested in the &amp;#34;brushing too hard&amp;#34; feature. I thought there were sensors in the toothbrush that would aid in indicating if brushing was being done correctly. This too is a bit misleading. The &amp;#34;brushing too hard&amp;#34; feature is indicated by the app when the motor strains. The app detects this by listening to the toothbrush. This was evident when the app alerted me to the fact the my volume needed to be turned up to detect proper brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rolling news, tips, and photo feature is lacking. It is also quite cumbersome to brush properly and read an article on your phone without dripping toothpaste everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My real motivation for getting this toothbrush was to give to my tween to help her record her brushing sessions. Since sessions are only record when the app is present, it isn&#x27;t going to work very well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been an Oral-B electric toothbrush owner for many years and I find this one to be just as good as any other but not worth the extra $$ for the extra features.</li>
            <li> In the pamphlet that was provided with the product, it mentioned that you&#x27;re suppose to get more than one brush head for different kinds of brushing. There are 7 different kinds; however, I only received one. I guess I wont be able to enjoy the full experience of this product</li>
            <li> I do love this tooth brush, lots of flashy bells and lights.  The bluetooth concept apeals to me as a technoweenie. I do think that the app is over cooked.  This makes me not want to us it all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with this product.  The MODE button does not work.  The handle is heavy to hold.  The bluetooth feature is useless.  I have to return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a Oral-B Pro 4000.  It is much better than 5000.  It does not have those useless features and it is lighter.</li>
            <li> Great product! Love using it with my iPhone.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The Bluetooth connection with my Android phone works very well.</li>
            <li> Fairly quiet, does a great job.</li>
            <li> you have to learn how to use it by trial and error,then its quite good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from the old school and thought I could do just as well with the  tried and true toothbrush.  Not hardly!  Every time I use this wonderful tool, I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dentist and had a thorough cleaning!  So glad my dentist recommended  I go this route. Also received coupons to purchase additional heads.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for more!</li>
            <li> This Oral B 5000 with Bluetooth  is a waste of money.  I don&#x27;t want to bring my iPhone to the bathroom and open the Oral B app and sync up my toothbrush to Bluetooth every time I brush my teeth.  The Oral B 4000 does the same job for much less, without the necessity of having your iPhone on the bathroom sink every time you brush.  The 5000 relies on the app to tell you what mode you are in and for the 2-minute timing--the 4000 does this on the toothbrush itself.  I am returning this 5000 and getting another 4000.  If you really want an app running every time you brush your teeth, then maybe the 5000 is for you.  If you think this is stupid, do yourself a favor and get the 4000.</li>
            <li> I switched from sonic to this, and the results are great. Much more effective than others.  The Bluetooth thing is laughable though.  If you need beeps and timers to brush your teeth, you need help!</li>
            <li> You can feel the clean and tartar being brushed away, strong brush but not so strong as the pulsonix ones which I didn&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> When I went to the dentist to have my teeth cleaned, they gave me x-ray scans and it showed that I had gingivitis so they recommended me this product. After 1 week of using this my teeth feel great! My gingivitis also cleared up. The only flaw was that it only came with 1 brush instead of 4. Other than that the product works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Brushing is easier &amp; more effective with my Oral -B. I give it 4-1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> Bought as gift for boyfriend. He can&#x27;t stop telling me how much he loves it. The pressure sensor is great. Will probably get one for myself as well since I have receding gums from brushing too hard.</li>
            <li> The pressure sensor does not work correctly. You have to press hard enough to slow the motor down for the like to actually come on. That is far too much pressure for your teeth. Amazon replaced the 1st one, but the 2nd was the same. A call to Oral-B was not productive,  they will just replace it also.</li>
            <li> Enjoying my first electric toothbrush.  It&#x27;s night and day difference w/ a manual brush.  Teeth feel so much cleaner. The toothbrush looks great in white. Although I like that it had several brushing modes, I haven&#x27;t use anything but the normal mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bluetooth app is nice but not a necessity. The apps drawback is that you can not export the user data which would be needed when you get a new phone - I lost all my historical data/awards.</li>
            <li> There is a more expensive model with better travel capabilities. I wish had had purchased it; however, this one works very well.</li>
            <li> Awesome as I expected it would be. I recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> Item battery does not last that long. Do not buy</li>
            <li> The product started malfunctioning last year, with wobbly rotation, and occasional burning smell. I contacted Oral-B customer service, and they sent me an addressed mailing envelope and instructions to send it back to them. I did so, and now, months later, I have tried to contact their customer service and each time I have been met either with no response, or some pre-fab response telling me to mail them the toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a replacement Oral-B toothbrush thinking that when they sent back the repaired one I could keep that one at work. I figured that maybe my old one breaking was an anomaly. I wish I had purchased from a different manufacturer. Now that I know how incompetent Oral-B customer service is, I will never purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Caution for buyers who do not live in the U.S.!! (so far, I have not found this warning): I was surprised to know that the Android app is not available for all countries in Google Play ...  I cannot really think of a valid reason for that.  In my case Oral-B customer service simply apologized and said they could not do anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works well, does it&#x27;s job.  Without the app there&#x27;s not much else to say about it because I cannot really take advantage of many of the most interesting features. In particular, the bluetooth connectivity becomes unuseful and it&#x27;s difficult to know which brushing mode is being used, so I only use the \\&quot;daily clean mode\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this electric toothbrush it&#x27;s definitely better than a manual toothbrush, but considering what I know now about the app, I would not buy this model again but a simplier (less expensive), as it will do the same job.</li>
            <li> I feel like I can finally give a good review of this product since we&#x27;ve been using it for over a month now.  I purchased this as a gift for my 9 year old son when it was on a lightning deal.  Just a little history, my son is a complete joy most of the time. He&#x27;s polite, listens, does well in school and an all around great kid. Except when it comes to his teeth. After several years of fighting constantly, I finally decided to give this a try. People thought I was nuts, spending so much $$ on a toothbrush for a child. I figured, if it works, think of all of the dentist bills we will avoid down the road. If it didn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;d use it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me just say that this toothbrush has changed EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It connects to an app on his ipod through bluetooth. All he has to do is open the app and turn on the toothbrush and the timer starts running. It tells him what part of his mouth to brush next and warns him if he&#x27;s pressing too hard.  Once he&#x27;s done brushing it prompts him to rinse, floss, and brush his tongue.  After so many days of continuous usage he earns badges.  The charge lasts about a week or so and it comes with a travel case so he can take it with him when he spends the night at Grandma&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still find that I have to remind him to brush his teeth.  But that&#x27;s it. One reminder. Not constant nagging, checking, making him re-brush. He actually looks forward to brushing his teeth! Now I just spot check his teeth a few times a week and can give him a pat on the head with &amp;#34;Great job, Kiddo,&amp;#34; every time. We&#x27;re getting ready to go to his first dentist appointment since switching to this and I&#x27;m looking forward to hearing the dentist compliment him on his new habits instead of telling him he needs to brush more, too. I&#x27;m so glad I made this purchase!</li>
            <li> I have been using a Sonicare for many years and have to say I still like it best.  This cleaned as well, but I am a creature of habit.  The app was easy to use (but I balked at the information on my that it wanted).  I did find that after the initial novelty of the app&#x27;s report I started to ignore it.  Quite frankly, after a few days I didn&#x27;t bother to haul my phone into the bathroom to see what the report was.  My Sonicare already beeps every 30 seconds to tell me to change to a different quadrant and shuts off after the recommended 2 minutes.  I have to admit I started ignoring the quadrant reminders after a few days, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This would be a good gift or purchase for someone who doesn&#x27;t have the benefit of a good dentist who tells me what I am doing wrong or right.  Kind of fun, but in the end it is just a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used battery powered toothbrushes in the past, but found that they really didn&#x27;t do a good job of tooth cleaning. This product, which is rechargeable, fills the bills quite nicely, and I am very happy using it. There&#x27;s a bluetooth part to the brush, but I don&#x27;t use it and not using it has no effect on its operation. If you want cleaner teeth with your btrush, use this.</li>
            <li> This series comes w blue tooth capability. It allows you to download an app that interacts with your toothbrush. You can keep track of the amount of time and frequency of brushing. Did you floss? Did you apply too much pressure with brushing? Yes, the toothbrush flashes when you brush too hard. I, personally, am not interested in the app. I just want to brush and move on. For the tech savvy or tooth enthusiast, this is a cool gadget.&lt;br /&gt;As far as cleaning goes, this brush is tops. It has 5 speeds, though the brush doesn&#x27;t display which mode is in use. There is a button to toggle through the different speeds. The brush shakes every 30 seconds to let you know to move to the next quadrant of your mouth. My teeth are exceptionally clean and shiny after using this brush. Much better than a manual brush. I feel like the electric brush covers more surface area. This would be a nice gift.</li>
            <li> I suck at taking care of my teeth. I don&#x27;t brush or floss them like I should and I happen to be a few days away from getting two fillings for cavities. Naturally, I needed something different in my routine and this toothbrush sounded like the right thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It telling me when thirty seconds have passed so I can move on to a different part of my mouth is the best. I have a horrible sense of time and apparently only brushed my teeth before this toothbrush for about 30 seconds. Oops? But now I&#x27;m doing better and my mouth feels cleaner after each brushing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had the chance to try out the app connection to it yet and I don&#x27;t particularly want to. It would be a lot easier to have the features the app and Bluetooth promise built into the toothbrush proper to simplify the brushing process, but I guess we aren&#x27;t there in tech yet or Oral-B wants to drive up app downloads.</li>
            <li> This is a lazy person&#x27;s dream!  Honestly, this has a lot of power and my teeth feel so much cleaner than they do when using just a regular toothbrush!  I know it&#x27;s pricey, but I really love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush I think this product is very nice. Some things I would like to see implemented better would be:&lt;br /&gt;- No display to see in which &amp;#34;mode&amp;#34; are you (5 modes: Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening, and Deep Clean).&lt;br /&gt;- I wasn&#x27;t able to find the app in the iOS market - Only when I changed my account location to the US it was possible, not sure what would be the future impact with version updates.</li>
            <li> My Oral B was long overdue for a replacement and I was contemplating getting the 7000 series but settled for this as it was not over the top expensive and I must say I am Happy. The brush makes my teeth feel so much cleaner and even though the Bluetooth is a bit of a overkill does help keep track of ones brushing habbits. They could do away with the news and local weather feature and add features around which section as a user you send most of your brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative is that it runs on 110-130 voltage which means I need a voltage converter when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Pros:  comfortable design.  Feels really good, cleans really well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  its basically a timer.  I had hoped that this would make brushing fun or identify bad habits I have with teeth brushing...IT DOESN&#x27;T.  Frankly, all it seems to do is remind me to change the brush.  The intelligent features, have to be programmed by your dentist and even then its just a timer...  I don&#x27;t know what I was expecting from a &amp;#34;smart toothbrush&amp;#34; but this isn&#x27;t worth the price.  When it fails I&#x27;ll switch back to my $5 one.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my wife.  She has used a Sonicare for about 7 years, but was recently advised by dentist to change.  She enjoys the feedback that it gives her via the Bluetooth app.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I love it.  The item is great and the price is very good.  Keep up the good work guys.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I noticed whiter teeth and a more polished look within the first week.  Great toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Received only 1 brush, in the package, expected about 4 different bristles..  In my purchase of previous Oral Pro 5000 series, I had received a total of 4 different bristles in the package. Why are they scrimping and being cheap... and in fact charging a lot more ? We have deflation and  not inflation in the country....</li>
            <li> For the price it should have come with more than one Brush head.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife, she has has not stopped thanking me it!  She loves her Oral-B 5000 Smart Series!!</li>
            <li> Does a good job of cleaning. However it is rather harsh. The brush bristles are very stiff and hard. Overall a good tooth brush. I have had better.</li>
            <li> Brush works better than the older model I have but was disappointed in several features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The brush holder I had previously was built in and had the ability to drop in the head and close it.  The new design is not that great, it does not seal well to protect when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;2. Bluetooth, really I mean who wants to sync their brush to the phone and watch the phone while brushing.  This is a terrible idea, just put a display back on the front of the brush like the older models.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The new travel cases are huge, the older models had a nicer slim case which worked very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the new brush mechanically but the rest is a huge failure.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from arthritis, this is the toothbrush for you! Changed my life &amp; my teeth!</li>
            <li> believe there should be some visual indication of mode in use...sorry I purchased this model.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. I don&#x27;t use the blue tooth at all, I&#x27;m using the Oral B cross action brush and it does a terrific job.</li>
            <li> As anyone who uses Oral B electric toothbrushes know, they&#x27;re great and get the job done at a reasonable price for head replacement vs sonicare.  What is nice about this model is you can get rid of the unnecessary plastic and just set the brush on the small base which takes up very little room on the counter.  The brush lights up like a LED xmas tree when brushing, which is meant to be functional.  For example, when you brush too hard it blinks red.  The nice thing versus my older model is when it&#x27;s fully charged, the blue light turns off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the software.  It&#x27;s fine but you&#x27;ll probably stop using it.  First, it does a good job at tracking everything.  It&#x27;s like a fitbit for your mouth.  It&#x27;ll tell you when you brushed, how long, keeps track of if you flossed, brushed your tongue, mouthwash, etc.  It syncs quickly to my iPhone 6 and it even displays news on the bottom that you can scroll through and read, which is pretty cool if you&#x27;re bored while you brush.  The reason why you&#x27;ll probably stop using it is because you have to launch the app before you brush and then you&#x27;re standing there brushing and looking at your phone, browsing news and brushing tips.  I quickly got the sense that &#x27;geez, now I don&#x27;t even put my phone down when I brush!&#x27;  It&#x27;s just too much technology and connectivity.</li>
            <li> it would be a 5 start if it didn&#x27;t have the bluetooth</li>
            <li> I wish there was a star leer than one. I&#x27;ve never bought a product as bad as this. Pasted the return level within 10 minutes of opening the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- the unit Is 110 volts only who does that in 2015? Especially with a personal hygiene product many people travel with. When I called them I was told to buy a travel converter. Yeah right. Shows cheap manufacturing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2- This mode doesn&#x27;t ship with the smart controller. And the display just shows the charge level. So I really have no way of selecting brushing mode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3- apparently I can see the brushing mode with the mobile phone app. So I go to both apple and android app stores and there is no oral-b app. It may be because I&#x27;m not on the U.S. store. Which is kind of lame, because a tooth brush is not a matter of national security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So how do I use this thing? I don&#x27;t. I send t back to Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One would say I should have known before ordering. But truth is, who builds such crappy product in this day and time?</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral-B Pro 5000.  I don&#x27;t remember how long I had the first one, but it&#x27;s the best part of ten years.  It never stopped working, but seemed sluggish, and the rubber-platicized handle covering was degrading.  That longevity and reliability tmade choosing Oral-B again, a no-brainer.  The choice to replace was vindicated on using the new one: what a difference in power!  I hadn&#x27;t noticed how much or how gradually the original Triumph 5000 was fading.  Not sure the remote timer and clock are necessary or much of a smiley-face feature, (despite the smiley-face on the read out).  The original Pro 5000 displayed brushing time and I suspect not too many of us often refer to it.  That stand-alone SmartSeries do-hickey does present a more prominent reminder of brushing duration, and does have an inoffensive little beep every fifteen seconds to spur you on, (or signal, \\&quot;enough already\\&quot;).  Affixing the SmartSeries gizmo to an adjacent wall would seem to invite leaving paint circle disfigurement - the adhesive ring doesn&#x27;t appear substantial enough to maintain adhesion bathroom humidity for too long.  It can also be affixed to a mirror, but too many of my wife&#x27;s magnification mirrors have crashed for that to engender much confidence, either.  Bottom line - this is an excellent device.  Suggest diligence in inverting it and rinsing after each brushing, then drying with a half-sheet of paper towel.  I didn&#x27;t do this for the first couple of years with my first Pro 5000 and the accumulated, hidden sludge is best not described.  I&#x27;ve dispensed with using the head holder contraption, and keep a supply of replacement heads in a vanity drawer.  Kind of hard to imagine sharing a toothbrush, even the electronic variety, via swapping brush heads.  (Yekh, retch, shudder).</li>
            <li> great product, it looks durable and portable</li>
            <li> I bought it for my son he is very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Oral B is the best and they were in great condition</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m part of the dentistry profession.&lt;br /&gt;I love this toothbrush! The x-hair toothbrush head gives an amazing feeling of clean teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t care at all about the Bluetooth feature and I think it&#x27;s silly.&lt;br /&gt;I would give 5 stars if the charging time wasn&#x27;t so ridiculously long.&lt;br /&gt;First charge takes over 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I simply charge it now every weekend for about 15 hours.&lt;br /&gt;If you wait till it&#x27;s empty you need to charge for another 24hours which means if you want to brush your teeth, you interrupt the charging cycle.</li>
            <li> My many years old electric toothbrush no longer worked, I needed a replacement &amp; like this model much!! It does the job!</li>
            <li> It works but is very noisy. The manual is online, not convenient.</li>
            <li> It works really good highly recommended</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the Bluetooth feature yet but so far, the rest of the essential functions works great!</li>
            <li> Ive always been an oral b fan; really great toothbrush love the vibration where it tells you when ur 30 seconds is done, kinda pricey though</li>
            <li> bluetooth integration is on point. shame and fun in brushing teeth.</li>
            <li> If you aren&#x27;t using an electric tooth brush I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing with your life.  This is the best thing I&#x27;ve done to my teeth!  My teeth have never felt so clean-it&#x27;s like I just had my 6 month check up every day.  No more manual brush for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blutooth stuff is rather gimmicky and I can&#x27;t imagine it being much help.  That being said, I love gadgets so tinkering with all of the settings was mildly entertaining.  I can&#x27;t see myself ever depending on the Blutooth stuff for much of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist has been recommending an electric toothbrush for some time but I kept using the manual brush because of the cost.  Having had some gum problems and needing an urgent appointment, said dentist recommended it again and I&#x27;m glad I listened.</li>
            <li> My 1st electric toothbrush &amp; I have to say this thing is great!</li>
            <li> 2nd one I have, battery life lasts a long time and recommended by dentist. I have been satisfied</li>
            <li> Excellent tooth brush, very effective, the best I ever had.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time in good condition.  Helps me to brush properly with the red light when I press too hard against my gums and with the green light every 30 seconds to tell me how long I&#x27;ve been brushing.  Haven&#x27;t used all the speeds yet, but very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Best ever toothbrush ive ever used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a SonicCare tooth brush for 10 + years.  I&#x27;ve upgrade as the new models came out, but want to give the Oral-B Series a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I did and feel like my teeth are just cleaner.  It make sense to give each tooth special attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I switch!</li>
            <li> We bought this toothbrush and love it.  We don&#x27;t really use the Bluetooth feature as much.  It has a holder for 4 different brush heads.  We bought one main toothbrush and several heads for everyone in the family so we can all use it.  That helped me justify the price.  It cleans *SO WELL* I feel like I am leaving the dentist every night.  I feel like I notice a difference in the color of my teeth just in the month we&#x27;ve had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some users commented about the vibration being too strong.  I have used a traditional toothbrush my whole life and had no problem transitioning to this.  It didn&#x27;t bother me at all.  It holds its charge well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the travel case.  It kept it well protected on our trip.  After we brush we just wipe it down--it cleans well and everything on it is well enclosed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the features it has.  We use the basic mode most often.  It lights up green to remind you to move to a different quadrant in your mouth and lights up again when it&#x27;s been 2 minutes.  It flashes red if you are pushing too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the brush head it came with and we also bought some sensitive brush heads.  We got the whitening ones but don&#x27;t like those as much.  (It included a coupon for $3 off a brush set so it was a good way to try some different brush heads)</li>
            <li> This is a multi-functioning toothbrush, but has no indicator for what mode you are in.  You need to memorize the order of the options and pay attention to how many times you push the button.  If you lost count, you have to turn it off and try again.  I even downloaded the (as ridiculous as this sounds) Bluetooth app for my iPhone, hoping that it would have an indicator.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Either pay the extra $20 to get the next model up, or save yourself the trouble (and money) and get an lower model number.  You won&#x27;t use the features since its too much effort to try and guess which will fit your needs.</li>
            <li> I love my new toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Went from a spin brush to this and my teeth and gums have never looked or felt so good. Feels like a teeth cleaning from the dental office when you&#x27;re done. I used the Bluetooth app twice...nothing great. I didn&#x27;t care that Bluetooth was a feature, I bought it because it was a lightning deal and I&#x27;ve been wanting a good toothbrush.</li>
            <li> App is a joke. Bells and whistles that I find useless. Toothbrush is great tho.</li>
            <li> Works great!  High quality.  Love the bluetooth connection...</li>
            <li> As pointed out by other android users, android app sucks. Does not work at all, feels like Chinese cheap product. I must say on iOS it works and sync all session very well except few quirks. Well I wanted to review this app on android since I recently switched my phone from iOS to Android Motorola latest gen phone. The app is CRAP, seems like 3rd grade app developed by very much reputed brand.&lt;br /&gt;1) Well first of there is not way to bring your old sessions from other devices&lt;br /&gt;2) After connected first time, it worked and synced well on Android but then next day It did not connect to phone at all!&lt;br /&gt;3) 3rd day it did connected again but after 4-5 seconds of brushing it stop syncing. since there is not guide comes with this brush I had to rely on vibrate mode and complete the session disconnected!&lt;br /&gt;4) 4th day I though it would sync the broken session (stored on brush) details in App but it did not, lost! a big looser here!&lt;br /&gt;5) After many more day I still don&#x27;t see my session synced on app and also app does not shows it connected anymore with brush instead is show a manual start/stop button! WHAT? yes, it totally worthless now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole reason I bought this brush was to find out how time I brushed and missed, but it appeared it&#x27;s better to get guide brush not smart series because they are dumb!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please fix it before it&#x27;s too late and ruin your product reputation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have written, the bluetooth connection to my iPhone is completely unnecessary.  I used it couple of times until the novelty wore off.  That said, I understand why the manufacturer included it.  I had an older model for about 10 years and always wanted the little device that is sold separately to mount in the bathroom and watch while I brushed my teeth.  When I replaced that older model with the 5000 I was a little excited to finally have the opportunity.  I am glad to say I never spent the money on the optional device.  We are all too rushed in the morning and sleep deprived to remember to bring our iPhones into the bathroom and then remember to bring it back into the bedroom so you don&#x27;t forget to take it when you leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just too much hassle for the small amount of additional information provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the toothbrush and will buy another when this one wears out in 10 years.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy the cheaper series.  No real difference in operation and its a craps shoot regarding the poor quality batteries.  Mine lasted two months and battery will no longer hold any charge.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, after 5 months of use it stop working. Two night ago and randomly shut off on me while using. For the next day it would turn on on its own. Not the buttons don&#x27;t work. I suspect water leaked in.  I wish I bought the 35$ one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it worked, it worked damn well. My teeth have never been cleaner. Just truly disappointed my busted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great toothbrush</li>
            <li> Everything works as expected. Just not a fan of Bluetooth companion app. Mostly gimmicky features meant to look good on a box or commercial. Should have gone with one mode down without Bluetooth. Great toothbrush though.</li>
            <li> A very good toothbrush.  However, I found the ProWhite 4000 model to be more powerful.  The 4000 model only rotated, but vigorously so.  I was able to go over each tooth with that rotation power.  This 5000 model has additional action--pulsates, etc.  I thought that would make the cleaning action better, but I find it&#x27;s not as good.  I&#x27;ve not had trouble with the Bluetooth, but it&#x27;s pointless.  The 4000 model also beeped when it was time to change quadrants.  The 5000 model simply hesitates.  My final analysis is to save the money for the better toothbrush--the 4000!</li>
            <li> Given that I&#x27;m a little of a data nerd, the reason I bought the Pro 5000 is so that I would force myself to do a better job brushing my teeth and gums.  Given this, I have to review both the toothbrush and the related application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toothbrush – 4 stars&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush works exceptionally well.  I love that the LED turns red when I’m pressing too hard against my teeth and gums.  I love that it pulses when it’s time to change quadrant and pulses more strongly when I’ve reached my target time.&lt;br /&gt;To get the 5th star, the toothbrush needs to address the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. When I change to total brush time from 2 to 3 minutes, I expect that the toothbrush adjusts the time to brush per quadrant.  When set to 2 minutes, each quadrant takes 30 seconds (4 x 30 sec &#x3D; 120 sec).  When set to 3 minutes (what Oral-b calls Deep Clean or 2 minutes + 1), the toothbrush wants me to change at the following rate: (Quad-1) after 30 seconds, (Quad-2) after 45 seconds, (Quad-3) after 45 seconds, (Quad-4) after 45 seconds.  This means that Quad-1 was only brushed for 30 seconds and there still is 15 seconds to go in the 3 minutes.  Also, there is no indication when you reach the 3-minute mark.  Instead, I expected that I would be reminded to change quadrant after 45 seconds and that end-of-job indicator would vibrate at the 3-minute mark.&lt;br /&gt;2. When set to Deep Clean (3 minutes of brushing), disable the 2-minute end-of-brushing mark and set it at 3 minutes instead.&lt;br /&gt;3. Recharging a discharged toothbrush takes a long time, close to 48 hours for me.  I expect it to recharge overnight (8-10 hours).&lt;br /&gt;Note: For what it’s worth, my firmware version is: SW-Version 05, P-Version: 01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B App – 2 stars&lt;br /&gt;I’m using Android version of the Oral-B app (version 2.1.2).  I love how it prompts you to go from quadrant to quadrant.  The graphics and user interface are excellent.  I also enjoy the little motivation tricks it displays.  Finally, I like how I can customize its settings.  For example, I only want to be prompted to brush my tongue in the morning and use a fluoride rinse in the evening but remind me to floss every time.  The application then tracks all of these, providing of course you use them honestly.  However, I found the following very annoying defects for a product this expensive:&lt;br /&gt;1. I have not yet been able to pairing the toothbrush with my Samsung S5 and the application.  I’m putting this here instead of in the toothbrush section, because this doesn’t really impact the use of the brush.  I’m prompted for a PIN and none was given in the documentation.  So I tried the usual ones without success.&lt;br /&gt;2. After using the toothbrush for close to 3 months, I have never been able to synchronize my off-line brushing sessions with the application even though I’m trying different ways to pair the app with the brush.  Even though the app and the brush as not formally paired, the application seems to be able to communicate with the brush.  It senses when I briefly interrupt my brushing and resumes where I left off, I senses when I’m done brushing and when I press too hard on my gums (the screen on the smartphone turns red), etc.&lt;br /&gt;3. The time indicator on the app is always set to 2:00 even when both the app and the toothbrush know that I will be doing what Oral-B calls a Deep Clean (3 minutes of brushing).  I expect the setting to be 3:00 in this case.&lt;br /&gt;4. The app hiccups when I start brushing my teeth before it had a chance to try to retrieve prior brushing sessions.  In other words, the clock will start with my brushing session for say 10 seconds, then it will reset to 2:00.  Sometimes stopping the brush for a few seconds then restarting will correct this.&lt;br /&gt;5. I’ve had the app stop recording in the middle of sessions and give me the very disappointed face that I didn’t brush for at least 2 minutes when in fact I was still brushing.&lt;br /&gt;6. The Oral-b website is abysmal whentrying to find support for the points above.  There are no forums or an effective Q&amp;A section to answer user questions.  That’s very strange in this era of crowd-sourcing help and answers.  Ironically, the best site I’ve found for answers is the Amazon Review section.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary – 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;Given the price of the toothbrush, Braun’s reputation for quality, and Braun’s attempt at migrating consumers away from Philips’ Sonicare brand, I expected more from this purchase.  Bluetooth is meant to bind together a pretty good toothbrush with a smartphone application to make a superior user experience.  That goal is far from being reached.  The toothbrush, on its own, is very effective and motivates me to at least brush for 2 minutes per session and lets me know when I’m pressing too hard against my gums.  Only you can decide whether this is worth the price of the toothbrush.  I like mine.he points above.  There are no forums or an effective Q&amp;A section to answer user questions.

            <li> Exellent toothbrush minus the blutooth -it really doesnt clean yor teeth any better with it. I am still fingiring out how to turn it off.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.  The pressure warnings are great.  The toothbrush has a nice feel to it.  The data is helpful and encourages regular usage.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, but can think of a couple improvements that would make it a great tool. I was using it only 3 weeks, went to my dental appointment and the hygienist complemented me on the fact that there was no plaque to clean.</li>
            <li> Its function is rich.There is five operational speeds which can be chosen depending upon your preference. But the problem is that it&#x27;s a poor process.</li>
            <li> pretty gut. but the delivery service is not as good as the product is.</li>
            <li> My teeth are definitely cleaner. This is my first electric brush and I noticed a big difference, my teeth are smoother and whiter. I definitely recommend getting an electric toothbrush. However, while it cleans your teeth much better than a manual brush, it might make you forget to clean the other parts of your mouth, like on and around your tongue, the space between your gums and your lips/cheek, etc... which can still leave your breath less than fresh. So I find myself having to use a manual brush for these areas, since the small head of the electric brush does not hold the toothpaste for use in this stage of brushing. And I&#x27;m ok with doing that. The &#x27;too much pressure&#x27; sensor is also helpful, and the lights on the brush turn red to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the bluetooth side, the functionality is not as exciting as I would&#x27;ve expected. You can watch the timer on your phone, which helps when you&#x27;re first getting used to it, and it stores the times you brushed and for how long, and, after setting it up before hand, you can tell it if you flossed and cleaned your tongue. But you can&#x27;t go back and edit it after. Plus, after a few weeks, I stopped logging my brushes, because it really doesn&#x27;t serve very much of a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like adding some useful bluetooth functionality, or at least the ability to edit the entries after to add flossing/tongue or something, would add practically zero cost, since it already has a smart chip on it, and it already connects with the phone. It would just be creative thinking on the app design side. If I was buying again, I probably wouldn&#x27;t have spent the extra money ($40) for the bluetooth connectivity, and would&#x27;ve gone with the Pro 4000.</li>
            <li> Upgraded from older Braun that was no longer holding change after 5 years.  This one has a lot of features, the one I like best is the pressure sensor that visually lights up red when pressing to hard is very useful.  As far as features like the Bluetooth to sync with the app are pretty useless.  As far as the cleaning power goes, it gives a very noticible clean and the charge lasts for about 5 days with normal 2x day cleaning</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! Easy to use. Cleans very well and battery life is good for 5 days after fully charged. The brush compartments comes handy for storage.</li>
            <li> Switched to Oral-B from Sonicare about 10 years ago and have missed the high frequency cleaning of the gums of the Philips system. Nice to now have the best of both after my leap forward several generations of Oral-B</li>
            <li> All started out well, however after a few days, maybe it was because of the Lollipop upgrade to Android, the Oral-B app timer, which starts when you start brushing and stops when you stop brushing, would stop in the middle of brushing.  Since the main reason for getting this toothbrush was the Bluetooth capability, it seems rather an expensive mistake to have bought a Bluetooth brush that doesn&#x27;t work reliably with Bluetooth.  I gave feedback to Braun via the Google Play site for the Oral-B app, and never heard anything back.</li>
            <li> I love using this toothbrush it makes me feel really clean and refreshed every use.  I used to use the app, but I ended up just brushing my teeth regularly without it.  The replacement heads is expensive but you do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Amazing does a great job. very powerful</li>
            <li> Great quality electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The delivery was done before the estimated time. Well done!!!</li>
            <li> I replaced an old electric toothbrush with this. I needed to download the App to my Ipod touch to know what setting I had the toothbrush in. Once I had the app downloaded and the toothbrush communicated with my Ipod touch, I could see what the toothbrush settings were. How come they don&#x27;t display the settings on the toothbrush somewhere? I don&#x27;t always carry my Ipod to the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt; It does a great job cleaning my teeth. I found I have to open my mouth much wider than I did with my old toothbrush. The tooth brush head is deep. It changes the rhythm of the spin on the bristles when you are supposed to move to another section of teeth and when 2 minutes is up. I think those are nice features.  The other aspect of the blue tooth is that it will report how often and much time I spent brushing my teeth. I don&#x27;t care about that. I won&#x27;t ever use it. I can tell by the taste in my mouth and the loss of fuzz on my teeth that this tooth brush is working. I suppose that would be good if you have a child you need to police because they lie about brushing their teeth, but I don&#x27;t need this feature. The best feature is that the brush lights up red when you apply too much pressure. I tend to do that and have had gum problems because of it. I make sure to brush in front of the mirror to see the light and it helps me to not brush so hard. Overall, I am glad I got the tooth brush because it cleans my teeth well, but I wish the toothbrush head was smaller and that the brush displayed settings on it instead of just on your smartphone or device.</li>
            <li> If I could give zero stars I would. Battery died after about three weeks of use. Absolutely ridiculous considering it cost over $100. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my 98 yr old Mother, at the suggestion of her new dentist!  She hasn&#x27;t had a rechargeable toothbrush before!  It didn&#x27;t take her long to get use to it and now she loves it!  At her age I didn&#x27;t know how she would adjust, so I am pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time</li>
            <li> gift to my daughter, she likes it</li>
            <li> its a  toothbrush ,it cleans my teeth just as I thought, now the question is  is how long will it keep working  for the price that I paid.  blue tooth im not going to use I only bought it because of the rating&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used and well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  I&#x27;ve tried using it with the app on IOS (iPhone, iPad), Android (tablet &amp; phone).  You need to use an app to change the settings which include timers (more than 1), speed/intensity, and order of functions.  The charging base can be remove from the 4 slot toothbrush holder.  The second button allows changing speeds without having to stop/start the session.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t always use the app when brushing, but the toothbrush remembers the last 20 sessions.  It then synchronizes the next time the app is used while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is when sharing the brush with someone else or multiple devices with the app.  The programmers did not consider this important.  If multiple people use the brush, their brushing history is combined.  If multiple devices are used during different sessions, the settings on the current device changes the settings for the next usage.  If all the settings are not the same, chaos results.</li>
            <li> As a toothbrush this device is awesome.  However, the bluetooth functionality is very spotty and frustrating to use.  The bluetooth app crashes on my Nexus 5 often when I open it and it seems you have to have the stars align for the device to actually communicate with your phone.  Great idea but very poorly executed.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush preforms well. Bluetooth connectivity is a gimmick - the app leaves a lot to be desired. I wish there was a way to easily tell what cleaning mode without having to use the app.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hurt by the fact that this item was not what was advertised.  I have been using Oral B electric toothbrushes for 20+ years and have loved the product all that time.  I wanted to get this particular item because it was advertised to have 3 brushes and it only came with one.  I know that doesn&#x27;t seem like much but I wanted to try each one.  Now I have to buy two others instead of have each one to try.</li>
            <li> Exceeds my expectations. I had used a Sonicare HX6710 for about 4 years. Then I noticed that the brush would no longer oscillate when I put any pressure against my teeth. I had to ask myself if the Sonicare had been going down hill for months, and, therefore, was not doing the teeth cleaning that it should have been doing. When I looked at getting another Sonicare I noticed that the latest Sonicare unit had a completely new brush head design... I.E.  if I bought the new Sonicare I would need to buy brush heads for my wife&#x27;s old Sonicare and the new brushes for the new Sonnicare... I decided to just try something new which was the reason for buying the Oral-B 5000. I also noted that the brush heads for the Oral-B are somewhat less expensive...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impressions of the Oral-B 5000 was that it made a different sound than the Sonicare. The Sonicare is a high pitched vibration while the Oral-B has more of a pulsating sound... No big deal... In fact the Oral-B sounded like a &amp;#34;hard working&amp;#34; appliance should... What I really noticed is that my teeth and gums  felt cleaner after using the Oral-B for the first time.... The Oral-B seemed to truly brush my teeth and gums. I also like the idea of having multiple brush head options with the Oral-B such as the &amp;#34;floss white&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;deep sweep&#x27; and whitening brush heads..... 8 options in all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend the Oral B... By the way I did get the iPhone app for recording my brushing activity... The app does get me into going thru the whole 9 yards of brushing for two minutes.... Flossing... And using a mouth wash... Just what my dentist always pleads me to do in order to keep my teeth in their best shape possible...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an Oral B electric toothbrush for 10 years now.  I first purchased when I was getting braces to ensure I&#x27;d get a good clean.  Though my previous brush still works, it was time for a new one as after 10 years it wouldn&#x27;t charge as well.  I upgraded to the 5000 series and the clean I received is unbelievable!  I can&#x27;t stop running my tongue over me super clean teeth and gums.  An investment into my oral health and definitely worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> This is an additional purchase for my son who is going off to college. Paired with the Crest ProHealth toothpaste, perfect clean teeth. Wouldn&#x27;t ever get another brand. Love the updated Smartphone function.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not new to the electric toothbrush game. I&#x27;ve used the Sonicare for years, but recently my dentist recommended this model to me because it has a sensor that tells you if you&#x27;re brushing too hard. That seems like a good idea, and it seems to work. However, the brushing experience of this device is pretty bad by my standards. The brush head vibrates at a much lower frequency than the Sonicare, giving the teeth the feeling of being in a lopsided washing machine during spin cycle. If Sonicare sounds like &amp;quot;zzzzzzzzzzzz&amp;quot;, the Pro 5000 soulds like &amp;quot;duh-duh-duh-duh&amp;quot;, if that makes sense. Also, the size of the head makes it hard to slip around and into the mouth, it gets caught on my cheek every time I try to go the the back teeth and I have to manually pull the cheek out. Finally, the feeling of precise control is missing. With the Sonicare, I can feel my way along each tooth, but with Pro 5000 lacks that accuracy of feeling. Sorry to sound like a shill for Sonicare, it&#x27;s just my only mode of comparison. I&#x27;m going back.</li>
            <li> This is my very first electric toothbrush. Like any electric toothbrush virgin, I bled the first time (gross I know – but that was kind of funny). I kept thinking that it isn’t my first time brushing! But this is more powerful than a $1 brush so, my gums have had to get used to it. This pain is part of the payment for those who belong to the exclusive $100 toothbrush club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an added perk, if you start getting lolled into a morning stupor while brushing your teeth and spend too much time in one area, the brush wakes you up with bursts of slowing vibrating pulses and a gentle yellowish light to let you know to move on. And if you are not gentle enough with the placement of the brush, it will glow red and slow down the pulsations. The toothbrush trains you, like Pavlov trained his dog. Sort of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that you can switch brush heads to share with others, that it came with a charger and a case. Note about the charger: if your bathroom is like mine – a large opening in front of your bed that looks straight into your sink with no door, charge the toothbrush in another room. While the toothbrush is charging it will glow blue on and off ALL NIGHT LONG. I suppose you can put a towel over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are cleaner than they’ve been in a while. The whole thing is a 21st century experience with all the waterproof electronics, blue, yellow and red lights and all. I haven’t used the Bluetooth capability. I may download the app sometime. Maybe. Probably not.</li>
            <li> I now look forward to brushing - just to feel how clean my teeth are.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this toothbrush that lasted over 10 years, which gave me such a good impression of the brand that I didn&#x27;t even consider another. After the first use, I could feel the improvement in the brush technology, and have been enjoying the feeling of clean teeth. I&#x27;m disappointed, however, that the design of the handle was not more thought out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the brush has multiple modes, there is no indicator on the brush to see which mode I&#x27;m using. I just have to guess that they are in the order  they are listed on the box when you press the arrow button. There isn&#x27;t a way to save your preferred mode, so you have to cycle through every time you start up. If the indicator was on the back of the unit, I&#x27;d be able to see it in the mirror while I brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also not particularly interested in the Bluetooth feature, and found that though you can disable it when you turn it on, it re-enables after you turn it off and on again, which is goofy. So, why bother? :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the battery indicator flashes while charging. So, if you use it right before bed, it needs to recharge a bit afterward... I *used to* leave the bathroom door open in my master, but I can see the dang thing flashing in there when I try to go to bed! That is really the most annoying design flaw for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nice having the brush head tray for the 2 of us that use it, and the travel case (holds to brush heads). Otherwise, I may have gone for the far less expensive 1000 model.</li>
            <li> Used Soniccare for years and tried this one due to the good reviews but just not as good as the sonic care.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m putting this on my Christmas wish list this year!  It will go perfectly with my Bluetooth toothpicks.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I had my hygiene appointment within 3 weeks of receiving, and was complimented on the absence of tartar.</li>
            <li> Great electric toothbrush and a low price!</li>
            <li> not as good as the soniccare :(</li>
            <li> My old oral b braun professional care I got from Costco in 07 was in need of a replacement.  It could have lasted longer, but it wasnt going at full speed and I got a good deal on this.  (oral b website coupons link to amazon for extra bonus deal).  The bluetooth link is a gimmick-- i used it once so far and dont really plan on using it.  The pressure sensor is, like other reviewers say, fairly useless since you have to press really hard for it to go off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it noticeably works better and gives me a cleaner feeling than my old electric toothbrush.  I plan to use the extra whitening modes and such but its not clearly marked (only useful part of the bluetooth app.  Ill have to read the manual and go from there.</li>
            <li> It really cleans my teeth and is much more thorough than a standard toothbrush. The choice of speeds is also a good feature that both family members use. I don&#x27;t use the blue tooth - not everything in life needs to be tied to an app!</li>
            <li> Feels like I just came from the dentist every time!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Works great .... I don&#x27;t use the Wi-Fi feature.  I just needed a good electronic toothbrush with a small counter footprint</li>
            <li> exelent, you only can download the app in EU</li>
            <li> The bluetooth connection never worked. The manufacturer was very helpful in attempting over the phone fixes, but the handle is apparently defective. The CSA was so helpful she convinced me to try a return, otherwise I wouldn&#x27;t have continued with the product and asked for a refund. The mechanics of the brush work well - I think they over-stepped the technology. I loved my Rotodent which died after 10 years.</li>
            <li> My old one died and until I bought this, I didn&#x27;t know how much I missed.</li>
            <li> My teeth never felt so clean!</li>
            <li> Great product. its easy to use and bluetooth works fine.</li>
            <li> Bluetooth software not compatible with any device I have: phones, computers etc</li>
            <li> Its kind of expensive but the battery stays charged for about a week which is good if you travel.  Also I like the variable speed brush.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that I can read the news while brushing my teeth. Makes me read news and brush my teeth for 3-4min lol</li>
            <li> I really like this toothbrush. I have had it for 1 year now and it works very well. Granted after a few months it seemed the motor got a little weak but not to much. I frankly think that if its too powerful that can probably have an adverse effect on the enamel of your teeth, so right now its at the perfect speed/intensity. It cleans your teeth very well. I get the floss action oral b brush head. I will say that you will have to charge this probably once every 4 or 5 days, but even on a low battery, it still does the job. I definitely will be buying this again if it lasts me--you just never know with these motor toothbrushes. This is my first one. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> Battery shorted out after only a few months.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize until it arrived that it offers less than its predecessor, Oral B, Braun, Triumph Professional Care 9000. Unless you use Bluetooth to connect it to something else, there&#x27;s no readout. The only way to gauge the time is with vibrations and a light flash. They mention 5 modes, but no instructions that I found say what they are or how to utilize them. Since I don&#x27;t find the Bluetooth useful, this product is a big, very expensive, disappointment.</li>
            <li> I love it; however shop around, it was over-priced.  The product earns 5 stars, the price earns 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush replaced an Oral B Triumph electric toothbrush that was several years old and starting to show a lot of wear.  I needed a new toothbrush anyway and the bluetooth feature intrigued me.  After having used it for a few days I will say that I&#x27;m very happy with the toothbrush itself.  The brush head I was using was only 4 or 6 weeks old, so I just put my existing brush head on the new toothbrush and I was quite surprised that my teeth felt noticeably cleaner than when I brushed with my old triumph brush, even though I was using the exact same brush head.  The triumph was in the same price range as this brush, so I really wasn&#x27;t expecting any difference in brushing performance.  This brush is also noticeably lighter than my old triumph.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how helpful the bluetooth feature really is, though.  It&#x27;s really a bit of a pain to remember to bring my phone to the bathroom, unlock the phone, start the app, then start brushing every time.  While you&#x27;re brushing the app pretty much gives you the same info that you get with the smart guide that Oral B has included with their toothbrushes for a while now (although it does also include news headlines, weather information, and upcoming calendar appointments) but frankly,when I first got my triumph brush I think I used the smart guide for all of about a week and then managed to lose it in the back of a bathroom cabinet, so I&#x27;m not sure I really see myself continuing to open up the app every time I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app will also record how often and how long you brush for and the brush will retain 20 sessions if you don&#x27;t start the app each time you brush, so if you want a log of your brushing habits, then it would be good for this and you&#x27;d only have to sync with your phone about every two weeks or so, but frankly, I&#x27;m not entirely certain why I&#x27;d want a log of how often I brush my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other thing worth noting is that it doesn&#x27;t work well to share the brush with someone else.  The brush will sync with more than one phone, so if everyone remembers to open the app every time they brush, then it will work and the data will all be logged correctly for each user.  However, if you don&#x27;t open the app the brush will store the session in it&#x27;s own memory and will then sync that session with the first phone that it connects to.  So if my wife wakes up first and brushes her teeth without connecting her phone, then I connect my phone and start brushing the app will show that I brushed my teeth twice that morning... once from the saved session that my wife did and once from when I actually brushed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in the end I&#x27;m going to keep the brush as I&#x27;m really quite happy with it&#x27;s performance as an electric toothbrush, and the bluetooth feature doesn&#x27;t really add any additional cost (I believe it&#x27;s actually the same price as the non-bluetooth Pro 5000), but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll actually be using the bluetooth feature several weeks from now.e else.

            <li> Lightweight and powerful. Have had for a few weeks now and it works great. I had the older Triumph series for 7 years. It was on it&#x27;s last legs so we upgraded during &amp;#34;deal of the day.&amp;#34; The toothbrush storage is simpler, less difficult to keep clean than my previous device. I especially like the notification light for when you are brushing too hard. Very similar to other model, just lighter and a few new features. I highly recommend it, especially for the price I paid!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been longtime Oral-B users but have always had the basic no-frills models.  The Oral-B 5000 Smart Series with Bluetooth is definitely several notches up in the bells and whistles department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head boasts 3D action--namely, it rotates, oscillates and pulsates and there&#x27;s a triple pressure sensor that lights up if you&#x27;re using too much pressure on your gums.  There are also different settings for sensitive gums, whitening and deep clean, as well as a two-minute timer that pulses every 30 seconds (a feature that&#x27;s also in the no-frills models).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gimmick here is the Bluetooth technology which allows the brush to communicate with a smartphone app, allowing you to keep a real-time tab on your brushing habits.  Guess you could say the Bluetooth helps you maintain a white tooth.  It&#x27;s a cool interface, but, truthfully, it feels a little too gimmicky for my use.  The toothbrush might be waterproof but my phone definitely isn&#x27;t, and I&#x27;m not sure I like the idea of keeping it on my sink where it can get splattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the brush itself is first class all the way and my teeth felt noticeably cleaner after the first use.  It also comes with a charger and a charging station (the rechargeable battery lasts up to 10 days based on two, two-minute brushings a day) as well as a handy travel case.  There&#x27;s only one brush head in the packaging, but it is compatible with most Oral-B refills.</li>
            <li> First of all my 5 star rating is based on the Toothbrush itself and the excellent job it does at cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the best electric toothbrush I have ever used and you can definitely tell that your teeth are a lot cleaner than they would be had you used anything else, short of a dentist cleaning your teeth. The construction and build quality are first rate and I see no problems at all with anything in it&#x27;s construction. I expect this unit to last a pretty long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said I was almost tempted to take off a star because my first impressions of the Bluetooth hookup was that it was just a big gimmick!  After all I know when I brushed my teeth I have an idea of how well I brushed them, an added app is really not going to make much difference.  Then I started to think about it and realized this might be a useful tool for monitoring my Sons brushing, so I attached an extra head and loaded up the app and gave him a lesson in using it.  The end results are excellent!  He feels like it&#x27;s a bit of a game/competition and I get an easy way to monitor that he has really brushed his teeth properly.  About my only complaint is that the app is a bit intrusive and of course it&#x27;s another device to plugin and charge.  Those issues aside this is the Mercedes Benz of electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about what I expected. It works good, but way overpriced for what you&#x27;re using it for. Go with the $30 oral b. Who uses the bluetooth...and what more does the tongue cleaner do? Pulsing speeds? What for?</li>
            <li> The toothbrush itself is fine. Almost. It&#x27;s the absolutely useless features built (and charged for) in that made me angry and even more so that you have to read the whole manual to understand how to access them because the 5000 doesn&#x27;t have a display. But Bluetooth. All you need is a smartphone and a waterproof case for it if you brush your teeth under the shower like I do. This is the most ridiculous feature of them all. Run an app on your smartphone to track how you brush your teeth? Really? If you want to track your kids then stand behind them and watch them. Because you can&#x27;t use the toothbush and track on more than one smartphone. If you want this to be a conversation piece at the next dinner party you probably miss the automated posting of your cleaning pattern on Facebook and the direct video streaming from your gums to Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you press too hard (in your toothbrush&#x27;s opinion) it flashes a red light and reduces speed so you don&#x27;t hurt your gums. Really? You don&#x27;t know when you are hurting yourself and need your brush to tell you? Unfortunately the damn thing also kicks in when you press too hard on a tooth. Very annoying. I haven&#x27;t figured out the polishing and whitening mode (which is why I bought that thing in the first place) because I got irritated after flipping through 20+ pages. For Christs sake I just want to brush my teeth and I decide myself when I&#x27;m done. And that is when I covered everyone of my teeth from all sides and not when some timer starts buzzing. And the deep clean mode? It just adds another minute to the timer. If I would go by the timer I would never get to the last quadrant in my mouth. This is a hyped up product full of gadgets that the world doesn&#x27;t need. I got the Oral-B PRO 1000 instead which cleans almost the same. The 5000 seems to have a little more power but only as long as you don&#x27;t press on it. Other than that the result (clean teeth) is the same. Only for $31 instead of $101.</li>
            <li> Our old Oral-B finally bit the dust. The new one is great much improved.. More power. Missed five stars for 2 reasons. 1. The portable case should be bigger,  not enough room for a small toothpaste tube. 2. The old Oral-B charger was approved for 100-230v 50/60Hz great for foreign travel. The new one is 100-130v 50/60Hz could fry the charger overseas.</li>
            <li> We previously were using the Oral-B Triumph and were happy with that toothbrush, but this new on far exceeds the Triumph. We just hope that the battery life on this one is better.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth brush. Within 2 weeks I already noticed whiter teeth. Clean and brushes hard to reach areas. Feels like you leave the dentist everytime you use it. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I feel like my teeth get really clean. Used to travel case on a trip. Very handy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Works exactly as stated.  I love the vibrating timer which helps to ensure brushing is maximized.  The battery life is great for when I travel - I don&#x27;t have to take the whole charging platform - even for a week long trip.  The phone app is kind of gimmicky but I didn&#x27;t buy this unit for that so it doesn&#x27;t matter much to me.  I love the travel case that comes with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and price as well</li>
            <li> I have an earlier version of this product and love it. I purchased this one as a gift.  Evidently the product no longer includes the handy timer.  Now you need to sync to your phone.  I do not care for that but the recipient of the gift didn&#x27;t seem overly bothered by that.  Be aware the product is not as it is described.</li>
            <li> Sir i have already received my order and i m using it its awesome..</li>
            <li> It looks alot cheaper than I thought it would be but works great!!!!!1</li>
            <li> The iOS app is neat, except that it means I have to have my phone in the bathroom near water splashes and such. Once you&#x27;re done brushing, you are supposed to tap buttons on the screen indicating you did floss and again when you brushed your tongue, and again when you rinsed. My hands are wet, and I&#x27;m not touching my phone when my hands are dripping wet. It the app is not active, it doesn&#x27;t notice if you&#x27;ve brushed. Despite brusing diligently for weeks, the app says I&#x27;m slackin. That app could record brushing sessions, even in the background. Other apps record events while in the background, why not this one?&lt;br /&gt;The toothbrush itself is very good. The initial charge took a full 24 hours, but that was indicated in the instructions. The battery lasts a LONG time after being charged. I&#x27;m on a full week without recharging, and still going.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought \\&quot;who needs a Bluetooth enabled toothbrush\\&quot; ( we will ignore all the puns about Bluetooth and toothbrush)?  After using this brush for almost a week I am impressed with it, even though it has some areas that could be improved. But even with not being perfect, this is a great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, the toothbrush is comfortable to hold and use.  I have used bulkier toothbrushes in the past, and this one has nice contours.  The power it offers to the head is sufficient to clean without me having to push hard or brush vigorously on my home. The toothbrush has a pressure sensor to alert you if you are pushing too hard. Of the five modes available I checked out Daily Clean, Deep Clean, Sensitive, and Tongue Cleaning.  The different modes seem to alter the speed of the rotation, whether the pressure sensor is turned on, and I believe the activation of the timer. I have only used the supplied brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app is interesting.  For all intents and purposes I would describe the app as an activity monitor with some fluff built in.  When on, the app will record how long you brushed for and store that stat.  After each brushing the app asks you three questions as to whether or not you flossed, brushed your tongue, and rinsed. Also, recording your answers to those questions.  You have the opportunity to view your brushing stats for the day, wee, or month. During the brushing routine, you can set your screen to see just a straight timer, or 3D teeth mode which highlights a quadrant of your mouth that you should be brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app also contains silly things like Achievement badges which are awarded after repeated uses, based on the activity and the time you do it (for instance if you brush your teeth at least 7 times between 3 AM and 6 AM you get a badge).  These badges may add some positive reinforcement, but are largely useless.  You can also shop for brush heads from the app, but when I tried to connect the store said it was unavailable.  This is also true about the Feedback function. I do like the idea that I can customize the routine to fit suggestions from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the app is useful, but I can see improvements that will hopefully be introduced into future models. The app says that you can connect up to two handles to a single app.  I am assuming that then you can have two separate profiles for different people.  I think this should be available now.  At this price I am only buying one brush for the whole family and each of us would then have our own heads.  But, there is no way of distinguishing if the person who is brushing is me, or my wife, or one of my kids. I don&#x27;t know if we installed the app on multiple devices if that would solve the problem.  I have a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t. I believe the app would download all brushing sessions to each device because it would think it was missing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wish the app would record how much time I am spending in each area/tooth.  This would require some type of gyroscopic feature so the toothbrush would understand where in your mouth the head currently is.  The usefulness of this would be that I would know what areas I am neglecting or spending too much time on.  Everyone brushes their teeth unequally based on a number of factors including things like if you are right handed or left handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw I found was the ability for the toothbrush to remember my sessions when I did not have my phone available.  I purposely tested this twice.  I left my Bluetooth off on my phone and did a brushing session.  One time it updated my profile with the missing session, the other time it did not.  I wish there was a way to manually update the info.  Also, if you answer the post-brushing questions incorrectly (easy to do at 4 AM) you can&#x27;t go back and alter them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with these issues I find this to be a great brush and I will keep using it.as unavailable.  This is also true about the Feedback function. I do like the idea that I can customize the routine to fit suggestions from my dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the app is useful, but I can see improvements that will hopefully be introduced into future models. The app says that you can connect up to two handles to a single app.  I am assuming that then you can have two separate profiles for different people.  I think this should be available now.  At this price I am only buying one brush for the whole family and each of us would then have our own heads.  But, there is no way of distinguishing if the person who is brushing is me, or my wife, or one of my kids. I don&#x27;t know if we installed the app on multiple devices if that would solve the problem.  I have a feeling it wouldn&#x27;t. I believe the app would download all brushing sessions to each device because it would think it was missing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I wish the app would record how much time I am spending in each area/tooth.  This would require some type of gyroscopic feature so the toothbrush would understand where in your mouth the head currently is.  The usefulness of this would be that I would know what areas I am neglecting or spending too much time on.  Everyone brushes their teeth unequally based on a number of factors including things like if you are right handed or left handed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw I found was the ability for the toothbrush to remember my sessions when I did not have my phone available.  I purposely tested this twice.  I left my Bluetooth off on my phone and did a brushing session.  One time it updated my profile with the missing session, the other time it did not.  I wish there was a way to manually update the info.  Also, if you answer the post-brushing questions incorrectly (easy to do at 4 AM) you can&#x27;t go back and alter them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with these issues I find this to be a great brush and I will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I like electronic toothbrushes.They just seem to do a better job of getting stuff out of those hard to reach places.  It took me a few days to figure everything out on this one.  Mostly out of laziness on my part.&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;First I tried it with my ipad 2, but it told me I needed to update to bluetooth 4.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;Next I tried it with my iphone 5 and got the toothbrush to be recognized by the Oral-B app.  Once you set up the app (30 seconds) and have it running you don&#x27;t need to do anything except turn the toothbrush on and start brushing.  The app acts as a timer for each quadrant.  It also tells you when you are pushing too hard&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;I found it worked very well, encouraging me to brush for the entire alloted time.  Plus it keeps your data for about 20 days, so you can see how you are doing over the long run.&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone with Bluetooth 4 on their device.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush, mostly made in Germany, 100% more plaque than regular manual tooth brushing. The associated smartphone app provides coaching, tracking, and personalization. The package contains a single brush head, handle, charging unit with brush head storage, and a travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head storage compartment holds up to four brush heads.  In addition to the CrossAction brush head that is included, six additional brush heads are available for various purposes.  Even though it may appear the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush is designed for a family of four, it is meant as a personal hygiene device for a single user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B app is a large component of the Pro 5000 Bluetooth toothbrush, and will only work with one smart phone connection. The app primarily shows the timer with the associated quadrants one should be brushing during that period of time. Reminders for cleaning your tongue, flossing, and rinsing with mouthwash can be set as well as setting additional time for focused care. Statistics and achievements are also provided so one can see how they&#x27;re doing over time, and receive positive reinforcement. The app may be a nice tool for those learning how to brush their teeth, however it&#x27;s an amusing gimmick for experienced brushers. With the apps limitation to one user, and its focused purpose, the app may not be a compelling reason to purchase this product for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brushing is accomplished by setting the rotating brush head on the tooth, moving from one to the next.  While this is occurring, the toothbrush will alert the user if too much pressure is being applied.  When it&#x27;s time to move to the next quadrant, the brush will flash a green light and intermittently stop and start a couple times.  Using the app, it&#x27;s easy to gauge time spent on each tooth and side to get even brushing throughout.  The brush is on the loud side, but is tolerable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a [[ASIN:B0085RZLU4 Philips Sonicare toothbrush]], and will continue to do so.  The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush is effective at brushing and promoting good brushing habits.  However for an experienced user such as myself, the app is more or less gimmicky.  I found after using this toothbrush that I already have good brushing technique and the app didn&#x27;t really do much for me.  Although, I can definitely see where the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth electric rechargeable power toothbrush can be a handy training tool which my current sonicare toothbrush doesn&#x27;t provide.  If you&#x27;re looking for improving brushing skills, this may be the toothbrush you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;60 day money-back satisfaction guarantee&lt;br /&gt;Great learning device&lt;br /&gt;Provides positive reinforcement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Loud brushing&lt;br /&gt;Designed for single usersh is on the loud side, but is tolerable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a [[ASIN:B0085RZLU4 Philips Sonicare toothbrush]], and will continue to do so.

            <li> If you live the US you won&#x27;t be able to download the app, since is only available for the US app store. So all the fancy crap that comes along is worthless. Get the old version of the toothbrush. Is more reliable</li>
            <li> While I refuse to download and use phone app that goes along with this item (it acts for access to way too much information), I am very pleased with the toothbrush itself.  The toothbrush base can easily be used by more than one individual, we share amongst two people.  I have not yet tested just how long the battery lasts between charges.</li>
            <li> Product works very well.  I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as advertised: my tooth didn&#x27;t turn blue.</li>
            <li> Great product. I enjoy using this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush ever! I have had over $20k worth of work put into my teeth so I knew I had to invest in a top of the line toothbrush to help and I am glad it was this! Along with the free Oral-B app it has helped me keep track of my brushing habits, improve them and even make sure I am doing it right! (by not applying to much pressure etc.) along with giving tips and helping improve my dental habits.&lt;br /&gt;My friends laugh at me for having a toothbrush that syncs bluetooth with my phone, but it has def made a HUGE difference!</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd Oral B I&#x27;ve had. Each time I keep getting a better model. I love this one. I used to have gum disease, I have reversed&lt;br /&gt;my gum disease to zero and my dentist is very pleased with the condition of my gums and teeth!</li>
            <li> Works great. Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.  I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to switch to an electric toothbrush.  The bluetooth feature is amazing.</li>
            <li> Had the Triumph before this, and honestly liked it better as it had the timer right on the face of the handle.  App works fine, but it&#x27;s more trouble to have to always have the phone at hand or remember to download you brushing data.  The app seems more like a gimmick than a real asset to the process of brushing teeth.  I like the case that came with it, but was disappointed that it does not accommodate the charger and cord, just two brushes &amp; the handle.  Overall, it works well and I like the various brushing levels it has.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t use the app it is a really neat feature! I am a coffee drinker and my teeth are noticeably whiter! I love this brush! The carrying case is a plus as well! Would buy it again in a heart beat.</li>
            <li> Great product! Charger should be 110/220V compatible!</li>
            <li> Great way to monitor your brushing habits!</li>
            <li> I wish I had this when I was kid, I would have loved to brush my teeth.  Syncs perfectly with the iPhone. Gives great tips on brushing.  Like news updates when brushing my teeth.  Just wish I could get a splash guard...:)</li>
            <li> I purchased the Oral-B Pro 5000 Smart Series toothbrush when my Pursonic ultrasonic toothbrush suddenly broke when it&#x27;s on/off button jammed after only 3 months and no longer could be turned on.  The Oral-B Pro 5000 was pricey but, since it appeared to be made sturdier and had some features that I loved, I decided to purchase it.  I&#x27;ve owned it about 2 months now.  The Pursonic customer support was honest and did repair it for free including free shipping and returned it about 3 weeks later.  However, I gave the Pursonic toothbrush to my spouse when we got the repaired toothbrush back. It is still working after about 2 months.  I had originally loved the Pursonic ultrasonic toothbrush when it worked and liked that it turned off automatically after 2 minutes.  Thus, I was originally taken aback by the Oral-B Pro 5000 when it did not shut off automatically when it reached 2 minutes. However, once I got used to this feature I now like this feature better because I often take extra time to brush my front lower teeth where I tend to get tartar and stains.  I&#x27;ve noticed my coffee stains are now gone and my teeth look even brighter than before.  While the Pursonic toothbrush had improved my gums and teeth, it had not improved my teeth and gums to the degree of the Oral-B toothbrush.  I also love that I can turn the Oral-B toothbrush on or off at will and it remains ready to be turned on again for 30 seconds.  This is much more convenient as I often have to spit out the excess toothpaste and saliva that collects in my mouth and now I don&#x27;t lose any brushing time.  I found the replacement heads are much more expensive than the replacement heads for the Pursonic toothbrush.  I was worried that the Oral-B toothbrush heads were much larger than the Pursonic toothbrush heads and worried they would be too big for my mouth to prevent proper brushing.  I have had no problem getting the Oral-B toothbrush head to go in every available tooth surface.  Additionally, the toothbrush head for the Oral-B is much sturdier and is constructed much better. The Oral-B toothbrush heads have also more variety and seem to get between my teeth better.  The Oral-B toothbrush  to cleans my teeth better since my teeth are now stain-free.  The Oral-B toothbrush also provides a few additional settings (mine came with 5 different modes) from the Pursonic toothbrush in case you need them.  The Pursonic also came with a few different setting and, probably came with all the settings you need.  I&#x27;ve only used the default setting for both toothbrushes as that setting seems to provide a good brushing for my teeth and gums.  One negative for the Oral-B toothbrush is the bluetooth feature that comes with the toothbrush.  Although the bluetooth feature sounds cool, it is not very useful.  The bluetooth feature for Oral-B does work seamlessly with my samsung s4 smart phone but had very silly and useless features.  I only used it for less than one day because using it is too onerous for what it provides.  The Oral-B comes with a plastic travel case but the case is very bulky so I am not sure if I will use it when I travel.  It does not have an ultrasonic feature, which I liked on the Pursonic toothbrush.  If you can afford the Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries I recommend it over the Pursonic for it&#x27;s superior toothbrush features and how it has improved my teeth and gums.  However, if you find an Oral B that comes without bluetooth and is priced cheaper, I would go for the toothbrush without bluetooth because the Oral-B bluetooth feature is not worth extra money. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase and it met or exceeded my expectations in most categories.for the Oral-B is much sturdier and is constructed much better.

            <li> This seems to be a lot louder than the one that we replaced</li>
            <li> Good brush, but doesn&#x27;t seem to get in between the teeth as well as described. There are a dozen bluetooth features that I don&#x27;t need. The blue light blinks while charging and that&#x27;s really annoying at night. Seems to have some lubricating oil leaking out of the drive shaft.</li>
            <li> You know you&#x27;re an adult when you buy yourself a TOOTHBRUSH for Christmas! I had a prior version of this brush for almost a decade, and it just started to fail.  This one is a huge improvement - lighter, easier to maneuver, has lights that tell you if you&#x27;re applying too much pressure, plus syncs with an app that can track/analyze your brushing habits.  It also has multiple brush settings for different types of cleaning,  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My teeth is very clean.</li>
            <li> Got these for my kids. They love them.</li>
            <li> This same exact model has been used by me for many years and has helped tremendously in keeping my teeth and gums clean. This was recommended by my dentist who is very happy to see my gums healthy after a long battle with gum disease</li>
            <li> This voltage can use it in 220v in VIETNAM?</li>
            <li> I was not nearly as impressed with this unit as I hoped to be. I am replacing an older &amp;#34;sonic&amp;#34; type toothbrush that is reaching the end of it&#x27;s life span. I bought this on the recommendation of my dentists hygienist, who pointed out that these Oral-B toothbrushes are about as close as is available to what you see in the dentist office,&lt;br /&gt;It does the job it is made for, but there are a few things I&#x27;ll mention.&lt;br /&gt;Bluetooth - Don&#x27;t bother, it never works. Save a few bucks, even if it did work it&#x27;s not really a useful feature. That could change but I doubt it.&lt;br /&gt;Pressure sensor - The unit &amp;#34;stops&amp;#34; if it detects you are putting to much pressure on your teeth or gums. I find it stops too often, seems like just the pressure my cheek exerts is enough to set it off.&lt;br /&gt;Comfort - This may not be an issue for most as I have a &amp;#34;smaller mouth&amp;#34;. The old unit I had was much more comfortable for me to use, it&#x27;s not a deal-breaker though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, would I recommend it to a friend? I would suggest that they see what is available as these can be pricey. It&#x27;s not bad, just not as good (in my opinion) as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush but takes a LONG time to recharge the battery -- over 30 hours!</li>
            <li> This product is terrifico!!!!</li>
            <li> I thought that it will come with the separate timer as in the picture but it comes with out. And it is really not comfortable because you dont know which mode it is working on.&lt;br /&gt;But overall it brushes my teeth well.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of cleaning my teeth, but the corresponding bluetooth App on my iPhone is such a joke - you&#x27;d think I was preparing for an Olympic event. Total gimmick, making it a good toothbrush (as I prefer the rotary heads) way more expensive then it should be. I have a similar model in my Summer home, but it has a separate timer that does everything I need, without having to bring my iPhone into the bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Bluetooth toothbrush for several weeks now and I really don&#x27;t like for it&#x27;s &#x27;extra&#x27; features. As reported by several others, I keep losing connectivity between my Samsung S3 and the Bluetooth almost every time I try to use the timing feature. I&#x27;ve uninstalled and reinstalled the App and it would work for the next 2 or 3 sessions then again start losing connectivity. I have Bluetooth Version 4 on my smartphone but it still drops out anywhere between 3 seconds and 1 minute and 45 seconds into the brushing session even with my smartphone about a foot away. Very frustrating given the cost of this purchase especially when the session drops out after 5 seconds and I get a message I should try to brush longer! Another major annoyance is the Christmas Tree indicator for battery charging. A series of 3 blue lights flash during recharging which is anywhere between 30 to 45 minutes before reaching full charge and the lights go off. Our master bedroom has a sink and vanity outside the bathroom and this it where I set up my station. My wife goes crazy when I brush my teeth just before going to bed and 3 blue lights are flashing for up to 45 minutes in the darkness of the room. She wants me to move the station to one of the other 2 bathrooms but out of principle of buying this expensive product I refuse to leave the room just to brush my teeth. I like the toothbrush itself but the Bluetooth is flaky and the blue lights are annoying. I can&#x27;t find any information on how to troubleshoot or try to address the connectivity problem because there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any information in regard to this problem on the manufacturer&#x27;s site on generally on the internet. I&#x27;m going to try to replace this and try a new one just in case the one I have is defective.</li>
            <li> Excellent makes brushing fun</li>
            <li> Works really well compared to my now 7 year old Braun toothbrush. Tried the Bluetooth once and it worked, but decided it provided no added value.</li>
            <li> Smart Toothbrushes are definitely still in their early days. While it does have some sensors to stop you from brushing too hard, its mainly just a timer with some recommended brushing instructions</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great I actually feel my teeth really clean</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. It holds a charge. Went on vacation for a week and never had to charge it.</li>
            <li> Good tooth brush but the Bluetooth connectivity and App do not work properly.  Love that the brush changes color to Red to indicate too much pressure. Good feel and size. Plenty of adjustable settings but I never use them.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two of these while on sale for $80.  I would not pay any more than this due to the weak App and Bluetooth connectivity. This is a component of using the tooth brush if you have your smart phone handy to watch the timer and sync up your progress. This can be interesting if and when it works.  So basically it is a good overall tooth brush for the sale price but not worth the extra cost for the Bluetooth connectivity and app.</li>
            <li> I replaced my sonicare brush with this oral-b and couldn&#x27;t be happier. Does a great job cleaning between teeth.The small and angled head allows you to access the rear teeth and the inside of your teeth much easier. The timer lets you know how long you&#x27;ve been brushing. The only thing I didn&#x27;t need is the Bluetooth feature that I&#x27;ll never use and the replacement heads tend to be on the pricier side.</li>
            <li> Good but not as good as my former model.</li>
            <li> Love it best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> You cannot use this with a tablet. You have to sync it with your smartphone for it to work properly and guide you into better habits for brushing where you need it most. You use it with an app that you download to your phone. It lets you know at what phase you are in the cleaning process and recommends areas that need attention. The brush seems to do a really good job of cleaning. It feels good in the hand and pairing it to the phone is easy enough, if you have bluetooth connectivity at the 4 level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tracks what you do as well so you get the most of your 2-minute brushing. I like electric toothbrushes, and this one is impressive in it&#x27;s \\&quot;smartness\\&quot; but somehow this seems to me like an overkill (dental high-tech) as if we can&#x27;t figure out what to do ourselves. One more thing to sync to your phone. We don&#x27;t have enough apps to scroll through already, now we have one for brushing our teeth as well :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a personal choice. If you want to be sure you get the best job done on your teeth at home, every day, then this might be worth the due diligence to you.</li>
            <li> Overall, this toothbrush is just an electric toothbrush.  It spins and cleans.  This model does not come with the optional external display.  Without the display, it is almost impossible to tell which brushing mode you are on.  One thing I do not like about this toothbrush is at random times the toothbrush will stop spinning and a yellow light will come on.  I thought this was the pressure sensor, but but when I try to intentionally activate the pressure function, it won&#x27;t turn on. So I have no idea what the light is for.  The Bluetooth connection to the app is extremely simple and easy to use if you want to have your phone in next to you while brushing.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. It gives me just from the dentist clean teeth. The only thing I don&#x27;t like and wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the extra money on was the smart series. The app us nor good. It keeps telling me I haven&#x27;t brushed my teeth when I have. I don&#x27;t even use the app. I do like that the toothbrush lights up if you brush too hard. I can never go back to a regular toothbrush</li>
            <li> A toothbrush, that has a bluetooth itself? Really? Call me crazy, but I find that there is much more to life than the bluetoothbrush. Like a shoe polisher with the bluetooth, or a dinner fork, for example. I bet there is an app for that and what a life changing experience it is!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby. He loves it!! then he bought another set for me as gift..take note it&#x27;s not fit 220v..we live in Singapore so we have to buy converter. but this one is still worth buying.</li>
            <li> No Bluetooth feature unless you have (relatively) new phone! The product page uses the word “Bluetooth” more than 25 times and, at the time of this review, mentions ZERO times anything about Bluetooth 4.0.  The reason is clear why they leave this out:  fewer than half of devices in use have the new Bluetooth 4.0 so those devices can’t communicate at all with this toothbrush! Zero.  No Bluetooth connectivity, as in “can’t find device.”&lt;br /&gt;Note: iPhone 4S and later included this BT version (the OralB app also requires you to run iOS 6 or later), but Android was much slower to adopt BT 4.0. You &amp;#62;may&amp;#60; have Bluetooth 4.0 if you’re running at least Android 4.3 (released July 2013).&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:  Oral B is trying to cleverly omit this requirement for Bluetooth 4.0 from their marketing.  If you don’t have BT 4.0, this toothbrush is a step back from last generation that included a SmartGuide that sat on the counter and provided similar info:&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HWS9GG/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush my mouth always feels clean and with Bluetooth it is like a toy. Makes oral care fun!!!! And I am 55.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush. Really  gets your teeth clean. Bought as a replacement for a ten year old one. We don&#x27;t use the Bluetooth so can&#x27;t comment on that feature.</li>
            <li> We got this to replace a sonic care that died after 3 years and we both think we like the feel of the Oral better.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so clean really do like the tooth brush</li>
            <li> I bought this toothbrush for when I travel. It comes with a travel case that protects the handle and 2 brushes nicely tucked to the case so the brush doesn&#x27;t get squeezed or pressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger is single-voltage. In my case 110~120VAC. This is the main reason why I feel this brush will not work for me for travelling. Oral-B has chosen the &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; charger for this model instead of the &amp;#34;ring&amp;#34; model charger that offers 110~240VAC input voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Android phone App is very large. I guess this is because of the graphics and animations. It is fine on this regard, but the &amp;#34;newsfeed&amp;#34; is extremely annoying. Even when you strip it down to one category (let&#x27;s say, weather) it keeps blinking and &amp;#34;updating&amp;#34;. You can see your WiFi very busy while using the App, which in my mind it shouldn&#x27;t be doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would given it 2-stars to the product because of the charging voltage since I purchased the product mainly for travelling, but the brush performs better than my previous model and performs well when I use it at home.</li>
            <li> Once you use a great electric brush like this one, you&#x27;ll never go back to manual. I love this brush!</li>
            <li> Great Product.  Had experience with the base model for the past 2 years and decided to step up and buy one of the top models.  I chose the 5000 due to the bluetooth, which the 7000 does not have (surprisingly).  However, the bluetooth doesn&#x27;t do all that it claims....Gives you a timer and some other basic data, but not all that I was looking for.  Hooks up to your smart phone and shows you a timer and a picture of a mouth, but it doesn&#x27;t correlate to your mouth and the directions aren&#x27;t very clear on how to use it other than a timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The travel case is very basic, but nice and a nice feature.  The motor is much better in this unit than the cheaper versions.  Only gave it a &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; due to the bluetooth claims.  Otherwise, a great product.</li>
            <li> Very few people know what the Oral-B Pro 5000 is, much less have one.  However, they don&#x27;t know what they are missing and what a great job it does on your teeth and gums and keeps a record of it in the process.  It&#x27;s GREAT!😀</li>
            <li> its a toothbrush, so i didn&#x27;t expect the world from it. but it has turned brushing into an informative and enjoyable experience. the app is great and the sync function happens so effortlessly that you don&#x27;t even think about it. high fives all around.</li>
            <li> The price was amazing on Amazon! 79.99 with a 7.00 instant coupon!! I previously owned the 3000. I thought that was a great toothbrush. This one blows that one out of the water. My wife used sonicare but loves to use mine(with her own head). The Bluetooth sync is pretty cool too. The app is easy to use and reminds you to floss and brush your tongue. This brush is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> tOOTH BRUSH SEEMS FINE BUT THE ACTUAL BRUSH ATTACHMENT IS OF NO USE</li>
            <li> Gave It away as a gift.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was hesitant to spend this much in a toothbrush. I used to have a 10.00 electric brush from Walgreen&#x27;s but believe when I say that this is very different. I&#x27;ve never felt my mouth so clean. I love the app and the statistics. Very Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I expected to be impressed with the features on this electric toothbrush. Wow, Bluetooth technology! Now, I am thinking, why? The Oral B electric toothbrush works well without any extra technology. It does a thorough job. It gets the teeth that are way in the back, and as a bonus, I do not gag while brushing with this toothbrush.  However, the negative aspects of this toothbrush outweigh the positives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I showed this toothbrush to my husband, he wondered why anyone would want to bring their cell phone into the bathroom where it could get damaged. He thought it was silly to stand there and brush with a smart phone that really does not do much as far as helping you. Now, I must mention that at the time of this review, I had no cell phone so no Bluetooth was used. However, even without the Bluetooth technology, this SmartSeries is not so smart. When you open the box you get the Oral B Pro 5000 SmartSeries Toothbrush handle or unit, a toothbrush head for one person, a ring that is color coded so you can designate which head is yours (provided you purchase more heads), a travel case, a stand which is also where the unit charges, and a cover for the tray where you place the heads. Also included are the directions. The toothbrush is easy to charge and click onto the stand. The heads pop off and on easily enough too.  I thought the cover tray was poorly done since you just place it over the toothbrush heads. It does not click in anywhere so if someone knocks something into it, the cover comes off and then your heads are exposed. The travel case is big and I did not think it was a necessity but it is a nice feature if you travel with your electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now this Oral B toothbrush supposedly has 2 timer modes for you to set the toothbrush so you get the kind of clean you want. One is professional and the other is the 2 minute mode. Either mode will communicate with you through a stuttering sound and feel. They mention a green light but I never saw the green light on while brushing. I find the stuttering experience annoying since it suddenly stops what I am trying to do. A beep would be better and would not prolong my brushing. Now, the toothbrush comes set in the Professional Mode. Every 30 seconds, it stutters and supposedly a green light comes on to let you know you need to move to the next quadrant of your mouth. I never timed it for accuracy but it seems pretty short to me.  I do not need a toothbrush to tell me when it is time to move on.  A long stuttering sign indicates that your 2 minute time for the Professional Mode is done.  I can&#x27;t tell the difference and I just continue and turn off the brush when I am done. (I brush longer than the allotted time.) With the 2 minute Mode, it gives a short stuttering sound and a green light when you are done with the two minutes. I have never been able to figure out which mode I am in without turning on the brush and brushing my teeth. There is nothing to indicate which mode you are in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you put too much pressure on your brush, a red pressure sensor light will light up. I tried this by biting down on the head and I did not see any red light. What do you have to do bite the head off?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now apparently the more advanced model comes with this happy face timer and offers different brushing modes. This toothbrush comes with ONLY the ability to change between the timer modes. There are no different brushing modes like I thought there would be. To me, this is just a gussied up version of a regular Oral B Pro electric toothbrush with Bluetooth technology. Why pay for something that you can determine on your own? Apparently the features of the phone give diagrams, charts, and other info that you can show the dentist. As if your dentist would really start studying that. Most ask if you have been brushing and flossing and take your word for it. They examine you to see if you are doing a good job or not. If someone brushes for 2 minutes, it does not mean that it is a quality job. You have to brush well and the right way in order to keep your teeth in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would say the actual brushing without the bells and whistles gives you a wonderful, clean mouth better than a regular, manual toothbrush can.  However, I do not think you should spend more money for something that claims to have these amazing features and really doesn&#x27;t.ean that it is a quality job.

            <li> Normally, I do not write reviews unless I&#x27;m absolutely sold on something, or if its something I feel the need to warm people about.  In this instance, this will be the fact that I am absolutely, 100% positively, sold on this toothbrush.  I have literally had it for two days now and I can already tell a difference in the way my teeth feel.  So either my technique of manual brushing was that bad, or, this toothbrush is really that good.  I&#x27;ll go with the latter.  I use a waterpic before every brush, and even with the old manual brush method they felt clean after.  But combining my waterpic with this thing makes them feel like they&#x27;ve been finely polished, and silky smooth.  Like I said before I truly don&#x27;t write reviews about products, but in this case I had to.  It&#x27;s equivalent to dentist office clean, without all of the uncomfortableness and pain.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month.  My teeth have never been cleaner.  They feel as though I went to the dentist for a cleaning everyday.</li>
            <li> This is my second Oral B toothbrush , my teeth feel so much cleaner when I use this toothbrush instead of the traditional toothbrush.  Very pleased with quality!!</li>
            <li> My only issue is I was hoping for wall mount.  I thought all brushes had that option these days.  If you were to put it on the wall the little lid over your brush storage area would not open.  It also appears in the pix that the travel case stands as part of the display.  It does not.  You just have to put it somewhere.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is nice.  I am still getting used to it, and practicing using lighter pressure.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go for the price. Easy use. Excellent product my second one no problems</li>
            <li> Never have I felt my teeth this clean</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does a great job cleaning, and I love that it has a travel kit. However, I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 stars because this toothbrush has many features but only two buttons, and the instructions included with the toothbrush aren&#x27;t very good at teaching you how to use the different functions. I actually bought this toothbrush for my husband, as I already have my own Oral-B power toothbrush, and the first time he used it, he splattered toothpaste all over the bathroom because he couldn&#x27;t figure out how to control speed and other functionalities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, I had the same problem regarding a lack of instructions when I first got my Oral-B power tooth brush last year. Granted, the model I have is much cheaper with only basic functionalities. However, it seems like Oral-B falling short with their instruction manuals seems to be a recurring theme. My toothbrush is supposed to have a two-minute timer, and to this day I cannot get that function to work despite going over the &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34; a dozen times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Oral-B Pro 5000 is a great toothbrush, I&#x27;d say go for a cheaper power toothbrush if you don&#x27;t care about all the various potential functionalities. If you want the 3-speed settings, two minute timers, etc, I say buy a different brand of brush that better explains how to use the features of the toothbrush.</li>
            <li> To start off, my teeth have never felt cleaner, even though I used to use a good-quality SonicCare vibrating brush.  This does a terrific job if you use it right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are all thinking that the idea of a Bluetooth toothbrush is funny but it really encourages me to brush my teeth, my tongue and floss much more often.  It does little beeps and awards for consistently using it, which is rewarding.  I&#x27;m MUCH more consistent about doing the entire routine than ever before, and I never &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; and tell the phone app that I&#x27;ve flossed when I haven&#x27;t, because I&#x27;d only be cheating myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about this feature is that it saves your sessions on the toothbrush, so you don&#x27;t have to run the phone app every time you brush.  The next time you brush with the phone app open, just tap the &amp;#34;brushing mode&amp;#34; button and it will sync up the previous sessions.  That way you don&#x27;t lose the momentum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The app also will display news, sports, etc articles while you&#x27;re brushing, and you can select the general categories it will display.  But I rarely look at the displays because I&#x27;m focused on getting all the nooks and crannies between my teeth, which currently require enough focus that I can&#x27;t do that and read effectively.  So for me, this is a useless feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery lasts for almost 2 weeks, even though I brush more than the 2 minute minimum they recommend.  The charging base is nice and small, so very portable for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased, unless they included replacement brush heads, which they recommend you change every 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, especially if you can get it on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED 4/28/15: I got my teeth cleaned for the first time since getting this and the dental hygienist said that whatever this toothbrush was doing for me, it was really working. She said my gums and teeth never looked better.  However she did warn me not to press too hard at the gumline, as she saw little curves where the rotating brush was grinding the soft part of my teeth at the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really find the fact that I can track my brushing and flossing has increased my frequency. I just hit a new high of having flossed 27 days in a row, where I used to be an occasional flosser.  Only 3 more days to get the 30-day &amp;#34;award&amp;#34; from the phone app!she saw little curves where the rotating brush was grinding the soft part of my teeth at the gumline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really find the fact that I can track my brushing and flossing has increased my frequency.

            <li> Liked most of the features of the toothbrush.  Was able to get it at a very reasonable price, $79.99, so it was worth purchasing this version.  However if you could not get it at a reasonable price, I would skip the Bluetooth functionality and purchase one that is a bit more reasonable in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good features include the 5 different modes you can select (Daily Clean, Gum Care, Sensitive, Whitening and Deep Clean), the indicator light if you press too hard, the fact it stays charged for 10 days (have not tested this yet), the nice charger, the ability to program the brush through the app, and the travel case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature I am still debating on is the Bluetooth capability.  The toothbrush connected seamlessly with my phone, Galaxy 4S, utilizing the Oral-B app.  However the app has a very limited usefulness.  The app gives you a count-up or count-down timer (selectable) as well as a graphic of your teeth quadrants while brushing.  You can easily tell when it is time to move to the next quadrant by watching the app.  However the toothbrush itself gives you haptic feedback (pulses) when it is time to move to the next quadrant as well.  The app tells you if you are pressing the brush too hard, but the brush also lights up red to tell you that you are pressing too hard.  App keeps track of how long you brushed your teeth.  So unless you want to know how long you brushed your teeth for a week ago,  you can actually care for your teeth without the Bluetooth ever being used with the extra benefit on not getting toothpaste spray on your smart phone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why am I debating whether the Bluetooth is a good idea?  Well the app does give you some flexibility.  For instance the app allows you to turn off the haptic feedback and/or the lights on the toothbrush.  The app will allow you to remove any or all brushing modes from your toothbrush or rearrange the order that they appear on your brush selection.  The app also will keep track of whether it has been 90 days since you have replaced your brush.  Finally the app allows you to customize how long you would like to brush in certain areas (i.e., you can add time to each quadrant) so that you can concentrate on that particular quadrant longer if required.  These are nice-to-have items, but only require you to turn your app on once when you purchase the toothbrush, make your settings for the brush, and then never turn the app on again.  So nice, yes.  Worth $100 premium, you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  Wonderful brush, nice flexibility on the settings, no real reason to use the Bluetooth unless you desire to change settings.as been 90 days since you have replaced your brush.

            <li> 1) This device makes as much noise as a lawnmower.&lt;br /&gt;2) The head is too large, if you have wisdom teeth back there, they will be hard to reach.&lt;br /&gt;3) In a bathroom where so many germs float, shouldn&#x27;t the brush come with a cover?&lt;br /&gt;4) The bluetooth is just a useless gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I miss my sonicare!</li>
            <li> I have great bright teeth</li>
            <li> Works great.  No problems.  I haven&#x27;t used the bluetooth though.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but I can&#x27;t get the battery to charge fully. I might have a defective unit</li>
            <li> awesome product excellent</li>
            <li> Item is good. But the few unremovable black stains on the white rubber handle is truly disappointing.</li>
            <li> Without reservation I rate this seller&#x27;s product and service as excellent.  I will  refer my friends and most likely will be a return customer whenever the opportunity arises.</li>
            <li> You must have your phone with you at all times, for your brushings to be recorded</li>
            <li> Pricey but I am very pleased with this electric toothbrush. iphone app makes the cleanings more effective and helps keep me on a good cleaning schedule.</li>
            <li> Fantastic toothbrush! It doesn&#x27;t a wonderful job cleaning, it is pretty quiet, the settings are great, and my teeth feel extremely clean. However, be warned that the toothbrush head (cross action) that it comes with is currently not out for individual sale. So the head you get is the only one, unless you buy a different style head later.</li>
            <li> My friends thought I was silly for choosing a blue tooth tooth brush.  Well - I would definitely disagree.  Not only does this toothbrush keep me accountable, it tells me: when it is time to change the brush head, when I&#x27;m late brushing my teeth that day (brunch brusher), reminds me of my upcoming dentist appt. and maps out my weekly and monthly brushing, flossing and rinsing progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want accountability and friendly reminders - you have to get the blue tooth model.  There is an app for that.</li>
            <li> Product in excellent working condition. Very good electric toothbrush. For those who can&#x27;t connect via bluetooth, there is no PIN required. Just switch off and on your bluetooth, try to reconnect till it works.</li>
            <li> Brush itself is great. Battery life has been good so far over 8 months. However the Bluetooth is worthless. Should have gotten one tier lower and saved the money. That&#x27;s what we did for my wife and hers is actually somewhat slimmer but otherwise just as good as mine but less expensive.</li>
            <li> already had old model.  This one looks nicer</li>
            <li> Not what I expected too much to do</li>
            <li> Really like the toothbrush. The battery lasts a long time, and the head selection is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially started by alternating between the electric toothbrush and my regular one because it hurt my gums at first. Occasionally, if I brush with the electric toothbrush too much it will make my gums sore, so I will switch to using a regular toothbrush until it subsides, or alternate them for a few days.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be so loud.  Almost as if using some small power tool.  I also thought it was too rough.  I will be returning this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a previous Oral-B that finally gave up after a few years.  I was happy with the performance and product life of the previous model, so I stuck with it for this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the previous model, I never really used the lower button that changes the speed/cadence of the brush head.  Just seemed like a gimmicky feature to me.  On this one, that button has been moved slightly, and I find that I&#x27;m constantly inadvertently pushing it while brushing.  It&#x27;s located right where my thumb naturally rest.  Minor complaint, but why not move it to a spot not so likely to get pushed?</li>
            <li> Good toothbrush.  Bluetooth?  Why?...</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my girl its her First one she crazy about it she said why she never bought in the past.  The best</li>
            <li> You have to use a Bluetooth device to change settings and so it is a nice companion device but not good as a stand alone device</li>
            <li> Works great, just like my previous Oral-B&#x27;s.  Very well made.</li>
            <li> Toothbrush does not function as advertised, app is useless and doesn&#x27;t function with the brush handle.  Numerous calls and emails to Oral B have left me with a costly, dis-functional brush.  Although courteous over the phone, no one at Oral B was able to give me answers on why my brush and app are not working properly.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do which is a good thing, Bluetooth part is a bit gimmicky but does motivate you to brush for a full 2 minutes twice a day</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was.  The first brush I bought with toothbrush holder etc. Came with a variation of toothbrushes for everything. Included price was actually less. I bought what I thought was the same for my husband one tooth brush, what a pain finding the correct toothbrushes and you can&#x27;t buy one at a time that I have found so far.  I love the toothbrush itself but putting a holder without the brushes is deceitful to me. TJ</li>
            <li> Just a great toothbrush. The Bluetooth works well and I like it but would be happy either way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an improvement over a manual brush, but, for me, not a great powered toothbrush.  After trying it for just over a week, these are my thoughts and why I am sending it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+ I like the circular shape of the head, it seems easier and more natural of a shape&lt;br /&gt;- Much noisier than my girlfriend&#x27;s Sonicare&lt;br /&gt;- Usually &amp;#34;smart&amp;#34; gadgets work to motivate me, party because they&#x27;re fun to use and partly because I love tracking data.  I did not find the app at all motivating and often felt like it rushed me (if you stop brushing for more than 30 seconds...to talk to someone or spit, the whole session resets).  So often, I avoided using the app and wanted to just rely on the toothbrush&#x27;s ability to store sessions and sync later, for tracking purposes.&lt;br /&gt;- But that doesn&#x27;t work either.  I would brush for 3 days, without bluetooth connection, and then sync with my phone (Galaxy S5) and ... nothing.  It would show Syncing and then no new sessions.&lt;br /&gt;- Finally, always knowing that everyone--I mean everyone--I have talked to saying their Dentist recommended Sonicare... not to mention my own.</li>
            <li> Love the toothbrush and makes my teeth feel cleaner....</li>
            <li> This electric tooth brush works well as advertised. My only complaint, which is the reason for a 4 stars rating, is that it takes more than a full day to fully charge the battery inside the handle (from flashing red to three green battery indicator). I have to use the tooth brush while it not fully charged, thus use up 2 charging cycles every time the red led light is on. Since a typical rechargeable battery lasts about 500 charging cycles and the battery runs about 5 days once it&#x27;s fully charged for me, I expect the battery will last 1,250 days (500x5/2) or 3.4 years. I hope the manufacturer will improve its future design so that it takes only 4-6 hrs to fully charge the battery.</li>
            <li> Have had an Oral B toothbrush for probably 15 years and always loved it - it was just time to get a new one.  I highly recommend this product!!  My teeth love it!!!</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing a good job so far.  My dentist told me to use an electric brush and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing.  However, the pause gives me pause.  I do not like nor appreciate it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful toothbrush!</li>
            <li> Disappointed I did not read the product description well enough to see that it did not come with monitor - have not been able to purchase separately and think it would be a necessary enhancement for full utilization of toothbrush. Works much better than the Sonicare we had before.</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush after having the entry level brushes that lasted years. It seems that the handle is not properly sealed and the water get in and create rust that cab be seen through the clear plastic at the top back of the handle. My kids use this handle again and it gets wet but I expect a toothbrush handle to cope with such conditions.&lt;br /&gt;Sent it back to customer service and got a new handle instead (fast service). Couple of months later the same phenomena occurred again.&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this model as it is too delicate for wet environment.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Works great but I don&#x27;t use the bluetooth so I can&#x27;t say how good that works</li>
            <li> Three months is broken, what all didn&#x27;t touch the red light has been bright, don&#x27;t know how to guarantee in China, alas, since can from recognize unlucky, isn&#x27;t it</li>
            <li> Use it everyday and have fallen in love with it. The brush still feels new after a month of use. One side affect though, my wife seems to use all the toothpaste. Oh well.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and I was really skeptical I thought he was ridiculous for wanting a toothbrush this expensive, but he loves it and I&#x27;m actually amazed it has made a huge difference. I purchased the whitening brushes with it and in 2 weeks his teeth are definitely 2 shades whiter!</li>
            <li> It works very well! Good quality and excellent results</li>
            <li> I just got this so I haven&#x27;t even charged it yet but I was disappointed that it came with only one brush. The photo shows 2, so now I have to order another one.</li>
            <li> Very impressed and happy with the purchase.  Cannot go back to a manual brush.</li>
            <li> High Quality. I cannot use a manual toothbrush anymore</li>
            <li> I would not have expected that an electric toothbrush could be so much better than a manual one. My teeth both look and feel whiter and cleaner.  Though a bit expensive, my only regret is not buying it sooner.</li>
            <li> Amazing toothbrush.  It works as advertised.  Holds a long charge,  cleans greatly and the app is fun.</li>
            <li> It cleans extremely well</li>
            <li> Pricey but I am very pleased with this electric toothbrush. iphone app makes the cleanings more effective and helps keep me on a good cleaning schedule.</li>
            <li> *quality toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;*clean so good&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. It can save you so much time in the morning and night. It&#x27;s not loud for me. BUT I don&#x27;t know which mode I am on because I don&#x27;t use with my phone. Let me use it for couple weeks and will provide a follow up feedback. Overall, I love this toothbrush. Good job Oral B.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning and form, fit, function with more bells and whistles than anyone should ever need.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it. This $124 toothbrush came with only 1 brush head. I&#x27;ve used Oral B for many years and know it is the best product in its class...but this is the height of corporate stinginess. For this price you can&#x27;t give a family at least one more brush head?</li>
            <li> Great powerful toothbrush, but bluetooth isn&#x27;t stable.  Seem to always have to reconnect once a week</li>
            <li> The bluetooth function only works when you open the app.  If it could stream data from past brushings so you don&#x27;t have to bring your phone every time you brush, it would be far better.</li>
            <li> It okay, I used the Triumph professional care with a smart guide for 6 years, and cannot use any other toothbrush after getting used to this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s necessarily worth the money to get a brush with 5 different speeds/modes cause they all seem pretty much the same to me but I must admit as silly as the Bluetooth capability and an app ..for my toothbrush! sounds, it&#x27;s truly a nice tool to ensure you are using the brush properly. As far as the battery goes, read the manual, follow the proper instructions, and you will get the most out it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush.  The accompanying app can be useful.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible tooth brush. I&#x27;m so sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended this to me because he said that I brush too hard with a normal brush and it wears away the base of my enamel. I have poured money down the drain with dentist bills because I had been brushing too hard all along. This toothbrush may seem a little spendy but it is an amazing investment and keeps you and your dentist happy. The sensor can sense when I put too much pressure and it flashes a red light on the base of the brush, obviously my favorite feature of the whole thing because it solves my issue. All around great investment.</li>
            <li> Except the tongue cleaning mood which is different from the other moods, I feel like the other four are the same function. But I like it. It is my first time to use electric tooth brush and I have a good experience of it.</li>
            <li> i really like the toothbrush. I bought it on sale but after using it for almost 6 months, I don&#x27;t use the bluetooth feature anymore. I&#x27;m thinking on buying one for my brother but I will get the model below this one, without bluetooth.</li>
            <li> I would give this toothbrush more stars if I could use the app.  I mistakenly thought it would work with any bluetooth device and tried to download the app on a tablet, it only works with smartphones.  I do not have a smartphone nor do I plan on buying one.  This wouldn&#x27;t be big deal except there is no way to know which of the 5 settings you are on without the app.  I&#x27;m hoping it on a regular or deep clean right now, but can&#x27;t be sure since I started pressing the button to change the settings and have no idea now what it is on.  Otherwise, it seems to charge quickly and the charge lasts a long time.  I just want to see what setting I&#x27;m on!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush does an excellent job cleaning your teeth. The cleaning leaves your mouth feeling like a trip to the dentist office more than a manual brush. There is a two minute timer that pulses every 30 seconds to remind you to switch quadrants in your mouth. This can be helpful if you are busy or prone to not brushing long enough. An advanced feature of this brush is that it lights up red when you put too much pressure on your gums or teeth. Other Oral B toothbrush heads are interchangeable with the base of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle does feel a bit bulky in your hand. Also, when handling an electric toothbrush you need to be careful not to have it turned on unless it is in your mouth. Otherwise, it will splatter and make a mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bluetooth connection to your phone is interesting but not something I will use on a daily basis. Downloading the app was easy. Your phone does need to be connected to Bluetooth and the app needs to be manually turned on each time. This requires you to have your phone with you and ready in order to take advantage of this feature. In my opinion, most people are too busy in the morning and too tired at night to worry about this. If you are interested in tracking your progress, then you will love this feature. It keeps track of how long you&#x27;ve brushed, flossed, and cleaned your tongue, all while giving you the daily news and temperature outside.</li>
            <li> This is a high-end, really effective toothbrush. Personally I like the vigorous motion more than the Sonicare I used previously for over 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set to alert you when to change brushing to another quadrant by buzzing briefly. This is really useful and non-intrustive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bluetooth app and functionality. I tested this on a Nexus 5 Android device. It worked fine. I don&#x27;t find it particularly useful to me - the built-in features tell me when I&#x27;ve brushed for long enough. This is probably only useful if you really want to track how long you brush, or to make sure that a child is brushing enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expect to use the Bluetooth app a few times and then stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a cheap brush. The heads are not too bad at around $7 each, which isn&#x27;t cheap but seems reasonable. That said, it really does do a great job cleaning. If you want the best toothbrush you can buy, and are happy to invest the asking price, this is a great toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spoke to my dentist&#x27;s office and the hygienist said her patients had really good results with the top of the line Oral-B toothbrushes, so she recommended it.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush is great. I have been using a Phillips Sonicare toothbrush, which I&#x27;ve been very happy with, but this one is quite different. There are different types of bristles in the head, which I suppose clean in different ways. Unlike the Sonicare which just vibrates the bristles ultrasonically, this one actually rotates the head back and forth. I had thought that would be too much scrubbing and cause my gums to recede, but I found that this slight rotation action just causes the bristles, which are angled different ways, to flex against the gums. It seems to clean maybe better than the Sonicare, and if you press too hard the brush pauses and vibrates and lights up, so you really know to press lightly. It lets you know when 30 seconds is up so you can switch to a different quadrant of your mouth (Sonicare does this too). The handle is comfortable, and I really like the brush. I tried to connect it with Bluetooth to my phone, but it wouldn&#x27;t connect. I do have Bluetooth 4.0 on my LG V3 Vigor phone, and I think I followed the instructions on the app, but after waiting for a couple of minutes, I gave up. You&#x27;re supposed to push a button on the brush handle to make the initial bluetooth connection, and I did that after starting the OralB app on my phone, but the app just kept saying it was waiting for a connection. On the phone I tried going to the Bluetooth settings and telling it to allow discovery and to look for bluetooth things, but it didn&#x27;t detect any. I&#x27;m curious what the phone app would add, but I don&#x27;t have the patience or motivation to pursue it further. In any case, even without the odd bluetooth connection to a phone, the toothbrush itself is very nice and a good substitute or even alternative to a Sonicare.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pro 5000 rechargeable toothbrush is a step up from the one I have been using for several years and I have been quite pleased with that one. The new toothbrush has quite a few bells and whistles that were probably not even considered for a toothbrush when my original one was manufactured. The Pro 5000 is Bluetooth capable which pretty much means it has its own app that is available for your Apple or Android device. It also is equipped with flashing lights and vibrators that let one know if he is applying too much pressure, when it is time to move on to another area of the mouth, and of course signals the end of the optimum two minute brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about the Pro 5000 is that it seems to be more powerful than my former model which is probably a good thing. I did feel that my teeth were cleaner than before. As far as the Bluetooth and app - I guess it&#x27;s a nifty feature for some people and might be handy for those teaching their children how to brush properly. I don&#x27;t particularly like the idea of having my device in the bathroom close to water when I brush. Another feature of the app is that it notified me that it had been 2 days since I connected. I guess it was reminding me that I needed to brush however I just felt no need to use the app. I will probably uninstall the app soon - I won&#x27;t be using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another plus with the Pro 5000 is much improved brush head storage. The storage area on my former model tended to develop  mold quickly and was difficult to clean. This newer model&#x27;s design should help to avoid that problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think the Oral-B Pro 5000 is an excellent toothbrush and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think it really is a great gift idea for a techie type person or a gadget person, but for the average person, like myself, the idea of a toothbrush telling me when to brush and how often to brush and when I have brushed in the past is just a waste of time in which case a less expensive Oral-B toothbrush would be more appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the toothbrush itself, the Oral-B Pro 5000 works great, but I wish a second and different brush head had been included so I could alternate like I do with the one I am using now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, unless you are going to take advantage of the Bluetooth accessibility, I would find a less expensive Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Feel so much cleaner.</li>
            <li> This particular Oral-B Pro 5000 can be connected to your blue tooth, if you have that available. What this does is keep track of the amount of time and frequency when you brush your teeth. Frankly, I have too many devices already to worry about connecting to blue tooth, trying to figure out the readings. Plus I am somewhat concerned where this data is going??? However, that said, it does a better  job of cleaning your teeth than most battery powered toothbrushes. I do like to floss and of course this toothbrush does not eliminate the need to floss. I talked to my dentist about this particular toothbrush and his answer was that he likes the old fashioned toothbrush! Also, the blue tooth just seems to be something extra, but has nothing to do with the actual cleaning. Your mouth does feel very clean after the actual brushing. Also, I found out that unless you have Blue tooth 4.0, it comes up with &amp;#34; can&#x27;t find device.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a good toothbrush, it gets the job done, but it is not necessary to have the blue tooth connection .</li>
            <li> This rechargeable toothbrush is awesome - the best I have owned. It cleans my teeth extremely well without making my gums sore. This is truly a dentist-equivalent system for whitening and cleaning. The item, when upright in its charger, doesn&#x27;t take up much space on my bathroom sink counter at all - which is nice. It has a nice, comfortable grip in my hand. I especially like the fact that there are several different brush settings to suit different brushing styles and preferences. You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Oral-B Pro 5000 if you are looking for a professional-level automatic toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I use to have the older Oral-B PC1000, so at least I have a comparable.  This brush is drastically better in almost every way.  First, the motor is quieter and seemingly works better than the more basic models.  It seems much easier to operate as such (less revisiting parts of my mouth that feel dirty still).  Second, it has lots of modes.  I don&#x27;t really utilize any of the extra modes, but they&#x27;re there should I feel up to it.  Third, which makes this the best thing ever, is bluetooth.  I never thought I would need it, but man -- I feel like I&#x27;ve accomplished something after I&#x27;m done brushing.  I get awards, it tracks the time I spent, provides news in the AM while I&#x27;m brushing, yells at me if I brush too hard, etc.  It also helps to de-clutter my sink area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In general, it&#x27;s a motivating tool that serves a solid purpose.  Unlike the more basic models, I&#x27;m also happy it comes with a travel case.  I did have to replace mine within the first day, since the battery indicators LED was dead -- but that&#x27;s not a big deal thanks to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the Bluetooth and I love it!. i need a new toothbrush and this one fits the bill!</li>
            <li> Never actually got to use it.  It got burned in a house fire.  I  can tell you that it does not stand up well to fire - but then what does?  I think I would have liked this a lot if I had actually gotten to try it.  FWIW the toothbrush did not cause the fire.  I am only writing this to get it off my review list.  Maybe after insurance pays off I will be able to purchase another one of these...</li>
            <li> This is a great upgrade in the tooth department. I had a 8 year old basic oral b, I consider switching to the sonicare, but read comparison studies that said this did the same job for 1/2 the price. ( I used saved money to buy a water flosser- another great buy).&lt;br /&gt;I love the blue tooth app, I did not want a device on the wall. I find the app helpful and my note 3 has plenty of room for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes with one basic head, all the heads are cheaper than sonicare. I wish I could buy a variety pack instead of a three pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Between the water flosser and this I am off to a great start in tooth maintenance. I would buy again and will keep upgrading.</li>
            <li> The Oral-B Pro 5000 SmartSeries with Bluetooth technology is, truly, an excellent toothbrush system with some high-tech hygiene implications.  I could never in my wildest imagination, as a youngster, have considered a day when I was brushing my teeth in concert with my smartphone.  Heck, my dream as a youngster might have been having a phone in the bathroom.  With a cord.  And a rotary dial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bluetooth, I must admit, is really pretty cool.  If nothing else, it has made me pay attention to the amount of time I actually brush my teeth.  I think in the past I have -- like so many probably do -- not paid attention at all while brushing and just let my thoughts wander until the rogue thoughts turn to a realization that I must have been doing this brushing thing for a while and that I should probably stop to go watch five more minutes of TV before bed.  Now, I brush for what I know is at least two minutes, if not more.  Can you get the same thing from an egg timer?  Yes.  We&#x27;ve done it before while teaching our five-year old to brush.  But I said it a long time ago when I wrote a review for the voice-activated grocery list machine that you put on the fridge... this gadget is expensive, and that&#x27;s why I use it instead of a piece of paper.  And there are more entertaining benefits to the Bluetooth aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The five different mode settings and the tooth-cleaning ability of this premium toothbrush is really the reason why you should buy it.  It has gone down in price over the last two months from over $100 to just below $80, and I hope that trend continues.  It is absolutely worth either price, but the lower the better, of course.  There are some modes where I can&#x27;t tell at all what the differences might be between them.  I think, &amp;#34;deep-cleaning?  Whitening?  What can the difference between those things really be?&amp;#34;  You may actually find a mode that you&#x27;ll stick with, believing that one of the &amp;#34;3D&amp;#34; motions of the brush is better than the others.  All the power to you; it really does clean teeth nicely.  It is comfortable to hold, and the overall brushing experience is a very pleasant one, and a satisfying one as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this toothbrush system, especially to those families with kids who would really utilize the Bluetooth connectivity.e others.

            <li> [[VIDEOID:82c6545f16552fc978243a059772f3f5]] In my written review, I said that the bluetooth version works with the SmartGuide that comes with the non-bluetooth version. Oral-B support says it doesn&#x27;t, though, according to some people who&#x27;ve contacted the company. So, here&#x27;s a very short video to show that, at least with the toothbrush and SmartGuide that I have, they do work together.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is great.  My teeth look noticeably better after use.</li>
            <li> Does work good. But the smart Bluetooth features are useless. (kind of cool the first few brushes, but then get old and useless)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, there&#x27;s no light indicator to tell which mode you are on or the sequence of the modes. You can change the order/programming via the Bluetooth (that is have regular clean first by default, deep clean second, gum massage third, etc.) but then you have to memorize the sequence and remember to push the mode button on the toothbrush the correct number of times to switch modes (that is push mode one time to get to deep clean, two times to get to gum massage, etc.). This is just plain dumb product design! Because it is not easy to change modes, I just keep it on regular clean.</li>
            <li> This model is better than the 1000 I had before.  It angles the brush a little more so it is easier to reach back teeth.  Holds a charge for a long time even tho I use my brush for 4 min 2x a day.  Like that it shows when the battery is getting down there so you can recharge before it stops in the middle of your brushing like my old one did.  Can&#x27;t say anything about the bluetooth since I have a windows phone and the app is only for apple or android;(( I haven&#x27;t used the different modes either because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t know which one I&#x27;m using without the bluetooth feature.  The case is very nice.  I use it everyday to store my brush in so it stays somewhat sanitary between brushings.</li>
            <li> This brush turns itself on and, at times, I cannot get it to go off.  Other times, it won&#x27;t turn on when I need to use it.  On the handle it mentions that there are five modes but there is no way change or view them.</li>
            <li> Sure beats the manual toothbrush, really helps that it alerts you if you are brushing too hard.</li>
