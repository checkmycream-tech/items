            <li>Great for traveling; I put hair spray in it and it works fine.</li>
            <li>However, this bottle does a nice job misting water.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of these to make my own air fresheners.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my own tablet/phone/eyeglass cleaning mix (50/50 water &amp; rubbing alcohol) that saves me a bundle.</li>
            <li>Its made from a thicker plastic which is nice because you can put it into a purse and not have to worry about it squeezing and popping the cap off.</li>
            <li>I put my lavender oil, sea salt, and warm water mixture together and proceeded to spray.</li>
            <li>yet, and the spray it puts out is a nice even Mist, not a spray.  </li>
            <li>bet if you have one or two, you would come up with a handy use for them.</li>
            <li>i use it for my rose water face mist.</li>
            <li>Its fits nicely in your purse or over-night bag as well.</li>
            <li>I like doing my own nails at home</li>
            <li>The bottles themselves are very sturdy and are the perfect size!</li>
            <li>Good price, doesn&#x27;t leak, and has a nicely even and fine spray.</li>
            <li>I use this bottle to spray a mist of aftershave on my clothes for a nice scent without getting overbearing... like a dryer sheet, but more guy-like.  </li>
            <li>Very fine mist.</li>
            <li>Each press gives you a generous \\&quot;spritz\\&quot; of very fine mist.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has a very fine mist, finer then I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>The spray is a very fine mist as described and seems like it will hold up for quite a while.</li>
            <li>but no, they all seem to produce a very fine mist.  </li>
            <li>the mist is very fine</li>
            <li>The bottle produces a very fine mist that disperses well.</li>
            <li>Very fine mist.</li>
            <li>He told me that my best solution is a bit of cool water and a clean smooth cloth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice size and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>It gives me nice control over the amount because it sprays a fine mist.</li>
            <li>This bottle creates a nice, fine mist.</li>
            <li>a nice fine mist.  </li>
            <li>It puts out a fine mist and the alcohol mists onto my skin and evaporates rapidly, providing a nice, cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li>Sprayer makes a nice fine mist but this thing leaks from sprayer part every time I shake the bottle (the liquid I keep in the bottle needs to be shaken before each use.)</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve since ordered and received two more of these.  </li>
            <li>Thought I was getting more than just one spray bottle.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Nice light spray for making bath bombs.</li>
            <li>You have better control using this spray bottle</li>
            <li>Worked well and packaged well :)</li>
            <li>I put aloe vera juice in most of them and would spray them over my sun burns.</li>
            <li>should, unlike most of the ornate minsters.</li>
            <li>Have ordered some more for my friends.</li>
            <li>I have to type twelve more words for this review to count.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell gross like some plastic products tend to, and the spray comes out perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have another with apple cider vinegar that I use as a toner or on top of a toner.</li>
            <li>(Pssst, I LOVE toner.</li>
            <li>So uh some how I need to write more about this product.</li>

            <li>The customer service was also top notch.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that we bought it</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s great and it is very functional.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly for my essential oils and water mixture.</li>
            <li>What more can be said.</li>
            <li>like it and will probably purchase more if i see them in a store somewhere</li>
            <li>I just wished the packaging would have been better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li>At 2.5 ounces, it was within the 3.4-ounce limit and held more product than I needed for a week away from home.</li>
            <li>Sprays well and very useful!</li>
            <li>Nice fine mist, but not too fine, so that product flies away.</li>
            <li>so I am happy to say that this misting bottle arrived before the due date and in good order.  </li>
            <li>Eventually I learned that the best material is clean cotton - such as a handkerchief.  </li>
            <li>It was the right size that I was hoping for and I love how there&#x27;s a cap for it!</li>
            <li>A great little bottle that creates a good mist.</li>
            <li>other words: perfect.</li>
            <li>They sprayed easily.</li>
            <li>They clog easily and fall apart - trust me</li>

            <li>This bottle fit the bill.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all, this bottle is not that cheap, squishy plastic - it is firm - which is perfect for my use.  </li>

            <li>As a bonus on a hot day I can spray my face slightly to cool myself.  </li>
            <li>and I love natural skin care</li>
            <li>The plastic is nice and sturdy, not at all flimsy or likely to &amp;#34;collapse&amp;#34; from suction like some bottles do.</li>
            <li>Great for having water spray able to wet down my kids hair for easy brushing and styling.</li>

            <li>Great for when you need to apply small amounts.</li>
            <li>but I believe it was worth it as I have never purchased a spray bottle that had such a fine mist!</li>
            <li>Right size and looked exactly like the picture.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m using it for rubbing alcohol for a first aid kit.  </li>
            <li>The spray bottle is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>but I was okay with the wait and purchased a second one.  </li>
            <li>Only would spray once, after that i would have to pull up the top to keep spraying.</li>
            <li>keep the one with water in my purse and use it to refreshen my face in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li>Compared to what exactly?</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>

            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>She knew exactly what I was talking about and agreed it seemed like what I wanted.&lt;br</li>

            <li>gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>so it may be needed to be filled frequently.</li>
            <li>So since this thing sprays a mist, I put butter in it, melt it by placing in a hot cup of water then spray</li>
            <li>/&gt;It broke within the first 24 hours of using it.</li>
            <li>These days, you never know if what you buy is going to work well or be a cheap product only worthy of a refund.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality and a very strong plastic despite its low cost.</li>
            <li>Little bottle works perfectly as could be expected.</li>
            <li>This is a nice size, a little on the small side but holds more than many other cosmetic or perfume containers, and it creates a nice mist.  </li>
            <li>many years I have experienced the problem of dirty eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li>Some spray bottles break easily, but I can tell from this one that it will last.</li>
            <li>I already use a large plant sprayer for keeping her off the counter and</li>
            <li>Bottle is a convenient pocket size, and with a nice tight cap to help prevent leaks in a bag or travel kit.</li>
            <li>Needed a fine mist spray bottle for a makeup sealer I purchased that was in a bigger bottle without a pump.</li>
            <li>Handy little gizmo.</li>
            <li>This is a surprisingly nice little travel bottle.  </li>
            <li>Handy little bottles.</li>
            <li>Nice little spray bottle.</li>
            <li>These are great little bottles for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li>the price of one expensive bottle of cologne or perfume you can get a shelf full of essential oils and a 12-pack of these spray bottles - so you can experiment with emphasizing different scents and find a unique blend that&#x27;s perfect for you.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really just a spray</li>
            <li>The end of the feeder tube is not straight cut, so no matter where it is positioned it should always be able to pick up fluid.&lt;br</li>
            <li>An inexpensive product that meets my needs very well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to use my vermouth mister instead which really pissed me off.</li>
            <li>Not like a squirt where you get too much product in one spot.  </li>
            <li>so much I&#x27;m using it now that I&#x27;m home too.</li>
            <li>It sprays very well.</li>
            <li>Filled 2 of them, stored the rest for later use.</li>
            <li>This spray bottle worked really well.  </li>
            <li>Everything came just as described.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the deal and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Better than expected!</li>
            <li>Good sprayer but VERY SMALL.  </li>
            <li>Though made of plastic, this bottle has a very high tolerance level to puncturing and high pressure.</li>
            <li>It was a little too soft to be effective for that purpose, but that wasn&#x27;t my problem with</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be less pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Nice little spray bottle, I am not sure what most people would use it for, but I had 2 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The spray is very fine and the small bottle doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my table.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally I thought of getting a clean spray bottle so that I could carry a small amount of water with me and spray my glasses whenever I wished to clean them.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND, WOULD BUY AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A cute little spray bottle.</li>
            <li>small, light weight, clear, looks clean and sleek.</li>
            <li>The feeder tube extends all the way to the bottom of the bottle and naturally sits at the very edge.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>It sprays a fine mist instead of a straight stream and it comes with a little cap which is not shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>Finally, the price was right.</li>
            <li>The 2.5 ounce size is small enough to avoid being a burden and large enough to hold sufficient water to clean my glasses for more than a week.  </li>
            <li>I will get the 3 pack next time for a $1 more, it was not listed when I ordered a few days ago and use those for the hot summer months for cooling.  </li>
            <li>This is a very useful product, and inexpensive enough that I can order several as backup in case I must replace the bottle.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised of the quality of the bottles.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed in a tiny spray bottle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little plastic bottle with a fine mist sprayer.  </li>
            <li>this little bottle does what it is supposed to do, and its cheap.</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li>First off I waited a month for this spray bottle, which is too long.  </li>
            <li>Used this for Skin So Soft as bug spray.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural girl</li>
            <li>the oils so far.</li>
            <li>So, far it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leak, but it may drip a tiny bit from where liquid mists out if I spray too much too fast but nowhere near enough to be a problem.</li>
            <li>I like this bottle so much that I ordered this (the second one) just in case I needed it.</li>
            <li>so far it hasn&#x27;t missed a spritz.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a true &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; bottle and not one that just comes out as a single solid shot</li>
            <li>I used this to put a little bit of cleaner and water in it so that I can clean my yoga mat on the go...</li>
            <li>I put a little windex in it and keep it by my pc, use it once in a while to clean my screen or the one on my phone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted something with a fine mist like this one promised, but when I gave it a shot with the sealing spray it came out in three small, concentrated areas.</li>
            <li>The ounces listed on the item were slightly higher than the actual bottle (I think 3 oz) when it is actually 2.5?  </li>
            <li>And, these little mist bottles do a terrific job of misting lightly, too.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes because of the many positive reviews but the sprayer is very difficult to press down and the spray comes out in a heavy spurt, not producing &amp;#34;fine mist&amp;#34; of any kind.</li>
            <li>The hard plastic cap is a great assist by the manufacturer, no more squirts at those inappropriate moments!</li>
            <li>The atomizer produces a true mist, as fine as the atomizers on expensive cologne, as long as you don&#x27;t abuse it by putting viscous or particulate matter through it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>realize this is a lot to say about such a small, cheap item.  </li>
            <li>So inexpensive and for 40 bottles, these suckers aren&#x27;t cheap enough to die anytime soon.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, a little bottle of windex in you purse, Put rubbing alcohol in it and place in a first aid kit, liquid seasonings for your food to spray on a salad or</li>
            <li>The pump bottle found in your average travel kit doesn&#x27;t really mist, so much as shoot out a bit fluid and then drips a  bit down the bottle.</li>
            <li>I found cobalt tinted spray bottles at Whole Foods for less</li>
            <li>Sprays extremely fine mist, is cheap, small, and I haven&#x27;t broken it!</li>
            <li>I am using a body spray in it, not technically a &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; and certainly nothing heavy or oil based.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to aim where you&#x27;re spraying at, but otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to aim where you&#x27;re spraying at, but otherwise, it&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li> However, this bottle does a nice job misting water.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these to make my own air fresheners.  </li>
            <li> I use it for my own tablet/phone/eyeglass cleaning mix (50/50 water &amp; rubbing alcohol) that saves me a bundle.</li>

            <li> I put my lavender oil, sea salt, and warm water mixture together and proceeded to spray.</li>
            <li> yet, and the spray it puts out is a nice even Mist, not a spray.  </li>
            <li> bet if you have one or two, you would come up with a handy use for them.</li>
            <li> i use it for my rose water face mist.</li>
            <li> Its fits nicely in your purse or over-night bag as well.</li>
            <li> I like doing my own nails at home</li>
            <li> The bottles themselves are very sturdy and are the perfect size!</li>
            <li> Good price, doesn&#x27;t leak, and has a nicely even and fine spray.</li>
            <li> I use this bottle to spray a mist of aftershave on my clothes for a nice scent without getting overbearing... like a dryer sheet, but more guy-like.  </li>
            <li> Very fine mist.</li>
            <li> Each press gives you a generous \\&quot;spritz\\&quot; of very fine mist.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has a very fine mist, finer then I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> The spray is a very fine mist as described and seems like it will hold up for quite a while.</li>
            <li> but no, they all seem to produce a very fine mist.  </li>
            <li> the mist is very fine</li>
            <li> The bottle produces a very fine mist that disperses well.</li>
            <li> Very fine mist.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a nice size and is easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> It gives me nice control over the amount because it sprays a fine mist.</li>
            <li> This bottle creates a nice, fine mist.</li>
            <li> a nice fine mist.  </li>
            <li> It puts out a fine mist and the alcohol mists onto my skin and evaporates rapidly, providing a nice, cooling sensation.  </li>
            <li> Sprayer makes a nice fine mist but this thing leaks from sprayer part every time I shake the bottle (the liquid I keep in the bottle needs to be shaken before each use.)</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve since ordered and received two more of these.  </li>
            <li> Thought I was getting more than just one spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Nice light spray for making bath bombs.</li>
            <li> You have better control using this spray bottle</li>
            <li> Worked well and packaged well :)</li>
            <li> I put aloe vera juice in most of them and would spray them over my sun burns.</li>
            <li> should, unlike most of the ornate minsters.</li>
            <li> Have ordered some more for my friends.</li>
            <li> I have to type twelve more words for this review to count.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell gross like some plastic products tend to, and the spray comes out perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have another with apple cider vinegar that I use as a toner or on top of a toner.</li>
            <li> (Pssst, I LOVE toner.</li>
            <li> So uh some how I need to write more about this product.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic for cleaning my glasses and also my nav screen in my car!</li>
            <li> The customer service was also top notch.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that we bought it</li>
            <li> I mostly use this product to store my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and it is very functional.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly for my essential oils and water mixture.</li>
            <li> What more can be said.</li>
            <li> like it and will probably purchase more if i see them in a store somewhere</li>
            <li> I just wished the packaging would have been better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,</li>
            <li> At 2.5 ounces, it was within the 3.4-ounce limit and held more product than I needed for a week away from home.</li>
            <li> Sprays well and very useful!</li>
            <li> Nice fine mist, but not too fine, so that product flies away.</li>
            <li> so I am happy to say that this misting bottle arrived before the due date and in good order.  </li>
            <li> Eventually I learned that the best material is clean cotton - such as a handkerchief.  </li>
            <li> It was the right size that I was hoping for and I love how there&#x27;s a cap for it!</li>
            <li> A great little bottle that creates a good mist.</li>
            <li> other words: perfect.</li>
            <li> They sprayed easily.</li>
            <li> They clog easily and fall apart - trust me</li>
            <li> Sturdy bottle and easy working sprayer.</li>

            <li> Strong spring also.</li>

            <li> fine mist.</li>
            <li> The spray is extremely fine.</li>
            <li> but it works just fine.</li>

            <li> and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li> This little bottle sprays a fine mist which is perfect for eye glasses cleaning solution.</li>
            <li> Excellent little bottle.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this little bottle.</li>
            <li> I find that the mist is fine enough for my purpose and am quite happy with this.</li>
            <li> For my purposes - using with plain water, the bottle works perfectly - producing a fine spritz.  </li>
            <li> I dont think they are BPA free though</li>
            <li> Its fantastic.</li>
            <li> My friend filled them all with water</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s great for homemade fragrance, facial toners, etc.</li>
            <li> the cap and the pump stay securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so I bought 2 of these bottles and filled them with cuticle remover and cuticle tint.</li>
            <li> This bottle fit the bill.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all, this bottle is not that cheap, squishy plastic - it is firm - which is perfect for my use.  </li>
            <li> The bottle produces a very fine mist as a spray - exactly what I needed for my shirt bleaching projects.</li>
            <li> The bottle produces a very fine mist as spray, exactly what I needed for my shirt for my shirt bleaching.</li>
            <li> Very nice for facial spray .</li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive, but it&#x27;s a great mister.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li> I like to keep one bottle filled with cool water and another with apple cider</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> What I purchased was exactly what I was looking for, glad I purchased it here.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Ok so hot water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so any way, the bottle is plastic but feels good in the hand and solid, not think cheap stuff, sprayer feels smooth, no clicking or&lt;br /&gt;sticking</li>
            <li> pump has a nice action and sprays a fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it with windex in my motorcycle, to clean off my helmet shield.</li>
            <li> I use it here where it is hot and humid to refresh my skin and find that this little spray bottle is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I was worries it would be cheap and not work, but I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy more of these for travel.</li>
            <li> Definitely a quality product for a fair price.</li>
            <li> Above and beyond good customer service deserves all the praise it can get these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t you buy products in bottles with such a good mechanism?</li>
            <li> I used these fine mist spray bottles on my recent trip to UK and liked how the bottles sprayed.</li>
            <li> It produces a fine mist, exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> to make sure the smaller size was OK.  </li>
            <li> I can spray it fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered this bottle instead of hoping to find a decent quality alternative at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> This bottle is exactly what I was hoping it would be--it sprays a very fine mist and works very well.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a fine mist, no big drops, and is perfect for keeping acrylic artist paint wet on a glass pallet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super cheap, and does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> williams lectric shave lotion with little waste.&lt;br /&gt;Works too good IMH as the fine mist can irritate eyes and nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really does spray fine mist.</li>
            <li> These little bottles are great and do the job well.  </li>
            <li> Great little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just a little while, but it&#x27;s been working great.</li>
            <li> Great little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this little bottle, I bought the rose water from amazon as well</li>
            <li> The sprayers don&#x27;t get clogged and it&#x27;s very easy to push the top down when you want to mist the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> As a bonus on a hot day I can spray my face slightly to cool myself.  </li>
            <li> and I love natural skin care</li>
            <li> The plastic is nice and sturdy, not at all flimsy or likely to &amp;#34;collapse&amp;#34; from suction like some bottles do.</li>
            <li> Great for having water spray able to wet down my kids hair for easy brushing and styling.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for any purpose that requires a fine spray.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend for any purpose that requires a fine spray.</li>
            <li> Funny that this little bottle has a dozen great reviews...</li>
            <li> I use that for deodorant and it has just the right amount of spray to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Right size to carry.</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle is the right size for storing water.</li>
            <li> I put skin so soft oil in this and it sprayed great all summer long to keep Mosquitos away!</li>
            <li> Great, small spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Great for when you need to apply small amounts.</li>
            <li> but I believe it was worth it as I have never purchased a spray bottle that had such a fine mist!</li>
            <li> Right size and looked exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li> If you want this item quickly, make sure you check how long they say it&#x27;s going to take it to arrive before ordering it.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s a clear plastic bottle with a spray cap that lets you spray a fine mist onto what ever you want to use it for.</li>
            <li> This is a good little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> This bottle is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it for rubbing alcohol for a first aid kit.  </li>
            <li> The spray bottle is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> but I was okay with the wait and purchased a second one.  </li>
            <li> Only would spray once, after that i would have to pull up the top to keep spraying.</li>
            <li> keep the one with water in my purse and use it to refreshen my face in the hot, humid weather.</li>
            <li> Compared to what exactly?</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Seems to be very durable not sure how it would hold up to anything acidic but it works great for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> She knew exactly what I was talking about and agreed it seemed like what I wanted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not taking any chances  ; )</li>
            <li> Works exactly like I expected,&lt;br /&gt;produces</li>
            <li> gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> so it may be needed to be filled frequently.</li>
            <li> So since this thing sprays a mist, I put butter in it, melt it by placing in a hot cup of water then spray</li>
            <li> /&gt;It broke within the first 24 hours of using it.</li>
            <li> These days, you never know if what you buy is going to work well or be a cheap product only worthy of a refund.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality and a very strong plastic despite its low cost.</li>
            <li> Little bottle works perfectly as could be expected.</li>
            <li> This is a nice size, a little on the small side but holds more than many other cosmetic or perfume containers, and it creates a nice mist.  </li>
            <li> many years I have experienced the problem of dirty eyeglasses.  </li>
            <li> Some spray bottles break easily, but I can tell from this one that it will last.</li>
            <li> I already use a large plant sprayer for keeping her off the counter and</li>
            <li> Bottle is a convenient pocket size, and with a nice tight cap to help prevent leaks in a bag or travel kit.</li>
            <li> Needed a fine mist spray bottle for a makeup sealer I purchased that was in a bigger bottle without a pump.</li>
            <li> Handy little gizmo.</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly nice little travel bottle.  </li>
            <li> Handy little bottles.</li>
            <li> Nice little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> These are great little bottles for multiple purposes.</li>
            <li> the price of one expensive bottle of cologne or perfume you can get a shelf full of essential oils and a 12-pack of these spray bottles - so you can experiment with emphasizing different scents and find a unique blend that&#x27;s perfect for you.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really just a spray</li>
            <li> The end of the feeder tube is not straight cut, so no matter where it is positioned it should always be able to pick up fluid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> An inexpensive product that meets my needs very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to use my vermouth mister instead which really pissed me off.</li>
            <li> Not like a squirt where you get too much product in one spot.  </li>
            <li> so much I&#x27;m using it now that I&#x27;m home too.</li>
            <li> It sprays very well.</li>
            <li> Filled 2 of them, stored the rest for later use.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle worked really well.  </li>
            <li> Everything came just as described.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the deal and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> Better than expected!</li>
            <li> Good sprayer but VERY SMALL.  </li>
            <li> Though made of plastic, this bottle has a very high tolerance level to puncturing and high pressure.</li>
            <li> It was a little too soft to be effective for that purpose, but that wasn&#x27;t my problem with</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be less pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Nice little spray bottle, I am not sure what most people would use it for, but I had 2 uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray is very fine and the small bottle doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my table.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Finally I thought of getting a clean spray bottle so that I could carry a small amount of water with me and spray my glasses whenever I wished to clean them.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND, WOULD BUY AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A cute little spray bottle.</li>
            <li> small, light weight, clear, looks clean and sleek.</li>
            <li> The feeder tube extends all the way to the bottom of the bottle and naturally sits at the very edge.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> It sprays a fine mist instead of a straight stream and it comes with a little cap which is not shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> Finally, the price was right.</li>
            <li> The 2.5 ounce size is small enough to avoid being a burden and large enough to hold sufficient water to clean my glasses for more than a week.  </li>
            <li> I will get the 3 pack next time for a $1 more, it was not listed when I ordered a few days ago and use those for the hot summer months for cooling.  </li>
            <li> This is a very useful product, and inexpensive enough that I can order several as backup in case I must replace the bottle.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised of the quality of the bottles.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed in a tiny spray bottle!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little plastic bottle with a fine mist sprayer.  </li>
            <li> this little bottle does what it is supposed to do, and its cheap.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> First off I waited a month for this spray bottle, which is too long.  </li>
            <li> Used this for Skin So Soft as bug spray.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural girl</li>
            <li> the oils so far.</li>
            <li> So, far it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leak, but it may drip a tiny bit from where liquid mists out if I spray too much too fast but nowhere near enough to be a problem.</li>
            <li> I like this bottle so much that I ordered this (the second one) just in case I needed it.</li>
            <li> so far it hasn&#x27;t missed a spritz.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a true &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; bottle and not one that just comes out as a single solid shot</li>
            <li> I used this to put a little bit of cleaner and water in it so that I can clean my yoga mat on the go...</li>
            <li> I put a little windex in it and keep it by my pc, use it once in a while to clean my screen or the one on my phone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted something with a fine mist like this one promised, but when I gave it a shot with the sealing spray it came out in three small, concentrated areas.</li>
            <li> The ounces listed on the item were slightly higher than the actual bottle (I think 3 oz) when it is actually 2.5?  </li>
            <li> And, these little mist bottles do a terrific job of misting lightly, too.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes because of the many positive reviews but the sprayer is very difficult to press down and the spray comes out in a heavy spurt, not producing &amp;#34;fine mist&amp;#34; of any kind.</li>
            <li> The hard plastic cap is a great assist by the manufacturer, no more squirts at those inappropriate moments!</li>
            <li> The atomizer produces a true mist, as fine as the atomizers on expensive cologne, as long as you don&#x27;t abuse it by putting viscous or particulate matter through it.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> realize this is a lot to say about such a small, cheap item.  </li>
            <li> So inexpensive and for 40 bottles, these suckers aren&#x27;t cheap enough to die anytime soon.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, a little bottle of windex in you purse, Put rubbing alcohol in it and place in a first aid kit, liquid seasonings for your food to spray on a salad or</li>
            <li> The pump bottle found in your average travel kit doesn&#x27;t really mist, so much as shoot out a bit fluid and then drips a  bit down the bottle.</li>
            <li> I found cobalt tinted spray bottles at Whole Foods for less</li>
            <li> Sprays extremely fine mist, is cheap, small, and I haven&#x27;t broken it!</li>
            <li> I am using a body spray in it, not technically a &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; and certainly nothing heavy or oil based.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to aim where you&#x27;re spraying at, but otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to aim where you&#x27;re spraying at, but otherwise, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> but THIS is a decent little bottle.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34;produced by this bottle was worse than the bottle I originally had.</li>
            <li> However,  haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine its ability to withstand the chemicals of the cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li> The tube inside is long enough that you can get every last drop.</li>
            <li> I also like that it is small, does not take much room on your desk and you can put it in the purse.</li>
            <li> I was surprised and disappointed with how long it took for them to deliver it, but that&#x27;s partially my own fault for not paying attention to the delivery date (which was over a month after I ordered it).</li>
            <li> It is definitely a major improvement over the little plastic travel dispensers sold in drugstores and the big box stores.</li>
            <li> This little guy works like you&#x27;d imagine and features an incredibly clear 360 degree viewing chamber</li>
            <li> , let dry -- don&#x27;t dry with towel -- then immediately moisturize with moisturizer mixed with a dab of coconut</li>
            <li> The atomizer head can be rotated independently of the feeder tube, so no matter whether you want to spray upwards or downwards, and no matter how little fluid is left, that can be arranged.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; is plenty long and can be cut to your liking.</li>
            <li> The inner straw (which feeds the liquid to the head/pump-nozzle) reaches all the way down, which means you don&#x27;t have to worry about constantly keeping the thing half-full.</li>
            <li> Works right out of the box, no hassles, small enough for travel but not so small that you can&#x27;t use it on a day to day basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for a rosewater toner.. works fine as expected but a bit expensive for something that comes empty.</li>
            <li> I was looking quite a while online for a small, clear spray bottle to use to spray water on my cat to keep her from biting/clawing me.  </li>
            <li> The first one is used to thin my colorstay makeup</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s made of a fairly hard thought not brittle very clear plastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because I only like to take carry on bags when flying, I needed a small enough spray bottle to take my hair products in.  </li>
            <li> Size-wise, the container is a little bigger than one of those 5-hour energy drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The stopped doesn&#x27;t stick or squeak and the bottle did not arrive crushed in the mail.</li>
            <li> I left one on it&#x27;s side for a few weeks and it didn&#x27;t leak at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put a few drops of essential oil in one of these sprayers and then fill with tap water.  </li>
            <li> I use this to spray water on my acrylic paints before closing the lid on my wet paint pallet.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Took over a month to get here, but works as expected.</li>
            <li> On time and just as expected.</li>
            <li> and just wet.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s kind of annoying to spray yourself in the face with liquids.</li>
            <li> , that is a half ounce less than a third of a cup.  </li>
            <li> But I found it inconvenient to run to the sink anytime I wished to clean my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair product (bodifier spray, if you&#x27;re curious) doesn&#x27;t come in small enough size to get through airport security checks, so I needed a  travel-sized spray bottle.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the bottle is dimpled, so when there&#x27;s very little fluid, it flows to the edge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other times I would breathe on the lens and wipe them with a cloth.  </li>
            <li> and the other will be to mist my house plants.  </li>
            <li> Not a pretty thing, but</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be putting anything else in it, so can&#x27;t judge how it would work for any other liquid.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would purchase again, next time I will just pick up one at Target.</li>
            <li> It sprays a fine mist, is a convenient portable size, has a cap so the contents don&#x27;t accidentally get pumped out into the rest of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;The pump springs back into place well and doesn&#x27;t squeak or anything annoying like that either.  </li>
            <li> For putting just a little cleaning fluid on a small area of a dirty pistol, this is right on the money!  </li>
            <li> I have been needing a small spray bottle for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It still sucks in the mixture but pressing the button makes it run out the opposite way.</li>
            <li> At this price I expected to get a few duds</li>
            <li> Took a month and a half to arrive and leaks everywhere.</li>
            <li> Yep,  I have an air popper for my popcorn, but it is so bland</li>
            <li> sends four to five forceful jets of liquid into my face causing a splattering drippy mess.</li>
            <li> Lid seals tight and the oil does not leak out.</li>
            <li> But my glasses were never really clean and my vision suffered.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> Leaks a little bit.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get to me</li>
            <li> it was past due.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t spray out unevenly, or too heavy.</li>
            <li> but it is not a fine mist.</li>
            <li> pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Not much more to say,</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great for traveling; I put hair spray in it and it works fine. I find the size fits well in my travel case. Handy little gizmo.</li>
            <li> It took a long time to arrive, but it&#x27;s a great mister.</li>
            <li> fine mist. Very nice for facial spray .</li>
            <li> U use this container-slash-sprayer for cuticle removers for easier application and it functions well. No leaks, very easy to wist cap and the sprayer itself sprays perfectly well.</li>
            <li> Took a month and a half to arrive and leaks everywhere.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle is great for a variety of uses.  I&#x27;ve found it good for mixing your own scents.  It sprays well and the tip doesn&#x27;t clog.</li>
            <li> First off I waited a month for this spray bottle, which is too long.  I bought it to spray CLP, which is a gun cleaner/lubricant and it doesn&#x27;t work, the fluid comes out in a stream not a mist.  However, this bottle does a nice job misting water.</li>
            <li> Using it to keep my Gardenia bonsai moist and humid. Little bottle works perfectly as could be expected. The stopped doesn&#x27;t stick or squeak and the bottle did not arrive crushed in the mail.</li>
            <li> This bottle is exactly what I needed.  I&#x27;m using it for rubbing alcohol for a first aid kit.  It sprays a fine mist, is a convenient portable size, has a cap so the contents don&#x27;t accidentally get pumped out into the rest of the kit.&lt;br /&gt;The pump springs back into place well and doesn&#x27;t squeak or anything annoying like that either.  I left one on it&#x27;s side for a few weeks and it didn&#x27;t leak at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;edit - I&#x27;ve since ordered and received two more of these.  They work just as well as the original one I got, so out of the 3 I have received - they&#x27;re all perfectly functioning.&gt;</li>
            <li> Used this for Skin So Soft as bug spray.  Perfect travel size for airport security. Sprayer worked great. Definitely a good purchase and would buy again.</li>
            <li> My body spray / perfume broke and I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I wanted an inexpensive container to allow me to keep using the fragrance.  This is a nice size, a little on the small side but holds more than many other cosmetic or perfume containers, and it creates a nice mist.  I am using a body spray in it, not technically a &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; and certainly nothing heavy or oil based.  It gives me nice control over the amount because it sprays a fine mist.</li>
            <li> The bottle produces a very fine mist as a spray - exactly what I needed for my shirt bleaching projects. Would highly recommend for any purpose that requires a fine spray. The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to aim where you&#x27;re spraying at, but otherwise it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Great, small spray bottle. I&#x27;m using it in my go bag for hydrogen peroxide and it feeds flawlessly. The cap covering the sprayer stays in place even if you hold it by the cap.</li>
            <li> Excellent little bottle. Very fine mist. I use it for water to help moisturize my face when needed. I also like that it is small, does not take much room on your desk and you can put it in the purse.</li>
            <li> These are great little bottles for multiple purposes. I dont think they are BPA free though so that is something to consider.</li>
            <li> Leaks a little bit. Thought I was getting more than just one spray bottle.</li>
            <li> Needed a fine mist spray bottle for a makeup sealer I purchased that was in a bigger bottle without a pump. The spray is extremely fine. Its fantastic. Tad bit expensive for a spray bottle [thus 4 stars], but I believe it was worth it as I have never purchased a spray bottle that had such a fine mist! It does come with a cap, bottle seems durable [not cheap-y], and the &amp;#34;sucker up tube thing&amp;#34; goes all the way to the bottom. Very well made.</li>
            <li> I got this to put rubbing alcohol in.  I use that for deodorant and it has just the right amount of spray to do the job.  It&#x27;s a little plastic bottle with a fine mist sprayer.  Not much more to say, but it works just fine.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is exactly what I wanted. It&#x27;s high quality and a very strong plastic despite its low cost. I was surprised and disappointed with how long it took for them to deliver it, but that&#x27;s partially my own fault for not paying attention to the delivery date (which was over a month after I ordered it). If you want this item quickly, make sure you check how long they say it&#x27;s going to take it to arrive before ordering it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bottle that has a spray cap that works but it is not a fine mist. I wanted it for misting toner on my face but it&#x27;s really just a spray and it&#x27;s kind of annoying to spray yourself in the face with liquids. Buy if you want a small spray bottle but not if you&#x27;re looking to &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; anything.</li>
            <li> Good spraying pattern. Doesn&#x27;t seem to leak. Comes with a plastic cap. Only had it for a week, time will tell if it holds up.</li>
            <li> Broke after one use.  Literally.  Zero stars if I could</li>
            <li> .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For many years I have experienced the problem of dirty eyeglasses.  Sometimes I would take a tissue and wipe the lens.  Other times I would breathe on the lens and wipe them with a cloth.  Eventually I learned that the best material is clean cotton - such as a handkerchief.  But my glasses were never really clean and my vision suffered.&lt;br /&gt;Then I received some advice from my youngest son, who worked in an optometrist business.  He told me that my best solution is a bit of cool water and a clean smooth cloth.  But I found it inconvenient to run to the sink anytime I wished to clean my glasses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally I thought of getting a clean spray bottle so that I could carry a small amount of water with me and spray my glasses whenever I wished to clean them.  The idea works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the Fantasea Fine Mist Spray Bottle.  The 2.5 ounce size is small enough to avoid being a burden and large enough to hold sufficient water to clean my glasses for more than a week.  As a bonus on a hot day I can spray my face slightly to cool myself.  This is a very useful product, and inexpensive enough that I can order several as backup in case I must replace the bottle.</li>
            <li> Bottle is a convenient pocket size, and with a nice tight cap to help prevent leaks in a bag or travel kit. Each press gives you a generous \\&quot;spritz\\&quot; of very fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these bottles for use as part of a home-brew eyeglass-cleaning solution, along with:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00F462T3Q Kimtech Science KimWipes Delicate Task Wipers 1-ply 280 count]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B008UH4AI8 MG Chemicals 824 99.9% Isopropyl Alcohol Liquid Cleaner]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fill each bottle with 1/2 alcohol, 1/2 filtered water, and a drop or two of dish soap. I am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fine mist spray bottle to put my toner in, and this turned out to be perfect! it&#x27;s within the TSA liquid limit too, so you can take it onto a plane. yay!</li>
            <li> I purchased two of these to make my own air fresheners.  I put a few drops of essential oil in one of these sprayers and then fill with tap water.  Lovely!  And, these little mist bottles do a terrific job of misting lightly, too.  The sprayers don&#x27;t get clogged and it&#x27;s very easy to push the top down when you want to mist the fragrance.  Very good quality.</li>
            <li> GOT WHAT I PAID FOR. WORKS GOOD FOR MIXERS LIKE MYSELF.</li>
            <li> Nice light spray for making bath bombs. You have better control using this spray bottle so you don&#x27;t overwater the project.</li>
            <li> Some of the great features of this bottle:&lt;br /&gt;* The bottom of the bottle is dimpled, so when there&#x27;s very little fluid, it flows to the edge.&lt;br /&gt;* The feeder tube extends all the way to the bottom of the bottle and naturally sits at the very edge.&lt;br /&gt;* The end of the feeder tube is not straight cut, so no matter where it is positioned it should always be able to pick up fluid.&lt;br /&gt;* The atomizer head can be rotated independently of the feeder tube, so no matter whether you want to spray upwards or downwards, and no matter how little fluid is left, that can be arranged.&lt;br /&gt;* The atomizer produces a true mist, as fine as the atomizers on expensive cologne, as long as you don&#x27;t abuse it by putting viscous or particulate matter through it.&lt;br /&gt;For the price of one expensive bottle of cologne or perfume you can get a shelf full of essential oils and a 12-pack of these spray bottles - so you can experiment with emphasizing different scents and find a unique blend that&#x27;s perfect for you. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Worked well and packaged well :)</li>
            <li> The bottle produces a very fine mist as spray, exactly what I needed for my shirt for my shirt bleaching. Would highly recommend for any purpose that requires a fine spray. The only downside is that it&#x27;s a little difficult to aim where you&#x27;re spraying at, but otherwise, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> it was just what I was looking for. It sprays a fine mist instead of a straight stream and it comes with a little cap which is not shown in the picture. Perfect for your purse or makeup bag.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a true &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34; bottle and not one that just comes out as a single solid shot and I found it!  It took a little while to get to me but I was okay with the wait and purchased a second one.  I&#x27;m a natural girl and so it&#x27;s perfect to carry around in my purse to rehydrate my hair... and the other will be to mist my house plants.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It took ages to get to me so I was expecting them to never come but the did and it was a good time. My friend filled them all with water so I got rid of them because I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to try and fix what she did. I put aloe vera juice in most of them and would spray them over my sun burns. aI experienced no problems with the way they functioned.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up well over the last year.</li>
            <li> Works. Not a pretty thing, but it works like a mistie atomizer should, unlike most of the ornate minsters. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> My cologne bottle atomizer stopped working so I used this, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I bought two of these to use with Poo-pourri spray.  They saved me a lot of money, because I could buy the poo-pourri in the 16 oz. refill size.  They&#x27;re small, discreet, and they work well with the poo-pourri product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for cleaning my glasses.  This has a very fine mist, finer then I was expecting.  I am just using distilled water and all is good.  I will get the 3 pack next time for a $1 more, it was not listed when I ordered a few days ago and use those for the hot summer months for cooling.  Great very fine mister bottle.</li>
            <li> I have a detangler that I like to use daily and needed a spray bottle for travel to keep within TSA requirements.  This bottle did the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this--for my makeup brush cleaning solution--for a year now, and haven&#x27;t had any issues with its effectiveness. I use it relatively often, so that&#x27;s saying something! The inner straw (which feeds the liquid to the head/pump-nozzle) reaches all the way down, which means you don&#x27;t have to worry about constantly keeping the thing half-full.</li>
            <li> Works great. Even spray. Right size to carry. Excellent product. Have ordered some more for my friends. They loved it too!!</li>
            <li> Took 24 days to arrive. But it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Only would spray once, after that i would have to pull up the top to keep spraying. didnt like it, maybe i got a defected one? pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I use these to mix my own air fresheners out of scented oils and they work perfectly...no clogs and no drips!</li>
            <li> It works and hasn&#x27;t broken after two years. I have to type twelve more words for this review to count.</li>
            <li> its a spray bottle but you pay for what you get</li>
            <li> A great little bottle that creates a good mist. I use it for my own tablet/phone/eyeglass cleaning mix (50/50 water &amp; rubbing alcohol) that saves me a bundle.</li>
            <li> This really does spray fine mist. Currently using this for my alcohol. Though made of plastic, this bottle has a very high tolerance level to puncturing and high pressure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to keep in my office to water my air plants. I was worries it would be cheap and not work, but I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and am very pleased with it. It didn&#x27;t smell gross like some plastic products tend to, and the spray comes out perfectly. I would absolutely buy more of these for travel.</li>
            <li> Perfect size and quality for me. I buy my hairspray buy the liter, so I often need extra spray bottles. These are very nice quality, they also come with a plastic cover over the spray nozzle. Great buy!</li>
            <li> These days, you never know if what you buy is going to work well or be a cheap product only worthy of a refund.  These little bottles are great and do the job well.  I bought a couple to put aftershave in i.e. Aqua Velva.  I use this bottle to spray a mist of aftershave on my clothes for a nice scent without getting overbearing... like a dryer sheet, but more guy-like.  The spray is a very fine mist as described and seems like it will hold up for quite a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold alcohol while doing gel polish on my nails.  It sprays perfect.  The perfect size for a strong solution.  I&#x27;m very happy that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Took 6 weeks to get here from China but I&#x27;m excited.</li>
            <li> I have various uses for these bottles.  I like to keep one bottle filled with cool water and another with apple cider vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the one with water in my purse and use it to refreshen my face in the hot, humid weather. It&#x27;s a life save!  I keep another in my vanity with water and use for multi purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I have another with apple cider vinegar that I use as a toner or on top of a toner. (Pssst, I LOVE toner.) I immediately get out of the shower, use my Loreal toner, then apple cider vinegar spray, let dry -- don&#x27;t dry with towel -- then immediately moisturize with moisturizer mixed with a dab of coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a miracle combo for my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this so that I could put hairspray in it and take it through TSA when traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does the trick.  Has a great spray, and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it plugging up or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really glad I got it!</li>
            <li> It...is a spray bottle. And it sprays liquids. So uh some how I need to write more about this product. DONE!</li>
            <li> At this price I expected to get a few duds but no, they all seem to produce a very fine mist.  Strong spring also.</li>
            <li> Better than expected! I bought this to put Ultra-Pure valve oil into for use on my trumpet. I decided to break away from the drop method and try  spraying it on. The mist is perfect and it doesn&#x27;t drip out. It has a good pattern, not all concentrated in one spot. Perfect for what I wanted to use it for. Lid seals tight and the oil does not leak out. Very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Great squirt bottle.  Not flimsy and doesn&#x27;t clog.  Definitely a quality product for a fair price.</li>
            <li> Great little spray bottle. Really fine mist and quality product. Do a great job. My bet is You will like these.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I had high hopes because of the many positive reviews but the sprayer is very difficult to press down and the spray comes out in a heavy spurt, not producing &amp;#34;fine mist&amp;#34; of any kind. I tried using it with a makeup setting solution and it was like I was putting a garden hose to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for just a little while, but it&#x27;s been working great. It&#x27;s a nice size and is easy to travel with. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with leaking. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed in a tiny spray bottle! Good price, doesn&#x27;t leak, and has a nicely even and fine spray. I use it for a diluted tea tree oil mixture that I spray on everything--cuts, bug bites, etc.</li>
            <li> I use this for organic products for my home. I was very surprised of the quality of the bottles. They sprayed easily.</li>
            <li> I used these fine mist spray bottles on my recent trip to UK and liked how the bottles sprayed.</li>
            <li> I use this to spray water on my acrylic paints before closing the lid on my wet paint pallet. The spray is very fine and the small bottle doesn&#x27;t take up much room on my table. An inexpensive product that meets my needs very well.</li>
            <li> Fine mist? Compared to what exactly? I bought this for my makeup finishing mist and each pump of the nozzle sends four to five forceful jets of liquid into my face causing a splattering drippy mess. I couldn&#x27;t be less pleased with this purchase. I&#x27;ve had to use my vermouth mister instead which really pissed me off.</li>
            <li> Item just as described and works great!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> the mist is very fine it works great for the earring cleaning solution we use for my girlfriend&#x27;s daughter. Seems to be very durable not sure how it would hold up to anything acidic but it works great for my purposes.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic for cleaning my glasses and also my nav screen in my car!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use for eye glass cleaner solution.  It works great.  The bottle is sturdy and produces a fine mist... just perfect to cover the lenses of my glasses in one squirt.  The 2.5 Ounce bottle is small but holds plenty of solution.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> This bottle creates a nice, fine mist. It is exactly what I wanted and I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Right size and looked exactly like the picture. I am happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Because I only like to take carry on bags when flying, I needed a small enough spray bottle to take my hair products in.  This bottle is the perfect size to fit in the quart size baggie for liquids and does not leak at all.  The mist it sprays is well distributed.  Not like a squirt where you get too much product in one spot.  I would highly recommend this.  The customer service was also top notch.</li>
            <li> For the price, it works great. There&#x27;s always the Dollar Store bottles, but they do not work great! They clog easily and fall apart - trust me but THIS is a decent little bottle.</li>
            <li> This bottle is just great. It&#x27;s super cheap, and does exactly what it should. I have only had it a few days, but it seems very durable. The plastic is hard, and not flexible. A cap is also included.</li>
            <li> Some spray bottles break easily, but I can tell from this one that it will last. I am so glad that we bought it, It&#x27;s great for homemade fragrance, facial toners, etc. recipes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not what I expected. The spray is too strong. That&#x27;s not mist coming out but a ton of water.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  Perfect travel size and provides a great mist for the hair care product I filled it with.</li>
            <li> I was looking quite a while online for a small, clear spray bottle to use to spray water on my cat to keep her from biting/clawing me.  She is a rescue cat and a friend with 3 cats recommended this.  I already use a large plant sprayer for keeping her off the counter and tables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this bottle is not that cheap, squishy plastic - it is firm - which is perfect for my use.  It comes with a cap so I can carry the bottle and not activate the pump spray while in my pocket.  For my purposes - using with plain water, the bottle works perfectly - producing a fine spritz.  I won&#x27;t be putting anything else in it, so can&#x27;t judge how it would work for any other liquid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At 2.5 oz, that is a half ounce less than a third of a cup.  Size-wise, the container is a little bigger than one of those 5-hour energy drinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to laud the customer service on this, an 80cent product!!  The ounces listed on the item were slightly higher than the actual bottle (I think 3 oz) when it is actually 2.5?  I can&#x27;t quite recall now.  But they *called* me to make sure the smaller size was OK.  I spoke with a very nice customer rep and explained what I wanted to use it for.  She knew exactly what I was talking about and agreed it seemed like what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realize this is a lot to say about such a small, cheap item.  But hey!  Above and beyond good customer service deserves all the praise it can get these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ETA:  I also got an email from the manufacturer who had actually noticed the description error and had contacted Amazon.  They wanted to inform me that I could cancel or change my order.  I think they sent it before the call, but I had missed seeing it in my IN box.  Really good service!!</li>
            <li> Purchased this bottle to transfer Ben Nye setting spray into and it works perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t spray out unevenly, or too heavy. Nice fine mist, but not too fine, so that product flies away. The size of the bottle is perfect too. Not too big and not too small. Good size to carry around in purse too.</li>
            <li> Very good quality item. Fine mist spray that works well. Got 2 of them. You know how once you find something that works for you, they improve it? Not taking any chances  ; )</li>
            <li> The spray gives a fine mist...perfect for my air plants.  The size of the bottle is the right size for storing water.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this little bottle. It sprays with every pump. Why can&#x27;t you buy products in bottles with such a good mechanism?</li>
            <li> A cute little spray bottle. Its made from a thicker plastic which is nice because you can put it into a purse and not have to worry about it squeezing and popping the cap off. I use it for enameling and giving a fine, even coat to put my enamels on. Sprays well and very useful!</li>
            <li> What I purchased was exactly what I was looking for, glad I purchased it here.&lt;br /&gt;Very fair price for this item.</li>
            <li> For putting just a little cleaning fluid on a small area of a dirty pistol, this is right on the money!  However,  haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine its ability to withstand the chemicals of the cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li> perfect for water or rubbing alcohol. small, light weight, clear, looks clean and sleek. fine mist, can label with a marker.</li>
            <li> Sprays extremely fine mist, is cheap, small, and I haven&#x27;t broken it!</li>
            <li> Works exactly like I expected,&lt;br /&gt;produces a nice fine mist.  I use it&lt;br /&gt;with essential oils for a bathroom&lt;br /&gt;spray mister.  Seems to be compatible&lt;br /&gt;with the oils so far.</li>
            <li> Took over a month to get here, but works as expected.</li>
            <li> This is a surprisingly nice little travel bottle.  I got it for my toner, to take on a carry-on through airport security, and like the spray/mist so much I&#x27;m using it now that I&#x27;m home too.</li>
            <li> Has a really fine mist, it&#x27;s perfect for my use</li>
            <li> does what its supposed to do</li>
            <li> I used this to put a little bit of cleaner and water in it so that I can clean my yoga mat on the go... perfect size and works well!</li>
            <li> This is a good little spray bottle. I&#x27;m using it with windex in my motorcycle, to clean off my helmet shield. So, far it&#x27;s holding up well.</li>
            <li> I got these to put in essential oils I have mixed with grapeseed oil. It sprays very well. i use them sort of like a perfume.</li>
            <li> This worked perfectly. I needed to mix a 10 to 1 solution of bleach to remove a stain on the ceiling. This spray bottle worked perfectly for this. I sprayed the spot on two separate occasions, twenty fours apart, with no scrubbing involved and the stain was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle worked exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Great for when you need to apply small amounts.</li>
            <li> I put skin so soft oil in this and it sprayed great all summer long to keep Mosquitos away!</li>
            <li> This product works well and does what it is supposed to. The quality of the plastic looks good and the size is convenient.</li>
            <li> Definitely a keepsake for your bag/purse. It is the perfect size, easy to use, and wont leak. You can just put it in your bag and be on the go. I mostly use this product to store my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> Bought this to dispense my colloidal silver.  It produces a fine mist, exactly what I was looking for.  It is definitely a major improvement over the little plastic travel dispensers sold in drugstores and the big box stores.</li>
            <li> Great for having water spray able to wet down my kids hair for easy brushing and styling. Sturdy bottle and easy working sprayer.</li>
            <li> I use these to make my own air freshener spray and they work great. The bottle produces a very fine mist that disperses well. I can spray it fairly quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leak, but it may drip a tiny bit from where liquid mists out if I spray too much too fast but nowhere near enough to be a problem. The &amp;#34;straw&amp;#34; is plenty long and can be cut to your liking. No complaints, will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a fine mist, no big drops, and is perfect for keeping acrylic artist paint wet on a glass pallet</li>
            <li> This spray bottle is in the middle of the road for me. It works, but because I have to tilt it all sorts of different angles for my purpose, it leaks! It&#x27;s not too bad though, and otherwise this is a sturdy bottle. I also like that it&#x27;s clear.</li>
            <li> I bought these for travel. They work fine for one trip but then the pump quits working.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product in the past and had to call Amazon so I could email them that my product had not arrived it was past due. I. Received it the next day so I am happy to say that this misting bottle arrived before the due date and in good order.  I like this bottle so much that I ordered this (the second one) just in case I needed it. The first one is used to thin my colorstay makeup so I can get a shearer coverage when stippling. Thank you Fantasea and Crazy Cart.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Got this for shrinking tissue paper</li>
            <li> using to spray water when watercolor painting</li>
            <li> Loaded this baby with Bay Leaf Rum aftershave. OH BABY! This little guy works like you&#x27;d imagine and features an incredibly clear 360 degree viewing chamber so you an monitor your liquid level inside. The hard plastic cap is a great assist by the manufacturer, no more squirts at those inappropriate moments! Feel confident in your squirt! Fantasea will take you to places of misting ecstasy. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, WOULD BUY AGAIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Short version: It works.</li>
            <li> lower price but good qualityÔºÅ</li>
            <li> Good sprayer but VERY SMALL.  Good for perfume or after shave.  I will use it for computer monitor cleaner. Did I say VERY SMALL?</li>
            <li> using to mist my air plant with - works well!</li>
            <li> I thought I bought 2 bottles... no I bought two packs of 20 bottles...  They are excellent and perfect for my needs... and I have plenty to share for-ever-more!  So inexpensive and for 40 bottles, these suckers aren&#x27;t cheap enough to die anytime soon.  Filled 2 of them, stored the rest for later use.</li>
            <li> Love this little bottle, I bought the rose water from amazon as well and now I have my very own rose water mist, the smell is great and I love natural skin care so this saves me a lot of money and doesn&#x27;t add chemicals to my skin, the mist in this bottle is perfect!</li>
            <li> Funny that this little bottle has a dozen great reviews...&lt;br /&gt;But it deserves them. This is not some squshy cloudy&lt;br /&gt;plastic poor seamed, case of 20 for a penny (or is it? lol ) bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of a fairly hard thought not brittle very clear plastic.&lt;br /&gt;The pump has a nice action and sprays a fine mist.&lt;br /&gt;Both the cap and the pump stay securely in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use mine to spray williams lectric shave lotion with little waste.&lt;br /&gt;Works too good IMH as the fine mist can irritate eyes and nose.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll make do but I advise others to maybe seek an adjustable pump&lt;br /&gt;to avoid the burning mist!!</li>
            <li> I already a review for this product. It&#x27;s great and it is very functional. It was the right size that I was hoping for and I love how there&#x27;s a cap for it!</li>
            <li> great for burning man</li>
            <li> I have been needing a small spray bottle for a long time.  I have rubbing alcohol in mine.  I use it here where it is hot and humid to refresh my skin and find that this little spray bottle is perfect.  It puts out a fine mist and the alcohol mists onto my skin and evaporates rapidly, providing a nice, cooling sensation.  I find that the mist is fine enough for my purpose and am quite happy with this.</li>
            <li> I bought this for traveling and it fits the task, I would recommend if you can&#x27;t find it in stores.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted a mist spray for my dreads. I put my lavender oil, sea salt, and warm water mixture together and proceeded to spray. It worked fine for just three sprays then stopped working. It still sucks in the mixture but pressing the button makes it run out the opposite way. This is great for getting the mixture through my hair and to my scalp. Awful for what I intended to use it for, which is a mist spray for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have to look for a spray bottle that won&#x27;t break after three sprays.</li>
            <li> Sprayer makes a nice fine mist but this thing leaks from sprayer part every time I shake the bottle (the liquid I keep in the bottle needs to be shaken before each use.)</li>
            <li> Handy little bottles. The tube inside is long enough that you can get every last drop. Shipping was a bit slow, but they were coming from China.</li>
            <li> Great little spray bottle. Works perfectly for my essential oils and water mixture.</li>
            <li> Nice little spray bottle. Works well as described. It sprays an even mist which doesn&#x27;t dribble. What more can be said. Spray bottle which sprays. Yeah.</li>
            <li> great item  The shipping was great</li>
            <li> On time and just as expected. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Works great for traveling.  No leaks, sprays well</li>
            <li> Amazingly fine spray used for cleaning lenses and computer screens. It&#x27;s quite small so it may be needed to be filled frequently.</li>
            <li> This spray bottle worked really well.  Perfect for airplane trips.</li>
            <li> as described, fine mist. fits in hand well and travels easily.</li>
            <li> Nice little spray bottle, I am not sure what most people would use it for, but I had 2 uses.&lt;br /&gt; 1. I put a little windex in it and keep it by my pc, use it once in a while to clean my screen or the one on my phone.&lt;br /&gt; 2. Butter.  Yep,  I have an air popper for my popcorn, but it is so bland, I tried using the flavored powders and salt&lt;br /&gt;but that just falls to the bottom, when you try to put melted butter on the popcorn, you can not do it even and it gets&lt;br /&gt;cold and just wet.  So since this thing sprays a mist, I put butter in it, melt it by placing in a hot cup of water then spray&lt;br /&gt;the butter mist on the popcorn, I get the flavor but not soaked popcorn.  By the way, I tried warming the butter in this&lt;br /&gt;bottle for 8 seconds (without the lid of course) in the microwave... It warped an melted ha.  Ok so hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok so any way, the bottle is plastic but feels good in the hand and solid, not think cheap stuff, sprayer feels smooth, no clicking or&lt;br /&gt;sticking yet, and the spray it puts out is a nice even Mist, not a spray.  A mist of micro droplets. Perfect for perfume and the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it and will probably purchase more if i see them in a store somewhere, you never know when you might have a use.  Like I said, a little bottle of windex in you purse, Put rubbing alcohol in it and place in a first aid kit, liquid seasonings for your food to spray on a salad or what ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet if you have one or two, you would come up with a handy use for them.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use for a rosewater toner.. works fine as expected but a bit expensive for something that comes empty. I found cobalt tinted spray bottles at Whole Foods for less and we all know how expensive WF is!</li>
            <li> This is great for making your own skin care products--it does come with a bottle cap, although that is not pictured</li>
            <li> I just wished the packaging would have been better. It&#x27;s just a regular (what I needed) spray bottle. Not sure if I would purchase again, next time I will just pick up one at Target.</li>
            <li> Perfect for spraying my plants</li>
            <li> I use this for my rosewater spritz.  It is perfect in size and performance.  I&#x27;ve had it for months, so far it hasn&#x27;t missed a spritz.</li>
            <li> We need this for our dolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;It is just what I needed, it works great and the purchase was easy.  Everything came just as described.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the deal and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> this little bottle does what it is supposed to do, and its cheap. i use it for my rose water face mist.</li>
            <li> Bottle leaks everywhere. Sitting upright on a table, leaking out the bottom.</li>
            <li> This bottle is exactly what I was hoping it would be--it sprays a very fine mist and works very well. The plastic is nice and sturdy, not at all flimsy or likely to &amp;#34;collapse&amp;#34; from suction like some bottles do. I&#x27;m glad I ordered this bottle instead of hoping to find a decent quality alternative at the drugstore. I had read the good reviews on this bottle, but was still impressed at how well it sprays. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Very fine mist. Doesn&#x27;t clog and has a durable body. I just found that it is a bit expensive for one bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay,like I said on the headline it is what it is,it&#x27;s a clear plastic bottle with a spray cap that lets you spray a fine mist onto what ever you want to use it for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write negative reviews, but this little thing annoyed me. I wanted it because I am trying to train my kitten not to bite hands. It was a little too soft to be effective for that purpose, but that wasn&#x27;t my problem with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It broke within the first 24 hours of using it. Just stopped spraying. Not sure what happened to it. Not to mention, it took forever to arrive. I picked up a bigger one at the grocery store, for cheaper and it is still working fine.</li>
            <li> This little bottle sprays a fine mist which is perfect for eye glasses cleaning solution. Its fits nicely in your purse or over-night bag as well.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace the bottle that came with Ben Nye final seal spray. I wanted something with a fine mist like this one promised, but when I gave it a shot with the sealing spray it came out in three small, concentrated areas. The &amp;#34;mist&amp;#34;produced by this bottle was worse than the bottle I originally had.</li>
            <li> I like doing my own nails at home so I bought 2 of these bottles and filled them with cuticle remover and cuticle tint. It&#x27;s easier spraying them onto your nails than dipping your pusher or whatever else way. The bottles themselves are very sturdy and are the perfect size!</li>
            <li> I use this for spraying a mist of rubbing alcohol after I&#x27;ve shaved. Works right out of the box, no hassles, small enough for travel but not so small that you can&#x27;t use it on a day to day basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words: perfect.</li>
            <li> My hair product (bodifier spray, if you&#x27;re curious) doesn&#x27;t come in small enough size to get through airport security checks, so I needed a  travel-sized spray bottle. This bottle fit the bill. At 2.5 ounces, it was within the 3.4-ounce limit and held more product than I needed for a week away from home. The bottle did not leak once during my travels. The pump actually misted as I hoped it would. The pump bottle found in your average travel kit doesn&#x27;t really mist, so much as shoot out a bit fluid and then drips a  bit down the bottle. The result is one small section of hair oversaturated with hair product and a sticky bottle. As I already indicated, this spray bottle actually delivered an even mist as promised, without dripping. Finally, the price was right.</li>
