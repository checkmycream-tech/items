            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>Face feels great all day</li>
            <li>Works as intended, it is great for oily prone skin.</li>

            <li>did for me, but with Sebamed I am satisfied that it is the best alternative!</li>
            <li>Really, really good.</li>
            <li>I used it before and it is really good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Because of</li>
            <li>This gel has the soothing aloevera which really really is good if your skin gets sunburnt.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My favorite face moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to pay for the awesome results!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>This gel gives you nice hydration without causing acne.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many products and this is definitely one of the best.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;ve been using this for many many years.</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Another plus is it makes my skin tone look more even.</li>
            <li>Love Seba Med products.</li>
            <li>Nice light weight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>It was pretty good, but because of the consistency couldn&#x27;t wear under makeup.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s important because so many things tend to break me out.</li>
            <li>This has more of a clean feel to it that goes away</li>
            <li>Im getting by just fine with the Cetaphil and Paula&#x27;s Choice</li>
            <li>Because it is a gel, it also goes on smoothly (almost like make-up primer) and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about PH and gentle products being important, but now I am a believer.</li>
            <li>It did its job, but it didn&#x27;t do anything special that would make me consider it a staple product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gives your face a shiny look sort of, but for people with sensitive skin and wide pores, its not the best solution.</li>
            <li>Have improved my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight, clean gel which applies smoothly to my face after washing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to lose a product that works perfectly for you like Awake</li>
            <li>Wow, I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is sticky at first, but it quickly absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>Works fantastically under makeup, and is amazing for dry lips.</li>
            <li>It is soft, smooth and supple, my facial redness is diminished and my fine lines have even almost disappeared!</li>
            <li>Sebamed works on my combination skin very well!</li>
            <li>She only started use couples of day, her face looks better.</li>
            <li>This is the only moisturizer I can use at night that doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, and my skin has NEVER looked better.</li>
            <li>When starting to use this the first time, it tended to make me break out more after using the Cetaphil face wash and Paula&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I would absolutely order it again.</li>
            <li>My daughter told me Sebamed really worked for her.</li>
            <li>I really do like this face gel.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve begun to much prefer this one to it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic at repairing the acid mantle and balancing the pH of your skin to minimize new acne, and to moisturize deeply.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive, acne-prone, and reacts to a lot of stuff.</li>
            <li>and I broke out more than usual.</li>
            <li>The only moisturizer I have been able to use that does not break me out since my previous moisturizer Awake was discontinued.  </li>
            <li>As someone who is used to mild adult acne and small pimples on my forehead and cheeks, for the first time in my life, it&#x27;s ALL GONE.</li>
            <li>The price of this is pretty high, but I think worth it because you only need a little bit.  </li>
            <li>Clear, no scent, no colour.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that it would help moisturize and clear up some acne.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with the Cleansing Foam and they seem to be keeping my skin relatively clear after I gave up on Proactiv after 10 years.</li>
            <li>I got sensitive skin</li>
            <li>will recommend this for sensitive skin and will contnue buying this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the other factors that I&#x27;ve changed (different facewash and different diet) helped, but this played a role in clearing up my skin.</li>
            <li>I use the Face/Body Wash, Clear Face Foam, Clear Face Toner, Clear Face Gel Moisturizer (product above) and Clear Face Pimple Gel.</li>
            <li>It has taken me 2 years of testing countless products to find something for my extremely sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Finally, a moisturizer for my ridiculously sensitive skin that won&#x27;t make me break out or look greasy.</li>
            <li>I also really enjoy the way this feels on my face as opposed to other brands that leave me feeling a little bit oily or gross.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Most of the products marketed for sensitive skin assume that it means you have dry skin</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate (especially during the winter) and sometimes I have to apply just a teeny bit of lotion along with this gel.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Amazing product. Really, really good. Dries a little tacky (aloe) but it goes away after a few minutes. Clear, no scent, no colour. Best moisturizer i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product. Been using it for years. Control acne to an extent but definitely not the cure.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work out too well for me.  I was hoping that it would help moisturize and clear up some acne.  It didn&#x27;t do either for me.  It caused my face to become very red and I broke out more than usual.</li>
            <li> The price of this is pretty high, but I think worth it because you only need a little bit.  It&#x27;s the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t sting or feels like it&#x27;s burning on my face.  Because it is a gel, it also goes on smoothly (almost like make-up primer) and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have used. I&#x27;m sure the other factors that I&#x27;ve changed (different facewash and different diet) helped, but this played a role in clearing up my skin.</li>
            <li> Soaks in well without leaving an oily feeling. Face feels great all day</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer I have been able to use that does not break me out since my previous moisturizer Awake was discontinued.  It has taken me 2 years of testing countless products to find something for my extremely sensitive skin! Thankfully a friend suggested it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the products marketed for sensitive skin assume that it means you have dry skin and so they have been too heavy and have instantly broken me out. Sebamed works on my combination skin very well! I have the cream for winter time use, in case my skin becomes especially dry,  but I use the gel on a daily basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very hard to lose a product that works perfectly for you like Awake did for me, but with Sebamed I am satisfied that it is the best alternative!</li>
            <li> This gel gives you nice hydration without causing acne. I have tried so many products and this is definitely one of the best. I would absolutely order it again.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me Sebamed really worked for her. She only started use couples of day, her face looks better. She will try to use it until anti gone.</li>
            <li> Wow, I can&#x27;t believe how much I love this stuff. Finally, a moisturizer for my ridiculously sensitive skin that won&#x27;t make me break out or look greasy. Works fantastically under makeup, and is amazing for dry lips. The only improvement I can imagine is SPF.</li>
            <li> Fantastic at repairing the acid mantle and balancing the pH of your skin to minimize new acne, and to moisturize deeply. My favorite face moisturizer ever!</li>
            <li> Works as intended, it is great for oily prone skin. However, this is very expensive. You can get a 16 oz tub of Cerave for the same price.</li>
            <li> I used it before and it is really good for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Because of the PH5.5, there is no whelk on my face.</li>
            <li> I really do like this face gel. I&#x27;ve moved on to other products, but there were no problems with the Sebamed or anything. It did its job, but it didn&#x27;t do anything special that would make me consider it a staple product. I will say that it didn&#x27;t break me out and that&#x27;s important because so many things tend to break me out. My skin is combination and acne prone. I don&#x27;t think this product would give me enough moisture during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I can use at night that doesn&#x27;t break my skin out, and my skin has NEVER looked better. It is soft, smooth and supple, my facial redness is diminished and my fine lines have even almost disappeared! I can&#x27;t believe how beautiful my skin looks, and I have no break outs. As someone who is used to mild adult acne and small pimples on my forehead and cheeks, for the first time in my life, it&#x27;s ALL GONE. I never even realized how bad my skin actual was until now. I come home from a long day of work and my make-up is still smooth and perfect because my skin is happy! I actually look in the mirror at my skin and say \\&quot;WOW!\\&quot;. I can&#x27;t say enough about Sebamed products. They are all I use now. I threw away all my other moisturizers and skin care products and I am afraid to use anything else. I wasn&#x27;t sure about PH and gentle products being important, but now I am a believer. I think my skin was very angry from harsh ingredients in my skin care products that caused an upset PH, and now my skin is balanced and is functioning the way it was always meant to. I use the Face/Body Wash, Clear Face Foam, Clear Face Toner, Clear Face Gel Moisturizer (product above) and Clear Face Pimple Gel. If you are a sufferer of acne, rosacea, eczema, etc. I suggest you purchase these products NOW. Don&#x27;t waste another moment of angry skin, USE THEM ALL! GET ON THE PROGRAM AND PREPARE TO BE AMAZED!!! THESE PRODUCTS WORK!!!</li>
            <li> Very lightweight, clean gel which applies smoothly to my face after washing. It seems to be helping a bit with acne flareups as well! I live in a very dry climate (especially during the winter) and sometimes I have to apply just a teeny bit of lotion along with this gel. You only need a dab of this, so one tube should last you a few months.</li>
            <li> I switched to using this as my facial moisturizer from the Cerave moisturizer in the tub and I&#x27;ve begun to much prefer this one to it. For one, I no longer have to worry about contaminating the tub with bacteria from my hand since this just squeezes out. I also really enjoy the way this feels on my face as opposed to other brands that leave me feeling a little bit oily or gross. This has more of a clean feel to it that goes away quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this for an oily complexion.</li>
            <li> I always use sebamed clearface care gel for my face. I got sensitive skin and i&#x27;ve been using this for many many years. It keeps your skin moisturized and protects it. I cannot find this in CVS or walgreens so i always have to order them. They were packed properly and always deliverd before expected delivery date. This gel has the soothing aloevera which really really is good if your skin gets sunburnt.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend this for sensitive skin and will contnue buying this.</li>
            <li> I feel like it may make my face sticky, but I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s this product or another. I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with the Cleansing Foam and they seem to be keeping my skin relatively clear after I gave up on Proactiv after 10 years.</li>
            <li> When starting to use this the first time, it tended to make me break out more after using the Cetaphil face wash and Paula&#x27;s Choice exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using the gel and stopped having as bad of breakouts..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives your face a shiny look sort of, but for people with sensitive skin and wide pores, its not the best solution. Im getting by just fine with the Cetaphil and Paula&#x27;s Choice</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer. My skin is very sensitive, acne-prone, and reacts to a lot of stuff. It&#x27;s also oily and I find myself looking shiny throughout the day. This stuff has helped this problem a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting on a heavy, greasy moisturizer. It is sticky at first, but it quickly absorbs into the skin. Another plus is it makes my skin tone look more even. I had a dermatologist once think I had rosacea due to my skin&#x27;s constant redness. This moisturizer definitely helps relieve some of that redness. It&#x27;s a bit pricy, but it&#x27;s a price I&#x27;m willing to pay for the awesome results!</li>
            <li> It was pretty good, but because of the consistency couldn&#x27;t wear under makeup.  The gel peels and rolls under the makeup.</li>
            <li> Love Seba Med products. Have improved my skin tremendously.</li>
            <li> Nice light weight moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for about a week and it seems to be reducing the redness of acne bumps</li>
