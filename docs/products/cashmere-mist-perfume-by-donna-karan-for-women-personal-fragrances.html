            <li>Quick delivery and love the smell</li>
            <li>Wanted something light and clean smelling.  </li>
            <li>came in its original box with cellophane still on it.  </li>

            <li>Highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>This has happened to me with cologne; the fragrance is nice in the short-term, but too strong or heavy for wearing everyday.</li>
            <li>Been looking for a new fragrance for years.  </li>

            <li>Subtle but sexy.</li>
            <li>My son complained because he said it was too strong and gave him a headache, so I decided to order Cashmere Mist.  </li>
            <li>Very soft, sentual, and lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It is light and delicate.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy this is a imitation of the real stuff my wife compared it to the bottle i bought in Boscovs&#x27;  </li>
