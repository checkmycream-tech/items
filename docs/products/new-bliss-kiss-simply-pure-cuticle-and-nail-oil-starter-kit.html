            <li>Simply Amazing.</li>
            <li>Completly amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so any over the years because I unconsciously pick my cuticles when I&#x27;m stressed, this stuff is amazing and heals my skin within 24 hours.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The pen is handy though for when you travel.</li>
            <li>and I cannot even begin to explain how nice my nails look.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the maker, Anna, for helping us ladies have great nails!</li>
            <li>Since I started using this oil I have gotten tons of compliments on how nice my nails look.</li>
            <li>and my cuticles are nice, no breaks or splits.</li>
            <li>One of a Kind Cuticle oil</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;Crisp&amp;#34; smell is very nice, very fresh.</li>
            <li>smells amazing, works great, and really gives you strong and beautiful</li>
            <li>My cuticles were not thick and jagged and the skin on the sides of my nails looked perfect.</li>
            <li>This product has helped me get better, healthy, and pretty nails, best I&#x27;ve had in my lifetime!</li>
            <li>My grandmother has diabetes and her feet and nails are super healthy and just look beautiful, in part, because we continue to do her nail/cuticle treatments with the oil.</li>
            <li>It smells great and delivers exactly what it promises: Healthy, moisturized cuticles!</li>
            <li>Smells great too (crisp scent)!</li>
            <li>By far the best nail oil I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>By far the best cuticle oil I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li>I feel I could see better results but at my own fault I am a &amp;#34;cuticle clipper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>The Crisp scented oil has a very mild scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>It makes it so easy to keep in your purse!</li>
            <li>I bought 2 kits and it arrived very quick!</li>
            <li>The pen also makes it so easy and neat to apply on the go or at home!</li>
            <li>Strong nails bend but don&#x27;t break!</li>
            <li>My nails are so strong and cuticles are getting better every day!</li>
            <li>But I believe that in addition to this product being pure and effective, the instructions force you to understand the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s of healthy nail care and coupled with this great product...</li>
            <li>It smells great and soaks in really fast!</li>
            <li>The scent is great, I didn&#x27;t like it much at first</li>
            <li>and they were all looking better and better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My nails became more brittle and keep breaking.</li>
            <li>I love the dispenser/brush.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace cuticle creams and I love it.</li>
            <li>I wound up buying more oil pens to keep</li>
            <li>Love the fact I can refill the pen and not worry about running out.</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s a refill bottle available and the lotion stick is amazing.  </li>
            <li>My nails *looked* better drenched in oil just like the photos, but looks are deceiving.  </li>
            <li>This is my third purchase of this awesome nail oil!</li>
            <li>and I am pleased from both; her site and Amazon with the care taken for my package shipment.</li>
            <li>:) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My nails and cuticles look and feel better than they ever have.</li>
            <li>By day three I was noticing more moisturized hands and nails, more flexible nails, and fewer</li>
            <li>My hangnails are significantly better as well.  </li>
            <li>my nail look better</li>
            <li>And nothing moisturizes your cuticles better.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t leave you greased up either :)</li>
            <li>Healthy nails, that do not split, and cuticles that are moisturized.</li>
            <li>Been using the stuff for two days and it already is making my nails look better.</li>
            <li>The nail bed is hydrated and my cuticles have never looked better.</li>
            <li>I love how I can just throw the pen into my purse</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and would recommend it to anyone that has problem nails or cuticles.</li>
            <li>and you will be like me and never want to be without it. :)</li>
            <li>I cant say how much I love the products that Ana makes</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Before using this I couldn&#x27;t get my nails to grow healthily at ALL.</li>
            <li>My favorite cuticle oil ever</li>
            <li>Simply the best nail care solution out there.</li>
            <li>My daughters LOVE this product and introduced me to it.</li>
            <li>and I then gifted a sample of it to my sister, mom, and grandmother for their nails.</li>
            <li>We now ALL use it and just LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I used the pen most often because it was so convenient.</li>
            <li>So, I decided to apply more.</li>
            <li>My nails have never been stronger, moisturized, and healthy.</li>
            <li>sure you follow all the steps and apply it all the time and you will see results..trust me</li>
            <li>Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite cuticle oil.  </li>
            <li>Love the cuticle oil, and the brush pen applicator.</li>
            <li>Leaves my nails nourished and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love the pen because you can keep it in your purse and apply it throughout the day.</li>
            <li>The last thing I want to say about Bliss Kiss is that it is also great for hair!  </li>
            <li>This oil is magic, give it a try</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this nail oil.  </li>
            <li>This absorbs and leaves your skin and nails feeling healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li>I have had no peeling and my nails are more flexible than ever.  </li>
            <li>The convenience of the pen is outstanding and I am able to put this on no matter where I am.  </li>
            <li>I tend to apply more of it when using the bottle but no worries.  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I came across Bliss Kiss.</li>
            <li>But since I started using this (just 7 days ago) not only have I noticed growth; my once flimsy at best nails are stronger...way stronger.</li>
            <li>After being a nail biter, I bought this oil in hopes I would finally be able to grow my nails out, the healthy way.  </li>
            <li>I feel like my nails were better when I used the Nailtique&#x27;s hardener.</li>
            <li>I have had more breakage since using this oil and discontinuing Nailtiques.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>&quot; time, so you can imagine the torture I put my hands through :)</li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I love love love Bliss Kiss.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love my results I&#x27;ve been using it now for any a month now</li>
            <li>and my nails have never been this healthy.</li>
            <li>My nails are stronger than ever before I love my Bliss kiss nail oil</li>
            <li>My nails had begun to grow again and they feel so much better.</li>

            <li>My nail have never looked so healthy and felt so strong.</li>
            <li>I was able to do it all by myself, however it is really easy to over fill.</li>

            <li>It easily absorbs into your hands and cuticles without being greasy.</li>
            <li>Strong?</li>
            <li>Even strong and flexible nails will break</li>

            <li>the brush applicator is pretty amazing).</li>
            <li>Crisp smells amazing</li>
            <li>I wanted my beautiful nails back.</li>
            <li>This oil is hands down the best there is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the hefty price tag because there is a unique blend of beneficial ingredients and that amazing scent, but at the end of the day this is primarily is just jojoba oil that you can get elsewhere for a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to see it available in more scents, but for now the Crisp scent is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>( I always use Solar Oil and thought I was doing fine)  </li>
            <li>I love the summer scent but think crisp apple is still my all time favorite.  </li>
            <li>The pens make it super convenient!</li>
            <li>My introduction to this product came when I won a pen from the creator&#x27;s Facebook page, and it was love at first use!</li>
            <li>but they are most definitely healthier and every day that I use the oil, my nails get better and better!  </li>
            <li>I was using OPI Nail Envy prior to this product and has great results.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING and really quenches your nails &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li>Shipping is really fast, the company is courteous and will help with any questions you have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The 3 Day challenge process is a great way to give your nails a boost and from some people&#x27;s before and after pictures it looks like this oil can work miracles on especially damaged nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of oils and this is BY FAR the best that&#x27;s ever touched my nails.</li>
            <li>scent is fresh and relaxing, which I enjoy!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t perfect by no means and there have been a few breaks</li>

            <li>I also noticed that since I saw such fast results, I no longer wanted to pick at the skin anymore because my cuticles looked so darn perfect.</li>

            <li>The results are almost instantaneous and your nails, cuticles and surrounding skin feel silky smooth and look so healthy even after the first use.</li>
            <li>At first I had the pen, and I loved it so much</li>

            <li>I have noticed that my nails are stronger, my free edge is whiter and my nail bed more transparent, my cuticle/eponychium have shrunk back and gave been more moisturized, and my nails are growing faster and break/crack</li>
            <li>and I promise your nails will be in a much improved healthy state.</li>
            <li>I love it so much...</li>

            <li>The new growth has fewer ridges and better color.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Ana for making such an amazing product!</li>
            <li>my nails absorbed the oil quite quickly.</li>
            <li>My nails have been able to grow long and my cuticles are so healthy.  </li>
            <li>Really makes it easy to apply the oil on the go.  </li>

            <li>also have the Simply Sealed Lotion Stick, and I love it!</li>
            <li>And the crisp smell is to die for!</li>
            <li>I got the &amp;#34;Crisp&amp;#34; and love the scent, nice and slightly lemony.</li>
            <li>For me this is worth the price.</li>
            <li>that same kind of look).  </li>
            <li>If you need some help with restoring your nails and cuticles, I think this oil is definitely worth a try.  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I kept trying to growth out my nails, and I was not having any success.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I makes my cuticles and skin around the nail feel soft and healthy.</li>
            <li>I literally have to do ZERO maintenance on my cuticles - they are now well hydrated and have shrunk back into place all on their own -</li>
            <li>My nails greedily absorbed the oil like a hungry baby with a bottle.</li>
            <li>I would rather go buy some lotion for under $5 it would have the same effects honestly.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY reccomend this product to anyone who wants their nails to look better within a day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s on sale here on Amazon right now</li>
            <li>Peeling is such a huge issue for me, and the peeling areas haven&#x27;t completely grown out yet, but I&#x27;m 100% convinced this nail oil has improved my nails for the better!</li>
            <li>If the answer is yes then you NEED Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil!</li>
            <li>I am going to buy a few more pens so that I can keep them in more places...</li>
            <li>It strengthens nails, restores flexibility so the nails don&#x27;t break so easily and the scent is just lush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most delicate, elegant, sweet smell you can imagine.</li>
            <li>My fingers did not feel greasy, even after covering them in oil, and it is absorbed very well.</li>
            <li>I have stopped using all nail hardeners and strengtheners since purchasing and using this CONSISTENTLY.  </li>
            <li>The products work really well!</li>
            <li>This was my first time purchasing it through Amazon</li>
            <li>After the first day I was convinced that the skin around and under my nails was the softest it had ever been.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to actually do my nails and keep my manicure for a week.  </li>
            <li>and then with the bottle one drop is more than enough!</li>
            <li>I gifted a set to my boss as well, and she has had similar results.  </li>
            <li>Within the first day, I used the pen about 20 times.</li>
            <li>By the end of the third day, my nails had never looked better.</li>
            <li>I have been using this oil religiously for around a month and my nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li>:)  By the third day my C curves had relaxed so much!  </li>
            <li>I saw immediate improvement with the first application.  </li>
            <li>Have recommended the product to several friends who fell in love with it and the convenience.</li>
            <li>I knew that I would have to keep them very short until the grew out healthy again.</li>
            <li>It really does work!</li>
            <li>My nails have never been this healthy, or long, and I&#x27;ve even bought the &amp;#34;vat sized&amp;#34; bottle of oil (it&#x27;s definitely worth it.)</li>
            <li>It really hydrates your cuticles, and promotes nail growth!</li>
            <li>I have used it every day for several months and it keeps my nails supple and healthy.</li>
            <li>I love this and will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li>My cuticles and nails are finally starting to get healthy since I started using Bliss Kiss Oil ...</li>
            <li>Bliss Kiss improved my nail health so much!</li>
            <li>My cuticles were always dry and cracking, but after using this oil on them for just a few days, my hands and nails look great!</li>
            <li>first time I tried Pure Nail Oil</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is now weeks since I first tried Pure Nail Oil.</li>
            <li>There were certain products that I couldn&#x27;t even wear at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about 2 months now, and I&#x27;ve noticed my nails break less and are much more flexible!</li>
            <li>The first three days is a \\&quot;go naked\\&quot; challenge where you don&#x27;t paint your nails and just reapply this oil over the whole nail.</li>
            <li>I really wish Bliss Kiss would branch out into candles or other items with this scent because its so amazing.  </li>
            <li>I had peeling nails my whole life and thanks to this product they have been eliminated!</li>
            <li>Havent tried to refill the pen yet, but seems pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li>but now that pure nail oil keeps my nails moisturized, my nails can pretty much handle any nail lacquer or treatment.</li>
            <li>I decided to do some research on the pure nail oil.</li>
            <li>I have been using pure nail oil for about 1 year.</li>
            <li>and I came about Bliss Kiss Pure Cuticle and Nail oil.</li>
            <li>I stumbled upon a nail care blog that mentioned this product Pure Nail Oil and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li>I dare you to give Bliss Kiss Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil</li>
            <li>Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil should be considered THE #1 marvel of the beauty world.</li>
            <li>Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil makes an immediate difference in your nails, as well as in the skin surrounding them.</li>
            <li>One week of using Bliss Kiss Pure Cuticle Oil 2-3 times a day</li>
            <li>and I recommend this oil to everyone who wants healthy, long nails!</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life I have long AND strong nails.  </li>
            <li>Yes, there are some other brands of cuticle oils or balms that are good,and you may think they&#x27;re the best thing ever, but believe me you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing!</li>
            <li>It works better than pretty much every other cuticle oil if ever bought.</li>
            <li>I no longer get hangnails at all, my cuticles are super soft, and my nails are long &amp; strong.  </li>
            <li>I actually see a huge difference in the length as well</li>
            <li>5 days later, I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li>This oil is fabulous to bring your nails back to life.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, Just as Described</li>
            <li>The scent is also very pleasing.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I accidentally squeeze a bit much</li>
            <li>This product is an absolute lifesaver for my nails.</li>
            <li>of course because I am mindful not use them as tools, and I am now always mindful of what I&#x27;m doing with my hands thanks to reading their website.</li>
            <li>my nail bed has lost most, if not all, of the former yellow tinge from having them constantly painted and are now a healthy pinkish color.  </li>
            <li>My nails have stopped peeling and appear much healthier.</li>
            <li>I wont say much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think the three day treatment would do much</li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t leave that oily feeling, and leaves my cuticles feeling very moisturized.</li>
            <li>My fingers really just drink this stuff up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it so much.</li>
            <li>This stuff really, really works.  </li>
            <li>I started taking biotin, which helped thicken my nails tremendously, but I still had some major issues with cracking/peeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d seen Pure Oil many times on other blogs that I follow but didn&#x27;t decide to take the plunge myself until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to refill the pen with the dropper bottle.</li>
            <li>The only con is that the refill bottle I got more recently wasn&#x27;t filled up all the way ( I know it can&#x27;t be exactly the same</li>
            <li>I feel its better than other brands.</li>
            <li>They were strong and flexible and long!</li>
            <li>My nails were peeling, dry, breaking easy</li>
            <li>received my starter kit last Friday, well ahead of the first estimated deliver date, and started right away.  </li>
            <li>a three day to a week long trial and see what a huge difference it makes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this oil!</li>
            <li>I purchased Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil around December and did the naked nails test and was really surprised at how much my nails would suck up the oil so quickly.</li>
            <li>I also find it fairly easy to refill the pen once it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy the larger refill bottle when I run out. :)</li>
            <li>That is the main reason I started this.  </li>
            <li>the pen is super convenient and lives in my purse so that I can moisturize multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Just use Grapeseed oil, olive oil or any other kind of oil with some essential oils in it.</li>
            <li>In a moment of near desperation, I ordered Bliss Kiss Pure Nail Oil&#x27;s starter kit.</li>
            <li>once I have a few more</li>
            <li>My nails are in much better shape after just a few days of using this product.  </li>
            <li>My results after only 3 days makes the cost so worth it.</li>
            <li>I choose to apply this heavily every night before bed and when I wake up my cuticles and skin feel and look more improved.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through my entire adult life extremely embarrassed of my nail situation and was very conscious about making sure other people couldn&#x27;t see my nails easily (adjusting the way I held and carried objects so my nails weren&#x27;t in anyone&#x27;s line of sight!)</li>
            <li>Lo and behold, this product healed my cuticles, strengthened my nails, all signs of nail biting disappeared and my nails grew long quite quickly.</li>
            <li>but to me its very subtle, I&#x27;m kind of excited because I remember looking at the website last year and seeing a &#x27;winter&#x27; scent..</li>
            <li>I used the oil religiously and exactly to the way it was described in the instructional manual.</li>
            <li>This oil was completely life changing for me!</li>
            <li>It can be a bit fussy to refill the applicator brush, but really worth it to figure out how to do it because every other way I&#x27;ve tried to get the oil on my nail has been very wasteful.  </li>
            <li>but then I just rub it in to my first knuckle and to stop my finger tips from feeling oily I rub them on my arm or legs and then no extra oiliness!</li>
            <li>When I do get the occasional break, my nail seems to grow back to its original length way faster than before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used so many cuticle oils in the past.</li>
            <li>I first saw the three day naked nail challenge on instagram.</li>
            <li>To me, it smells like regular cuticle oil and smells exactly like my OPI avoplex.</li>
            <li>I tried many other things to help my nails but this is the only thing that worked!!!</li>
            <li>After the first three days I was already starting to see results.  </li>
            <li>After trying the oil out the first time, I knew this product was different.</li>
            <li>In fact if my right index nail gets too long, I felt like it might become a circle!  </li>
            <li>This is only my second purchase of this product and I am already a loyal fan/customer.  </li>
            <li>Simply Pure oil and Simply Sealed lotion stick for about a year now.</li>
            <li>The oil immediately hydrates the cuticle and make dead white skin look healthy and alive!</li>
            <li>Other cuticle oils I had used did not absorb as quickly or evenly.</li>
            <li>Now I can see a clearly defined line of nail growth.  </li>
            <li>but it is a clear winner in my book.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As a nail polish lover and blogger, I find myself frequently changing my nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li>I had completely given up on my nails until I started using this product.</li>
            <li>It does absolute wonders for nail health if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li>Mango cuticle oil, burt&#x27;s bees lemon cutcle balm, lush&#x27;s lemmony flutter cuticle butter, olive oil, and OPI avoplex cuticle oil.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, my nails had gotten up to about 1 hour before it was completely gone.</li>
            <li>By the time it got to the 3rd day, my nails and cuticles looked so much healthier, but the biggest change was in my C curves.  </li>
            <li>I did this from as early as I can remember up until I was about 14.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really been wanting to try this stuff and the sale finally got me to go for it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I completely recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li>This is a relatively inexpensive product that REALLY works.</li>
            <li>and they look so much healthier, same for cuticles.</li>
            <li>That funky index nail actually looks normal!  </li>
            <li>I used my pen religiously and still do simply because the results are exactly what I wanted to achieve.</li>
            <li>I have read many reviews about this oil, and it made me interested in trying it, but I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very subtle but nice.</li>
            <li>If you notice in my photo (taken 1 month apart), you can actually see a growth line halfway down my nail of strong white new nail growth since I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li>Now I try to remember to use the Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil pen as often as possible and it makes it so convenient to have one in my purse and next to my chair in the living room.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve learned that strong nails aren&#x27;t hard nails.</li>
            <li>I personally continue to stock up on Bliss Kiss because I just love the stuff so much and the extra vitamin E and other ingredients really do bring it above the level of plain jojoba oil (plus</li>
            <li>and I never realized how dry my nails really were.</li>
            <li>The base coat has helped to seal in the oil and provide a more healthy look till they grow out.</li>
            <li>I use to be self conscious about showing my hands, but now the nail looks much better and is not dry, thin, and sensitive.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the oil, I looked down at my nails and the oil was completely gone within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Within a few hours of the first use, you&#x27;ll notice progress!</li>
            <li>I decided 2 weeks ago to take the nails off and go bare.</li>
            <li>Apparently, I am in the minority here in my review of this product.</li>
            <li>I live in a rural part of southern NC, on 5 acres, with 4 dogs, 2 cats, and a pony...</li>
            <li>The pen is extremely convenient, I am actually still on my first pen, though it&#x27;s almost finished.</li>
            <li>;) (without any coat of polish.. allowing water to penetrate the nail making it weak &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;).</li>
            <li>I would often bite my nails down past the quick, drawing blood, and pick and peel at my cuticles and hangnails, again, drawing much blood.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 30 days now and have noticed no more peeling, no more hangnails and significant nail growth!!  </li>
            <li>I did gel nails for the first time and the removal process killed my nails, so I went online looking for some way to help them heal faster.</li>
            <li>not sure worth the price.</li>
            <li>My nails are LONG and STRONG, no chips or breakage, which is unbelievable for me!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised by how dry my nails were.</li>
            <li>nails are stronger, hydrated, growing fast and peeling less.</li>
            <li>The oil just soaked into the dry patches and made my cuticles feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>The damaged areas are stronger and at least not breaking way back in the quick.  </li>
            <li>After wearing artificial nails for 15+ years, I never thought I would be able to settle for my natural nails</li>

            <li> Simply Amazing.</li>
            <li> Completly amazing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so any over the years because I unconsciously pick my cuticles when I&#x27;m stressed, this stuff is amazing and heals my skin within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> The pen is handy though for when you travel.</li>
            <li> and I cannot even begin to explain how nice my nails look.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the maker, Anna, for helping us ladies have great nails!</li>
            <li> Since I started using this oil I have gotten tons of compliments on how nice my nails look.</li>
            <li> and my cuticles are nice, no breaks or splits.</li>
            <li> One of a Kind Cuticle oil</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;Crisp&amp;#34; smell is very nice, very fresh.</li>
            <li> smells amazing, works great, and really gives you strong and beautiful</li>
            <li> My cuticles were not thick and jagged and the skin on the sides of my nails looked perfect.</li>
            <li> This product has helped me get better, healthy, and pretty nails, best I&#x27;ve had in my lifetime!</li>
            <li> My grandmother has diabetes and her feet and nails are super healthy and just look beautiful, in part, because we continue to do her nail/cuticle treatments with the oil.</li>
            <li> It smells great and delivers exactly what it promises: Healthy, moisturized cuticles!</li>
            <li> Smells great too (crisp scent)!</li>
            <li> By far the best nail oil I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> By far the best cuticle oil I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> I feel I could see better results but at my own fault I am a &amp;#34;cuticle clipper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The Crisp scented oil has a very mild scent that is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> It makes it so easy to keep in your purse!</li>
            <li> I bought 2 kits and it arrived very quick!</li>
            <li> The pen also makes it so easy and neat to apply on the go or at home!</li>
            <li> Strong nails bend but don&#x27;t break!</li>
            <li> My nails are so strong and cuticles are getting better every day!</li>
            <li> But I believe that in addition to this product being pure and effective, the instructions force you to understand the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s of healthy nail care and coupled with this great product...</li>
            <li> It smells great and soaks in really fast!</li>
            <li> The scent is great, I didn&#x27;t like it much at first</li>
            <li> and they were all looking better and better.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My nails became more brittle and keep breaking.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser/brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace cuticle creams and I love it.</li>
            <li> I wound up buying more oil pens to keep</li>
            <li> Love the fact I can refill the pen and not worry about running out.</li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s a refill bottle available and the lotion stick is amazing.  </li>
            <li> My nails *looked* better drenched in oil just like the photos, but looks are deceiving.  </li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of this awesome nail oil!</li>
            <li> and I am pleased from both; her site and Amazon with the care taken for my package shipment.</li>
            <li> :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My nails and cuticles look and feel better than they ever have.</li>
            <li> By day three I was noticing more moisturized hands and nails, more flexible nails, and fewer</li>
            <li> My hangnails are significantly better as well.  </li>
            <li> my nail look better</li>
            <li> And nothing moisturizes your cuticles better.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t leave you greased up either :)</li>
            <li> Healthy nails, that do not split, and cuticles that are moisturized.</li>
            <li> Been using the stuff for two days and it already is making my nails look better.</li>
            <li> The nail bed is hydrated and my cuticles have never looked better.</li>
            <li> I love how I can just throw the pen into my purse</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and would recommend it to anyone that has problem nails or cuticles.</li>
            <li> and you will be like me and never want to be without it. :)</li>
            <li> I cant say how much I love the products that Ana makes</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Before using this I couldn&#x27;t get my nails to grow healthily at ALL.</li>
            <li> My favorite cuticle oil ever</li>
            <li> Simply the best nail care solution out there.</li>
            <li> My daughters LOVE this product and introduced me to it.</li>
            <li> and I then gifted a sample of it to my sister, mom, and grandmother for their nails.</li>
            <li> We now ALL use it and just LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I used the pen most often because it was so convenient.</li>
            <li> So, I decided to apply more.</li>
            <li> My nails have never been stronger, moisturized, and healthy.</li>
            <li> sure you follow all the steps and apply it all the time and you will see results..trust me</li>
            <li> Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite cuticle oil.  </li>
            <li> Love the cuticle oil, and the brush pen applicator.</li>
            <li> Leaves my nails nourished and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the pen because you can keep it in your purse and apply it throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The last thing I want to say about Bliss Kiss is that it is also great for hair!  </li>
            <li> This oil is magic, give it a try</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail oil.  </li>
            <li> This absorbs and leaves your skin and nails feeling healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li> I have had no peeling and my nails are more flexible than ever.  </li>
            <li> The convenience of the pen is outstanding and I am able to put this on no matter where I am.  </li>
            <li> I tend to apply more of it when using the bottle but no worries.  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I came across Bliss Kiss.</li>
            <li> But since I started using this (just 7 days ago) not only have I noticed growth; my once flimsy at best nails are stronger...way stronger.</li>
            <li> After being a nail biter, I bought this oil in hopes I would finally be able to grow my nails out, the healthy way.  </li>
            <li> I feel like my nails were better when I used the Nailtique&#x27;s hardener.</li>
            <li> I have had more breakage since using this oil and discontinuing Nailtiques.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> &quot; time, so you can imagine the torture I put my hands through :)</li>
            <li> Love it....</li>
            <li> and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> I love love love Bliss Kiss.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my results I&#x27;ve been using it now for any a month now</li>
            <li> and my nails have never been this healthy.</li>
            <li> My nails are stronger than ever before I love my Bliss kiss nail oil</li>

            <li> My nail have never looked so healthy and felt so strong.</li>
            <li> I was able to do it all by myself, however it is really easy to over fill.</li>

            <li> It easily absorbs into your hands and cuticles without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Strong?</li>
            <li> Even strong and flexible nails will break</li>

            <li> the brush applicator is pretty amazing).</li>
            <li> Crisp smells amazing</li>
            <li> I wanted my beautiful nails back.</li>
            <li> This oil is hands down the best there is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the hefty price tag because there is a unique blend of beneficial ingredients and that amazing scent, but at the end of the day this is primarily is just jojoba oil that you can get elsewhere for a lot cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to see it available in more scents, but for now the Crisp scent is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> ( I always use Solar Oil and thought I was doing fine)  </li>
            <li> I love the summer scent but think crisp apple is still my all time favorite.  </li>
            <li> The pens make it super convenient!</li>
            <li> My introduction to this product came when I won a pen from the creator&#x27;s Facebook page, and it was love at first use!</li>
            <li> but they are most definitely healthier and every day that I use the oil, my nails get better and better!  </li>
            <li> I was using OPI Nail Envy prior to this product and has great results.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING and really quenches your nails &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li> Shipping is really fast, the company is courteous and will help with any questions you have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The 3 Day challenge process is a great way to give your nails a boost and from some people&#x27;s before and after pictures it looks like this oil can work miracles on especially damaged nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of oils and this is BY FAR the best that&#x27;s ever touched my nails.</li>
            <li> scent is fresh and relaxing, which I enjoy!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t perfect by no means and there have been a few breaks</li>
            <li> I have the driest, peeling, ridge filled nails I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that since I saw such fast results, I no longer wanted to pick at the skin anymore because my cuticles looked so darn perfect.</li>

            <li> This was the first one that I was able to see results after one or two applications.</li>

            <li> My nails have never grown so fast or been so strong!</li>
            <li> I could tell within just a day or two that my nails and cuticles were much more hydrated (this was my whole original problem I believe, my nails/</li>
            <li> My smile line is much more defined and the whites of my nails are much whiter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with maintaining healthy cuticles and this cuticle oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve completed the 3-day intense routines many times over</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my nails are stronger, my free edge is whiter and my nail bed more transparent, my cuticle/eponychium have shrunk back and gave been more moisturized, and my nails are growing faster and break/crack</li>
            <li> and I promise your nails will be in a much improved healthy state.</li>
            <li> I love it so much...</li>
            <li> The (Crisp) scent is so sweet, fresh, and smells so fantastic, as soon as I apply, I keep smelling my nails!</li>
            <li> Convenient, efficient, safe, natural, easy...</li>
            <li> , it is pretty easy to refill.</li>

            <li> Thanks Ana for making such an amazing product!</li>

            <li> And the crisp smell is to die for!</li>
            <li> I got the &amp;#34;Crisp&amp;#34; and love the scent, nice and slightly lemony.</li>
            <li> For me this is worth the price.</li>
            <li> that same kind of look).  </li>

            <li> I literally have to do ZERO maintenance on my cuticles - they are now well hydrated and have shrunk back into place all on their own -</li>
            <li> My nails greedily absorbed the oil like a hungry baby with a bottle.</li>
            <li> I would rather go buy some lotion for under $5 it would have the same effects honestly.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY reccomend this product to anyone who wants their nails to look better within a day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s on sale here on Amazon right now</li>

            <li> If the answer is yes then you NEED Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil!</li>
            <li> I am going to buy a few more pens so that I can keep them in more places...</li>
            <li> It strengthens nails, restores flexibility so the nails don&#x27;t break so easily and the scent is just lush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the most delicate, elegant, sweet smell you can imagine.</li>
            <li> My fingers did not feel greasy, even after covering them in oil, and it is absorbed very well.</li>
            <li> I have stopped using all nail hardeners and strengtheners since purchasing and using this CONSISTENTLY.  </li>
            <li> The products work really well!</li>
            <li> This was my first time purchasing it through Amazon</li>
            <li> After the first day I was convinced that the skin around and under my nails was the softest it had ever been.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to actually do my nails and keep my manicure for a week.  </li>
            <li> and then with the bottle one drop is more than enough!</li>
            <li> I gifted a set to my boss as well, and she has had similar results.  </li>
            <li> Within the first day, I used the pen about 20 times.</li>
            <li> By the end of the third day, my nails had never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil religiously for around a month and my nails have never looked better.</li>
            <li> :)  By the third day my C curves had relaxed so much!  </li>
            <li> I saw immediate improvement with the first application.  </li>
            <li> Have recommended the product to several friends who fell in love with it and the convenience.</li>
            <li> I knew that I would have to keep them very short until the grew out healthy again.</li>
            <li> It really does work!</li>
            <li> My nails have never been this healthy, or long, and I&#x27;ve even bought the &amp;#34;vat sized&amp;#34; bottle of oil (it&#x27;s definitely worth it.)</li>
            <li> It really hydrates your cuticles, and promotes nail growth!</li>
            <li> I have used it every day for several months and it keeps my nails supple and healthy.</li>
            <li> I love this and will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> My cuticles and nails are finally starting to get healthy since I started using Bliss Kiss Oil ...</li>
            <li> Bliss Kiss improved my nail health so much!</li>
            <li> My cuticles were always dry and cracking, but after using this oil on them for just a few days, my hands and nails look great!</li>
            <li> first time I tried Pure Nail Oil</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is now weeks since I first tried Pure Nail Oil.</li>
            <li> There were certain products that I couldn&#x27;t even wear at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about 2 months now, and I&#x27;ve noticed my nails break less and are much more flexible!</li>
            <li> The first three days is a \\&quot;go naked\\&quot; challenge where you don&#x27;t paint your nails and just reapply this oil over the whole nail.</li>
            <li> I really wish Bliss Kiss would branch out into candles or other items with this scent because its so amazing.  </li>
            <li> I had peeling nails my whole life and thanks to this product they have been eliminated!</li>
            <li> Havent tried to refill the pen yet, but seems pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li> but now that pure nail oil keeps my nails moisturized, my nails can pretty much handle any nail lacquer or treatment.</li>
            <li> I decided to do some research on the pure nail oil.</li>
            <li> I have been using pure nail oil for about 1 year.</li>
            <li> and I came about Bliss Kiss Pure Cuticle and Nail oil.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon a nail care blog that mentioned this product Pure Nail Oil and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
            <li> I dare you to give Bliss Kiss Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil</li>
            <li> Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil should be considered THE #1 marvel of the beauty world.</li>
            <li> Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil makes an immediate difference in your nails, as well as in the skin surrounding them.</li>
            <li> One week of using Bliss Kiss Pure Cuticle Oil 2-3 times a day</li>
            <li> and I recommend this oil to everyone who wants healthy, long nails!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life I have long AND strong nails.  </li>
            <li> Yes, there are some other brands of cuticle oils or balms that are good,and you may think they&#x27;re the best thing ever, but believe me you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing!</li>
            <li> It works better than pretty much every other cuticle oil if ever bought.</li>
            <li> I no longer get hangnails at all, my cuticles are super soft, and my nails are long &amp; strong.  </li>
            <li> I actually see a huge difference in the length as well</li>
            <li> 5 days later, I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> This oil is fabulous to bring your nails back to life.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Just as Described</li>
            <li> The scent is also very pleasing.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I accidentally squeeze a bit much</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute lifesaver for my nails.</li>
            <li> of course because I am mindful not use them as tools, and I am now always mindful of what I&#x27;m doing with my hands thanks to reading their website.</li>
            <li> my nail bed has lost most, if not all, of the former yellow tinge from having them constantly painted and are now a healthy pinkish color.  </li>
            <li> My nails have stopped peeling and appear much healthier.</li>
            <li> I wont say much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the three day treatment would do much</li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t leave that oily feeling, and leaves my cuticles feeling very moisturized.</li>
            <li> My fingers really just drink this stuff up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it so much.</li>
            <li> This stuff really, really works.  </li>
            <li> I started taking biotin, which helped thicken my nails tremendously, but I still had some major issues with cracking/peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d seen Pure Oil many times on other blogs that I follow but didn&#x27;t decide to take the plunge myself until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to refill the pen with the dropper bottle.</li>
            <li> The only con is that the refill bottle I got more recently wasn&#x27;t filled up all the way ( I know it can&#x27;t be exactly the same</li>
            <li> I feel its better than other brands.</li>
            <li> They were strong and flexible and long!</li>
            <li> My nails were peeling, dry, breaking easy</li>
            <li> received my starter kit last Friday, well ahead of the first estimated deliver date, and started right away.  </li>
            <li> a three day to a week long trial and see what a huge difference it makes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this oil!</li>
            <li> I purchased Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil around December and did the naked nails test and was really surprised at how much my nails would suck up the oil so quickly.</li>
            <li> I also find it fairly easy to refill the pen once it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy the larger refill bottle when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> That is the main reason I started this.  </li>
            <li> the pen is super convenient and lives in my purse so that I can moisturize multiple times a day.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Just use Grapeseed oil, olive oil or any other kind of oil with some essential oils in it.</li>
            <li> In a moment of near desperation, I ordered Bliss Kiss Pure Nail Oil&#x27;s starter kit.</li>
            <li> once I have a few more</li>
            <li> My nails are in much better shape after just a few days of using this product.  </li>
            <li> My results after only 3 days makes the cost so worth it.</li>
            <li> I choose to apply this heavily every night before bed and when I wake up my cuticles and skin feel and look more improved.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through my entire adult life extremely embarrassed of my nail situation and was very conscious about making sure other people couldn&#x27;t see my nails easily (adjusting the way I held and carried objects so my nails weren&#x27;t in anyone&#x27;s line of sight!)</li>
            <li> Lo and behold, this product healed my cuticles, strengthened my nails, all signs of nail biting disappeared and my nails grew long quite quickly.</li>
            <li> but to me its very subtle, I&#x27;m kind of excited because I remember looking at the website last year and seeing a &#x27;winter&#x27; scent..</li>
            <li> I used the oil religiously and exactly to the way it was described in the instructional manual.</li>
            <li> This oil was completely life changing for me!</li>
            <li> It can be a bit fussy to refill the applicator brush, but really worth it to figure out how to do it because every other way I&#x27;ve tried to get the oil on my nail has been very wasteful.  </li>
            <li> but then I just rub it in to my first knuckle and to stop my finger tips from feeling oily I rub them on my arm or legs and then no extra oiliness!</li>
            <li> When I do get the occasional break, my nail seems to grow back to its original length way faster than before I started using this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used so many cuticle oils in the past.</li>
            <li> I first saw the three day naked nail challenge on instagram.</li>
            <li> To me, it smells like regular cuticle oil and smells exactly like my OPI avoplex.</li>
            <li> I tried many other things to help my nails but this is the only thing that worked!!!</li>
            <li> After the first three days I was already starting to see results.  </li>
            <li> After trying the oil out the first time, I knew this product was different.</li>
            <li> In fact if my right index nail gets too long, I felt like it might become a circle!  </li>
            <li> This is only my second purchase of this product and I am already a loyal fan/customer.  </li>
            <li> Simply Pure oil and Simply Sealed lotion stick for about a year now.</li>
            <li> The oil immediately hydrates the cuticle and make dead white skin look healthy and alive!</li>
            <li> Other cuticle oils I had used did not absorb as quickly or evenly.</li>
            <li> Now I can see a clearly defined line of nail growth.  </li>
            <li> but it is a clear winner in my book.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As a nail polish lover and blogger, I find myself frequently changing my nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the results.  </li>
            <li> I had completely given up on my nails until I started using this product.</li>
            <li> It does absolute wonders for nail health if you use it regularly.</li>
            <li> Mango cuticle oil, burt&#x27;s bees lemon cutcle balm, lush&#x27;s lemmony flutter cuticle butter, olive oil, and OPI avoplex cuticle oil.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my nails had gotten up to about 1 hour before it was completely gone.</li>
            <li> By the time it got to the 3rd day, my nails and cuticles looked so much healthier, but the biggest change was in my C curves.  </li>
            <li> I did this from as early as I can remember up until I was about 14.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really been wanting to try this stuff and the sale finally got me to go for it!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I completely recommend this for anyone.</li>
            <li> This is a relatively inexpensive product that REALLY works.</li>
            <li> and they look so much healthier, same for cuticles.</li>
            <li> That funky index nail actually looks normal!  </li>
            <li> I used my pen religiously and still do simply because the results are exactly what I wanted to achieve.</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews about this oil, and it made me interested in trying it, but I was skeptical.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle but nice.</li>
            <li> If you notice in my photo (taken 1 month apart), you can actually see a growth line halfway down my nail of strong white new nail growth since I&#x27;ve been using it</li>
            <li> Now I try to remember to use the Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil pen as often as possible and it makes it so convenient to have one in my purse and next to my chair in the living room.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that strong nails aren&#x27;t hard nails.</li>
            <li> I personally continue to stock up on Bliss Kiss because I just love the stuff so much and the extra vitamin E and other ingredients really do bring it above the level of plain jojoba oil (plus</li>
            <li> and I never realized how dry my nails really were.</li>
            <li> The base coat has helped to seal in the oil and provide a more healthy look till they grow out.</li>
            <li> I use to be self conscious about showing my hands, but now the nail looks much better and is not dry, thin, and sensitive.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the oil, I looked down at my nails and the oil was completely gone within 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Within a few hours of the first use, you&#x27;ll notice progress!</li>
            <li> I decided 2 weeks ago to take the nails off and go bare.</li>
            <li> Apparently, I am in the minority here in my review of this product.</li>
            <li> I live in a rural part of southern NC, on 5 acres, with 4 dogs, 2 cats, and a pony...</li>
            <li> The pen is extremely convenient, I am actually still on my first pen, though it&#x27;s almost finished.</li>
            <li> ;) (without any coat of polish.. allowing water to penetrate the nail making it weak &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;).</li>
            <li> I would often bite my nails down past the quick, drawing blood, and pick and peel at my cuticles and hangnails, again, drawing much blood.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 30 days now and have noticed no more peeling, no more hangnails and significant nail growth!!  </li>
            <li> I did gel nails for the first time and the removal process killed my nails, so I went online looking for some way to help them heal faster.</li>
            <li> not sure worth the price.</li>
            <li> My nails are LONG and STRONG, no chips or breakage, which is unbelievable for me!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised by how dry my nails were.</li>
            <li> nails are stronger, hydrated, growing fast and peeling less.</li>
            <li> The oil just soaked into the dry patches and made my cuticles feel soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> The damaged areas are stronger and at least not breaking way back in the quick.  </li>
            <li> After wearing artificial nails for 15+ years, I never thought I would be able to settle for my natural nails</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had tips on for most of my life and I am very tough on my nails.  </li>
            <li> I think I set my expectations a little too high.</li>
            <li> .....the pen won&#x27;t last long if using 2 x daily.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer after 3 days, and although my hangnails have not completely disappeared, I believe that regular use of this will decrease the frequency and intensity of them.</li>
            <li> nail biters know what I mean when I describe the former shape of my cuticles all thick and overgrown, and I swear this oil just magically sorted them out</li>
            <li> My nails were constantly splitting and my cuticles were as dry as ever.</li>
            <li> The oil has definitely cleared up my hang nails and dry spots and also helped with some staining on my nails.</li>
            <li> and my cuticles were dry with constant hangnails and after using this my nails</li>
            <li> I used to have such dry nails and cuticles until I purchased this.</li>
            <li> I have problems with my hands actually hurting if they get too dry, so Bliss Kiss is my lifesaver!</li>
            <li> had intended on ordering the fragrance free but apparently failed to make that choice when I placed the order.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple things to try to stop - the bitter tasting liquid you paint over your nails, acrylic nails, gel nails, but nothing worked for me.  </li>
            <li> My nails are getting so long.</li>
            <li> NO more no less!!</li>
            <li> My nails have never looked better, everyone thinks they&#x27;re fake!</li>
            <li> I will use this oil for as long as it&#x27;s sold!</li>
            <li> I have always thought that I just naturally had very tight C curves.  </li>
            <li> My cuticles were cracked and dry.</li>
            <li> The oil helps to nourish and prevent dry cuticles and hang nails.</li>
            <li> I can skip a day or two and my cuticles don&#x27;t immediately dry out.  </li>
            <li> They are always so dry</li>
            <li> My nails were extremely dry and brittle before buying this product.</li>
            <li> I guess my nails were so dry that they were just drawing up.  </li>
            <li> my nails were extremely dry</li>
            <li> They were so dry that the line showing nail growth was not defined at all..</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and sadly, dry nail and cuticles.  </li>
            <li> cuticles were so dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely dry in Arizona and</li>
            <li> I did see improvement in dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I would reccoment this to anyone who needs hydration to dry brittle nails or rouch cuticles.</li>
            <li> It has worked wonders for my daughter and her excessively dry hands.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend doing the 3 day hydration treatment and then use at least 3 times a day from then on.  </li>
            <li> Due to frequent handwashing I have trouble with hangnails, brittle and splitting nails, and dry nails.</li>
            <li> In addition to the drying effects of remover, I also have very dry</li>
            <li> I recently started adding a few drops to my hair after a towel dry</li>
            <li> You only need a little amount to nourish your nails &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and I hardly have any hang nails.</li>
            <li> I do agree, however, that the Nailtique&#x27;s strengtheners can make your nails so hard that if you hit your nail just right, they are going to break because of the fact that the strengthener makes your nails so hard.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve been using the oil faithfully for roughly 2 years</li>
            <li> They definitely work for me and my everyday lifestyle.</li>
            <li> I use the nail oil everyday as well as use two coats of OPI nail envy daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent the last few months using a jojoba based oil I made myself but wasn&#x27;t getting quite the results I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> My weak, brittle nails have gotten new life since using this oil!</li>
            <li> Instantly, and I mean INSTANTLY, I could see and feel the difference after one application.</li>
            <li> Part of that problem might have been because I got slack and would only apply it once everyday or every other day because my nails always felt oily after</li>
            <li> However, I began noticing that the older I got, the worse my nails looked.</li>
            <li> will you still need other nail products?  </li>
            <li> Usually with the pen I click it once or twice and have enough for all my nails</li>
            <li> Extremely hydrating</li>
            <li> I managed to stop the biting, but due to all the damage, my nails were still extremely brittle and ugly/yellow.</li>
            <li> I have taken biotin and other supplements to remedy to no avail.</li>
            <li> My nails are thick (I can barely cut them with regualr clippers)</li>
            <li> My nails are weak and peel naturally.  </li>
            <li> After too many back to back gel manicures and harsh removals, they were in horrible shape.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> because that is my only complaint...</li>
            <li> Even my hands look at least 5 years younger.</li>
            <li> But one day a couple of months ago, I decided it was time to put an end to this disgusting habit for good and started researching nail care products that could help me.  </li>
            <li> I will never be purchasing any other cuticle oil again!</li>
            <li> but, what a difference compared to other oils!</li>
            <li> My nails, though, were in such bad shape, so it took longer than 3 days for me to see a real change.  </li>
            <li> /peel less.</li>
            <li> When I use a cuticle remover, it seems like there is less to remove.</li>
            <li> However, since using this cuticle &amp; nail oil, it does seem like my nails have less damage when shellac is removed.</li>
            <li> They would constantly be breaking or that weird flaking thing where a layer of it like peels off all gross</li>
            <li> also helps to hydrate my nails, and I have noticed less peeling with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> By today, I was oiling a lot less</li>
            <li> In a matter of 5-6 weeks my nails went from weak and constantly peeling and splitting to actually growing past my finger tips!  </li>
            <li> Your results WILL amaze you, and you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever wasted a dime on other \\&quot;treatments\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a little over a year.</li>
            <li> This was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Got hooked on this stuff a few months ago after seeing it on instagram.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also stoked that the pen is refillable, reducing plastic waste.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive compared to other brands but a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t have to drench your skin in oil for it to work.  </li>
            <li> They soaked the ingredients in this little bottle up!</li>
            <li> After three days, I noticed there were no more bleeding nails</li>
            <li> but if you are not sure about scents there is a fragrance-free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even when I go a few days without I can tell a difference!</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and saw a difference after day one!</li>
            <li> but if your dedicated and put it on everyday 2-3 times you will see improvement!</li>
            <li> The fake nails actually made things much worse, because although my natural nails would grow underneath, they were horribly weak and paper thin, so I ended up just peeling away at them.  </li>
            <li> My nails were in desperate need of some major cuticle TLC.</li>
            <li> I found out my nails were too hard and that was why they kept breaking.</li>
            <li> They were brittle and hard.</li>
            <li> Delivered late today</li>
            <li> at least for me.</li>
            <li> If it worked as well for me as other users, I wouldn&#x27;t mind the price, but I think this is an expensive product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I chucked all of my other oils!</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> but with this stuff I have seen a serious reduction.  </li>
            <li> Bliss Kiss is seriously HEAVEN for you nails.</li>
            <li> I was shocked when I noticed it was gone after the 3-day initial use.</li>
            <li> Kids at my school always made fun of me for the disgusting condition of my fingers.  </li>
            <li> My nails have become weak and started to hurt and split.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of products on my bad dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> I mean just the transformation in 6 weeks time is just unreal, I can&#x27;t believe these are my nails!  </li>
            <li> Also, my daughter started using it and her nails haven&#x27;t broken yet.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail oil about 1 year ago to help with my thin peeling breaking nails.</li>
            <li> and then my nails would be thin and just UGH.</li>
            <li> This is seriously a miracle product!</li>
            <li> Seriously, try it!</li>
            <li> Though skeptical, I tried this because I was a little desperate.  </li>
            <li> Saw a dramatic change on my nail.</li>
            <li> I used to bite my nails very badly (to the point of making them bleed and ripping off several layers of nail).</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> I promise you will not be sorry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to say if it has helped the strength of my nails as I use shellac.</li>
            <li> Needless to say it made them look even worse!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but decided to give it a go</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m utterly obsessed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> My nails have always been very thin, brittle and peel all the time</li>
            <li> Lately a few of my nails have been peeling terribly.  </li>
            <li> but I was feeling desperate.</li>
            <li> Some were even bleeding if I looked at them the wrong way!</li>
            <li> I also find it unpleasant to have oily hands and nails.</li>
            <li> Some inexpensive and some very expensive.</li>
            <li> My nails were in bad shape from gel manicures.</li>
            <li> I have a bad habbit of over nipping my cuticles and skin around my nails.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> The base does fill in and bind with the nail.</li>
            <li> (I had NO IDEA how badly!)</li>
            <li> and I realized how bad of a habit this is!</li>
            <li> The skin was peeling off and it was very painful.</li>
            <li> Just read the reviews, I PROMISE you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> My cuticles have always been terrible.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> My nails were always breaking and I had horrible hangnails.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Crisp scented oil has a very mild scent that is very pleasant. My fingers did not feel greasy, even after covering them in oil, and it is absorbed very well. My skin is softer after 3 days, and although my hangnails have not completely disappeared, I believe that regular use of this will decrease the frequency and intensity of them. For people who think that lemon scented cuticle balms are too strong, this is a great option to try!</li>
            <li> This item is a miracle!! Delivered late today and I just put some on my cuticles (still have polish on) to try it out. I CAN NOT believe how great they look. Can&#x27;t wait to do the 3 day treatment correctly. This smell is amazing! I have finally found my new &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; for great looking hands! I want to bathe in this stuff!! Do not hesitate on this one!!!</li>
            <li> I paint my nails every day which can wreck havoc on cuticles and nails! In a moment of near desperation, I ordered Bliss Kiss Pure Nail Oil&#x27;s starter kit. The first three days is a \\&quot;go naked\\&quot; challenge where you don&#x27;t paint your nails and just reapply this oil over the whole nail. Even after just three days, I noticed a significant difference! My cuticles were cracked and dry. Some were even bleeding if I looked at them the wrong way! After three days, I noticed there were no more bleeding nails and they were all looking better and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this oil for over a month and my cuticles and nails look healthier than they ever have before! I highly recommend trying this product. It smells great and delivers exactly what it promises: Healthy, moisturized cuticles!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It smells great and soaks in really fast!</li>
            <li> By far the best nail oil I have ever used.  I have stopped using all nail hardeners and strengtheners since purchasing and using this CONSISTENTLY.  I highly recommend doing the 3 day hydration treatment and then use at least 3 times a day from then on.  If you actually follow instructions and maintain your nails, you WILL see results.  This is only my second purchase of this product and I am already a loyal fan/customer.  It just works!</li>
            <li> Due to frequent handwashing I have trouble with hangnails, brittle and splitting nails, and dry nails. I purchased Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil around December and did the naked nails test and was really surprised at how much my nails would suck up the oil so quickly. I didn&#x27;t think nails could do that. My nails actually feel softer now. Now I try to remember to use the Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil pen as often as possible and it makes it so convenient to have one in my purse and next to my chair in the living room. I use it at stop lights and while watching tv and before I go to bed. The Crisp scent is very refreshing and not overpowering but if you are not sure about scents there is a fragrance-free version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails will never be perfect because of all of the handwashing but Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil at least keeps in pretty darn good condition.</li>
            <li> Great stuff and super fast delivery. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to use this product considering the rave reviews it received. I used the oil religiously and exactly to the way it was described in the instructional manual. I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my nails. My nails became more brittle and keep breaking. I was using OPI Nail Envy prior to this product and has great results. This was a waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> The products work really well! I love the dispenser/brush. It makes it so easy to keep in your purse!</li>
            <li> My nails have always been very thin, brittle and peel all the time but when I found Bliss Kiss and started using it as directed it was like I didn&#x27;t even recognize my own nails! They were strong and flexible and long! Even when I go a few days without I can tell a difference!</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace cuticle creams and I love it. Within two weeks, my fingers began to look great. I wound up buying more oil pens to keep I&#x27;m my bag and at work.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil. I am a nurse and wash my hands many,many times a day. The oil helps to nourish and prevent dry cuticles and hang nails. Love the fact I can refill the pen and not worry about running out.</li>
            <li> I give this 4 stars because as a cuticle oil it&#x27;s the best, with regular use my cuticles have become fantastic and unlike other oils out there I can skip a day or two and my cuticles don&#x27;t immediately dry out.  It&#x27;s expensive compared to other brands but a little goes a long way, you don&#x27;t have to drench your skin in oil for it to work.  The scent is great, I didn&#x27;t like it much at first but it grew on me over time.  I love that there&#x27;s a refill bottle available and the lotion stick is amazing.  I will remain a loyal customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time for a reality check though: This claims that it will strengthen your nails.  Well, I&#x27;ve been using the oil faithfully for roughly 2 years and I&#x27;ve completed the 3-day intense routines many times over and I just haven&#x27;t experienced the life-altering changes to the condition of my nails that others rave about.  My nails *looked* better drenched in oil just like the photos, but looks are deceiving.  My nails still peel.  A lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So will you still need other nail products?  Maybe. (I do.)  Will your cuticles improve?  Definitely.  Do I recommend this product?  Absolutely--for cuticles.</li>
            <li> Love this nail oil!! My nails are so strong and cuticles are getting better every day!</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of this awesome nail oil! I absolutely love it that much! This was my first time purchasing it through Amazon and I am pleased from both; her site and Amazon with the care taken for my package shipment. I am a customer for life for these nail oils. They definitely work for me and my everyday lifestyle. My photo attached is proof how well it&#x27;s worked for me.  :) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> My nails &amp; cucicles look so much better!</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. Just use Grapeseed oil, olive oil or any other kind of oil with some essential oils in it. Make your own, it&#x27;s nothing special. The pen is handy though for when you travel. I would you could refill it. Maybe you can? I&#x27;ll look into it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this set twice now and I love it. It works better than pretty much every other cuticle oil if ever bought. The only con is that the refill bottle I got more recently wasn&#x27;t filled up all the way ( I know it can&#x27;t be exactly the same but this one was really low)</li>
            <li> Love Bliss Kiss! I&#x27;ve been using it for years &amp; I ordered this for my back up! I always need it on hand. You only need a little amount to nourish your nails &amp; cuticles.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product.  My nails and cuticles look and feel better than they ever have.</li>
            <li> This is one of my must-have items. I started using it about 6 months ago with the last challenge, and I&#x27;m hooked. I am going to buy a few more pens so that I can keep them in more places...because that is my only complaint...the fact that I have to actually transport it :P. once I have a few more I&#x27;ll keep one in my work bag, one next to my bed, and one in the family room. love love love this product!!!</li>
            <li> As a nail polish lover and blogger, I find myself frequently changing my nail polish. In addition to the drying effects of remover, I also have very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried Pure Nail Oil my nails absorbed the oil quite quickly. I was surprised by how dry my nails were. Other cuticle oils I had used did not absorb as quickly or evenly. After the first day I was convinced that the skin around and under my nails was the softest it had ever been. By day three I was noticing more moisturized hands and nails, more flexible nails, and fewer hangnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is now weeks since I first tried Pure Nail Oil. I have noticed that my nails are stronger, my free edge is whiter and my nail bed more transparent, my cuticle/eponychium have shrunk back and gave been more moisturized, and my nails are growing faster and break/crack/peel less. This is my &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; cuticle and nail oil. I cannot wait to see how it saves my hands and nails this winter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> My nails are weak and peel naturally.  After too many back to back gel manicures and harsh removals, they were in horrible shape.  I&#x27;d been using OPI Nail Envy and Avoplex.  It helped temporarily but did not improve my nails.  Still peeling and lifting.  Though skeptical, I tried this because I was a little desperate.  I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by the results.  The new growth has fewer ridges and better color.  The damaged areas are stronger and at least not breaking way back in the quick.  My hangnails are significantly better as well.  I&#x27;ve been able to actually do my nails and keep my manicure for a week.  I do follow some of the advice on the website about how to seal and polish the nails as well. For me this is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have used the 3 day and it has helped my cuticles alot and my nail look better so I will keep using</li>
            <li> This oil is fabulous to bring your nails back to life. It adds strength and flexibility to your nails.  And nothing moisturizes your cuticles better. I am a Blissette for life!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month, and it is truly amazing!! I did gel nails for the first time and the removal process killed my nails, so I went online looking for some way to help them heal faster. If you notice in my photo (taken 1 month apart), you can actually see a growth line halfway down my nail of strong white new nail growth since I&#x27;ve been using it (the faded areas are the damaged scraped parts from the gels).  The pen is extremely convenient, I am actually still on my first pen, though it&#x27;s almost finished. Once it&#x27;s done I will try to refill the pen... The instructions are on their website. Also, if you notice in my pic (The before pic on the left) ... My middle finger nail had a visible mark that looked like a crack across it because I smacked my nail and it bent back. I was shocked when I noticed it was gone after the 3-day initial use. Also, my daughter started using it and her nails haven&#x27;t broken yet. I can&#x27;t rave enough about this stuff. Won&#x27;t leave you greased up either :)</li>
            <li> works great but not sure worth the price.</li>
            <li> I saw the pictures of the before and after and was blown away! At the time they were having their biannual sale and figured I&#x27;d give it a try. My nails were constantly splitting and my cuticles were as dry as ever. Instantly, and I mean INSTANTLY, I could see and feel the difference after one application. My nails soaked up the oil like a sponge. I used my pen religiously and still do simply because the results are exactly what I wanted to achieve. Strong? Healthy nails, that do not split, and cuticles that are moisturized. I will order again for my mother and myself when the sale happens again. Skeptics say they don&#x27;t see the results. I say they&#x27;re not using it enough. This oil is the only product I use to maintain my beauiful nails.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, Just as Described</li>
            <li> Been using the stuff for two days and it already is making my nails look better. The nail bed is hydrated and my cuticles have never looked better. If you need to re-hydrate your nails after taking nail polish off this is the product for you! Normally my nails look white and flakey after removing polish, but now they look great!</li>
            <li> Been using this cuticle oil for over a year and absolutely swear by it!! My nails have never grown so fast or been so strong!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and and awesome product!!! Hope to see the refill bottles on prime soon too!!!</li>
            <li> Must-have, end-all-do-all cuticle oil--absolute best product on the market for cuticle oils. I had completely given up on my nails until I started using this product. My nails have never looked better, everyone thinks they&#x27;re fake! Honestly, it&#x27;s like magic! Just read the reviews, I PROMISE you won&#x27;t be disappointed! This stuff NEVER leaves my side!</li>
            <li> I bought this nail oil about 1 year ago to help with my thin peeling breaking nails. The pen is easy to keep in my purse or pocket so I can quickly oil my nails and cuticles after washing my hands. It lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s easy to refill the pen with the dropper bottle. Just follow the video on the website.&lt;br /&gt;My nails are stronger, hydrated, growing fast and peeling less. Peeling is such a huge issue for me, and the peeling areas haven&#x27;t completely grown out yet, but I&#x27;m 100% convinced this nail oil has improved my nails for the better! I keep them polished 24/7 to keep the nail oil in my nails, and to protect them from water, just as she recommends.&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Simply Sealed Lotion Stick, and I love it! I put it on my hands and nails after washing, and they stay moisturized but not greasy almost all day. I wash my hands at work constantly, and when I do, this lotion stick prevents my hands from drying out.</li>
            <li> This product is AMAZING when used correctly!  For the first time in my life I have long AND strong nails.  I&#x27;m attaching a picture taken of my nails after using the product for 3 weeks. Please read the articles at www.nailcarehq.com  to get the greatest benefit from the product.  There is a wealth of information there!</li>
            <li> AMAZING nail oil- absorbs into skin and nails so quickly. Smells great too (crisp scent)! I use this oil multiple times a day. I love how I can just throw the pen into my purse and it&#x27;s so convenient for travel. I also find it fairly easy to refill the pen once it&#x27;s empty.</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of products on my bad dry cuticles. I read about this and thought it would just be another product to put on the shelf with the others. Boy was I wrong. I am on my 3rd bottle now! I love this stuff and would recommend it to anyone that has problem nails or cuticles. The results just in the 3 day challenge will amaze you. Even my hands look at least 5 years younger. I am not getting paid or anything else from writing this. It is that this product is just that good. So if you are thinking about it, try it. I promise you will not be sorry and you will be like me and never want to be without it. :)</li>
            <li> I have definitely noticed a difference on my cuticles. It leaves my skin soft and I hardly have any hang nails. Also, it seems to keep the cuticle grown to a minimum. When I use a cuticle remover, it seems like there is less to remove. As another reviewer mentioned, even if I miss using the oil for a day, my skin is still hydrated and looks great. It&#x27;s difficult to say if it has helped the strength of my nails as I use shellac. However, since using this cuticle &amp; nail oil, it does seem like my nails have less damage when shellac is removed. The scent is also very pleasing. It&#x27;s very subtle but nice. I will definitely buy the larger refill bottle when I run out. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the bliss kiss Simply Pure oil and Simply Sealed lotion stick for about a year now. I cant say how much I love the products that Ana makes and I&#x27;m one happy n satisfied customer of Bliss Kiss. If you want your nails healthy and strong then this is a must have for you. I am a nailartist and I change my polishes evry 2-3 days...this is the only thing that keeps my nails from getting damaged. I love this product.</li>
            <li> This oil was completely life changing for me! It does absolute wonders for nail health if you use it regularly. It can be a bit fussy to refill the applicator brush, but really worth it to figure out how to do it because every other way I&#x27;ve tried to get the oil on my nail has been very wasteful.  The best thing I love about this nail oil is the scent. It&#x27;s the most delicate, elegant, sweet smell you can imagine. I really wish Bliss Kiss would branch out into candles or other items with this scent because its so amazing.  It&#x27;s worth the hefty price tag because there is a unique blend of beneficial ingredients and that amazing scent, but at the end of the day this is primarily is just jojoba oil that you can get elsewhere for a lot cheaper. I personally continue to stock up on Bliss Kiss because I just love the stuff so much and the extra vitamin E and other ingredients really do bring it above the level of plain jojoba oil (plus the brush applicator is pretty amazing).</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Before using this I couldn&#x27;t get my nails to grow healthily at ALL. They would constantly be breaking or that weird flaking thing where a layer of it like peels off all gross and then my nails would be thin and just UGH. I got this for Christmas last year and I had gotten a bit low when I saw that there was a sale so I had to get some more! Usually with the pen I click it once or twice and have enough for all my nails (and sometimes my toes as well!) and then with the bottle one drop is more than enough! Sometimes I accidentally squeeze a bit much but then I just rub it in to my first knuckle and to stop my finger tips from feeling oily I rub them on my arm or legs and then no extra oiliness! The seller is super helpful on Instagram as well and her website has helped me understand how to keep my nails healthier.. though sometimes I do forget and shower naked ;) (without any coat of polish.. allowing water to penetrate the nail making it weak &amp;#62;.&amp;#60;). When my friend recently came to visit I had her try it as well and she ended up buying her own! I like how the scent is there but to me its very subtle, I&#x27;m kind of excited because I remember looking at the website last year and seeing a &#x27;winter&#x27; scent.. and I hope it returns this year as well! Being on Amazon prime is super awesome.. I just wish the sets of just the pens were prime too!</li>
            <li> My favorite cuticle oil ever</li>
            <li> This stuff is the BOMB! It smells AMAZING and really quenches your nails &amp; cuticles. Your nails will soak it up like a sponge just follow the directions for the 3 day hydration treatment and I promise your nails will be in a much improved healthy state.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bliss Kiss for just about a year now.  I no longer get hangnails at all, my cuticles are super soft, and my nails are long &amp; strong.  When I do get the occasional break, my nail seems to grow back to its original length way faster than before I started using this product.  I gifted a set to my boss as well, and she has had similar results.  Simply the best nail care solution out there.</li>
            <li> This nail oil is the best!! I&#x27;m NEVER going to use anything else! Within a week, my nails had already grown dramatically! I&#x27;ve been using this oil for about 2 months now, and I&#x27;ve noticed my nails break less and are much more flexible!</li>
            <li> This oil has saved my nails! I can grow my nails finally! I&#x27;ve learned that strong nails aren&#x27;t hard nails. Strong nails bend but don&#x27;t break! I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
            <li> This oil is hands down the best there is. Extremely hydrating and it soaks in quickly. I&#x27;d love to see it available in more scents, but for now the Crisp scent is pretty nice. I can&#x27;t live without this oil!</li>
            <li> My daughters LOVE this product and introduced me to it. I started to use it and I then gifted a sample of it to my sister, mom, and grandmother for their nails.We now ALL use it and just LOVE it. Our nails have all grown, they are strong and healthy looking. We use them for mani and pedi treatments. My grandmother has diabetes and her feet and nails are super healthy and just look beautiful, in part, because we continue to do her nail/cuticle treatments with the oil. I will now be purchasing the larger bottle to refill our pens. Convenient, efficient, safe, natural, easy... what more can one ask for!?! The pens make it super convenient!</li>
            <li> My cuticles have always been terrible. They are always so dry and I have a big problem with picking the skin on the side of my nails when I get nervous. Needless to say it made them look even worse! I have used so many cuticle oils in the past.Mango cuticle oil, burt&#x27;s bees lemon cutcle balm, lush&#x27;s lemmony flutter cuticle butter, olive oil, and OPI avoplex cuticle oil. I always thought these were good, but I never saw that great of results. Part of that problem might have been because I got slack and would only apply it once everyday or every other day because my nails always felt oily after and it was a pain in the butt to have to carry around a bottle everywhere I went. My nails were in desperate need of some major cuticle TLC. I first saw the three day naked nail challenge on instagram. I decided to do some research on the pure nail oil. I decided I would give it a try. I purchased the starter kit and went about the challenge. I used the pen most often because it was so convenient. The first time I used the oil, I looked down at my nails and the oil was completely gone within 5 minutes. So, I decided to apply more. Within the first day, I used the pen about 20 times. By the end of the day, my nails had gotten up to about 1 hour before it was completely gone. I continued this process for the next three days. By the end of the third day, my nails had never looked better. My cuticles were not thick and jagged and the skin on the sides of my nails looked perfect. I also noticed that since I saw such fast results, I no longer wanted to pick at the skin anymore because my cuticles looked so darn perfect. By the end of the three day challenge, I had used up my entire pen of the oil and I cannot even begin to explain how nice my nails look. This is seriously a miracle product! I have been using this oil religiously for around a month and my nails have never looked better. Needless to say, I chucked all of my other oils! The only thing I don&#x27;t understand is everyone bragging about the smell. To me, it smells like regular cuticle oil and smells exactly like my OPI avoplex. I use the nail oil everyday as well as use two coats of OPI nail envy daily. My nails have never been stronger, moisturized, and healthy. With this nail oil and OPI nail envy, I have found the perfect combination of products. I HIGHLY reccomend this product to anyone who wants their nails to look better within a day. I will never be purchasing any other cuticle oil again! Thanks Ana for making such an amazing product!</li>
            <li> OMG! I love it so much...smells amazing, works great, and really gives you strong and beautiful nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments all the time on my nails and people actually ask me what I do to make to get them that way.&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you follow all the steps and apply it all the time and you will see results..trust me</li>
            <li> My nails were extremely dry and brittle before buying this product. I tried many other things to help my nails but this is the only thing that worked!!! My nails also stopped peeling because of this oil. There were certain products that I couldn&#x27;t even wear at first but now that pure nail oil keeps my nails moisturized, my nails can pretty much handle any nail lacquer or treatment. This oil is definitely a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; for me and it will be in my nail regimen forever!!!--- (ccnailedit)</li>
            <li> I have read many reviews about this oil, and it made me interested in trying it, but I was skeptical.  As soon as it arrived, I started my 3 day naked challenge.  I always have nail polish on and change it about 3 times a week.  I thought I took pretty good care of my nails and cuticles.  ( I always use Solar Oil and thought I was doing fine)  Lately a few of my nails have been peeling terribly.  That is the main reason I started this.  I was not expecting the change I got though.  Evidently my nails were so dried out!  By the time it got to the 3rd day, my nails and cuticles looked so much healthier, but the biggest change was in my C curves.  I have always thought that I just naturally had very tight C curves.  In fact if my right index nail gets too long, I felt like it might become a circle!  :)  By the third day my C curves had relaxed so much!  That funky index nail actually looks normal!  I guess my nails were so dry that they were just drawing up.  I am very happy with this product and do intend to repurchase!</li>
            <li> THE ONLY OIL I WILL EVER USE AGAIN. This product is an absolute lifesaver for my nails. You will not be disappointed!!! Better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried. I had peeling nails my whole life and thanks to this product they have been eliminated!</li>
            <li> Love it.  It&#x27;s my favorite cuticle oil.  It&#x27;s absorption is supreme</li>
            <li> While searching the Internet on ways to strengthen my nails, I ran across Ana&#x27;s site. I found out my nails were too hard and that was why they kept breaking. I ordered this cuticle oil after researching the ingredients and I haven&#x27;t looked back!  This has been the best oil I have ever used. It has stopped my hangs on my cuticles and repaired my nails to a very healthy state. After wearing artificial nails for 15+ years, I never thought I would be able to settle for my natural nails but now that&#x27;s all I want.&lt;br /&gt;I love this oil and recommend that everyone try it for themselves!!</li>
            <li> I used to bite my nails very badly (to the point of making them bleed and ripping off several layers of nail). I did this from as early as I can remember up until I was about 14. I then decided to get my nails healthy and strong. I managed to stop the biting, but due to all the damage, my nails were still extremely brittle and ugly/yellow. I started taking biotin, which helped thicken my nails tremendously, but I still had some major issues with cracking/peeling. I found out about this AMAAAAAAZING product through instagram. I was skeptical, but decided to give it a go and I am so thankful I did. My nails no longer crack or split. My smile line is much more defined and the whites of my nails are much whiter! My nails are thick (I can barely cut them with regualr clippers) but Ana&#x27;s oil causes them to flee instead of break when I hit them. The oil also clears up hangnails in a matter of hours for me(but i only get hangnails when i dont use my oil religiously because of forgetfulness). I continue to be amazed with this oil. Within a few hours of the first use, you&#x27;ll notice progress! I will use this oil for as long as it&#x27;s sold!</li>
            <li> Love the cuticle oil, and the brush pen applicator. Leaves my nails nourished and healthy.</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST cuticle and nail oil there is. Everyone is jumping on the oil bandwagon but Bliss Kiss is the best. It absorbs quickly, provides immediate results, ships quickly. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had trouble with maintaining healthy cuticles and this cuticle oil is amazing! It works to repair really quickly and is very easy to use. I use it everyday and saw a difference after day one! I love the pen because you can keep it in your purse and apply it throughout the day. Definitely a must!</li>
            <li> My nails were in bad shape from gel manicures. I waited to give my review until I used the product for a month. I noticed a difference after 3 days, after continued use my nails are looking wonderful and they are stronger than ever. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have extensive experience in nail care and I have never had an oil do the things this does. But I believe that in addition to this product being pure and effective, the instructions force you to understand the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s of healthy nail care and coupled with this great product...women can understand what it takes to have healthy beautiful nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I manage a wine shop and I throw around 50lb boxes of wine all day (with gloves mind you) and my nails don&#x27;t break...of course because I am mindful not use them as tools, and I am now always mindful of what I&#x27;m doing with my hands thanks to reading their website. It&#x27;s things like this that the product instructions and the company website remind you of. Your nails are not tools so don&#x27;t use them as such!!! Even strong and flexible nails will break if forced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products they make are wonderful but the true strength of their company is giving the consumer the products AND knowledge to take care of their hands and nails. Knowledge is power as we all know...</li>
            <li> I have been using pure nail oil for about 1 year. This is an AMAZING product. You will NOT be disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Bliss Kiss for about 5 months now.  I tried the 3-day hydration challenge then and noticed an immediate difference in the skin around my nails.  My nails, though, were in such bad shape, so it took longer than 3 days for me to see a real change.  Before Bliss Kiss my nails were extremely dry (I had NO IDEA how badly!) and they would constantly split and peel.  They were so dry that the line showing nail growth was not defined at all.. it just looked like a big &amp;#34;grey&amp;#34; area of sorts.. it looked like I&#x27;d buffed or somehow scratched the surface of my nails (think of when a metal file etches glass.. that same kind of look).  It had bothered me for a while, but not until I started using Ana&#x27;s oil did that change.  My nails still greedily soak up the oil when I apply it, but I don&#x27;t have to apply as often, and lo and behold.. Now I can see a clearly defined line of nail growth.  It is truly amazing.. my nail bed has lost most, if not all, of the former yellow tinge from having them constantly painted and are now a healthy pinkish color.  The nail tips are now white, and look very healthy.  Not only that, I haven&#x27;t picked off a hangnail or cuticle in months.  I am currently using Bliss Kiss together with another nail oil (with a very similar profile as this) and the combination has been truly transformative for me.  I keep a stash around always (enough to hold me over in case I have to order more!).  The last thing I want to say about Bliss Kiss is that it is also great for hair!  I recently started adding a few drops to my hair after a towel dry and it has already made a difference.  If you need some help with restoring your nails and cuticles, I think this oil is definitely worth a try.  I know I don&#x27;t ever plan to be without it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could give BlissðŸ’‹Kissâ„¢ a 10 star rating. It&#x27;s amazing!! The results are almost instantaneous and your nails, cuticles and surrounding skin feel silky smooth and look so healthy even after the first use. And the crisp smell is to die for! Shipping is really fast, the company is courteous and will help with any questions you have. Don&#x27;t think JUST BUY!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best nail oil I&#x27;ve ever used. It keeps my manicures lasting longer! After each use, nails look like you just got a manicure! So lucky to have found this.</li>
            <li> For a while I&#x27;ve been watching people&#x27;s 3-Day hydration challenge results and reading everything from simplenailarttips.com. I&#x27;ve really been wanting to try this stuff and the sale finally got me to go for it!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great! The oil has definitely cleared up my hang nails and dry spots and also helped with some staining on my nails. I&#x27;ve still had some peeling but I think that will stop with prolonged use. I also look forward to seeing the strength my nails will have once they grow out and get prone to breaking.&lt;br /&gt;The 3 Day challenge process is a great way to give your nails a boost and from some people&#x27;s before and after pictures it looks like this oil can work miracles on especially damaged nails.&lt;br /&gt;The scent, applicator, and results are all great and I recommend this oil to everyone who wants healthy, long nails!</li>
            <li> This is the best nail oil going.  I have been using it for about 30 days now and have noticed no more peeling, no more hangnails and significant nail growth!!  It is worth every penny and then some!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed in this product.  She has created this product with science in mind and what the body actually needs.  NO more no less!!</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle worker! I&#x27;ve been having problems with nail biting since I was a child. I saw my daughter biting her nail and I realized how bad of a habit this is! I tried not biting my nails and I was successful but my nail won&#x27;t grow! I searched online for a nail oil that can help. I tried Sally Hansen but it didn&#x27;t work on my nails. I was reading blogs and I came about Bliss Kiss Pure Cuticle and Nail oil. I immediately bought. Lo and behold, this product healed my cuticles, strengthened my nails, all signs of nail biting disappeared and my nails grew long quite quickly. This product has helped me get better, healthy, and pretty nails, best I&#x27;ve had in my lifetime! Definitely a loyal customer. I bought 2 kits and it arrived very quick! Thanks to the maker, Anna, for helping us ladies have great nails! Just received my kit today and I&#x27;m buying more!!!</li>
            <li> I heard good reviews, so I wanted to see for myself and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all. The oil smells amazing &amp; the latex barrier is great. Would definitely order again</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and sadly, dry nail and cuticles.  I kept trying to growth out my nails, and I was not having any success.  After spending lots of dollars, I started doing some research.  I came across this product.  My nails are in much better shape after just a few days of using this product.  Now, I don&#x27;t go anywhere without one of my Bliss Kiss pens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go on Instagram - and see the reviews and all the people who love this product!</li>
            <li> This nail oil has changed my nail life. My nails were always breaking and I had horrible hangnails.  Since I started using this oil I have gotten tons of compliments on how nice my nails look. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Simply Pure cuticle oil is so amazing! The (Crisp) scent is so sweet, fresh, and smells so fantastic, as soon as I apply, I keep smelling my nails!ðŸ˜‚ The oil immediately hydrates the cuticle and make dead white skin look healthy and alive! At first I had the pen, and I loved it so much, I bought the refill bottle with the pen! The pen also makes it so easy and neat to apply on the go or at home! This miracle product is so great.</li>
            <li> This oil is great. I makes my cuticles and skin around the nail feel soft and healthy. I does leave some oil on the hands, but it absorbs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I also helps to hydrate my nails, and I have noticed less peeling with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;The pen works great, and once you get the hang of opening it (it just takes brute strength), it is pretty easy to refill.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different kinds of oils and this is BY FAR the best that&#x27;s ever touched my nails. I&#x27;m only on day 2.5 of my 3 day naked challenge and I&#x27;m utterly obsessed. My nails have stopped peeling and appear much healthier. Thank you blissðŸ’‹kiss for this outstanding product!</li>
            <li> This is a great product which you won&#x27;t regret buying. It strengthens nails, restores flexibility so the nails don&#x27;t break so easily and the scent is just lush. I&#x27;ve been using it for a while now and my cuticles are nice, no breaks or splits. Seriously, try it!</li>
            <li> This oil is magic, give it a try and u will see it work miracles!!!! I wont say much but u have to see it work!!! Thanks Ana for such an amazing oil!!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this nail oil.  It&#x27;s very different because it&#x27;s not like some nail oils that sit on your skin or nails and do nothing.  This absorbs and leaves your skin and nails feeling healthy and nourished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a chronic nail biter ever since the 4th grade.  I&#x27;ve tried multiple things to try to stop - the bitter tasting liquid you paint over your nails, acrylic nails, gel nails, but nothing worked for me.  The fake nails actually made things much worse, because although my natural nails would grow underneath, they were horribly weak and paper thin, so I ended up just peeling away at them.  I&#x27;ve gone through my entire adult life extremely embarrassed of my nail situation and was very conscious about making sure other people couldn&#x27;t see my nails easily (adjusting the way I held and carried objects so my nails weren&#x27;t in anyone&#x27;s line of sight!) I would often bite my nails down past the quick, drawing blood, and pick and peel at my cuticles and hangnails, again, drawing much blood.  Kids at my school always made fun of me for the disgusting condition of my fingers.  But one day a couple of months ago, I decided it was time to put an end to this disgusting habit for good and started researching nail care products that could help me.  I stumbled upon a nail care blog that mentioned this product Pure Nail Oil and decided to give it a shot.  I could tell within just a day or two that my nails and cuticles were much more hydrated (this was my whole original problem I believe, my nails/cuticles were so dry and I just picked and picked at them).  Now, I&#x27;m not even two months into using this product that my hands are literally unrecognizable!!  I literally have to do ZERO maintenance on my cuticles - they are now well hydrated and have shrunk back into place all on their own - you nail biters know what I mean when I describe the former shape of my cuticles all thick and overgrown, and I swear this oil just magically sorted them out and I did nothing but apply this oil several times a day!!  My nails are LONG and STRONG, no chips or breakage, which is unbelievable for me!  I mean just the transformation in 6 weeks time is just unreal, I can&#x27;t believe these are my nails!  I&#x27;m so fortunate I found this product, I will be buying this for the rest of my life :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I didn&#x27;t think the three day treatment would do much but, what a difference compared to other oils! It&#x27;s extremely dry in Arizona and your hands and nails take a beating in summer and winter even though everyone continually hydrates and moisturizes.  My nails were/are so improved, the tiny cracks and splits are gone. What a surprise to find this!</li>
            <li> Bliss Kiss Simply Pure Cuticle Oil is the best cuticle oil I&#x27;ve ever tried. It&#x27;s worth every penny! My nail have never looked so healthy and felt so strong. It&#x27;s AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is the best EVER! I have been using this nail oil and the results are amazing! My nails have been able to grow long and my cuticles are so healthy.  I have had no peeling and my nails are more flexible than ever.  The convenience of the pen is outstanding and I am able to put this on no matter where I am.  The oil does not leave any greasy mess and the fragrance free has a very pleasant smell.  I can&#x27;t stop thinking about this oil and just want to swim in it!</li>
            <li> This oil is absolutely amazing!  I&#x27;ve had tips on for most of my life and I am very tough on my nails.  After the first three days I was already starting to see results.  In a matter of 5-6 weeks my nails went from weak and constantly peeling and splitting to actually growing past my finger tips!  They were strong yet still flexible so if I happened to stub my finger or hit it on something they didn&#x27;t break.  I&#x27;m pretty sure this oil is magic in a bottle :)  I am on my fourth purchase of this oil I just can&#x27;t get enough of it!  I love the summer scent but think crisp apple is still my all time favorite.  Definitely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent the last few months using a jojoba based oil I made myself but wasn&#x27;t getting quite the results I was looking for.  I&#x27;d seen Pure Oil many times on other blogs that I follow but didn&#x27;t decide to take the plunge myself until recently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my starter kit last Friday, well ahead of the first estimated deliver date, and started right away.  My 3 day challenge ended about noon today but I forgot to take the after pic before I put on polish. I can say, however, that I am a customer for life. I saw immediate improvement with the first application.  The oil just soaked into the dry patches and made my cuticles feel soft and moisturized.  by the end of the day, I felt like I was constantly oiling but that&#x27;s just how dehydrated my nails were.  By today, I was oiling a lot less but my nails still looked well hydrated, even after exposure to water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pen is easy to use.  Just click the non-brush end several times and you&#x27;re good to go.  Really makes it easy to apply the oil on the go.  I tend to apply more of it when using the bottle but no worries.  the oil works great on the rest of my hands, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had intended on ordering the fragrance free but apparently failed to make that choice when I placed the order.  No worries there, either.  The Crisp scent is wonderful and doesn&#x27;t irritate the scent-sensitive people in my life, which includes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got problem nails and nothing else has worked, give this oil a try.  Seriously.  My results after only 3 days makes the cost so worth it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely wonderful product and so easy to use. I carry one in my purse and have one for home use. Have recommended the product to several friends who fell in love with it and the convenience. I am so glad I came across Bliss Kiss.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Love the Crisp scent. Also, the pen is a great way to moisturize on the go.</li>
            <li> Simply Amazing. A Must Have item</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping! It got to me 5 days after I ordered it, and the second I tried it, I was hooked! Smells fresh and clean, absorbs into my skin quickly so it doesn&#x27;t leave that oily feeling, and leaves my cuticles feeling very moisturized. By far the best cuticle oil I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
            <li> Its only been seven says since I started using this product but it is a clear winner in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have severely damaged my once beautiful and healthy nails by getting shellac manicures every 2-3 weeks for over a years time-span. My nails have become weak and started to hurt and split. I decided 2 weeks ago to take the nails off and go bare. I knew that I would have to keep them very short until the grew out healthy again. But since I started using this (just 7 days ago) not only have I noticed growth; my once flimsy at best nails are stronger...way stronger. I don&#x27;t know why it works so well, just that it does so I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> My nail routine is: Bliss Kiss &amp;#34;Crisp&amp;#34; nail oil, OPI Nail Envy, &amp; two biotin per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fresh and relaxing, which I enjoy! My fingers really just drink this stuff up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have refilled one pen, and was nervous thinking I would need my husbands help. I was able to do it all by myself, however it is really easy to over fill. If you do fill it, don&#x27;t use the pen just before (which is what I did) just in case you do over fill, you can easily use it up :)</li>
            <li> A wonderful product to use when your growing out tour nails. My results come with in 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from hang nails all my life no matter how I moisturize my hands/cuticles but with this stuff I have seen a serious reduction.  It has smoothed out my skin surrounding my nail bed, and seems to help my nails as well.  I definitely wouldn&#x27;t say its an instant fix but if your dedicated and put it on everyday 2-3 times you will see improvement!</li>
            <li> It really does work! My sister had a fungus on her thumbs. The skin was peeling off and it was very painful. I bought this for her to see if it would help and it did. she saw an improvement in just two weeks.</li>
            <li> After being a nail biter, I bought this oil in hopes I would finally be able to grow my nails out, the healthy way.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 9 months, and I have had great results, due not only to the amazing quality of this oil, but also because of the helpful tips, Ana (the creator of the oil) has on her website, nail care hq. My nails have never been this healthy, or long, and I&#x27;ve even bought the &amp;#34;vat sized&amp;#34; bottle of oil (it&#x27;s definitely worth it.) I recommend if your going to do the 3 day challenge, to buy a pair of kitchen gloves for in the shower, just oil up, put the gloves on, and use hair ties or bands to keep the water out to keep your nails hydrated while you shower.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li> Apparently, I am in the minority here in my review of this product. I feel like my nails were better when I used the Nailtique&#x27;s hardener. I have had more breakage since using this oil and discontinuing Nailtiques.  I do agree, however, that the Nailtique&#x27;s strengtheners can make your nails so hard that if you hit your nail just right, they are going to break because of the fact that the strengthener makes your nails so hard. I also find it unpleasant to have oily hands and nails. To have to use the oil after every hand washing isn&#x27;t practical for me. I did see improvement in dry cuticles. If it worked as well for me as other users, I wouldn&#x27;t mind the price, but I think this is an expensive product.</li>
            <li> Saw a dramatic change on my nail. Does not peel like it use to. Completly amazing.</li>
            <li> Great product! I love the scent. It really hydrates your cuticles, and promotes nail growth! It feels great on. Will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Do you have cuticles? Do you have fingernails? If the answer is yes then you NEED Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil! I&#x27;ve been a loyal user for around 3 months now and my nails and cuticles have never looked better! Yes, there are some other brands of cuticle oils or balms that are good,and you may think they&#x27;re the best thing ever, but believe me you have no idea what you&#x27;re missing! I dare you to give Bliss Kiss Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil a three day to a week long trial and see what a huge difference it makes.</li>
            <li> Bliss Kiss Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil should be considered THE #1 marvel of the beauty world. I live in a rural part of southern NC, on 5 acres, with 4 dogs, 2 cats, and a pony...I have 2 children still at home...and I do Nail Art in my \\&quot;spare\\&quot; time, so you can imagine the torture I put my hands through :) My introduction to this product came when I won a pen from the creator&#x27;s Facebook page, and it was love at first use! Bliss Kiss Pure Nail and Cuticle Oil makes an immediate difference in your nails, as well as in the skin surrounding them. Your results WILL amaze you, and you&#x27;ll wonder why you ever wasted a dime on other \\&quot;treatments\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out I use it so much. Love it....and I will be buying more. My nails are getting so long. I love love love Bliss Kiss.</li>
            <li> MUST HAVE!!! The best cuticle oil I have ever tried. I&#x27;ve tried so any over the years because I unconsciously pick my cuticles when I&#x27;m stressed, this stuff is amazing and heals my skin within 24 hours.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my results I&#x27;ve been using it now for any a month now and my nails have never been this healthy. I actually see a huge difference in the length as well My nails are stronger than ever before I love my Bliss kiss nail oil</li>
            <li> Got hooked on this stuff a few months ago after seeing it on instagram.  Was very happy to find it available on amazon for my refills!  the pen is super convenient and lives in my purse so that I can moisturize multiple times a day.  Havent tried to refill the pen yet, but seems pretty straight forward.</li>
            <li> I have always had long, beautiful nails. However, I began noticing that the older I got, the worse my nails looked. They were brittle and hard. They would crack and peel. They would also break at the tiniest bump to a nail. It seemed like I had tried everything. I found Bliss Kiss on Instagram and began reading about it. I saw the before and after results. I was skeptical but I was feeling desperate. I wanted my beautiful nails back. After trying the oil out the first time, I knew this product was different. My nails greedily absorbed the oil like a hungry baby with a bottle. 5 days later, I saw a huge difference. My nails had begun to grow again and they feel so much better. They aren&#x27;t perfect by no means and there have been a few breaks but they are most definitely healthier and every day that I use the oil, my nails get better and better!  I completely recommend this for anyone. You won&#x27;t be disappointed! It&#x27;s on sale here on Amazon right now so it&#x27;s a perfect time to try it. It&#x27;s also on Amazon Prime so shipping is free! I love Bliss Kiss. The scents are amazing and my nails and cuticles feel so good now!</li>
            <li> This stuff really, really works.  Please note that the pen is not refillable although I did find a u tube on how to do it it doesn&#x27;t work as well when you refill it.</li>
            <li> Bliss Kiss is seriously HEAVEN for you nails. I have one pen in my purse, one by the bed, one at work, and one where I do my nail polish. I have used it every day for several months and it keeps my nails supple and healthy. It instantly reduces the appearance of hang nails. I have problems with my hands actually hurting if they get too dry, so Bliss Kiss is my lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Great product! Love the smell. definitely seeing and feeling results. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this at the suggestion of my friend. It&#x27;s great. My cuticles were always dry and cracking, but after using this oil on them for just a few days, my hands and nails look great! I love this and will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 3 weeks now. I did the hydration challenge and I never realized how dry my nails really were. They soaked the ingredients in this little bottle up! The &amp;#34;Crisp&amp;#34; smell is very nice, very fresh. I choose to apply this heavily every night before bed and when I wake up my cuticles and skin feel and look more improved. I feel I could see better results but at my own fault I am a &amp;#34;cuticle clipper&amp;#34;. I have a bad habbit of over nipping my cuticles and skin around my nails. Even with this habit it seems to heal the issue areas. I would reccoment this to anyone who needs hydration to dry brittle nails or rouch cuticles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it helped in any way....at least for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product!! All of my clients that are having issues with their nails and cuticles I tell them to go buy and use this product. I feel its better than other brands.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this stuff! It definitely works! I would try to avoid touching your face because of the oils but otherwise no problems.</li>
            <li> I had to take the time for a review. I have the driest, peeling, ridge filled nails I have ever seen. I have taken biotin and other supplements to remedy to no avail. I have searched and tried different oils. Some inexpensive and some very expensive. This was the first one that I was able to see results after one or two applications. The base coat has helped to seal in the oil and provide a more healthy look till they grow out. The base does fill in and bind with the nail. It will not peal off like others. I wear rubber gloves when hands are in water for extra protection. I apply the oil to cuticles and under nail. I use to be self conscious about showing my hands, but now the nail looks much better and is not dry, thin, and sensitive. This is a relatively inexpensive product that REALLY works.</li>
            <li> The holy grail of nail/cuticle oil</li>
            <li> Best stuff I&#x27;ve tried! :D</li>
            <li> LOVE this product !! My cuticles and nails are finally starting to get healthy since I started using Bliss Kiss Oil ... I had tried so many other products but this oil is amazing and smells great !! My nails were peeling, dry, breaking easy and my cuticles were dry with constant hangnails and after using this my nails are more flexible, peeling is decreasing and they look so much healthier, same for cuticles.</li>
            <li> This is 100% the best oil I have ever used. I used to have such dry nails and cuticles until I purchased this. Bliss Kiss improved my nail health so much! I would never use anything else.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. My weak, brittle nails have gotten new life since using this oil! Can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I got the &amp;#34;Crisp&amp;#34; and love the scent, nice and slightly lemony. They sent a really lovely information packet with the kit, and I&#x27;m excited to take the 3-day challenge! I&#x27;m also stoked that the pen is refillable, reducing plastic waste. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for a little over a year. I&#x27;m so glad I got introduced to it. My cuticles are healthy and supple, I haven&#x27;t had hangnails in forever, and my nails are strong and flexible!!! I&#x27;ve even gotten my husband and daughter to use it. It has worked wonders for my daughter and her excessively dry hands. Another plus is the smell!! Crisp smells amazing, you will catch yourself smelling your fingers. Excellent product!!</li>
            <li> Love this item! Am currently doing the 3 Day Hydration and my nails are looking better and better.  Saw a difference by day 2.  Definitely ordering more of this product!!</li>
            <li> .....the pen won&#x27;t last long if using 2 x daily. I probably won&#x27;t re-order....but do like that you can take it with you in your purse if you should so choose.</li>
            <li> One of a Kind Cuticle oil</li>
            <li> I love this cuticle oil. I&#x27;ve been using it since January. It easily absorbs into your hands and cuticles without being greasy. It has a really pleasant smell, not to overpowering. My nails and hands have NEVER looked better. One week of using Bliss Kiss Pure Cuticle Oil 2-3 times a day and you will be convinced. I&#x27;ve tried using another brand of cuticle oil and my nails broke and peeled. I went back to using this in May and I haven&#x27;t looked back.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if i like it because it isn&#x27;t here (dom. rep) yet&lt;br /&gt;thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Best stuff on earth! My nails have been so much more healthier and so have my cuticles... I will always order every time I run out..</li>
            <li> I think I set my expectations a little too high. I would rather go buy some lotion for under $5 it would have the same effects honestly.</li>
