            <li>Love this makeup.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>I love that you can&#x27;t feel it on your face.  </li>
            <li>Also, have to love the SPF 30.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>wither way is OK.</li>
            <li>I will say, though, that I have pretty good skin.  </li>
            <li>This is great foundation &amp; most especially its gluten free.</li>
            <li>(Actually after the first application, I knew it was awesome).  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and covers well.  </li>
            <li>I got the Light color</li>

            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I use it under mineral makeup for full coverage because it won&#x27;t cover acne all by itself.</li>
            <li>Got a sample from Sephora and had to buy a full size after using it for a week.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could give this five stars because Smashbox is soooooo far superior to any competitor and is better for my skin than acne products(!)</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and this provides great all-day coverage without being greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li>If I want to refresh my face throughout the day, I do a spritz of rose water, and somehow it brings the CC cream back to life.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>The more I use, the more it fades away my dark spots on the cheeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty tan on my skin.</li>
            <li>everything* else (including many different acne medications and moisturizers)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite beauty product of all time and has been incorporated into my daily routine.</li>
            <li>I feel like I have to use powder over top to provide enough coverage, but I really do like how it goes on and feels.</li>
            <li>I got the light to medium, and it is just enough coverage to look dewey and fresh.</li>
            <li>It goes on very orange.</li>
            <li>Goes on very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I was looking for something lighter on my skin and found it in this Smashbox Camera Ready CCCream.  </li>
            <li>This really does create an even look on my skin.</li>
            <li>They like it and use it often so no complaints besides how pricey it is haha.</li>
            <li>up&amp;#34; with the foundation because less is more on aging skin.  </li>
            <li>I do not have to wear BB or any foundation with this particular product.  </li>
            <li>I wish it had a little bit more coverage.</li>
            <li>I set it in place with a little mineral powder and it lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>Within a few days her skin started looking better than ever.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne, and I can tell you that this product covers blemishes while making my skin look dewy and young.</li>
            <li>and it will be not only less effective but have adverse reactions to the skin.</li>
            <li>Not as full a tube as from other venders.</li>
            <li>But the coverage is so natural.</li>
            <li>because the CC doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;set\\&quot; nearly as well.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it glides on smoothly on the skin with or without a sponge or a beauty blender.</li>
            <li>Also has helped with diminishing certain dark spots.</li>
            <li>It really covers up well and makes your skin even toned, covering blemishes and dark spots.</li>

            <li> (Also, am curious why the CC has a slightly lower [30 vs. 35] SPF than the Smashbox BB cream since they have identical sun-protection ingredients in the exact same ratios).</li>
            <li> FAR darker than one I bought previously that was to be the same color...</li>
            <li> All you have to do is gently apple very tiny dabs of Smash Box to any dark spots on your face and, voila!, the dark spots are temporarily disappeared.  </li>
            <li> This product offers medium coverage, which I like vs. a heavy, caked on look.  </li>
            <li> Have not been using it long enough to know if it is correcting dark spots yet.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s up to you if you want to finish it off with a loose powder or not...</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way.</li>
            <li> little pricey, but I only use a pea sized amount for each application, so I have a feeling the 1 oz.</li>
            <li> Content seemed not to last as long as usual.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 10 different BB cream brands (literally) and keep coming back to Smashbox.</li>
            <li> After a few hours it&#x27;s turns gritty and crumbles.</li>
            <li> If you sweat the CC will bead and run, which was not my experience with the impervious-to-everything-never-needed-freshening Smashbox BB the previous summer.</li>
            <li> Kind of shocking.</li>
            <li> I will add that I&#x27;m not sure yet if it is &amp;#34;Dark Spot Correcting&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m giving it time</li>
            <li> But with this cream her skin looks creamy and not the least bit blotchy or uneven.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Super fast shipping! Great price and just like I bought it at the makeup counter! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne, and I can tell you that this product covers blemishes while making my skin look dewy and young. This is the best product I have ever put on my face ever. I always get compliments on my skin when I use it. I would recommend this product everytime.  A little definitely goes a long way. But the coverage is so natural. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost six months now, and I love it!  It goes on smoothly and covers well.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I got the Light color but it&#x27;s still pretty tan on my skin. I used a Korean brand before never had pore clogged but this one gave my skin problem ! It &#x27;s sitting in the drawer now</li>
            <li> The grandchildren loved it</li>
            <li> looks like caked makeup.  After a few hours it&#x27;s turns gritty and crumbles.</li>
            <li> Love this makeup. I use it in place of foundation to the gym or for taking the kids to school. Quick, easy &amp; effective!</li>
            <li> Content seemed not to last as long as usual.  Not as full a tube as from other venders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 10 different BB cream brands (literally) and keep coming back to Smashbox. While everyone&#x27;s skin is different (mine is oily), for me this is the only brand that truly feels weightless, and unlike *everything* else (including many different acne medications and moisturizers) the Smashbox BB actually cleared my skin. Kind of shocking. So of course when the CCs started coming out I turned to Smashbox, and it has indeed provided equivalent skin-clarity benefits while *somewhat* fading freckles and sun damage. (Don&#x27;t expect miracles.) I wish I could give this five stars because Smashbox is soooooo far superior to any competitor and is better for my skin than acne products(!) -- however, next summer I&#x27;ll be going back to the BB (Smashbox, please keep making it!) because the CC doesn&#x27;t seem to \\&quot;set\\&quot; nearly as well. If you sweat the CC will bead and run, which was not my experience with the impervious-to-everything-never-needed-freshening Smashbox BB the previous summer. (Also, am curious why the CC has a slightly lower [30 vs. 35] SPF than the Smashbox BB cream since they have identical sun-protection ingredients in the exact same ratios).</li>
            <li> It goes on very orange. Gets lighter as it spreads around. Blends very well and feels nice on skin. Haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my skin after I take it off but that&#x27;s okay. I use it under mineral makeup for full coverage because it won&#x27;t cover acne all by itself. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like this makeup. It covers well and has a nice texture. It wears well; I wear a mask at work and it manages to stay fairly well.</li>
            <li> The best c.f. cream I have tried!</li>
            <li> Goes on very well. Have not been using it long enough to know if it is correcting dark spots yet. I wish it had a little bit more coverage. I feel like I have to use powder over top to provide enough coverage, but I really do like how it goes on and feels.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it as a primer under her make-up, but it did not cover her &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34; as desired. She still must use a concealer.</li>
            <li> I do not have to wear BB or any foundation with this particular product.  I got the light to medium, and it is just enough coverage to look dewey and fresh.</li>
            <li> I SO love this foundation! Excellent, smooth coverage, hydrating and leaves a smooth finished. Never cake effect. Also has helped with diminishing certain dark spots. Totally recommend.</li>
            <li> Terrific product.  All you have to do is gently apple very tiny dabs of Smash Box to any dark spots on your face and, voila!, the dark spots are temporarily disappeared.  Great on a date, get it?  Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  Got a sample from Sephora and had to buy a full size after using it for a week.  (Actually after the first application, I knew it was awesome).  I will say, though, that I have pretty good skin.  Minor blemishes sometimes, pretty even skin tone, just a few acne scars on occasion, etc, so that may be a factor in why it works so well for me.  This product offers medium coverage, which I like vs. a heavy, caked on look.  It evens out your skin tone, gives a dewy glow and just makes your skin look healthier.  I love that you can&#x27;t feel it on your face.  It also seemed to last all day (I didn&#x27;t use a finishing powder on it) and I didn&#x27;t find any oiliness in my t-zone as the day went on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little pricey, but I only use a pea sized amount for each application, so I have a feeling the 1 oz. will last awhile. Also, have to love the SPF 30.</li>
            <li> This is great foundation &amp; most especially its gluten free. Goes on smooth, not greasy &amp; covers really good.</li>
            <li> This product seems the same as you can purchase in the store.  Great Price</li>
            <li> I always use Estee Lauder foundation - until now, that is.  I was looking for something lighter on my skin and found it in this Smashbox Camera Ready CCCream.  I will add that I&#x27;m not sure yet if it is &amp;#34;Dark Spot Correcting&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m giving it time - miracles can happen!  I am in my 70s and it was time to &amp;#34;lighten up&amp;#34; with the foundation because less is more on aging skin.  This really does create an even look on my skin.</li>
            <li> FAR darker than one I bought previously that was to be the same color...</li>
            <li> The more I use, the more it fades away my dark spots on the cheeks.</li>
            <li> One of my favourite BB/CC creams!</li>
            <li> excellent service, love this product</li>
            <li> Recently my wife added this CC Cream to her morning beauty routine. Within a few days her skin started looking better than ever. She has a tendency to have rosacea. But with this cream her skin looks creamy and not the least bit blotchy or uneven. She continues to use a tinted foundation. The combination of this and the cream makes her skin look really nice.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift. They like it and use it often so no complaints besides how pricey it is haha.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use my CC cream on a daily basis. I have combination skin, and this provides great all-day coverage without being greasy or heavy. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite beauty product of all time and has been incorporated into my daily routine. It glides on smoothly and conceals all unwanted blemishes. I set it in place with a little mineral powder and it lasts most of the day. If I want to refresh my face throughout the day, I do a spritz of rose water, and somehow it brings the CC cream back to life. I have heard before that sometimes your face can get &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; to a beauty product and it will be not only less effective but have adverse reactions to the skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 10 months and have not noticed that happening.</li>
            <li> My favorite foundation! Blends well and it is great for layering powder.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a better-looking made up skin/face before using this brilliant CC cream! It really covers up well and makes your skin even toned, covering blemishes and dark spots. It has a magnificent powder finish so it&#x27;s up to you if you want to finish it off with a loose powder or not...wither way is OK. A little goes a long way and it glides on smoothly on the skin with or without a sponge or a beauty blender. This on e of the best makeup items I have ever owned.</li>
