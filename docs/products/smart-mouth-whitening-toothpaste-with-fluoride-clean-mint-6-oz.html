            <li>kind.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t taste as good as Crest, but it&#x27;s not terrible tasting either.</li>
            <li>Nice taste.</li>
            <li>nice brand name and good association with the famous mouthwash</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d better to know that the quality of these brands are not as good as their manufacturers and distributors claim .</li>
            <li>couple of days after receiving and setting up the 2-part mixing arrangement on the bathroom counter between my wife and I  wash areas, I asked her how she liked</li>
            <li>For a very clean feeling mouth.... give this a try!</li>
            <li>It remove your stinking breath, clean and whiten your teeth thoroughly, and it has very nice smell.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and happy with product.</li>

            <li>JUST GOT THE TOOTHPASTE AND LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>and I notice more sensitivity when I use this</li>
            <li>Love SmartMouth Toothpaste.after</li>
            <li>best toothpaste, only thing it doesn&#x27;t do is whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li>What more do you want.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not even sure at the moment if it has anise in</li>
            <li>I love the flavor and consistency of the paste.</li>
            <li>Love your mouthwash.  </li>
            <li>Love Love Love this product it works.</li>
            <li>I use it in combination with smartmouth mouthwash most days.  </li>
            <li>read the FDA website for more details.. including associated deaths... not kidding!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am NOW IN LOVE with Jason&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I should write to their self-named website to ask why on earth they included FD&amp;C Blue 1 in their otherwise great product!</li>
            <li>it has a screw top instead of the flip top it used to have.</li>
            <li>Glad to find a source in which to purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>The mouthwash is even better.  </li>
            <li>I love this toothpaste....</li>
            <li>I love it too and use it after I eat a garlicky meal or anything strong.</li>
            <li>Love the freshness and clean feeling  of this item.</li>
            <li>It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very mild mint</li>
            <li>Great product, glad to finally find it.  </li>
            <li>I asked the community is this toothpaste has strong mint</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s strong</li>
            <li>Leaves a very clean and fresh feeling!</li>
            <li>The mouthwash does a good job when used with other toothpastes but this toothpaste is more effective when used with the mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best not to drink water or anything for a half hour or so after using it.  </li>
            <li>It is more of that great clean mouth feeling that last for hours.  </li>
            <li>To be truthful the toothpaste does the whole job!!</li>
            <li>It made a huge difference in our over all oral mouth care.</li>
            <li>I do not feel like my teeth are as smooth as they could be.</li>
            <li>Even my dentist can&#x27;t believe how plaque free my teeth have become.</li>
            <li>This product does not provide any better protection for fresh breath.  </li>
            <li>Is a great product, but I ordered three times expecting the one with withening, but I always received the same without withening.</li>
            <li>Enjoy your morning, start it with SmartMouth toothpaste followed by the mouthwash.</li>
            <li>My breath was fine, but it didn&#x27;t have the clean feeling.</li>
            <li>The taste is a very fresh mint.  </li>
            <li>I hope that the original toothpaste and mouthwash formulas become available again soon.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it!  </li>

            <li>We have a big stock at home, even bought to close family so they could tried it too, and they also were very satisfied.</li>

            <li>I quickly found [[ASIN:B001T8MTWO Jason Healthy Mouth Plus CoQ10 Fluoride Gel Toothpaste, Tea Tree, Cinnamon, 6 Ounce]] and it was cheaper individually on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save than the 3 pack tubes.  </li>

            <li>Even when you search toothpaste brands in your browser, these names are in the first page .</li>
            <li>How many times have you bought something that you needed to work, and it actually did?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>That said, it is not nearly as effective as the SmartMouth mouthwash but is still good and worthy of five stars.</li>
            <li>The Original TUNG Gel - Tongue Cleaner - Fresh Mint]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel has zinc, and the brush is a short firm bristle design that is good for removing tougne gunk.</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without Smart Mouth.  </li>
            <li>HAVE BEEN USING SMART MOUTH RINSE FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li>Use it in conjunction with Smart Mouth mouth wash</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t return Smart Mouth</li>
            <li>purchased two of the Smart Mouth wash and three tubes of tooth paste that will never be used now.  </li>
            <li>It really seems to work well as an addition to the Smart Mouth mouthwash.</li>
            <li>The Toothpaste lasts all day long, and my mouth always feels fresh and squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li>I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>It really whitens my teeth and chased away plaque.</li>
            <li>The real question is,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, what I did not like is that I could save almost 3 dollars on Drugstore.com with free shipping for this product and if you use regularly that is going add up eventually.</li>
            <li>She maintains a very strict oral hygiene routine using this toothpaste and feels she has improved quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>I really like the mouthwash and the toothpaste for me</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>You should really give it a try.</li>
            <li>It has a bit too much of an anise taste to it...</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t get much toothpaste when you squeeze the tube, so I won&#x27;t need to reorder for a l-o-n-g time.</li>
            <li>The zinc ion technology really works.</li>
            <li>and I really depend on it.  </li>
            <li>, I was sitting on the bar stool in the kitchen waiting on my wife to finish getting ready, when she walked within about 3-foot of me carrying on a conversation.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li>: It hurts my mouth and tongue waaaay too much.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed no one mentions how good it is for sensitivity, or at least I haven&#x27;t seen it in any of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it makes my teeth feel extra clean and the feeling lasts a lot longer than any other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>you have the extra money and you like the \\&quot;dentist clean feeling\\</li>
            <li>Nice taste but does not last long...</li>
            <li>buy the smart mouth wash, a decent brand toothpaste, floss,a decent brand toothbrush,and you are set.</li>
            <li>It makes a huge difference all day long</li>
            <li>but it lasts much longer than a normal tube.  </li>
            <li>Refreshing, tastes good and in combination with SmarthMouth Mouth Wash, it&#x27;s a one/two punch on bad breath.  </li>
            <li>We have used this product for several years and I make sure we have several tubes so that we never are without it.</li>
            <li>my whole family love this toothpaste for the clean feeling it leaves behind.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stupidly I opened the package without reading the ingredients - and found a bright green paste staring back at me.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend these Smartmouth products.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to everyone who values their teeth,gums &amp; the over all health of their mouth...</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND),</li>
            <li>This is a high quality toothpaste.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use any other toothpaste after I used smart mouth it makes my mouth feel so clean all the time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey but not much choice since it isn&#x27;t readily available in bricks-&amp;-mortar stores.</li>
            <li>toothpaste are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li>and all good, but not great</li>
            <li>When you brush it , easily and simply you can feel it deeply cleans your teeth with no exaggeration .</li>
            <li>Cannot live without this toothpaste now.</li>
            <li>you use that new mouth wash again, your breath is bad.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>Have new travel size now in the mouthwash too.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very professional to be chewing gum during meetings, sales calls etc.</li>
            <li>... read my review there to see why (and nope, it&#x27;s a clear gel!  </li>
            <li>You will buy your next package after your first purchase .</li>
            <li>But I continued to try both for the next coulple of days until after using the Toothpaste first and then rinsing thoroughly</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s no small thing.</li>
            <li>the mouthwash is a little strong for my taste,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>went on a quest to cure my problem, I tried brushing after each meal, flossing, refraining from eating spicy food/garlic, using Listerine, asking my dentist for help (they even complimented me how clean my mouth was) but they suggest the above still no results, cleaning my tongue, chewing gum constantly, using Breathrx..</li>
            <li>I tried Smart Mouth anyway, being very very very careful to NOT swallow any of the paste and rinsed very very very very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li>I was elated to see Smart Mouth is a local St. Louis company, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>rinse/gargle with the same company&#x27;s no-alcohol \\&quot;smart mouth\\&quot; mouthwash (</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a Closys (toothpaste &amp; mouthwash) user for 3 years and found the Smart Mouth system at my local Walmart.  </li>
            <li>the original \\&quot;tri-oral action\\&quot; was less embarrassing).  </li>
            <li>The only real difference is either the taste or if it is designed for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>It was having an effect on my professional life.</li>
            <li>and wow it&#x27;s a GOD SEND</li>
            <li>So far, this product is working.  </li>
            <li>Also cured my issue with &amp;#34;stringy saliva&amp;#34; that my dentist said was natural for some and no way to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li>He uses this daily and it really helps.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I was looking for a different brand with a real quality to get rid of these 2 brands forever</li>
            <li>I knew this toothpaste made my breath fresher, but realized how much when I ran out and used a different product for a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li>You can easily get the same freshness from other brands of tooth paste such as the Aquafresh extreme clean or the arm and hammer line.</li>
            <li>This is a very good toothpaste and when used in conjunction with the mouthwash - totally eliminates bad breath.</li>
            <li>For some reason I thought it would be a gel, but is is a solid light aqua green color.  </li>
            <li>There is a reason why this stuff is always on a waiting list --- because it works, like no other toothpaste can.</li>
            <li>Not exactly but pretty close.  </li>
            <li>It works well for whitening while being relatively gentle compared to other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li>I have to say my mouth feels much cleaner after using this as opposed to any other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li>I absolutely refuse to use any other toothpaste brand.  </li>
            <li>At least your teeth got clean.</li>
            <li>no complaints from the wife and no dry</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for people who have bad breath due to dry mouth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Taking nothing for granted before going to bed the that night, I again rinsed my mouth thoroughly with the Smart Mouth.&lt;br /&gt;After being in bed for a few minutes my wife rolled over and started a conversation.  </li>
            <li>These are not as good as smarth mouth in terms of bad breath prevention, however that what the 2 step mouth wash is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, this toothpaste is good against bad breathe.</li>

            <li> kind.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t taste as good as Crest, but it&#x27;s not terrible tasting either.</li>
            <li> Nice taste.</li>
            <li> nice brand name and good association with the famous mouthwash</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d better to know that the quality of these brands are not as good as their manufacturers and distributors claim .</li>
            <li> couple of days after receiving and setting up the 2-part mixing arrangement on the bathroom counter between my wife and I  wash areas, I asked her how she liked</li>
            <li> For a very clean feeling mouth.... give this a try!</li>
            <li> It remove your stinking breath, clean and whiten your teeth thoroughly, and it has very nice smell.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and happy with product.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest the SmartMouth mouthwash also!</li>
            <li> I always worried that he was grossing his clients out:)  </li>

            <li> I like this better than the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> JUST GOT THE TOOTHPASTE AND LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> and I notice more sensitivity when I use this</li>
            <li> Love SmartMouth Toothpaste.after</li>
            <li> best toothpaste, only thing it doesn&#x27;t do is whiten your teeth.</li>
            <li> What more do you want.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not even sure at the moment if it has anise in</li>
            <li> I love the flavor and consistency of the paste.</li>
            <li> Love your mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product it works.</li>
            <li> I use it in combination with smartmouth mouthwash most days.  </li>
            <li> read the FDA website for more details.. including associated deaths... not kidding!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am NOW IN LOVE with Jason&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I should write to their self-named website to ask why on earth they included FD&amp;C Blue 1 in their otherwise great product!</li>
            <li> it has a screw top instead of the flip top it used to have.</li>
            <li> Glad to find a source in which to purchase it again.  </li>
            <li> The mouthwash is even better.  </li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste....</li>
            <li> I love it too and use it after I eat a garlicky meal or anything strong.</li>
            <li> Love the freshness and clean feeling  of this item.</li>
            <li> It was shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very mild mint</li>
            <li> Great product, glad to finally find it.  </li>
            <li> I asked the community is this toothpaste has strong mint</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s strong</li>
            <li> Leaves a very clean and fresh feeling!</li>
            <li> The mouthwash does a good job when used with other toothpastes but this toothpaste is more effective when used with the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best not to drink water or anything for a half hour or so after using it.  </li>
            <li> It is more of that great clean mouth feeling that last for hours.  </li>
            <li> To be truthful the toothpaste does the whole job!!</li>
            <li> It made a huge difference in our over all oral mouth care.</li>
            <li> I do not feel like my teeth are as smooth as they could be.</li>
            <li> Even my dentist can&#x27;t believe how plaque free my teeth have become.</li>
            <li> This product does not provide any better protection for fresh breath.  </li>
            <li> Is a great product, but I ordered three times expecting the one with withening, but I always received the same without withening.</li>
            <li> Enjoy your morning, start it with SmartMouth toothpaste followed by the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> My breath was fine, but it didn&#x27;t have the clean feeling.</li>
            <li> The taste is a very fresh mint.  </li>
            <li> I hope that the original toothpaste and mouthwash formulas become available again soon.</li>
            <li> but it is worth it!  </li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without Smart Mouth.  </li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING SMART MOUTH RINSE FOR YEARS.</li>
            <li> Use it in conjunction with Smart Mouth mouth wash</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t return Smart Mouth</li>
            <li> purchased two of the Smart Mouth wash and three tubes of tooth paste that will never be used now.  </li>
            <li> It really seems to work well as an addition to the Smart Mouth mouthwash.</li>
            <li> The Toothpaste lasts all day long, and my mouth always feels fresh and squeeky clean.  </li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It really whitens my teeth and chased away plaque.</li>
            <li> The real question is,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, what I did not like is that I could save almost 3 dollars on Drugstore.com with free shipping for this product and if you use regularly that is going add up eventually.</li>
            <li> She maintains a very strict oral hygiene routine using this toothpaste and feels she has improved quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> I really like the mouthwash and the toothpaste for me</li>

            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> You should really give it a try.</li>
            <li> It has a bit too much of an anise taste to it...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get much toothpaste when you squeeze the tube, so I won&#x27;t need to reorder for a l-o-n-g time.</li>
            <li> The zinc ion technology really works.</li>
            <li> and I really depend on it.  </li>
            <li> , I was sitting on the bar stool in the kitchen waiting on my wife to finish getting ready, when she walked within about 3-foot of me carrying on a conversation.&lt;br /&gt;She</li>
            <li> : It hurts my mouth and tongue waaaay too much.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed no one mentions how good it is for sensitivity, or at least I haven&#x27;t seen it in any of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes my teeth feel extra clean and the feeling lasts a lot longer than any other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> you have the extra money and you like the \\&quot;dentist clean feeling\\</li>
            <li> Nice taste but does not last long...</li>
            <li> buy the smart mouth wash, a decent brand toothpaste, floss,a decent brand toothbrush,and you are set.</li>
            <li> It makes a huge difference all day long</li>
            <li> but it lasts much longer than a normal tube.  </li>
            <li> Refreshing, tastes good and in combination with SmarthMouth Mouth Wash, it&#x27;s a one/two punch on bad breath.  </li>
            <li> We have used this product for several years and I make sure we have several tubes so that we never are without it.</li>
            <li> my whole family love this toothpaste for the clean feeling it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stupidly I opened the package without reading the ingredients - and found a bright green paste staring back at me.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend these Smartmouth products.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to everyone who values their teeth,gums &amp; the over all health of their mouth...</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND),</li>
            <li> This is a high quality toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other toothpaste after I used smart mouth it makes my mouth feel so clean all the time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey but not much choice since it isn&#x27;t readily available in bricks-&amp;-mortar stores.</li>
            <li> toothpaste are pretty much the same.</li>
            <li> and all good, but not great</li>
            <li> When you brush it , easily and simply you can feel it deeply cleans your teeth with no exaggeration .</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this toothpaste now.</li>
            <li> you use that new mouth wash again, your breath is bad.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> Have new travel size now in the mouthwash too.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very professional to be chewing gum during meetings, sales calls etc.</li>
            <li> ... read my review there to see why (and nope, it&#x27;s a clear gel!  </li>
            <li> You will buy your next package after your first purchase .</li>
            <li> But I continued to try both for the next coulple of days until after using the Toothpaste first and then rinsing thoroughly</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no small thing.</li>
            <li> the mouthwash is a little strong for my taste,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> went on a quest to cure my problem, I tried brushing after each meal, flossing, refraining from eating spicy food/garlic, using Listerine, asking my dentist for help (they even complimented me how clean my mouth was) but they suggest the above still no results, cleaning my tongue, chewing gum constantly, using Breathrx..</li>
            <li> I tried Smart Mouth anyway, being very very very careful to NOT swallow any of the paste and rinsed very very very very thoroughly.  </li>
            <li> I was elated to see Smart Mouth is a local St. Louis company, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> rinse/gargle with the same company&#x27;s no-alcohol \\&quot;smart mouth\\&quot; mouthwash (</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Closys (toothpaste &amp; mouthwash) user for 3 years and found the Smart Mouth system at my local Walmart.  </li>
            <li> the original \\&quot;tri-oral action\\&quot; was less embarrassing).  </li>
            <li> The only real difference is either the taste or if it is designed for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> It was having an effect on my professional life.</li>
            <li> and wow it&#x27;s a GOD SEND</li>
            <li> So far, this product is working.  </li>
            <li> Also cured my issue with &amp;#34;stringy saliva&amp;#34; that my dentist said was natural for some and no way to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> He uses this daily and it really helps.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I was looking for a different brand with a real quality to get rid of these 2 brands forever</li>
            <li> I knew this toothpaste made my breath fresher, but realized how much when I ran out and used a different product for a couple of weeks!</li>
            <li> You can easily get the same freshness from other brands of tooth paste such as the Aquafresh extreme clean or the arm and hammer line.</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothpaste and when used in conjunction with the mouthwash - totally eliminates bad breath.</li>
            <li> For some reason I thought it would be a gel, but is is a solid light aqua green color.  </li>
            <li> There is a reason why this stuff is always on a waiting list --- because it works, like no other toothpaste can.</li>
            <li> Not exactly but pretty close.  </li>
            <li> It works well for whitening while being relatively gentle compared to other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I have to say my mouth feels much cleaner after using this as opposed to any other toothpaste I have tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely refuse to use any other toothpaste brand.  </li>
            <li> At least your teeth got clean.</li>
            <li> no complaints from the wife and no dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for people who have bad breath due to dry mouth.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Taking nothing for granted before going to bed the that night, I again rinsed my mouth thoroughly with the Smart Mouth.&lt;br /&gt;After being in bed for a few minutes my wife rolled over and started a conversation.  </li>
            <li> These are not as good as smarth mouth in terms of bad breath prevention, however that what the 2 step mouth wash is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, this toothpaste is good against bad breathe.</li>
            <li> After using this toothpaste, I will never go back to the sugary tasting mint flavor of nearly every other brand.  </li>
            <li> A few hours later, right on queue, the EXTREME GI ISSUES found me doubled over in pain, worshipping the porcelain throne again, wishing I had never laid eyes on this product.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I normally use sensadyne toothpaste for sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> And yes, for all smarties out there, we have even seen medical professionals to determine if there could be an underlying health problem causing her bad breath, and to date, she&#x27;s healthy!</li>
            <li> I feel the Smartmouth toothpaste and cost is not necessary as long as I use the mouth wash.</li>
            <li> but I have found that a tube seems to last a long time!  </li>
            <li> I could eat anything no matter how sweet, sour, hot, or cold.  </li>
            <li> otherwise, i won&#x27;t be buying this because this is more expensive than any other toothpastes out there.  </li>
            <li> They only try to fill markets to deprive you of having any other options especially in Asian markets .</li>
            <li> After reading the glowing reviews, I desperately wanted to LOVE</li>
            <li> They lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> After having gone through numerous other toothpaste and breath products out there</li>
            <li> You need to scrape your tongue BEFORE brushing, brush with a dry toothbrush, and also brush your tongue after brushing your teeth.  </li>
            <li> Finally a product that really works towards eliminating bad breath, highly recommend its use, with the mouth wash from the same brand.</li>
            <li> It seems to do much more to eleminate bad breath for a long time as compared to the Crest products I was using.  </li>
            <li> This toothpaste is my first defense against bad breath and it really works.  </li>
            <li> Not what I ordered &amp; made my mouth dry (drier)!</li>
            <li> The tubes seem to empty down to the last drop.  </li>
            <li> this stuff really works to fight the bad breath that certain foods bring.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a zinc based product that doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling dried out like traditional tooth pastes.  </li>
            <li> I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but have to admit it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Plain &amp; simple, it works!</li>
            <li> As a banker I had to come into close contact with people constantly, I could tell the clients were not pleased...</li>
            <li> Teeth feel cleaner than with other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> I do not use any other brand but this toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Other than that,  nothing out of the ordinary compared to your leading commercial brands in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> That petroleum based color is known to be a toxin to some people AND it always gives me EXTREME GI ISSUES (no details.. it would be TMI for this venue....</li>
            <li> So it will make your breath feel fresh, but the bad breath properties will not out last the performance of the mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much less of this is needed on your brush as compared to other toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> It leaves your teeth feeling smooth and the zinc keeps bad breath in check.</li>
            <li> The tube of the tung gel can last you at least 3 months.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t reorder as the price point was not worth it for the build up of what it&#x27;s claims were to provide.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like I use less.  </li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter is the one this was purchased for after having tried every other on/off market remedy for her constant bad breath.</li>
            <li> The toothpaste has a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling when you brush your teeth, but it just takes a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little time to get used to the taste of it</li>
            <li> Your toothpaste, however, did little for me.  </li>
            <li> Little over price.</li>
            <li> A little pricey.  </li>
            <li> The opening for the product to be dispensed is small, which helps cut down on waste when spreading on your toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t do anything for bad breadth.  </li>
            <li> It really helps with bad breath.</li>
            <li> No more &amp;#34;store brands&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how the results will be till I go to the dentist.  </li>
            <li> Nothing out of the ordinary here.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t make this same statement about SmartMouth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on it, but it is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This tooth paste at least includes zinc</li>
            <li> I used to tend to get sores in my mouth quite frequently, not sure why, but SmartMouth has eliminated them!</li>
            <li> I used to order from QVC but the prices are so much less expensive this way.....</li>
            <li> Does what it says for a bit less expensive than the stores charge.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive.</li>
            <li> had noticed the same thing from the wash, but not as bad from the Toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> it is NOT a good thing...</li>
            <li> whatever reason my breathe was not pleasant</li>
            <li> dumb name-</li>
            <li> It leaves my mouth dry and with a bad taste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Still I say try it and see, the worse case scenario is you get a toothpaste that you feel was mediocre and it didn&#x27;t hurt or help anything.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> This seems expensive</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my pharmacy doesn&#x27;t carry it</li>
            <li> No more GI ISSUES!!!!</li>
            <li> Have used it before, I know it&#x27;s a bit expensive for toothpaste, but I never have bad breath.</li>
            <li> It does kill the bad breathe</li>
            <li> Having some background in chemistry, the formulation makes sense as the zinc+  chelates with the sulfates (cause of bad breath) and precipitated it out.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of restorative work in my mouth, root canals, crowns, bridges, and often times that causes bad breathe.</li>
            <li> I had Bad Sinus Breath until I tried SmartMouth toothpaste the mouth wash and the mints.</li>
            <li> your breath is bad and you never have bad breath.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> This has zinc in it, which creates an environment in the mouth that bacteria can&#x27;t handle, so bad breath doesn&#x27;t return soon.  </li>
            <li> , I often got weird looks from people and often people backed up, it was a terrible feeling.</li>
            <li> NO :-(  </li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I HATE TO RUN OUT OF IT.</li>
            <li> it whitens your teeth and gets rid of bad breath!</li>
            <li> You literally don&#x27;t get bad breath throughout the day or while sleeping!  </li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the SmartMouth products, then you probably have bad breath!  </li>
            <li> It does NOT COVER bad breath, it ELIMINATES it!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> omg I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> In my view, it is Disgusting!!!</li>
            <li> After using this for 6 months, I received the worst dental cleaning ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great toothpaste when combined use with Smartmouth oral rinse. My dentist is quiet when it comes to my recommending smartmouth product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using SmartMouth mouthwash for years. I saw this one day and decided to give it a try. I&#x27;m a freak about cleanliness and smells and this has just become apart of my daily routine too now. I can&#x27;t go anywhere without this AND the mouthwash! Minty but not the &amp;#34;OW MINT&amp;#34; kind. Leaves a very clean and fresh feeling! (And smell!)</li>
            <li> This is the very best toothpaste on the market.  It makes your teeth feel like you just had them cleaned at the dentist except no yucky grit!</li>
            <li> this product is really very good!  otherwise, i won&#x27;t be buying this because this is more expensive than any other toothpastes out there.  but it is worth it!  it whitens your teeth and gets rid of bad breath!</li>
            <li> I really like this toothpaste.  Refreshing, tastes good and in combination with SmarthMouth Mouth Wash, it&#x27;s a one/two punch on bad breath.  It&#x27;s a bit pricey but not much choice since it isn&#x27;t readily available in bricks-&amp;-mortar stores.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To understand why I gave this product a 5 stats let me tell you my life story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For whatever reason my breathe was not pleasant, I often got weird looks from people and often people backed up, it was a terrible feeling. As a banker I had to come into close contact with people constantly, I could tell the clients were not pleased... It was having an effect on my professional life. Let&#x27;s not even talk about my personal life; I dare not go on a date with my problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went on a quest to cure my problem, I tried brushing after each meal, flossing, refraining from eating spicy food/garlic, using Listerine, asking my dentist for help (they even complimented me how clean my mouth was) but they suggest the above still no results, cleaning my tongue, chewing gum constantly, using Breathrx.. you name I did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon this and wow it&#x27;s a GOD SEND, it has given me my life back.. It does kill the bad breathe well but the claims that your breathe will smell good in the morning is limited, also I noticed the effects wane after eating a meal so I bring it with me to work.. Overall an extremely good product.</li>
            <li> The best toothpaste. It really whitens my teeth and chased away plaque.</li>
            <li> This is the only toothpaste that works for my breath. It says what it does.&lt;br /&gt;Only exception being, if you have strong coffee or very spicy foods.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s perfect for people who have bad breath due to dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Much less of this is needed on your brush as compared to other toothpaste.  It seems to do much more to eleminate bad breath for a long time as compared to the Crest products I was using.  Doesn&#x27;t taste as good as Crest, but it&#x27;s not terrible tasting either.</li>
            <li> This is the toothpaste that used to be Tri-Oral....It is the greatest for clean teeth, no more cavities and the cleanest breath ever...... I used to order from QVC but the prices are so much less expensive this way.....I also order their breath mints.....</li>
            <li> I love SmartMouth toothpaste and mouthwash! Plain &amp; simple, it works! I especially find the toothpaste a quick and easy way to keep my mouth healthy. I used to tend to get sores in my mouth quite frequently, not sure why, but SmartMouth has eliminated them! Also helps the breath! I&#x27;m sold on it, but it is hard to find in stores. I used to get it at Walgreen&#x27;s but guess I&#x27;ll have to order it online now. Not enough people know about it or... want to pay the extra money for it I guess. But, it does work!</li>
            <li> Having some background in chemistry, the formulation makes sense as the zinc+  chelates with the sulfates (cause of bad breath) and precipitated it out. Teeth feel cleaner than with other toothpastes.</li>
            <li> This was a good product. My family used it every day. It made a huge difference in our over all oral mouth care. Thank you very much for the product.</li>
            <li> Not what I ordered &amp; made my mouth dry (drier)! Great w/ whitening.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband! He had tried every remedy out there.  He is a salesman, so I always worried that he was grossing his clients out:)  It isn&#x27;t very professional to be chewing gum during meetings, sales calls etc. Certs, tic tacs, etc are only temporary fixes (maybe 10 seconds after they are gone) This Smartmouth toothpaste works ALL DAY!  He uses the toothpaste AND mouthwash 2 x a day. (am and pm)  I HIGHLY recommend these Smartmouth products.  I think they have whitened his teeth a bit as well. The taste is a very fresh mint.  I love it too and use it after I eat a garlicky meal or anything strong. Very good product!  I wish they has the strips like Listerine has though so you could keep some in your wallet or purse.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of the smarth mouth mouth wash and I wanted to try the toothpaste. It has zinc, like the mouthwash. The real question is,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can I use this toothpaste with out the mouth wash...yes and no.&lt;br /&gt;The toothpaste will get you teeth clean squeaky clean and will make your tongue fresh was well. However it does not contain the 2 stage cleaning properties as the mouth wash. So it will make your breath feel fresh, but the bad breath properties will not out last the performance of the mouth wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its it better then most toothpaste on the market? yes&lt;br /&gt;Most toothpaste are pretty much the same. The only real difference is either the taste or if it is designed for sensitive teeth. This tooth paste at least includes zinc so it has breath freshening properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this worth the money? No&lt;br /&gt;If you have the extra money and you like the \\&quot;dentist clean feeling\\&quot; then by all means. You can easily get the same freshness from other brands of tooth paste such as the Aquafresh extreme clean or the arm and hammer line. These are not as good as smarth mouth in terms of bad breath prevention, however that what the 2 step mouth wash is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy the smart mouth wash, a decent brand toothpaste, floss,a decent brand toothbrush,and you are set. Also a tounge brush&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00005BAWO The Original TUNG Brush - Tongue Cleaner with TUNG Gel Sample]]&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00005BJ92 The Original TUNG Gel - Tongue Cleaner - Fresh Mint]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel has zinc, and the brush is a short firm bristle design that is good for removing tougne gunk. The tube of the tung gel can last you at least 3 months. You do not need alot. This would be a better investment then the smart mouth paste.</li>
            <li> By now the world have known the magic of smarthmouth mouth wash and the toothpaste carries the same phenomenon. However, what I did not like is that I could save almost 3 dollars on Drugstore.com with free shipping for this product and if you use regularly that is going add up eventually. So I recommend this product but you can find a good deal elsewhere too.</li>
            <li> have used the mouthwash for years and love it</li>
            <li> So far, this product is working.  I will let you know when I have used it all.  I also bought the 12-hour mouth wash.</li>
            <li> Love this tooth paste.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 years now and dental check ups are good.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is exactly what it described.  It remove your stinking breath, clean and whiten your teeth thoroughly, and it has very nice smell.</li>
            <li> Cannot live without this toothpaste now. I just love it. This combined with the smart mouth advanced mouthwash and you&#x27;re set. Excellent toothpaste. I recommend getting the 3-pack, its cheaper that way. never saw this in stores, was so happy to find it here on amazon. I have this on subscribe &amp; save. LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love this toothpaste!</li>
            <li> Great with mouth wash</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter is the one this was purchased for after having tried every other on/off market remedy for her constant bad breath. She could not even stand the taste of her own mouth all day and especially when she woke up in the morning. She maintains a very strict oral hygiene routine using this toothpaste and feels she has improved quite a bit.  I would agree as I never notice her breath anymore, so big thumbs up here. And yes, for all smarties out there, we have even seen medical professionals to determine if there could be an underlying health problem causing her bad breath, and to date, she&#x27;s healthy!</li>
            <li> Works well. Nice taste. Recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it makes my teeth feel extra clean and the feeling lasts a lot longer than any other toothpaste.  I strongly suggest the SmartMouth mouthwash also!</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste!!</li>
            <li> I really like the mouthwash and the toothpaste for me is okay. I do not feel like my teeth are as smooth as they could be. Well I will use it since I got a pack of 3.</li>
            <li> I do not use any other brand but this toothpaste. It really works!</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine. My mouth feels cleaner, longer. Worth a try. Not anymore expensive than most toothpastes. Doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use three SmartMouth products daily - this toothpaste, [[ASIN:B001ET7IY2 SmartMouth Alcohol-Free Mouthwash, Fresh Mint, 16-Ounce Box (Pack of 2)]], and [[ASIN:B000MUH34E SmartMouth Sugarfree Gum, Great Mint Flavor, 12 packs]].  This combination works well for me.  My only complaint is that the SmartMouth products are on the pricey side, but I think they are worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is a very good toothpaste and when used in conjunction with the mouthwash - totally eliminates bad breath. The mouthwash does a good job when used with other toothpastes but this toothpaste is more effective when used with the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Really works. Big size tube, good value. I&#x27;ll buy it again. I like this better than the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without Smart Mouth.  After having gone through numerous other toothpaste and breath products out there I I&#x27;ve found Smart Mouth to be the one reliable product for fresh breath.  It&#x27;s a zinc based product that doesn&#x27;t leave your mouth feeling dried out like traditional tooth pastes.  As with any mouth regiment though, I would recommend tongue scraping and a corresponding mouth rinse.  Would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like the mouth wash much better and probably would prefer to use the normal toothpaste vs. this.  Good value for 3 tubes.  They lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Does what it says for a bit less expensive than the stores charge. Keeps my mouth fresh. I also use the mouthwash. With the two products my breath stays fresh for 10 to 12 hrs.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my Dentist who uses it herself. My hubby and I both use it and his gums look wonderful. He had lots of problems with gum disease and this product has helped tremendously. Thanks for the fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> HAVE BEEN USING SMART MOUTH RINSE FOR YEARS. JUST GOT THE TOOTHPASTE AND LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Makes your mouth feel extremely fresh and clean (stripped of buildup).  Also cured my issue with &amp;#34;stringy saliva&amp;#34; that my dentist said was natural for some and no way to get rid of it.  No more &amp;#34;store brands&amp;#34; for me.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - I first used the Smart Mouth mouth wash for several years - it works amazingly.  I never knew they also made toothpaste - so when I saw this on Amazon - I tried it.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> I have the toothpaste, the mouthwash and the mints.  I think they all work great.  The toothpaste has a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; feeling when you brush your teeth, but it just takes a little getting used to.  My only complaint is that I normally use sensadyne toothpaste for sensitive teeth and I notice more sensitivity when I use this but I feel it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve done some research and this is a highly recommended toothpaste, imparting a clean and fresh feeling that lasts. Good purchase and recommended!</li>
            <li> I like the Smart Mouth tooth paste because it leaves a clean feeling in my mouth and it leaves my breath feeling fresh for hours after. When used with the Smart Mouth mouse wash the fresh breath lasts a lot longer.</li>
            <li> This is a good toothpaste and I would recommend it but I now wish it would have had a tooth whitener in it.</li>
            <li> Love SmartMouth Toothpaste.after brushing you feel like you&#x27;ve just come from the dentist from your 6th mo.cleaning. I will never go back to buying over the counter toothpaste again.I highly recommend this product to everyone who values their teeth,gums &amp; the over all health of their mouth... but this is only toothpaste,it doesn&#x27;t take the place of routine checkup&#x27;s @ your Dentist... Thank you.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and happy with product.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of restorative work in my mouth, root canals, crowns, bridges, and often times that causes bad breathe. The Toothpaste lasts all day long, and my mouth always feels fresh and squeeky clean.  Been brushing with this toothpaste for many years, dont ever want to be without it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is about this brand, but I love it. I had been using their mouth wash for years and took a chance on the tooth paste. It also is very effective. Also bought their breath mints and like them, too.</li>
            <li> I use the Smartmouth mouth wash and have been very pleased with it--excellent product. Makes my breath fresh as described. I thought I&#x27;d give the toothpaste a try as well. My first impressions were that my teeth / mouth did not feel clean. My breath was fine, but it didn&#x27;t have the clean feeling. I got the 3 pack on subscribe and save and am on the last tube. I don&#x27;t think I will reorder it. I am actually quite pleased using Arm &amp; Hammer with baking soda and peroxide or Crest with the Smartmouth mouth wash. I feel the Smartmouth toothpaste and cost is not necessary as long as I use the mouth wash. I will cancel my subscription and continue using the Smartmouth mouth wash.</li>
            <li> I had Bad Sinus Breath until I tried SmartMouth toothpaste the mouth wash and the mints. To be truthful the toothpaste does the whole job!! If you cant afford the mints and mouth wash just get the tooth paste you will be one happy baby breath smelling camper !!</li>
            <li> This toothpaste along withe the SmartMouth rinse is Amazing!  You literally don&#x27;t get bad breath throughout the day or while sleeping!  I can&#x27;t imagine not using this!</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried the SmartMouth products, then you probably have bad breath!  I use the mouthwash and toothpaste, and it is amazing how it changes your mouth&#x27;s chemistry.  You won&#x27;t wake up with morning mouth, and you can go through the day not worrying about offending someone.  I am big into oral hygiene, and I use floss and a tongue scraper(which I HIGHLY RECOMMEND), and I brush often.  I just LOVE the way SmartMouth makes my mouth taste and feel!  Get this and the mouthwash!!!</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product :)</li>
            <li> I have been using the SmartMouth mouth wash for a year now and consider it the BEST mouth wash on the market. And so, a couple of months ago I decided to add the SmartMouth toothpaste to my daily regimen. It works great! The minty taste is not obtrusive. It does NOT COVER bad breath, it ELIMINATES it! Especially when used in conjunction with the mouthwash. There is no chalky afterfeel (some toothpastes make you feel as if you have been chomping on cement...). It leaves your teeth feeling smooth and the zinc keeps bad breath in check. I will repeat again: use it with the SM mouthwash for best results. And don&#x27;t forget to brush your tongue! ;o)</li>
            <li> best toothpaste, only thing it doesn&#x27;t do is whiten your teeth. your mouth feels clean and your breath is fresh. What more do you want.</li>
            <li> Good taste, texture, does a nice job of making mouth feel cleanly brushed &amp; polished teeth afterward.  Tube design works to enable ever last bit yo be extruded.</li>
            <li> Love the freshness and clean feeling  of this item.</li>
            <li> We have used this product for several years and I make sure we have several tubes so that we never are without it. It works! Try it!</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste out there.  Even my dentist can&#x27;t believe how plaque free my teeth have become.</li>
            <li> Nothing special. Leaves your breath somewhat fresh but does not leave you feeling refreshed after you brush</li>
            <li> Love this toothpaste! Leaves my mouth minty and clean.</li>
            <li> Nice taste but does not last long...the mouthwash is a little strong for my taste,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all good, but not great</li>
            <li> Best tooth paste ever!</li>
            <li> Never makes my mouth feel totally clean. I&#x27;m going back to my Aquafresh foaming toothpaste</li>
            <li> Really works!! No matter what I eat, garlic, coffee, etc. this stuff really works to fight the bad breath that certain foods bring. I use it with the mouthwash and have no need for gum or mints, etc. You should really give it a try. There is a reason why this stuff is always on a waiting list --- because it works, like no other toothpaste can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recomended tooth paste. !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Im a dental hygienist.  This toothpaste really helps my husband have fresh breath.  He has constant post nasal drip and can have some halitosis.  He uses this daily and it really helps.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this toothpaste. It really seems to work well as an addition to the Smart Mouth mouthwash. It was shipped very quickly. I&#x27;m extremely happy with the seller and Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> my whole family love this toothpaste for the clean feeling it leaves behind.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used it before, I know it&#x27;s a bit expensive for toothpaste, but I never have bad breath. And to me you can&#x27;t put a price on.</li>
            <li> nice brand name and good association with the famous mouthwash but it&#x27;s not the same.  it really doesn&#x27;t do anything for bad breadth.  You still have to use the mouthwash for that.</li>
            <li> The first thing I want to say is that this toothpaste isn&#x27;t the best tasting toothpaste.  It&#x27;s not the worst I ever tasted, but it&#x27;s not the best.  It has a bit too much of an anise taste to it...and I&#x27;m not even sure at the moment if it has anise in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, this toothpaste is good against bad breathe. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle worker for me, but I wouldn&#x27;t say I have a problem with it either.  The thing I found this toothpaste helped me with is sensitivity.  For years I&#x27;ve been using SmartMouth.  I could eat anything no matter how sweet, sour, hot, or cold.  It just didn&#x27;t matter.  I&#x27;ve noticed no one mentions how good it is for sensitivity, or at least I haven&#x27;t seen it in any of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I say this.  Give smartmouth a shot.  Everyone is different and this toothpaste may not work on sensitivity for others like it did me.  Still I say try it and see, the worse case scenario is you get a toothpaste that you feel was mediocre and it didn&#x27;t hurt or help anything.  At least your teeth got clean.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a breath-freshing toothpaste for my husband.  This one works o.k.  About the same as any toothpaste on the market.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality toothpaste.  It works well for whitening while being relatively gentle compared to other whitening toothpastes.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that actually WORKS like it claims to</li>
            <li> The SmartMouth Toothpaste has a very nice mint flavor to it. It leaves a fresh taste which seems to last longer than most toothpastes do. It&#x27;s a little expensive. It does make my teeth feel clean. You don&#x27;t get much toothpaste when you squeeze the tube, so I won&#x27;t need to reorder for a l-o-n-g time.</li>
            <li> This toothpaste tastes great and does a better job keeping breath fresh than conventional toothpaste.  That said, it is not nearly as effective as the SmartMouth mouthwash but is still good and worthy of five stars.</li>
            <li> I have found that SmartMouth toothpaste is most effective when used with SmartMouth mouthwash because they complement each other. The zinc ion technology really works.</li>
            <li> Best Toothpaste Ever! It takes a little time to get used to the taste of it however it works fantastically with giving me fresh breath all throughout the day!</li>
            <li> Great on the road when I don&#x27;t  carry the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This product does not provide any better protection for fresh breath.  I would not recommend buying this.  Very disappointed in my purchase.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve just started using this toothpaste so I&#x27;m not sure how the results will be till I go to the dentist.  I love the flavor and consistency of the paste. It&#x27;s in a durable tube.  Only thing I miss is my lift lid.  You have to take it off to get to the paste.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and started using it about 2 weeks ago. I have to say my mouth feels much cleaner after using this as opposed to any other toothpaste I have tried. I also use the SmartMouth rinse which works well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rave about this and I really wanted to be able to sing the praises of this product for breath freshness in particular.  Nothing out of the ordinary here.  One plus to buying this is I find you do use every last drop.  The tubes seem to empty down to the last drop.  Other than that,  nothing out of the ordinary compared to your leading commercial brands in my opinion.  I won&#x27;t reorder as the price point was not worth it for the build up of what it&#x27;s claims were to provide.</li>
            <li> Sorry.  Love your mouthwash.  Does&#x27;t taste great, but boy does it work!!!  Your toothpaste, however, did little for me.  I didn&#x27;t even like the taste.</li>
            <li> I asked the community is this toothpaste has strong mint they replied me \\&quot;yes it&#x27;s strong enough\\&quot; so I bought 6 packs with trust but it&#x27;s very mild mint omg I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product it works.</li>
            <li> Very good product. I have used this before and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> This seems expensive but I have found that a tube seems to last a long time!  I can&#x27;t figure out why but it lasts much longer than a normal tube.  I don&#x27;t feel like I use less.  It seems as good as any toothpaste I&#x27;ve used.  I don&#x27;t see it making my breath any better than a regular toothpaste though.  I use it in combination with smartmouth mouthwash most days.  I think that has an effect... but when I don&#x27;t use it, I don&#x27;t see a difference from regular Crest or Aquafresh or whatever.  This tastes good...no issues there</li>
            <li> This toothpaste is my first defense against bad breath and it really works.  It makes a huge difference all day long and I really depend on it.  Use it in conjunction with Smart Mouth mouth wash and it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve found.  Unfortunately my pharmacy doesn&#x27;t carry it so I have to order it online.  Thank goodness I can.</li>
            <li> After reading the glowing reviews, I desperately wanted to LOVE [[ASIN:B001ET7HQG SmartMouth Toothpaste, Mint, 6-Ounce Tubes  (Pack of 3)]], afterall, I bought a 3-pack.  I was elated to see Smart Mouth is a local St. Louis company, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stupidly I opened the package without reading the ingredients - and found a bright green paste staring back at me.  OH NO :-(  I quickly read the ingredients - darn.  FD&amp;C Blue 1.  That petroleum based color is known to be a toxin to some people AND it always gives me EXTREME GI ISSUES (no details.. it would be TMI for this venue.... it is NOT a good thing... read the FDA website for more details.. including associated deaths... not kidding!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soo.. I tried Smart Mouth anyway, being very very very careful to NOT swallow any of the paste and rinsed very very very very thoroughly.  UGH.  A few hours later, right on queue, the EXTREME GI ISSUES found me doubled over in pain, worshipping the porcelain throne again, wishing I had never laid eyes on this product.  But what was I to do? I was otherwise out of toothpaste... (I&#x27;ve since learned to use baking soda and spearmint essential oil when I&#x27;m out of toothpaste!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.. Amazon never fails me!  I quickly found [[ASIN:B001T8MTWO Jason Healthy Mouth Plus CoQ10 Fluoride Gel Toothpaste, Tea Tree, Cinnamon, 6 Ounce]] and it was cheaper individually on Amazon&#x27;s Subscribe and Save than the 3 pack tubes.  I am NOW IN LOVE with Jason&#x27;s... read my review there to see why (and nope, it&#x27;s a clear gel!  No more GI ISSUES!!!! yeah!!!!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I couldn&#x27;t return Smart Mouth I gave the 3 tubes away to others... I should write to their self-named website to ask why on earth they included FD&amp;C Blue 1 in their otherwise great product!</li>
            <li> my husband loves this toothpaste which you can no longer buy in store. so its great I can get 3 tubes at a time. only compliant is the change in the top. it has a screw top instead of the flip top it used to have.</li>
            <li> I was really fed up with those everyday on TV brands like Colgate and Sensodyne . Even when you search toothpaste brands in your browser, these names are in the first page . In supermarkets , newspapers , hypermarkets  , billboards and everywhere you can see them. In my view, it is Disgusting!!! You&#x27;d better to know that the quality of these brands are not as good as their manufacturers and distributors claim . They only try to fill markets to deprive you of having any other options especially in Asian markets . That&#x27;s why I was looking for a different brand with a real quality to get rid of these 2 brands forever and when I was searching in Amazon , I found Smartmouth and bought it to try and when I received the package and used it , it was amazing . When you brush it , easily and simply you can feel it deeply cleans your teeth with no exaggeration . I still have it and just suggest you to try it . You will buy your next package after your first purchase .</li>
            <li> If you want clean teeth and fresh breath, then look no further. This is the best toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever used and all my perfect checkups back that up.</li>
            <li> I knew this toothpaste made my breath fresher, but realized how much when I ran out and used a different product for a couple of weeks! Talk about swamp water breath! It cleared up the yucky taste I got from chronic sinusitis and even gets rid of the after effects of eating garlic! I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive, but have to admit it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use any other toothpaste after I used smart mouth it makes my mouth feel so clean all the time.  We also buy the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> For a very clean feeling mouth.... give this a try! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Listened to all of the advertisements on TV and thought this would be just the thing for my wife who is always on the go and dealing Face to Face with the public, family and friends all day everyday.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days after receiving and setting up the 2-part mixing arrangement on the bathroom counter between my wife and I  wash areas, I asked her how she liked the product.&lt;br /&gt;Without hesitation she replied, &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t! It leaves my mouth dry and with a bad taste.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I had noticed the same thing from the wash, but not as bad from the Toothpaste.  But I continued to try both for the next coulple of days until after using the Toothpaste first and then rinsing thoroughly, I was sitting on the bar stool in the kitchen waiting on my wife to finish getting ready, when she walked within about 3-foot of me carrying on a conversation.&lt;br /&gt;She stopped and said, &amp;#34;Larry your breath is bad and you never have bad breath.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Went immediately and washed mouth with Listerine and brushed with Colgate as I have for years.&lt;br /&gt;Few hours later my wife indicated that my breath was still good.&lt;br /&gt;Taking nothing for granted before going to bed the that night, I again rinsed my mouth thoroughly with the Smart Mouth.&lt;br /&gt;After being in bed for a few minutes my wife rolled over and started a conversation.  A couple of sentences in she stopped and made this statement, &amp;#34;Did you use that new mouth wash again, your breath is bad.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Once again, went and used the Listerine and life was good, no complaints from the wife and no dry mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased two of the Smart Mouth wash and three tubes of tooth paste that will never be used now.  $70 plus dollars for a lesson well learned.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no small thing. How many times have you bought something that you needed to work, and it actually did?  This stuff works.  You need to scrape your tongue BEFORE brushing, brush with a dry toothbrush, and also brush your tongue after brushing your teeth.  Finally don&#x27;t rinse with water- rinse/gargle with the same company&#x27;s no-alcohol \\&quot;smart mouth\\&quot; mouthwash (yeah I know- dumb name- the original \\&quot;tri-oral action\\&quot; was less embarrassing).  This has zinc in it, which creates an environment in the mouth that bacteria can&#x27;t handle, so bad breath doesn&#x27;t return soon.  It&#x27;s best not to drink water or anything for a half hour or so after using it.  It may be my imagination but I think I may have fewer colds each year after using it- zinc may have something to do with that.  Been using this combo for around 10 years now.  Also does a good job of whitening teeth, but that&#x27;s not why I use it.  Got dragon-breath and this takes care of it.</li>
            <li> Best toothpaste with the mouthwash technology in one! Little over price.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that really works towards eliminating bad breath, highly recommend its use, with the mouth wash from the same brand. After a couple of days the improvement is noticeable. We have a big stock at home, even bought to close family so they could tried it too, and they also were very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Works as described</li>
            <li> I HAVE ORDERED THIS SEVERAL TIMES.  I HATE TO RUN OUT OF IT.</li>
            <li> Great product, glad to finally find it.  Used to be called Tri-Oral and sold on QVC.  Glad to find a source in which to purchase it again.  The mouthwash is even better.  Kills bacteria for 24 hours.  Mouthwash is a two part system, so it is activated at the time you use it. Have new travel size now in the mouthwash too.</li>
            <li> Heard about this on the O&#x27;Reilly Factor.  I like it . . .makes the mouth feel fresh.  A little pricey.  I buy it as a subscription.  It is not a tooth whitener, however.</li>
            <li> Feels like you just came from the dentist.</li>
            <li> After using this for 6 months, I received the worst dental cleaning ever. So if I continue using this, I would have to use another toothpaste as well. However, since I can only find this product online, I doubt that I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It really helps with bad breath. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have a mouth that feels fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Helps to keep teeth clean and breath fresh.  My only question is if it affects the enamel on teeth.</li>
            <li> Is a great product, but I ordered three times expecting the one with withening, but I always received the same without withening.</li>
            <li> Pros: SmartMouth Toothpaste, Refreshing Mint does the job remarkably well.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It hurts my mouth and tongue waaaay too much.  If they don&#x27;t take it back, I&#x27;ll toss the three of them.</li>
            <li> I used the original TriOral toothpaste and mouthwash for years.  They were excellent products and were effective in treating halitosis.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t make this same statement about SmartMouth.  I was able to completely eliminate halitosis with TriOral, but have not been able to achieve this same result by using SmartMouth products.  I am extremely disappointed.  I hope that the original toothpaste and mouthwash formulas become available again soon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a Closys (toothpaste &amp; mouthwash) user for 3 years and found the Smart Mouth system at my local Walmart.  It&#x27;s much cheaper on Amazon!  I love this toothpaste.... it&#x27;s smooth (not grainy or chalky) and rinses clean, leaving a super fresh feeling.  Is it just like stepping out of the dentist chair?  Not exactly but pretty close.  For some reason I thought it would be a gel, but is is a solid light aqua green color.  The opening for the product to be dispensed is small, which helps cut down on waste when spreading on your toothbrush.  All in all, I am definitely a fan of this toothpaste and will continue to buy it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> If you use the SmartMouth mouthwash, this is a no brainer.  It is more of that great clean mouth feeling that last for hours.  After using this toothpaste, I will never go back to the sugary tasting mint flavor of nearly every other brand.  Enjoy your morning, start it with SmartMouth toothpaste followed by the mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This product does a LOVELY job temporarily relieving my dry mouth condition.  I absolutely refuse to use any other toothpaste brand.  I also use the mouth wash.  Very happy consumer!</li>
            <li> great product!  we love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Have used it for years.</li>
