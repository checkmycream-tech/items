            <li>they work , they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li>These are GREAT</li>

            <li>I pray that this product remains available for sale FOREVER!!!</li>
            <li>Still, nothing was successful.    </li>
            <li>I ordered the 30 pack to give them a try and loved them immediately.</li>
            <li>It was a good feeling, like it was cleaning my pores out.</li>
            <li>In my experience, it seems that all the good stuff (beauty products, haircare, cosmetics) that I become dependent on seem to be taken off</li>
            <li>These are a really good value.</li>
            <li>I am yet another person who does not write reviews, but I need to share the good news and reassure my fellow acne prone folk.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results).</li>
            <li>I love Niapads!</li>
            <li>I have used these for just over a month now and they work better than anything else I have ever tried without over drying my skin!</li>
            <li>I am honestly so glad that I bought Niapads!</li>
            <li>I promise you will be glad also!</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and great for travel.</li>
            <li>These sounded amazing, like they were sent from the gods...</li>
            <li>These are amazing.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>Niapads are amazingly effective for blemish and Rosacea control.</li>
            <li>I came across Niapads while searching the web for effective acne control products as everything I tried didn&#x27;t seem to work.  </li>
            <li>I felt suckered that I bought into it to be honest.</li>
            <li>Purchase with confidence, as this seller is absolutely honest and promptly and politely answers whatever question you may have.</li>
            <li>I really liked them however because of what happened with the serum that I ordered from you I won&#x27;t be ordering anything again.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to many of my friends who have also had good results.  </li>
            <li>I also really enjoy the pleasant lavender scent.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend \\&quot;Niapads\\&quot; for effective acne control from experience and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t believe there is a better product out there.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still on the hunt to complete my perfect skin regimen).</li>
            <li>I STRONGLY recommend Niapads for those suffering from acne who are through with doctors and their darn prescriptions!</li>
            <li>Everything said by most reviews is true, they are AMAZING!</li>
            <li>just giveanother try and loved very much immediately, and found effective.</li>
            <li>but when I do its ALWAYS on my jaw lines and they are ALWAY huge!</li>
            <li>and so so glad I found Niapads.</li>
            <li>It is better than Benzoyl peroxide which causes drying of the skin.</li>
            <li>This stuff is in most skin care products, shampoos, clothing, and dish washing detergents.</li>
            <li>have been greatly reduced and my skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li>We love them.</li>
            <li>...don&#x27;t let them fool you!  :)</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li>After more research, I found Niapads on Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Try it out, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li>These where had such great reviews I had to have them!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure that combo of that plus the Niapads will be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s more like it</li>
            <li>I love that they are made is the US.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m beyond impressed and will definitely place another order as soon as they&#x27;re needed!</li>
            <li>Definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>and I have more breakouts now then before I started using this product whiteheads everywhere</li>
            <li>I dont know if I ahould discontinue this product and use coconut oil or give it some more time</li>
            <li>We sincerely hope that this helps change your opinion about Niapads(TM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer</li>
            <li>We sincerely hope that this helps change your opinion about Niapads(TM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer</li>
            <li>love these.</li>
            <li>Love these pads.</li>
            <li>I am glad i found and tried out this product.</li>
            <li>(I got it for free when I ordered another product!)</li>
            <li>So don&#x27;t give up! :)</li>
            <li>Give us more.</li>
            <li>:):)</li>
            <li>was cause more and more break out and rash</li>
            <li>Within 2 days most of the cysts had come to a head and healed within another couple days.</li>
            <li>Very much need to follow instruction of product usage which  give good results.</li>
            <li>And while natural products have always worked best (Dermagist is good), my skin has never been completely clear...</li>
            <li>my face has never been more clear, smooth, and beautiful since I&#x27;ve been using these things.</li>
            <li>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is used by most companies because it is a cheap additive for lathering.    </li>
            <li>Immediately, I noticed the refreshing yet light Lavender smell of the pads.</li>
            <li>It is effective and totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Really it has never looked so good.</li>
            <li>I was excited to come across Niapads because the reviews seem so magical.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to bring Niapads on a trip.</li>
            <li>Niapads is easy to carry and store.</li>
            <li>My acne is gone and if I do get a pimple it clears up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the damage that it used to.</li>
            <li>Niapads have been the most effective and gentle product i have ever used for acne.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective that  get right into the skin porous and skin feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>They are not crap clean face well and exfoliate!</li>
            <li>I want to make sure there is full disclosure of the Niapads offer, since I believe this offer means 5 star reviews of the product may need to be considered with a sizable salt granule and folks</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mild on your skin, and is appropriate for any skin type.</li>
            <li>With Niapads, though, my acne goes away quickly!</li>
            <li>but I can always get rid of them quickly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider it a worthwhile buy as long as they kept it to $15 (which would be $1 per day for the product if used as directed), since I do not consider it sufficiently effective to use on its own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d consider it a worthwhile buy as long as they kept it to $15 (which would be $1 per day for the product if used as directed), since I do not consider it sufficiently effective to use on its own.</li>
            <li>For the first time in four years I have beautiful clear skin, all because of Niapads.</li>
            <li>Huge difference</li>
            <li>Within two days I saw a huge improvement in my cystic acne.</li>
            <li>Plus the light lavender scent is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just out of college, and the acne is now primarily on my chin/jawline, and sometimes around my nose.</li>
            <li>so they are easy to store and super easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li>product actually is very effective, which is why I ordered it a 2nd time and will probably continue to order it.</li>
            <li>They kept my face clean and blemish free.</li>
            <li>Much success to your companty as well!</li>
            <li>Very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased so far with this product.</li>
            <li>These are definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li>I think Sprintec (Rx) has done a lot to control my acne and Niapads have significantly improved the texture and clarity of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, since this does work pretty well, I buy this for when I travel, since most acne regimens will leak everywhere when you travel, and often bleach anything they touch.</li>
            <li>Niapads not only help clear away acne but keep the redness at bay, it&#x27;s purely wonderful.</li>
            <li>The results are noticeable although they are most effective if used daily.</li>
            <li>I struggle with hormonal acne shortly before my cycle, and these pads by far have been the best product I&#x27;ve used to combat this.</li>
            <li>IT IS AMAZING for cystic acne and body acne, but it doesn&#x27;t do enough for the shallower pimples I mostly get now, so I use Clearogen</li>
            <li>These pads are small, but they sure do work !!!</li>
            <li>and I have seen AMAZING results-- a complete 180!</li>
            <li>They have a gentle, yet effective exfoliation that gets right into the pores.</li>
            <li>Super excited and already feel my confidence growing.</li>
            <li>Whether you wet it and stick it on, or just use it to wipe the spot, it works great.</li>
            <li>Ok so my daughter has cystic acne also scars, she is using many things, acnepril,clinique acne,medera and bare minerals makeup, plus washing her pillow slip twice a week.....</li>
            <li>: it took about a month before I saw the full results I wanted...</li>
            <li>I was pretty much about to give up and go to a dermatologist (which can be very pricey if you don&#x27;t have insurance) until I read in a forum that niapads, which contain vitamin B3 is also good for acne flareups.</li>
            <li>I ordered Niapads as a quick fix for my acne.  </li>
            <li>My skin adapts too quickly to any product, so that&#x27;s probably part of the issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not only have I not have had such impressive results before, I&#x27;ve also not had results so quickly.</li>
            <li>But, so far, I can&#x27;t be more happy to not have a single zit on my face....</li>
            <li>Clean your face, eat right and drink water.</li>
            <li>By far, this is the easiest, most effective product I&#x27;ve tried and used for adult acne.</li>
            <li>I love Niapads, they leave my skin feeling clean and soft</li>
            <li>For myself, dealing with very mild rosacea, the pads for me have replaced what I had been using and really perform.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Niapads!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using these pads for a little over 2 weeks and have been really impressed with the results so far.</li>
            <li>After Pro Activ burned through and discolored two sets of bed sheets, and many different acne control regimens were invested in, the Niapads have proven to be superbly effective in helping to clear up his skin.    </li>
            <li>Sure some folks enjoy a nice lather and actually feel as though their skin isn&#x27;t properly cleansed without it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s definitely worth a try, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>but I thought it might be worth a shot.  </li>
            <li>These make my face so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>my pores look better, skin is really soft.</li>
            <li>$17, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying these out to see if they work for you.  </li>
            <li>It is definetely worth it to try this product if you are suffering from acne on your face, chest, etc.</li>
            <li>If you can make it through that, your skin stays clear :)</li>
            <li>Would have loved the product if it were not for the Lavender scent, the scent was too much for me and ultimately caused skin irritation, if they could remove the scent I would purchase again</li>
            <li>I can again smile and look people in the eye with confidence because my face has cleared up so well.</li>
            <li>Being older, I find that most acne medications (OTC or prescription) are very drying and rather ineffective.  </li>
            <li>It reduces redness and does make an impact if you use it the right way (with additional treatment, like a face wash).  </li>
            <li>right?  </li>
            <li>Right now I am leaning towards \\&quot;no.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Right now I am leaning towards \\&quot;no.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I found Niapads, I use the pads right after i wash my face.</li>
            <li>I am just not looking to take any chances right now.  </li>
            <li>The product instructions provided an alternate process to treat inflamed, nodule, and/or cystic type of acne which actually is pretty effective.</li>
            <li>So, I knew I was on the right track with eliminating certain ingredients and incorporating more natural ones like the Tea Tree and Vitamin B3, to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If the item was a one-stop product for my skin needs, it might be worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>If the item was a one-stop product for my skin needs, it might be worth the higher price.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t leave product reviews but the results I had with niapads has been so great that I have to share my experience with everyone else.</li>
            <li>Moreover, I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or excessive dryness either.</li>
            <li>Not even injections from the dermatologist improved my large nodule pimples that quickly.</li>
            <li>So I placed an order, which was very promptly filled and delivered (this company has a very high level of customer service, with same-day or next-day shipping on every order I&#x27;ve placed thus far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order it one more time and do a final evaluation and comparison of whether the effectiveness is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to order it one more time and do a final evaluation and comparison of whether the effectiveness is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Based on the Amazon reviews I&#x27;d read (several of which noted the same initial reactions), I urged him to keep using them for the full month, and he was willing to give it his best shot in order to avoid the Accutane.</li>
            <li>I now purchase Niapads for my 14 year daughter too and it really keeps her skin clear most of the month.  </li>
            <li>I have always struggled with this kind of acne, but when I stopped birth control it became a much more serious problem.</li>
            <li>Sure some lathering cleanser removes excess oils but doesn&#x27;t actually cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used many Neutrogena products (which are the WORST)that work up a good lather, only afterwards to use a toner, witch-hazel or alcohol and find globs of dirt and dead skin on the cotton</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the redness lessened.  </li>
            <li>The first 5 days of using it, I could have cried.  </li>
            <li>I also have very sensative skin and did not break out using these!</li>
            <li>I saw results from the first pad -</li>
            <li>/&gt;They did seem a bit drying at first</li>
            <li>I also think they are 10X better than any of those facial cleansing pads they have in Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Already received my second order in the mail and just in time for our vacation :-)</li>
            <li>Extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks niapads!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it, but I have not broken out since using these pads!</li>
            <li>Not all of our acne is the same and this product can surely do damage to some.</li>
            <li>My skin had improved so so much!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>have now been using niapads for about 4 months and each day the overall condition of my skin and my acne breakouts continue to get better.</li>
            <li>I have used many different OTC and Rx acne products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for many years (in mid 30s now).  </li>
            <li>Now I just use them when I first see a pimple appearing and</li>
            <li>I use it morning and night on the affected area, and once a week on my entire face (it feels a bit more drying on the rest of my face where I don&#x27;t have acne, but I have oily skin</li>
            <li>I get my pimples in the same spot most of the time</li>
            <li>In the course of that research I came across positive study info about the successful use of topical nicotinamide (also called niacinamide, and related to Vitamin B3 or niacin) in treating acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Truly, these things have made a tremendous difference in my skin with no negative side effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I was right, half a pad got the job done nicely.</li>
            <li>The next day, I significantly noticed my skin looked a bit clearer, in fact a lot clearer!</li>
            <li>to be fair this product may be good for some and bad for others.it didnt work for me all it did</li>
            <li>His face looks clean and clear.  </li>
            <li>They helped keep my face clean and clear and under control.....</li>
            <li>Overall, I would have to say besides being a little small they are a win win in my book.</li>
            <li>I first came across this product by pure chance.  </li>
            <li>have started using Niapads after reading positive reviews on acne.org and after just TWO DAYS</li>
            <li>Some were pretty affective but came with very severe side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle natural formula, even most sensitive Rosacea-afflicted skin will respond well to it.    </li>
            <li>With these, any pimple I have had has been gone pretty much over night without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>I realized I didn’t need the whole pad after using one the first night</li>
            <li>first my son didn&#x27;t really like the Niapads.  </li>
            <li>Those endorsements are worth much more to us than any paid endorsements by celebrities.&lt;br /&gt;While we certainly cannot afford celebrity endorsements in the near future, we assure you that we would continue to seek endorsements from real users even when we can afford to pay celebrities.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li>Easy to use, but didn&#x27;t help moderate acne.</li>
            <li>And I would certainly give it a 5 star but for now, I think 3 is appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>is a great alternative to using antibiotics, and putting your body through other kinds of stress.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I used it on conduction with Zinc Cream For Problem Skin every other day.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li>They are large and I didn&#x27;t figure I&#x27;d need a whole pad for my face each time.</li>
            <li>Now, a week and a half after starting, I have no new pimples on my face, the ones that I had disappeared quickly (like overnight quick), and the redness is greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>Skin type is very oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li>like to use the pads gently all over my face and neck</li>
            <li>and then I like to use my fingers to gently massage the product in for about 60 seconds and then rinse.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t scrub your skin - be gentle to it.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommed Niapads!</li>
            <li>I read another review that mentioned applying the Niapad at night and NOT rinsing it off, I followed that advice and really think it made a difference.  </li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy again</li>
            <li>: I received the product described above for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not irritating.</li>
            <li>So maybe 2x/day is too much for some skin types (like mine).  </li>
            <li>I had a couple of areas that needed clearing up, so I decided to try it on my whole face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also found their practical advise on calming acne outbreaks to be very helpful.</li>
            <li>and it provides us with the much needed encouragement to move forward.</li>
            <li>when I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 32 now, acne my whole life).</li>
            <li>the texture of my skin has improved so much,</li>
            <li>Oh my lord, it was an absolute nightmare</li>
            <li>Niapads cleared my acne and left me with wonderfully smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>I like using them for over night treatment and it works very well.</li>
            <li>My son &amp; I were very hopeful this would work for him after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li>These really work well and leave my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li>Since this product has benefitted me sooo much, I feel compelled to do so.  </li>
            <li>I doubt I&#x27;ll be without these, because they made my skin smooth and red bump-free.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and healthy and my breakouts are few and far between now.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many different products and nothing would clear my skin.</li>
            <li>Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for cheaper and more natural solutions since I have no insurance to see a doctor</li>
            <li>but Niapads not only cleared the pimples I would get but actually left my skin looking and feeling really nice.</li>
            <li>It still produced a rich lather and after rinsing my face, I had a white film/residue on my face.</li>
            <li>My daughte&#x27;s teenage acne is significantly diminished and my hormonal acne is gone.</li>
            <li>When I came across Niapads and read all the positive reviews, I knew I had to try them, and WOW!</li>
            <li>If you have responded to antibiotic treatment in the past, than this ingredient will be effective.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my adult life, I can leave my house without applying any coverup, foundation, or any make up at all.</li>
            <li>It did help some pimples but I am needing something a little more gentle and not so drying.</li>
            <li>so I cut the pads in half to get more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li>This product has worked miracles on teenage skin suffering from severe acne in our house, and is my favorite deep cleansing pad for face washing.</li>
            <li>I look younger and am confident enough to go without make up</li>
            <li>I am actually amazed at how quickly they work.  </li>
            <li>These are decent for spot treatments but beware there is SLS in it which kinda defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li>Normally, when using other acne medications I also run into the problem that they are too strong and end up taking off a layer of my skin or drying my skin out without really helping the pimple at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of all the hype and high ratings.  </li>
            <li>I was really impressed with these little pads, and how much power they have behind them.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s been very helpful with my adult acne problems.</li>
            <li>Since payment for the Accutane (at $400/month + frequent visits to the dermatologist to monitor side effects) would have come out of my pocket, and since my son was very reluctant to take the product</li>
            <li>figured this non-prescription treatment might be worth a shot before resorting to Accutane, but when I searched on Amazon, nearly all the niacinamide products were oral (about which I&#x27;d read nothing) and the few available niacinamide gels or ointments were being marketed as anti-aging, anti-wrinkle products, not acne treatments.  </li>
            <li>The only difference I noticed was that my face smelled great...which isn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to finally use a simple product that actually calms and improves the look of my skin.</li>
            <li>By the second day the patches of acne were pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>respect your opinion regarding Niapads(TM) offer and feel that we need to clarify our position.&lt;br /&gt;First - good reviews are essential to the growth of any small business competing with companies who can afford to have stars like Beiber, Brittany or Katy Perry</li>
            <li>I proceeded with my make-up as normal.</li>
            <li>Nothing seemed to do much good, and a friend of my wife suggested Accutane -- an expensive and very powerful oral retinoid with some horrendous potential side-effects (depression, liver damage, etc.).  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I have found that works quickly and effectively to clear up my breakout without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li>after seeing these results, I thought for sure I could suck up the irritating effects of SLS if the vitamin B3 could improve my acne that quickly.</li>
            <li>I have had mild acne for a long time now.</li>
            <li>The sole exception was Niapads, which had lots of positive Amazon reviews, although a majority of these reviews seemed to deal with adult acne rather than the more standard teenage variety my son was suffering from.  </li>
            <li>The pain, the embarrassment, the avoidance of face-to-face interaction needed to STOP after 6 months of this new persistent problem.</li>
            <li>Made my skin super dry.  </li>
            <li>So again, I was especially excited to receive this product as I believed it contained a decent concentration level of vitamin B or at the very least enough of it WITHOUT</li>
            <li>I should mention, that as with some other acne products, I experienced what other users mentioned about skin getting worse before it gets better.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these with the same high level of skepticism I usually have when trying a new product which claims to be effective in clearing up acne.</li>
            <li>It truly keeps your skin clear without over drying or irritation!  </li>
            <li>but I know with certainty that my face will be clear for the outing in a week that my husband has planned for our 1 year anniversary!</li>
            <li>, They completely disappeared WITHOUT a trace!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle cure--it won&#x27;t work overnight--but it works very quickly (within a few days).  </li>
            <li>I’ve tried so many products that when I read the reviews I was super skeptical but figured “what the hell”</li>
            <li>and I get the occasional large knot on my chin.  </li>
            <li>and my skin is almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li>It dries clear.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin and they help clear up my complexion immediately.</li>
            <li>I have acne and wanted to try something to clear my face.  </li>
            <li>She put me on Duac gel and said not to worry, this should clear up before the wedding.  </li>
            <li>i stop using it my face clear with garlic water.</li>
            <li>so my use with the pads on that area keeps it clear.</li>
            <li>I am over 40 and have battled cystic acne since my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>so it may be too early for results, but I do believe my skin feels softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 years old now and it has NEVER gone away.  </li>
            <li>They are soft and can be used even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I came across this product when searching the Internet for a natural product to treat breakouts.</li>
            <li>the acne I had around my nose/mouth area completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li>I have tried OTC, Rx, and natural products to manage my skin.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have ance prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am using it once a day, sometimes twice, to wash my face and after a month my face has completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li>my skin has completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li>I really felt as though this product purged my skin of impurities during the second week or so of use.  </li>
            <li>Considering I have like really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 27 years old and have been suffering with acne since I was 13.</li>
            <li>Within a week, she saw results and within two weeks stubborn acne that she had around her chin cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li>They leave the skin feeling clean, not greasy as with some cleansers or dried out by some others.  </li>
            <li>It completely cleared and returned back to normal when nothing else helped.</li>
            <li>Plus, I had two very large active nodule pimples near my temple that I was trying to rid myself of ASAP</li>
            <li>I use twice daily along with, 1 500mg B vitamin (Niacide) and, a high alkaline diet.</li>
            <li>While I was searching the web for effective acne product and all my previous trials  did not work and all that was waste of money and time.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products that have done me no good.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thing (and used my normal facial cleanser every night)</li>
            <li>After a month of twice-daily use my skin is mostly cleared up everywhere, with only a few blemishes left.</li>
            <li>For stubborn, cystic acne bumps these usually cause the tenderness to subside or at least bring it to a head much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>Niapads is something new and different-</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked fast, reduced scaring, and did not sting, over dry, or make me itch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>While they are not a miracle cure, nothing for acne really is, and these pads if used daily as a spot treatment will dramatically speed up the healing time of even deep cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I also had a few zits brewing that Niapad quickly diminished.</li>
            <li>No other compensation was provided</li>
            <li>Instructions say to use it twice a day, however I dont have time for that and using it once already is a major improvement.</li>
            <li>A few months ago I went back to a dermatologist because I will be getting married soon, and although I had come to terms with my skin in a way, I really didn&#x27;t want to have to deal with this in wedding pictures.  </li>
            <li>Did not notice any major improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have it mainly on the upper chest and back.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much time and money on so many useless products to treat and clear my adult acne!</li>
            <li>Having tried this product with high hopes &amp; ended with numerous breakouts including cysts (even in &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; areas that never had acne problem) following the instruction faithfully for a week, I feel obligated to share my experience.</li>
            <li>I used to wake up to 3-7 new pimples a day and within 7 days I’ve seen maybe 2 new breakouts, less redness, and clearing up of old acne scars.</li>
            <li>Accutane evetually worked and I was clear for about 5 or 6 years, but once my 20s hit, the acne &amp; redness started to come back.</li>
            <li>Aside from the occasional spot pimple, my skin is COMPLETELY CLEAR.</li>
            <li>This was the only thing that would clear up my chin.</li>
            <li>I was surprised that such an inexpensive fix could work so well, but it has.</li>
            <li>I was amazed when I woke up the next morning and the pimple had shrunk so that it was nearly unnoticeable.</li>
            <li>I am a 52 year old female with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li>Niapads ® is the only product that is working, this blemish is almost gone completely now.</li>
            <li>I am a female in my early 20s and have a history of moderate-severe acne since the age of 12.</li>
            <li>Especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s better than breaking out worse.</li>
            <li>one of the most irritating cleansing agents used in skin-care</li>
            <li>This product is simple to use and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much.</li>
            <li>In less than a month after I ordered my first pack I noticed an improvement in my skin and the amount of breakouts</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t begun to use these as a daily treatment yet, however, the other night I did use one all over my face for the first time.</li>
            <li>The very first night I used this product I had 3 fairly big pimples and 1 cystic-type one, the next morning they had all come to a &#x27;head&#x27; and by the morning after that they were well on their way to clearing up, which would normally have been at least another week.  </li>
            <li>My face is clearing up, staying clear, and feels really healthy-not dried out at all.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I recently discovered why most products just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me - irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li>When I first received the Niapads, I was like wow, this is a small sample.</li>
            <li>that you know will result in lifelong pockmarks, but he always had a fair number of angry looking pimples at any one time.  </li>
            <li>Not only does this clear your skin of acne, it also strengthens the immunity of your skin, making lesions (breakouts) less likely to occur and heal fast when then do.. win-win-win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>/&gt;HOWEVER, this works at least as well as most of my other preferred face washes (by the way,</li>
            <li>After the first few days, I noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll look for other products with high % niacin amide.</li>
            <li>Well, this pad has so much lathering ingredients in it that I had to cut it in half</li>
            <li>With the option of cutting off a small piece of pad and putting it on a zit to get rid of it more quickly, I have avoided embarrassing moments... repeatedly!</li>
            <li>After wetting the dry Niapad,  I gently wipe the wet Niapad all over my face and leave it on over night instead of washing it off as stated in directions.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I want to express how excited I was about receiving this particular product because I&#x27;ve recently given up on spending THOUSANDS on dermatologist and aesthetician bills, prescription medications, cosmetic procedures, and expensive skin care products.</li>
            <li>(original size is about 2 x 3 inch rectangle flat, textured swab) which is already very small.</li>
            <li>Niapads are the equivalent to little miracle workers when your skin wants to &amp;#34;misbehave&amp;#34;.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Still, nothing was successful.    </li>
            <li> I ordered the 30 pack to give them a try and loved them immediately.</li>
            <li> It was a good feeling, like it was cleaning my pores out.</li>
            <li> In my experience, it seems that all the good stuff (beauty products, haircare, cosmetics) that I become dependent on seem to be taken off</li>
            <li> These are a really good value.</li>
            <li> I am yet another person who does not write reviews, but I need to share the good news and reassure my fellow acne prone folk.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results).</li>
            <li> I love Niapads!</li>
            <li> I have used these for just over a month now and they work better than anything else I have ever tried without over drying my skin!</li>
            <li> I am honestly so glad that I bought Niapads!</li>
            <li> I promise you will be glad also!</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and great for travel.</li>
            <li> These sounded amazing, like they were sent from the gods...</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> Niapads are amazingly effective for blemish and Rosacea control.</li>
            <li> I came across Niapads while searching the web for effective acne control products as everything I tried didn&#x27;t seem to work.  </li>
            <li> I felt suckered that I bought into it to be honest.</li>
            <li> Purchase with confidence, as this seller is absolutely honest and promptly and politely answers whatever question you may have.</li>
            <li> I really liked them however because of what happened with the serum that I ordered from you I won&#x27;t be ordering anything again.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to many of my friends who have also had good results.  </li>
            <li> I also really enjoy the pleasant lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend \\&quot;Niapads\\&quot; for effective acne control from experience and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t believe there is a better product out there.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still on the hunt to complete my perfect skin regimen).</li>
            <li> I STRONGLY recommend Niapads for those suffering from acne who are through with doctors and their darn prescriptions!</li>
            <li> Everything said by most reviews is true, they are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> just giveanother try and loved very much immediately, and found effective.</li>
            <li> but when I do its ALWAYS on my jaw lines and they are ALWAY huge!</li>
            <li> and so so glad I found Niapads.</li>
            <li> It is better than Benzoyl peroxide which causes drying of the skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is in most skin care products, shampoos, clothing, and dish washing detergents.</li>
            <li> have been greatly reduced and my skin is much softer.  </li>
            <li> We love them.</li>
            <li> ...don&#x27;t let them fool you!  :)</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> After more research, I found Niapads on Amazon and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Try it out, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> These where had such great reviews I had to have them!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering more.  </li>

            <li> I love that they are made is the US.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m beyond impressed and will definitely place another order as soon as they&#x27;re needed!</li>
            <li> Definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> and I have more breakouts now then before I started using this product whiteheads everywhere</li>
            <li> I dont know if I ahould discontinue this product and use coconut oil or give it some more time</li>
            <li> We sincerely hope that this helps change your opinion about Niapads(TM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer</li>
            <li> We sincerely hope that this helps change your opinion about Niapads(TM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer</li>
            <li> love these.</li>
            <li> Love these pads.</li>
            <li> I am glad i found and tried out this product.</li>
            <li> (I got it for free when I ordered another product!)</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t give up! :)</li>
            <li> Give us more.</li>
            <li> :):)</li>
            <li> was cause more and more break out and rash</li>
            <li> Within 2 days most of the cysts had come to a head and healed within another couple days.</li>
            <li> Very much need to follow instruction of product usage which  give good results.</li>
            <li> And while natural products have always worked best (Dermagist is good), my skin has never been completely clear...</li>
            <li> my face has never been more clear, smooth, and beautiful since I&#x27;ve been using these things.</li>
            <li> Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is used by most companies because it is a cheap additive for lathering.    </li>
            <li> Immediately, I noticed the refreshing yet light Lavender smell of the pads.</li>
            <li> It is effective and totally worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Really it has never looked so good.</li>
            <li> I was excited to come across Niapads because the reviews seem so magical.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to bring Niapads on a trip.</li>
            <li> Niapads is easy to carry and store.</li>
            <li> My acne is gone and if I do get a pimple it clears up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the damage that it used to.</li>
            <li> Niapads have been the most effective and gentle product i have ever used for acne.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective that  get right into the skin porous and skin feels clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> They are not crap clean face well and exfoliate!</li>
            <li> I want to make sure there is full disclosure of the Niapads offer, since I believe this offer means 5 star reviews of the product may need to be considered with a sizable salt granule and folks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mild on your skin, and is appropriate for any skin type.</li>
            <li> With Niapads, though, my acne goes away quickly!</li>
            <li> but I can always get rid of them quickly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider it a worthwhile buy as long as they kept it to $15 (which would be $1 per day for the product if used as directed), since I do not consider it sufficiently effective to use on its own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d consider it a worthwhile buy as long as they kept it to $15 (which would be $1 per day for the product if used as directed), since I do not consider it sufficiently effective to use on its own.</li>
            <li> For the first time in four years I have beautiful clear skin, all because of Niapads.</li>
            <li> Huge difference</li>
            <li> Within two days I saw a huge improvement in my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> Plus the light lavender scent is a huge bonus.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just out of college, and the acne is now primarily on my chin/jawline, and sometimes around my nose.</li>
            <li> so they are easy to store and super easy to travel with.  </li>
            <li> product actually is very effective, which is why I ordered it a 2nd time and will probably continue to order it.</li>
            <li> They kept my face clean and blemish free.</li>
            <li> Much success to your companty as well!</li>
            <li> Very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased so far with this product.</li>
            <li> These are definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I think Sprintec (Rx) has done a lot to control my acne and Niapads have significantly improved the texture and clarity of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, since this does work pretty well, I buy this for when I travel, since most acne regimens will leak everywhere when you travel, and often bleach anything they touch.</li>
            <li> Niapads not only help clear away acne but keep the redness at bay, it&#x27;s purely wonderful.</li>
            <li> The results are noticeable although they are most effective if used daily.</li>
            <li> I struggle with hormonal acne shortly before my cycle, and these pads by far have been the best product I&#x27;ve used to combat this.</li>
            <li> IT IS AMAZING for cystic acne and body acne, but it doesn&#x27;t do enough for the shallower pimples I mostly get now, so I use Clearogen</li>
            <li> These pads are small, but they sure do work !!!</li>
            <li> and I have seen AMAZING results-- a complete 180!</li>
            <li> They have a gentle, yet effective exfoliation that gets right into the pores.</li>
            <li> Super excited and already feel my confidence growing.</li>
            <li> Whether you wet it and stick it on, or just use it to wipe the spot, it works great.</li>
            <li> Ok so my daughter has cystic acne also scars, she is using many things, acnepril,clinique acne,medera and bare minerals makeup, plus washing her pillow slip twice a week.....</li>
            <li> : it took about a month before I saw the full results I wanted...</li>
            <li> I was pretty much about to give up and go to a dermatologist (which can be very pricey if you don&#x27;t have insurance) until I read in a forum that niapads, which contain vitamin B3 is also good for acne flareups.</li>
            <li> I ordered Niapads as a quick fix for my acne.  </li>
            <li> My skin adapts too quickly to any product, so that&#x27;s probably part of the issue.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not only have I not have had such impressive results before, I&#x27;ve also not had results so quickly.</li>
            <li> But, so far, I can&#x27;t be more happy to not have a single zit on my face....</li>
            <li> Clean your face, eat right and drink water.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the easiest, most effective product I&#x27;ve tried and used for adult acne.</li>
            <li> I love Niapads, they leave my skin feeling clean and soft</li>
            <li> For myself, dealing with very mild rosacea, the pads for me have replaced what I had been using and really perform.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> Highly, highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Niapads!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads for a little over 2 weeks and have been really impressed with the results so far.</li>
            <li> After Pro Activ burned through and discolored two sets of bed sheets, and many different acne control regimens were invested in, the Niapads have proven to be superbly effective in helping to clear up his skin.    </li>
            <li> Sure some folks enjoy a nice lather and actually feel as though their skin isn&#x27;t properly cleansed without it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s definitely worth a try, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> but I thought it might be worth a shot.  </li>
            <li> These make my face so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> my pores look better, skin is really soft.</li>
            <li> $17, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying these out to see if they work for you.  </li>
            <li> It is definetely worth it to try this product if you are suffering from acne on your face, chest, etc.</li>
            <li> If you can make it through that, your skin stays clear :)</li>
            <li> Would have loved the product if it were not for the Lavender scent, the scent was too much for me and ultimately caused skin irritation, if they could remove the scent I would purchase again</li>
            <li> I can again smile and look people in the eye with confidence because my face has cleared up so well.</li>
            <li> Being older, I find that most acne medications (OTC or prescription) are very drying and rather ineffective.  </li>
            <li> It reduces redness and does make an impact if you use it the right way (with additional treatment, like a face wash).  </li>
            <li> right?  </li>
            <li> Right now I am leaning towards \\&quot;no.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Right now I am leaning towards \\&quot;no.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I found Niapads, I use the pads right after i wash my face.</li>
            <li> I am just not looking to take any chances right now.  </li>
            <li> The product instructions provided an alternate process to treat inflamed, nodule, and/or cystic type of acne which actually is pretty effective.</li>
            <li> So, I knew I was on the right track with eliminating certain ingredients and incorporating more natural ones like the Tea Tree and Vitamin B3, to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the item was a one-stop product for my skin needs, it might be worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> If the item was a one-stop product for my skin needs, it might be worth the higher price.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave product reviews but the results I had with niapads has been so great that I have to share my experience with everyone else.</li>
            <li> Moreover, I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or excessive dryness either.</li>
            <li> Not even injections from the dermatologist improved my large nodule pimples that quickly.</li>
            <li> So I placed an order, which was very promptly filled and delivered (this company has a very high level of customer service, with same-day or next-day shipping on every order I&#x27;ve placed thus far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order it one more time and do a final evaluation and comparison of whether the effectiveness is worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to order it one more time and do a final evaluation and comparison of whether the effectiveness is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Based on the Amazon reviews I&#x27;d read (several of which noted the same initial reactions), I urged him to keep using them for the full month, and he was willing to give it his best shot in order to avoid the Accutane.</li>
            <li> I now purchase Niapads for my 14 year daughter too and it really keeps her skin clear most of the month.  </li>
            <li> I have always struggled with this kind of acne, but when I stopped birth control it became a much more serious problem.</li>
            <li> Sure some lathering cleanser removes excess oils but doesn&#x27;t actually cleanse the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used many Neutrogena products (which are the WORST)that work up a good lather, only afterwards to use a toner, witch-hazel or alcohol and find globs of dirt and dead skin on the cotton</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the redness lessened.  </li>
            <li> The first 5 days of using it, I could have cried.  </li>
            <li> I also have very sensative skin and did not break out using these!</li>
            <li> I saw results from the first pad -</li>
            <li> /&gt;They did seem a bit drying at first</li>
            <li> I also think they are 10X better than any of those facial cleansing pads they have in Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Already received my second order in the mail and just in time for our vacation :-)</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks niapads!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it, but I have not broken out since using these pads!</li>
            <li> Not all of our acne is the same and this product can surely do damage to some.</li>
            <li> My skin had improved so so much!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> have now been using niapads for about 4 months and each day the overall condition of my skin and my acne breakouts continue to get better.</li>
            <li> I have used many different OTC and Rx acne products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for many years (in mid 30s now).  </li>
            <li> Now I just use them when I first see a pimple appearing and</li>
            <li> I use it morning and night on the affected area, and once a week on my entire face (it feels a bit more drying on the rest of my face where I don&#x27;t have acne, but I have oily skin</li>
            <li> I get my pimples in the same spot most of the time</li>
            <li> In the course of that research I came across positive study info about the successful use of topical nicotinamide (also called niacinamide, and related to Vitamin B3 or niacin) in treating acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Truly, these things have made a tremendous difference in my skin with no negative side effects whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was right, half a pad got the job done nicely.</li>
            <li> The next day, I significantly noticed my skin looked a bit clearer, in fact a lot clearer!</li>
            <li> to be fair this product may be good for some and bad for others.it didnt work for me all it did</li>
            <li> His face looks clean and clear.  </li>
            <li> They helped keep my face clean and clear and under control.....</li>
            <li> Overall, I would have to say besides being a little small they are a win win in my book.</li>
            <li> I first came across this product by pure chance.  </li>
            <li> have started using Niapads after reading positive reviews on acne.org and after just TWO DAYS</li>
            <li> Some were pretty affective but came with very severe side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle natural formula, even most sensitive Rosacea-afflicted skin will respond well to it.    </li>
            <li> With these, any pimple I have had has been gone pretty much over night without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I realized I didn’t need the whole pad after using one the first night</li>
            <li> first my son didn&#x27;t really like the Niapads.  </li>
            <li> Those endorsements are worth much more to us than any paid endorsements by celebrities.&lt;br /&gt;While we certainly cannot afford celebrity endorsements in the near future, we assure you that we would continue to seek endorsements from real users even when we can afford to pay celebrities.&lt;br /&gt;Our</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but didn&#x27;t help moderate acne.</li>
            <li> And I would certainly give it a 5 star but for now, I think 3 is appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> is a great alternative to using antibiotics, and putting your body through other kinds of stress.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I used it on conduction with Zinc Cream For Problem Skin every other day.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li> They are large and I didn&#x27;t figure I&#x27;d need a whole pad for my face each time.</li>
            <li> Now, a week and a half after starting, I have no new pimples on my face, the ones that I had disappeared quickly (like overnight quick), and the redness is greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li> Skin type is very oily and acne prone.</li>
            <li> like to use the pads gently all over my face and neck</li>
            <li> and then I like to use my fingers to gently massage the product in for about 60 seconds and then rinse.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t scrub your skin - be gentle to it.  </li>
            <li> Would highly recommed Niapads!</li>
            <li> I read another review that mentioned applying the Niapad at night and NOT rinsing it off, I followed that advice and really think it made a difference.  </li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy again</li>
            <li> : I received the product described above for free in exchange for my unbiased review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not irritating.</li>
            <li> So maybe 2x/day is too much for some skin types (like mine).  </li>
            <li> I had a couple of areas that needed clearing up, so I decided to try it on my whole face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also found their practical advise on calming acne outbreaks to be very helpful.</li>
            <li> and it provides us with the much needed encouragement to move forward.</li>
            <li> when I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 32 now, acne my whole life).</li>
            <li> the texture of my skin has improved so much,</li>
            <li> Oh my lord, it was an absolute nightmare</li>
            <li> Niapads cleared my acne and left me with wonderfully smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> I like using them for over night treatment and it works very well.</li>
            <li> My son &amp; I were very hopeful this would work for him after reading the reviews.  </li>
            <li> These really work well and leave my face feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Since this product has benefitted me sooo much, I feel compelled to do so.  </li>
            <li> I doubt I&#x27;ll be without these, because they made my skin smooth and red bump-free.</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and healthy and my breakouts are few and far between now.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many different products and nothing would clear my skin.</li>
            <li> Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for cheaper and more natural solutions since I have no insurance to see a doctor</li>
            <li> but Niapads not only cleared the pimples I would get but actually left my skin looking and feeling really nice.</li>
            <li> It still produced a rich lather and after rinsing my face, I had a white film/residue on my face.</li>
            <li> My daughte&#x27;s teenage acne is significantly diminished and my hormonal acne is gone.</li>
            <li> When I came across Niapads and read all the positive reviews, I knew I had to try them, and WOW!</li>
            <li> If you have responded to antibiotic treatment in the past, than this ingredient will be effective.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my adult life, I can leave my house without applying any coverup, foundation, or any make up at all.</li>
            <li> It did help some pimples but I am needing something a little more gentle and not so drying.</li>
            <li> so I cut the pads in half to get more bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> This product has worked miracles on teenage skin suffering from severe acne in our house, and is my favorite deep cleansing pad for face washing.</li>
            <li> I look younger and am confident enough to go without make up</li>
            <li> I am actually amazed at how quickly they work.  </li>
            <li> These are decent for spot treatments but beware there is SLS in it which kinda defeats the purpose.</li>
            <li> Normally, when using other acne medications I also run into the problem that they are too strong and end up taking off a layer of my skin or drying my skin out without really helping the pimple at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the hype and high ratings.  </li>
            <li> I was really impressed with these little pads, and how much power they have behind them.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s been very helpful with my adult acne problems.</li>
            <li> Since payment for the Accutane (at $400/month + frequent visits to the dermatologist to monitor side effects) would have come out of my pocket, and since my son was very reluctant to take the product</li>
            <li> figured this non-prescription treatment might be worth a shot before resorting to Accutane, but when I searched on Amazon, nearly all the niacinamide products were oral (about which I&#x27;d read nothing) and the few available niacinamide gels or ointments were being marketed as anti-aging, anti-wrinkle products, not acne treatments.  </li>
            <li> The only difference I noticed was that my face smelled great...which isn&#x27;t worth the money.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to finally use a simple product that actually calms and improves the look of my skin.</li>
            <li> By the second day the patches of acne were pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> respect your opinion regarding Niapads(TM) offer and feel that we need to clarify our position.&lt;br /&gt;First - good reviews are essential to the growth of any small business competing with companies who can afford to have stars like Beiber, Brittany or Katy Perry</li>
            <li> I proceeded with my make-up as normal.</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to do much good, and a friend of my wife suggested Accutane -- an expensive and very powerful oral retinoid with some horrendous potential side-effects (depression, liver damage, etc.).  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works quickly and effectively to clear up my breakout without drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> after seeing these results, I thought for sure I could suck up the irritating effects of SLS if the vitamin B3 could improve my acne that quickly.</li>
            <li> I have had mild acne for a long time now.</li>
            <li> The sole exception was Niapads, which had lots of positive Amazon reviews, although a majority of these reviews seemed to deal with adult acne rather than the more standard teenage variety my son was suffering from.  </li>
            <li> The pain, the embarrassment, the avoidance of face-to-face interaction needed to STOP after 6 months of this new persistent problem.</li>
            <li> Made my skin super dry.  </li>
            <li> So again, I was especially excited to receive this product as I believed it contained a decent concentration level of vitamin B or at the very least enough of it WITHOUT</li>
            <li> I should mention, that as with some other acne products, I experienced what other users mentioned about skin getting worse before it gets better.  </li>
            <li> I ordered these with the same high level of skepticism I usually have when trying a new product which claims to be effective in clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> It truly keeps your skin clear without over drying or irritation!  </li>
            <li> but I know with certainty that my face will be clear for the outing in a week that my husband has planned for our 1 year anniversary!</li>
            <li> , They completely disappeared WITHOUT a trace!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cure--it won&#x27;t work overnight--but it works very quickly (within a few days).  </li>
            <li> I’ve tried so many products that when I read the reviews I was super skeptical but figured “what the hell”</li>
            <li> and I get the occasional large knot on my chin.  </li>
            <li> and my skin is almost completely clear.  </li>
            <li> It dries clear.  </li>
            <li> I have combination skin and they help clear up my complexion immediately.</li>
            <li> I have acne and wanted to try something to clear my face.  </li>
            <li> She put me on Duac gel and said not to worry, this should clear up before the wedding.  </li>
            <li> i stop using it my face clear with garlic water.</li>
            <li> so my use with the pads on that area keeps it clear.</li>
            <li> I am over 40 and have battled cystic acne since my early 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> so it may be too early for results, but I do believe my skin feels softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 years old now and it has NEVER gone away.  </li>
            <li> They are soft and can be used even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I came across this product when searching the Internet for a natural product to treat breakouts.</li>
            <li> the acne I had around my nose/mouth area completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I have tried OTC, Rx, and natural products to manage my skin.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have ance prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am using it once a day, sometimes twice, to wash my face and after a month my face has completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li> my skin has completely cleared up.  </li>
            <li> I really felt as though this product purged my skin of impurities during the second week or so of use.  </li>
            <li> Considering I have like really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and have been suffering with acne since I was 13.</li>
            <li> Within a week, she saw results and within two weeks stubborn acne that she had around her chin cleared up completely.  </li>
            <li> They leave the skin feeling clean, not greasy as with some cleansers or dried out by some others.  </li>
            <li> It completely cleared and returned back to normal when nothing else helped.</li>
            <li> Plus, I had two very large active nodule pimples near my temple that I was trying to rid myself of ASAP</li>
            <li> I use twice daily along with, 1 500mg B vitamin (Niacide) and, a high alkaline diet.</li>
            <li> While I was searching the web for effective acne product and all my previous trials  did not work and all that was waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products that have done me no good.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thing (and used my normal facial cleanser every night)</li>
            <li> After a month of twice-daily use my skin is mostly cleared up everywhere, with only a few blemishes left.</li>
            <li> For stubborn, cystic acne bumps these usually cause the tenderness to subside or at least bring it to a head much more quickly.  </li>
            <li> Niapads is something new and different-</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked fast, reduced scaring, and did not sting, over dry, or make me itch.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> While they are not a miracle cure, nothing for acne really is, and these pads if used daily as a spot treatment will dramatically speed up the healing time of even deep cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I also had a few zits brewing that Niapad quickly diminished.</li>
            <li> No other compensation was provided</li>
            <li> Instructions say to use it twice a day, however I dont have time for that and using it once already is a major improvement.</li>
            <li> A few months ago I went back to a dermatologist because I will be getting married soon, and although I had come to terms with my skin in a way, I really didn&#x27;t want to have to deal with this in wedding pictures.  </li>
            <li> Did not notice any major improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have it mainly on the upper chest and back.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much time and money on so many useless products to treat and clear my adult acne!</li>
            <li> Having tried this product with high hopes &amp; ended with numerous breakouts including cysts (even in &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; areas that never had acne problem) following the instruction faithfully for a week, I feel obligated to share my experience.</li>
            <li> I used to wake up to 3-7 new pimples a day and within 7 days I’ve seen maybe 2 new breakouts, less redness, and clearing up of old acne scars.</li>
            <li> Accutane evetually worked and I was clear for about 5 or 6 years, but once my 20s hit, the acne &amp; redness started to come back.</li>
            <li> Aside from the occasional spot pimple, my skin is COMPLETELY CLEAR.</li>
            <li> This was the only thing that would clear up my chin.</li>
            <li> I was surprised that such an inexpensive fix could work so well, but it has.</li>
            <li> I was amazed when I woke up the next morning and the pimple had shrunk so that it was nearly unnoticeable.</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old female with hormonal acne.</li>
            <li> Niapads ® is the only product that is working, this blemish is almost gone completely now.</li>
            <li> I am a female in my early 20s and have a history of moderate-severe acne since the age of 12.</li>
            <li> Especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s better than breaking out worse.</li>
            <li> one of the most irritating cleansing agents used in skin-care</li>
            <li> This product is simple to use and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much.</li>
            <li> In less than a month after I ordered my first pack I noticed an improvement in my skin and the amount of breakouts</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t begun to use these as a daily treatment yet, however, the other night I did use one all over my face for the first time.</li>
            <li> The very first night I used this product I had 3 fairly big pimples and 1 cystic-type one, the next morning they had all come to a &#x27;head&#x27; and by the morning after that they were well on their way to clearing up, which would normally have been at least another week.  </li>
            <li> My face is clearing up, staying clear, and feels really healthy-not dried out at all.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I recently discovered why most products just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me - irritating ingredients.</li>
            <li> When I first received the Niapads, I was like wow, this is a small sample.</li>
            <li> that you know will result in lifelong pockmarks, but he always had a fair number of angry looking pimples at any one time.  </li>
            <li> Not only does this clear your skin of acne, it also strengthens the immunity of your skin, making lesions (breakouts) less likely to occur and heal fast when then do.. win-win-win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> /&gt;HOWEVER, this works at least as well as most of my other preferred face washes (by the way,</li>
            <li> After the first few days, I noticed an improvement.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look for other products with high % niacin amide.</li>
            <li> Well, this pad has so much lathering ingredients in it that I had to cut it in half</li>
            <li> With the option of cutting off a small piece of pad and putting it on a zit to get rid of it more quickly, I have avoided embarrassing moments... repeatedly!</li>
            <li> After wetting the dry Niapad,  I gently wipe the wet Niapad all over my face and leave it on over night instead of washing it off as stated in directions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I want to express how excited I was about receiving this particular product because I&#x27;ve recently given up on spending THOUSANDS on dermatologist and aesthetician bills, prescription medications, cosmetic procedures, and expensive skin care products.</li>
            <li> (original size is about 2 x 3 inch rectangle flat, textured swab) which is already very small.</li>
            <li> Niapads are the equivalent to little miracle workers when your skin wants to &amp;#34;misbehave&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I&#x27;ve been reading about more natural alternatives and ingredients that are equally beneficial for acne without all the harsh irritating effects.</li>
            <li> I am extremely prone to MRSA and cannot take anymore antibiotics, so as instructed by my Infectious Disease doctor, I sought a natural alternative.  </li>
            <li> As far as seeing a difference not really!</li>
            <li> Long story short, I contacted them and ordered a six pack for my son, severely afflicted with acne who was only marginally responding to oral antibiotics, and who had gone through every acne system for skin care imaginable.      </li>
            <li> 29yrs old black female.</li>
            <li> These small pads seem to really work.</li>
            <li> I cut each pad into 6 pieces and they last a LONG time.  </li>
            <li> Definitely helps keep oil production in check and long term there are also wrinkle reducing benefits.</li>
            <li> Birth control pills and antibiotics help in the short term but with side effects that make them undesirable solutions for the long term.  </li>
            <li> and I mean this has gone on for months, no matter what I did, which is why I got this product in the first plce.</li>
            <li> The pad was slightly drying to my face, but nothing that couldn&#x27;t be fixed with applying some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> but I scaled back to using just once a day with a quality moisturizer at night and my skin isn&#x27;t dry anymore.  </li>
            <li> This seems to be the first thing we&#x27;ve tried that has made a serious difference.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using any other topical acne treatments at the same time, however.  </li>
            <li> Due to medical side-effects from Accutane, I opted to try anything else before going back that route.    </li>
            <li> I purchased Niapads for my teenage daughter after years of going to the Dermatologist and several different topical creams and lotions with very little luck.  </li>
            <li> Lately, I have not even had to do that - as the pimples really don&#x27;t seem to form...and my scarring is dissipating as well.  </li>
            <li> I tried it a couple of times and it did not seem to really do much for me but that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work wonders for someone else.</li>
            <li> I do usually cut the squares smaller, and since they&#x27;ve raised the price above $15, and don&#x27;t really want to use this everyday anyway cause of the expense, but you can&#x27;t beat it for a travel face wash!</li>
            <li> I used them nearly exactly as directed on the package, however I decided to cut one pad in half and use one half in the morning and one half before bed.</li>
            <li> The only products that i have tried were antibiotics (minocycline) with benzol, some other chemicals, cleaners etc etc.</li>
            <li> However, just me personally I would of preferred a little bigger pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product has totally cleared up my chin as well as other areas.</li>
            <li> I stopped using all other acne products that I have tried over the years and started using these, a niaciminide serum (by skin daily), CereVe moisturizers, a clairsonic brush and wash, and niacin orally.</li>
            <li> Niapads dries out pimples but doesnt dry out the skin.</li>
            <li> is they dry out the area of the pimple and my skin peels after a day of using it.  </li>
            <li> It will overly dry the skin.</li>
            <li> Also these pads last a really long time because I cut them down to the size of the pimple.  </li>
            <li> Now during my pregnancy I have had a few breakouts with major stubborn pimples.</li>
            <li> So after researching every single ingredient in all of my Rx, skin care and hair car products, I had to toss out 98% of them.</li>
            <li> Just cut it up, wet it ( dont wash it) and put it on your face until its dry.</li>
            <li> In the morning I wiped my congested skin with the wet pad, waited for it to dry on my skin and then rinsed it off.</li>
            <li> These are super expensive for what you get, I see a slight improvement in my complexion but not enough to spend $20 for this product again.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft after using the cloths and it&#x27;s not the least bit drying which is something I always tend to struggle with.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I try to keep my skin clear I am always bound to get a pimple here &amp; there.</li>
            <li> In our Earth day round up of various products, I recommend it, you can find the article here:</li>
            <li> The my acne started to disappear after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I started birth control when I was 18, partially in hopes to help my skin.</li>
            <li> At night I cleansed my face, removing all make-up, then wiped my skin with the wet pad again.</li>
            <li> , I cut all the pieces in half so it lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> My 17-year-old son had had a pretty bad case of standard teenage acne vulgaris for a couple of years.  </li>
            <li> methyl paraben, other unknown chemicals</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t rinse the product off, but simply wet the cut bit of pad and coat individual spots(less and less!!)</li>
            <li> They ease the discomfort and embarressment of having to go in public with bumps that usually would not go away for weeks.</li>
            <li> almost immediately the lathering ingrediant (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) causes small numerous bumps all over.  </li>
            <li> What would be a blast is if the manufacturer would update their ingredients to exclude the SLS and other sodium ingredients within it.</li>
            <li> Then the breakouts I did have went from big bumps to small bumps or whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to search for some other alternatives.</li>
            <li> I have used lots of other products just like everyone else</li>
            <li> Tread with caution, run a trial on a small patch of skin before you use it on the entire face.</li>
            <li> but it also helps current pimples heal faster by keeping a small piece of the pad over the pimple for an extended amount of time.  </li>
            <li> But as others have said, I would not use all over due to SLS</li>
            <li> I did some research on the interwebs for other solutions to cystic acne and by happenstance (and luck)</li>
            <li> My active pimples went away within days and fewer are showing up.</li>
            <li> The antibiotics helped reduce breakouts and cystic acne from my face but there were still a few (like 10) tiny pimples over my face and jaw, this cleared it up within a few days.</li>
            <li> I also try to take a Niacinamide pill every day as well (active ingredient in Niapads).</li>
            <li> I hardly have to laser at the medical spa</li>
            <li> Not only did it not clear up my acne in days like others, it seemed to make it worse.  </li>
            <li> There were small whiteheads all around my chin, and a few starting in places</li>
            <li> and I even cut them in half</li>
            <li> anyway she recieved these Niapads 2 weeks ago and cuts them in half...</li>
            <li> I felt a slight tingling sensation, but nothing that bothered me.</li>
            <li> I noticed a slight improvement, I have acne scars, milia,and  hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> When I got my Niapads, I cut a small piece, wet it, and then placed it on the mess.</li>
            <li> I suspect it&#x27;s the SLS because it broke me out with a gazillion small closed comedones over 90% of my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have been using Niapads for a little over a month</li>
            <li> Little did I realize inside it contains 30 pads.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I wish I&#x27;d found them sooner!</li>
            <li> Some would work for a little while</li>
            <li> /&gt;Struggling with acne for over ten years, I came to terms with my bad skin and learned how to apply makeup and just live with it.</li>
            <li> Waste of $ to me.  </li>
            <li> I had one come a few months ago</li>
            <li> When I started using these I had clogged and broken-out skin on the sides of my face along my jawline, and a few blemishes here and there on my forehead.</li>
            <li> Each pad is small and thin (a little smaller than a credit card)</li>
            <li> I have been using them for about a week now and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since whereas before I would always have at least a couple active zits somewhere on my face at any given time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean read the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> have continued to order these for the past few months because I do like the product.</li>
            <li> have continued to order these for the past few months because I do like the product.</li>
            <li> There is usually some improvement, but I am never completely free of acne.  </li>
            <li> What can you use to stop or slow down the milia?</li>
            <li> It called for cutting out a small (smaller than thumb tip) corner of the pad, to slightly wet it and place on the pimple until dried, and then removing the pad and rinse.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I felt a cystic pimple coming on (that redness and hard bump under the skin), so I used the niapad as a spot treatment.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow... I proceeded to use this product in spite of what I knew because I was so anxious to see the results of what the Vitamin B3 could deliver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually have them.  </li>
            <li> I have always suffered from small breakouts.</li>
            <li> Results after just one use are unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, although Duac helped a bit, it was not enough for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Not really sure about this product.  </li>
            <li> If I do feel that small lump or \\&quot;twinge\\&quot; upon washing, I lather with the niapad and leave it on for 15 minutes or so, then rinse - and follow with my 2.5% hydrocortisone prescription cream.  </li>
            <li> expensive (even after cutting the pads in half for each use) and didn&#x27;t see any difference between these and say using purpose soap or just a hot washcloth.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s hard to break that habit).    </li>
            <li> but then the acne slowly started to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have terrible acne, since forever, and while it&#x27;s changed as I&#x27;ve aged, it hasn&#x27;t really diminished.</li>
            <li> and although I&#x27;ve never really gotten a lot of breakouts, the couple that are always present are horrible- very inflamed and painful.  </li>
            <li> And they seemed to be extra painful.  </li>
            <li> The pill helped my complexion, but I was still having really bad breakouts almost all the time (from white heads to deep painful pimples).</li>
            <li> We were cutting the cleaning wipes into little pieces.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To put SLS irritating effects in perspective, I switched to a shampoo containing zero sodium products and my seborrheic dermatitis is under control and my acne even showed some improvement.</li>
            <li> Irritating Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Sodium</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 30 with an oily, acne-prone complexion that gets worse depending on my hormonal cycle.  </li>
            <li> Pricey for the volume, a thin packet.  </li>
            <li> approximately 11 years ago.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m tired of spending money on things that don&#x27;t work and having it sit on my bathroom shelf.  </li>
            <li> I know I get worse around my period,</li>
            <li> Is it the combo of all this stuff or is it these pads that changed the game?</li>
            <li> Acne is a nightmare, but the hyper pigmentation that follows can be even worse.</li>
            <li> Did not cause any worse result though.</li>
            <li> Everything I had tried before dried my skin out so badly that I looked like I had a permanent sun burn.</li>
            <li> I had been using expensive department store cleansers that have not worked as well as this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not impressed and wont purchase again, unless they formulate this product without parabens.  </li>
            <li> with Acne are often shy and introvert and the offer is an incentive to get them to speak out.&lt;br /&gt;Second - if you tried Product \\&quot;PQR\\&quot; and it did not work for you, would you be enticed to give it a five star rating just to get another bottle of \\&quot;PQR\\&quot; even though it does not work for you?</li>
            <li> They are, however, too expensive for the amount you get.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have horrible acne but every once in a while I get a horrible cystic pimple that takes a couple of weeks to go away.</li>
            <li> After stopping birth control pills, I broke out like crazy with cysts around my jawline.</li>
            <li> and I picked (bad choice, trust me).  </li>
            <li> I got frustrated and turned to the message boards where I heard about this product.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Immediately after opening my package, I zoomed in on the ingredients and was very much disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst area was the painful bumps on chin.</li>
            <li> I was having horrible chest acne breakouts and acne scars</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the sort of awful acne</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product \\&quot;junkie\\&quot; and have a horrible online shopping addiction.  </li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change in acne. But that&#x27;s better than breaking out worse. These would be excellent for camp</li>
            <li> This product is simple to use and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much. It is effective and totally worth the cost. Give it a try and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For the first time in four years I have beautiful clear skin, all because of Niapads. Everything I had tried before dried my skin out so badly that I looked like I had a permanent sun burn. Niapads not only help clear away acne but keep the redness at bay, it&#x27;s purely wonderful. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Niapads has been a wonderful blessing in my life. I am over 40 and have battled cystic acne since my early 20&#x27;s.  This is the only product I have found that works quickly and effectively to clear up my breakout without drying out my skin. They ease the discomfort and embarressment of having to go in public with bumps that usually would not go away for weeks. My skin feels smooth and healthy and my breakouts are few and far between now. [[ASIN:B001AWCNVG Niapads]]</li>
            <li> UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve been using Niapoads since May and although it clears cystic Acne almost immediately the lathering ingrediant (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate) causes small numerous bumps all over.  Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is used by most companies because it is a cheap additive for lathering.    After struggling for several years with acne I finally found something that works!  Noticeable results within 2 days. I&#x27;ve tried everything under the sun and so so glad I found Niapads. I use twice daily along with, 1 500mg B vitamin (Niacide) and, a high alkaline diet.</li>
            <li> Niapads dries out pimples but doesnt dry out the skin. Im on my second pack now. It is better than Benzoyl peroxide which causes drying of the skin.</li>
            <li> Background: 29yrs old black female. 15+ year sufferer of moderate to severe acne, acne scaring and hyper-pigmentation. Skin type is very oily and acne prone. Tried OTC, Rx (to include Accutane), Lasers, Peels. Some were pretty affective but came with very severe side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I want to express how excited I was about receiving this particular product because I&#x27;ve recently given up on spending THOUSANDS on dermatologist and aesthetician bills, prescription medications, cosmetic procedures, and expensive skin care products. Additionally, I recently discovered why most products just didn&#x27;t seem to work for me - irritating ingredients. So after researching every single ingredient in all of my Rx, skin care and hair car products, I had to toss out 98% of them. Additionally, I&#x27;ve been reading about more natural alternatives and ingredients that are equally beneficial for acne without all the harsh irritating effects. So again, I was especially excited to receive this product as I believed it contained a decent concentration level of vitamin B or at the very least enough of it WITHOUT any counterproductive ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well so I thought...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after opening my package, I zoomed in on the ingredients and was very much disappointed. This product contains Sodium Lauryl Sulfate which is an ingredient used for its \\&quot;lathering\\&quot; effects. This stuff is in most skin care products, shampoos, clothing, and dish washing detergents. Well the problem is SLS \\&quot;is one of the most irritating cleansing agents used in skin-care products\\&quot; according to the European Journal of Dermatology and the American Journal of Contact Dermatitis. Sure some folks enjoy a nice lather and actually feel as though their skin isn&#x27;t properly cleansed without it but the truth is that lather has nothing to do with cleansing. Sure some lathering cleanser removes excess oils but doesn&#x27;t actually cleanse the skin. I have used many Neutrogena products (which are the WORST)that work up a good lather, only afterwards to use a toner, witch-hazel or alcohol and find globs of dirt and dead skin on the cotton swab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put SLS irritating effects in perspective, I switched to a shampoo containing zero sodium products and my seborrheic dermatitis is under control and my acne even showed some improvement. The shampoo also contains Tea Tree Oil which may have also contributed to my skin improvements. So, I knew I was on the right track with eliminating certain ingredients and incorporating more natural ones like the Tea Tree and Vitamin B3, to name a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow... I proceeded to use this product in spite of what I knew because I was so anxious to see the results of what the Vitamin B3 could deliver. Plus, I had two very large active nodule pimples near my temple that I was trying to rid myself of ASAP (this is actually an improvement considering prior to revamping my products regimen, I had 4 to 5 on any given day). The product instructions provided an alternate process to treat inflamed, nodule, and/or cystic type of acne which actually is pretty effective. It called for cutting out a small (smaller than thumb tip) corner of the pad, to slightly wet it and place on the pimple until dried, and then removing the pad and rinse. My nodule pimples were gone in 1.5 days which is an all time record. Not even injections from the dermatologist improved my large nodule pimples that quickly. For this reason alone is why I gave this product 3 stars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after seeing these results, I thought for sure I could suck up the irritating effects of SLS if the vitamin B3 could improve my acne that quickly. Well, this pad has so much lathering ingredients in it that I had to cut it in half (original size is about 2 x 3 inch rectangle flat, textured swab) which is already very small. It still produced a rich lather and after rinsing my face, I had a white film/residue on my face. Whether this is the SLS or Vitamin B3, I have no ideabut I suspect it&#x27;s the SLS because it broke me out with a gazillion small closed comedones over 90% of my face. However, zero nodule or cystic acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply, I would recommend this product for spot treatment, especially for nodule/cystic type acne. I would not recommend using this as a facial cleansing and especially not using it twice a day as recommended by the manufacturer. What would be a blast is if the manufacturer would update their ingredients to exclude the SLS and other sodium ingredients within it. Then I bet this stuff would fly off the shelves! And I would certainly give it a 5 star but for now, I think 3 is appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extremely Irritating Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Lauryl Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Coco Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;Lavender Oil</li>
            <li> I am 35 and I have SUFFERED from cystic/nodular acne for 3 years.  I have tried so many different products and nothing would clear my skin. After reading about B3/niacinamide, I was hopeful and decided to try these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Niapads for a little over a month and my skin is almost completely clear.  The first thing I noticed was the redness lessened.  Then the breakouts I did have went from big bumps to small bumps or whiteheads.  Another great thing is that these pads have helped my oily skin - I used to blot the oil off my skin every 2 hours, now I only blot once or twice a day! My scarring has gotten lighter and my skin is actually soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use the pads gently all over my face and neck and then I like to use my fingers to gently massage the product in for about 60 seconds and then rinse.  Don&#x27;t scrub your skin - be gentle to it.  And if you feel hopeless about your acne, try these!</li>
            <li> I first came across this product by pure chance.  I had written up a skincare review for the website Monsters and Critics, extolling the virtues of a skin care line that had been sent to me for review.  Niapads \\&quot;talked back\\&quot; in the user comments and left information regarding their skin cleansing pads.    Long story short, I contacted them and ordered a six pack for my son, severely afflicted with acne who was only marginally responding to oral antibiotics, and who had gone through every acne system for skin care imaginable.      After Pro Activ burned through and discolored two sets of bed sheets, and many different acne control regimens were invested in, the Niapads have proven to be superbly effective in helping to clear up his skin.    For myself, dealing with very mild rosacea, the pads for me have replaced what I had been using and really perform.    Niapads are amazingly effective for blemish and Rosacea control. The pads contain Niacinamide (aka Nicotinamide or Vitamin B3). This product has worked miracles on teenage skin suffering from severe acne in our house, and is my favorite deep cleansing pad for face washing. Gentle natural formula, even most sensitive Rosacea-afflicted skin will respond well to it.    In our Earth day round up of various products, I recommend it, you can find the article here: [...]</li>
            <li> I came across Niapads while searching the web for effective acne control products as everything I tried didn&#x27;t seem to work.  I ordered the 30 pack to give them a try and loved them immediately. Each pad is small and thin (a little smaller than a credit card) so they are easy to store and super easy to travel with.  They have a gentle, yet effective exfoliation that gets right into the pores. They leave the skin feeling clean, not greasy as with some cleansers or dried out by some others.  Plus the light lavender scent is a huge bonus. No medicine or antiseptic smell to these. They have definitely helped keep oily skin at bay and acne flare ups under control.  Would highly recommed Niapads!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on my second set of Niapads.  I&#x27;m almost 30 with an oily, acne-prone complexion that gets worse depending on my hormonal cycle.  I only use one Niapad a day and not the two that they recommend (but I will start using 2/day now).  My acne break outs have been greatly reduced and my skin is much softer.  I still break out, but I sleep with either side of my face against a pillow every night (it&#x27;s hard to break that habit).    I read another review that mentioned applying the Niapad at night and NOT rinsing it off, I followed that advice and really think it made a difference.  The very first night I used this product I had 3 fairly big pimples and 1 cystic-type one, the next morning they had all come to a &#x27;head&#x27; and by the morning after that they were well on their way to clearing up, which would normally have been at least another week.  I have accepted that I will never have a perfect complexion but Niapads do make a difference.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have tried countless remedies for stubborn acne. While browsing the internet we came upon a glowing review of Niapads so we decided to try them. We love them. My daughte&#x27;s teenage acne is significantly diminished and my hormonal acne is gone. I was surprised that such an inexpensive fix could work so well, but it has. My skin is radiant. Really it has never looked so good. I had been using expensive department store cleansers that have not worked as well as this. Thank You! Much success to your companty as well!</li>
            <li> I ordered Niapads as a quick fix for my acne.  I am extremely prone to MRSA and cannot take anymore antibiotics, so as instructed by my Infectious Disease doctor, I sought a natural alternative.  These sounded amazing, like they were sent from the gods...I mean read the other reviews.  However, Niapads did nothing for me; my acne stayed the same.  The only difference I noticed was that my face smelled great...which isn&#x27;t worth the money.  It may work for some people, but it did not for me.  I ended up spending $180 at the pharmacy picking up prescriptions from my dermatologist.  Niapads don&#x27;t work for everyone...don&#x27;t let them fool you!  :)</li>
            <li> Great product with a very pleasant smell. I use it in the evening after I wash my face with another cleanser. After wetting the dry Niapad,  I gently wipe the wet Niapad all over my face and leave it on over night instead of washing it off as stated in directions.  It dries clear.  I have not had any irritation from this product.  I have only used it for about one week so it may be too early for results, but I do believe my skin feels softer and smoother. I am using it for its anti-aging properties. Very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> Pricey for the volume, a thin packet.  Each sheet is about 1.5in x 3&amp;#34;.  Even so, I&#x27;m going to cut each pad with scissors in quarters to make it go further.  I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s working yet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have horrible acne but every once in a while I get a horrible cystic pimple that takes a couple of weeks to go away. Normally, when using other acne medications I also run into the problem that they are too strong and end up taking off a layer of my skin or drying my skin out without really helping the pimple at all. With these, any pimple I have had has been gone pretty much over night without drying out my skin. A few weeks ago I felt a cystic pimple coming on (that redness and hard bump under the skin), so I used the niapad as a spot treatment. I was amazed when I woke up the next morning and the pimple had shrunk so that it was nearly unnoticeable. I haven&#x27;t begun to use these as a daily treatment yet, however, the other night I did use one all over my face for the first time. The pad was slightly drying to my face, but nothing that couldn&#x27;t be fixed with applying some moisturizer. I think that I will start to use them as part of my daily routine to keep away those occasional pimples.</li>
            <li> We have been using Niapads for our teenage son and daughter for about a year. The results are noticeable although they are most effective if used daily. It&#x27;s so easy to bring Niapads on a trip. No adverse reaction has ever occurred. A great alternative to prescription medicine.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice anything different. Waste of $ to me.  I felt suckered that I bought into it to be honest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle cure--it won&#x27;t work overnight--but it works very quickly (within a few days).  It reduces redness and does make an impact if you use it the right way (with additional treatment, like a face wash).  Also these pads last a really long time because I cut them down to the size of the pimple.  Whether you wet it and stick it on, or just use it to wipe the spot, it works great.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT product! I only wish I had known about these 10 years ago... they work , they&#x27;re great and I even cut them in half so 30 becomes 60. I use them morning and night and haven&#x27;t had a zit since I started using them (over 2 months now). They are a permanent part of my skin care regime. If you have acne issues it&#x27;s definitely worth a try, I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I spot treat with these.  I cut each pad into 6 pieces and they last a LONG time.  I also don&#x27;t rinse the product off, but simply wet the cut bit of pad and coat individual spots(less and less!!) with B3 goodness.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of all the hype and high ratings.  I have oily-acne prone skin and I get the occasional large knot on my chin.  I have used the pads to wash my face and have done the spot treatments and the only thing i have noticed is they dry out the area of the pimple and my skin peels after a day of using it.  It&#x27;s no miracle by my standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: \\&quot;4% niacinamide\\&quot;, lavender oil&lt;br /&gt;Cons: methyl paraben, other unknown chemicals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not impressed and wont purchase again, unless they formulate this product without parabens.  I&#x27;ll look for other products with high % niacin amide.</li>
            <li> While I was searching the web for effective acne product and all my previous trials  did not work and all that was waste of money and time.I ordered the 30 pack just giveanother try and loved very much immediately, and found effective.Niapads is easy to carry and store.It is very effective that  get right into the skin porous and skin feels clean and fresh.Very much need to follow instruction of product usage which  give good results.I strongly recommend \\&quot;Niapads\\&quot; for effective acne control from experience and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have had mild acne for a long time now. It&#x27;s nice to finally use a simple product that actually calms and improves the look of my skin. It&#x27;s easy to use and has really helped my skin.</li>
            <li> Definitely helps keep oil production in check and long term there are also wrinkle reducing benefits. I use in conjunction w/ a Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these pads for a little over 2 weeks and have been really impressed with the results so far. My active pimples went away within days and fewer are showing up. I also really enjoy the pleasant lavender scent. I just wish the pads came in a larger size, so that I can use them for breakouts on my chest and back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I&#x27;ve started puberty...approximately 11 years ago.  I&#x27;m 26 years old now and it has NEVER gone away.  I have used numerous rounds of antibiotics, various prescription face creams, ProActive (twice), Accutane, blah, blah, blah.  Nothing has changed my acne.  Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for cheaper and more natural solutions since I have no insurance to see a doctor and I&#x27;m tired of spending money on things that don&#x27;t work and having it sit on my bathroom shelf.  I&#x27;ve only tried honey and coconut oil, neither of which worked.  I was excited to come across Niapads because the reviews seem so magical.  It&#x27;s not \\&quot;natural\\&quot; or necessarily \\&quot;cheap,\\&quot; but I thought it might be worth a shot.  The first 5 days of using it, I could have cried.  Not only did it not clear up my acne in days like others, it seemed to make it worse.  There were small whiteheads all around my chin, and a few starting in places I don&#x27;t usually have them.  And they seemed to be extra painful.  But, something told me to keep going.  I had nothing to lose anyway, right?  Now, a week and a half after starting, I have no new pimples on my face, the ones that I had disappeared quickly (like overnight quick), and the redness is greatly reduced.  I know I get worse around my period, so I&#x27;ll update and see whether it kept my skin under control during my most vulnerable time.  But, so far, I can&#x27;t be more happy to not have a single zit on my face....</li>
            <li> My son has tried anything and everything under the sun for his acne. Been to the dermatologist a dozen times. Nothing has worked. This seems to be the first thing we&#x27;ve tried that has made a serious difference. And the difference is almost immediate. Couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
            <li> These make my face so soft and smooth! The my acne started to disappear after only a few uses. I love Niapads!</li>
            <li> They kept my face clean and blemish free. They are soft and can be used even on sensitive skin. I would absolutely buy again</li>
            <li> I have always suffered from small breakouts. No matter how hard I try to keep my skin clear I am always bound to get a pimple here &amp; there. Now during my pregnancy I have had a few breakouts with major stubborn pimples. I use the NiaPads to help fight these breakouts every time a pimple pops up. These small pads seem to really work. They almost instantly reduce the redness &amp; you will see a change in the size of your pimples the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer: I received the product described above for free in exchange for my unbiased review. No other compensation was provided</li>
            <li> I tried Niapads on a whim and I can&#x27;t believe how well they worked after a week! I&#x27;ve tried everything over the years and have currently been using Retin-A but Niapads not only cleared the pimples I would get but actually left my skin looking and feeling really nice. No irritation or redness or flaky skin. Even my friends and family noticed a difference. I will definitely keep using them!</li>
            <li> I  don&#x27;t tend to get a lot of acne(maybe 5-6 pimples a year) but when I do its ALWAYS on my jaw lines and they are ALWAY huge! I had one come a few months ago and I used the Niapads, They completely disappeared WITHOUT a trace! These are GREAT to have just in case you get that unsightly pimple! I also have very sensative skin and did not break out using these! I will be keeping this on hand at ALL times!</li>
            <li> I came across this product when searching the Internet for a natural product to treat breakouts. I found out that the ingredient Nicotinamide (vit B3) \\&quot;attacks\\&quot; the bacteria that causes breakouts. If you have responded to antibiotic treatment in the past, than this ingredient will be effective. After more research, I found Niapads on Amazon and decided to give it a try. After the first few days, I noticed an improvement. That was two months ago and I&#x27;m still using Niapads and telling others about it. It&#x27;s easy to use and great for travel. Try it out, you&#x27;ll be pleased.</li>
            <li> These where had such great reviews I had to have them! They are not crap clean face well and exfoliate! As far as seeing a difference not really! Not a miracle. But then again nothing is! Clean your face, eat right and drink water. And these will be a bonus.</li>
            <li> I saw results from the first pad - my pores look better, skin is really soft. It&#x27;s not irritating. Best product I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;have ever used for my problem skin.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent product. The only products that i have tried were antibiotics (minocycline) with benzol, some other chemicals, cleaners etc etc. I was going to try accutane but I didnt want to get cancer and bleed internally so I decided to search for some other alternatives. The antibiotics helped reduce breakouts and cystic acne from my face but there were still a few (like 10) tiny pimples over my face and jaw, this cleared it up within a few days. Instructions say to use it twice a day, however I dont have time for that and using it once already is a major improvement. Ive never used any niaciamide products before so i cannot compare this to others, but yes this does work. Just cut it up, wet it ( dont wash it) and put it on your face until its dry.</li>
            <li> Ok so my daughter has cystic acne also scars, she is using many things, acnepril,clinique acne,medera and bare minerals makeup, plus washing her pillow slip twice a week.....anyway she recieved these Niapads 2 weeks ago and cuts them in half...she only uses them before bed....well am I seeing what I&#x27;m seeing!!!!!! She was going out tonight and she looked radient.  Are you kidding me?  I&#x27;m ordering more.  I see a massive difference.  Is it the combo of all this stuff or is it these pads that changed the game?</li>
            <li> Since age 15 (I am 32 now) I have suffered with constant acne ranging to moderate to severe.  No topical treatments would seem to help including BP (sold on acne.org), Salicylic acid, sulfur, clay masks, or Tretinoin cream (from the doc).  I also tried just doing nothing for a couple months to give my skin a break and that never helped, either.  Birth control pills and antibiotics help in the short term but with side effects that make them undesirable solutions for the long term.  Accutane helped while I was on it and for about 8 months after but then the acne slowly started to come back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started using Niapads after reading positive reviews on acne.org and after just TWO DAYS the acne I had around my nose/mouth area completely cleared up.  I have been using them for about a week now and haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since whereas before I would always have at least a couple active zits somewhere on my face at any given time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did seem a bit drying at first but I scaled back to using just once a day with a quality moisturizer at night and my skin isn&#x27;t dry anymore.  So maybe 2x/day is too much for some skin types (like mine).  I haven&#x27;t even started taking the oral B3 supplement yet but have ordered it.  I&#x27;m sure that combo of that plus the Niapads will be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $17, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying these out to see if they work for you.  I wouldn&#x27;t suggest using any other topical acne treatments at the same time, however.  It will overly dry the skin.</li>
            <li> I love Niapads, they leave my skin feeling clean and soft, it&#x27;s been very helpful with my adult acne problems.</li>
            <li> When I first received the Niapads, I was like wow, this is a small sample. Little did I realize inside it contains 30 pads. Now that&#x27;s more like it (guess I should&#x27;ve read that on the back!). Immediately, I noticed the refreshing yet light Lavender smell of the pads. I had a couple of areas that needed clearing up, so I decided to try it on my whole face. Now, if you are using it for just a pimple or a couple of pimples than it&#x27;s plenty big. However, just me personally I would of preferred a little bigger pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then proceeded to put it on my face, and left it on for about 30 seconds. I felt a slight tingling sensation, but nothing that bothered me. It was a good feeling, like it was cleaning my pores out. The next day, I significantly noticed my skin looked a bit clearer, in fact a lot clearer! By the second day the patches of acne were pretty much gone. If I had just let it do it&#x27;s thing (and used my normal facial cleanser every night), it would of probably took close to a week. I was really impressed with these little pads, and how much power they have behind them. I love that they are made is the US. I also think they are 10X better than any of those facial cleansing pads they have in Walgreen&#x27;s. Not to mention they are great if you travel, since the pouch is resealable. Overall, I would have to say besides being a little small they are a win win in my book.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the easiest, most effective product I&#x27;ve tried and used for adult acne. It&#x27;s mild on your skin, and is appropriate for any skin type. I use one pad at night (or you can use twice a day as directed), and only use water in the morning to rinse my face to avoid over-drying my skin. The improvement (visibly and the way your skin feels) is noticeable immediately. It also clears acne blemishes over time (I&#x27;ve been using this product now for 3 months and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results). I use this product and a moisturizer that is non-comedogenic to avoid clogging my pores. I&#x27;ve also found their practical advise on calming acne outbreaks to be very helpful. The price is excellent and you can&#x27;t beat it. My sister tried this product for 30 days and went from severe acne (that required injections, and both oral &amp; topical medications) to mild/moderate acne. My acne is mild/moderate and now I&#x27;m getting fewer and fewer episodes. This product WORKS!</li>
            <li> These pads are small, but they sure do work !!! I have combination skin and they help clear up my complexion immediately. Already received my second order in the mail and just in time for our vacation :-)</li>
            <li> I have used lots of other products just like everyone else, this works well, I cut all the pieces in half so it lasts twice as long.</li>
            <li> Extremely fast shipping! These pads work wonders for my teenage son who has problematic skin. Immediate results were visible after one use! I&#x27;m beyond impressed and will definitely place another order as soon as they&#x27;re needed! Niapads are the equivalent to little miracle workers when your skin wants to &amp;#34;misbehave&amp;#34;. Results after just one use are unbelievable. Niapads are a MUST have! Purchase with confidence, as this seller is absolutely honest and promptly and politely answers whatever question you may have.</li>
            <li> I struggle with hormonal acne shortly before my cycle, and these pads by far have been the best product I&#x27;ve used to combat this. While they are not a miracle cure, nothing for acne really is, and these pads if used daily as a spot treatment will dramatically speed up the healing time of even deep cystic acne. Definitely satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This product is the best one I&#x27;ve found!  It truly keeps your skin clear without over drying or irritation!  I cut them up and place a piece on a cystic nodule and it dramatically decreases the amount of time it takes to heal.  I accidentally ran out of them tonight and I&#x27;m freaking out because I can&#x27;t get them soon enough with waiting for shipping!! LOL</li>
            <li> I have used these for just over a month now and they work better than anything else I have ever tried without over drying my skin! Thanks niapads!</li>
            <li> I am a 52 year old female with hormonal acne. Worst area was the painful bumps on chin. This product has totally cleared up my chin as well as other areas. I am very pleased so far with this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything there is for acne since I was a teenager. All the topicals, pill form, everything. Accutane evetually worked and I was clear for about 5 or 6 years, but once my 20s hit, the acne &amp; redness started to come back. Due to medical side-effects from Accutane, I opted to try anything else before going back that route.    I had tried all of the over-the-counter drugstore treatments, IPL laser treatments, and saw a dermatologist who gave me 3 prescriptions. Still, nothing was successful.    I got frustrated and turned to the message boards where I heard about this product. Everyone raved about Niapads so I figured I had to give it a try. I can&#x27;t believe it, but I have not broken out since using these pads! I also try to take a Niacinamide pill every day as well (active ingredient in Niapads). As with anything, I would advise to not skip a day or sleep in makeup, as that&#x27;s the only time I notice any problems on my skin. But all in all I think this is a wonder product. My face is clearing up, staying clear, and feels really healthy-not dried out at all.</li>
            <li> Having tried this product with high hopes &amp; ended with numerous breakouts including cysts (even in &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; areas that never had acne problem) following the instruction faithfully for a week, I feel obligated to share my experience. Not all of our acne is the same and this product can surely do damage to some. Tread with caution, run a trial on a small patch of skin before you use it on the entire face.</li>
            <li> Exellent product! Makes inpurities fade within a day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using niapads for a week now and I have more breakouts now then before I started using this product whiteheads everywhere I dont know if I ahould discontinue this product and use coconut oil or give it some more time ughhh</li>
            <li> ... according to the note accompanying this product. So here you go, Niapads. Here&#x27;s your 5 star review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product actually is very effective, which is why I ordered it a 2nd time and will probably continue to order it. I would legitimately give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I want to make sure there is full disclosure of the Niapads offer, since I believe this offer means 5 star reviews of the product may need to be considered with a sizable salt granule and folks should know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited to add:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the following note from Niapads in regards to my review. I think they make a valid argument for the offer I described above, so I&#x27;m going to include it below so that others can take it into consideration:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We respect your opinion regarding Niapads(TM) offer and feel that we need to clarify our position.&lt;br /&gt;First - good reviews are essential to the growth of any small business competing with companies who can afford to have stars like Beiber, Brittany or Katy Perry endorse their product.&lt;br /&gt;Individuals with Acne are often shy and introvert and the offer is an incentive to get them to speak out.&lt;br /&gt;Second - if you tried Product \\&quot;PQR\\&quot; and it did not work for you, would you be enticed to give it a five star rating just to get another bottle of \\&quot;PQR\\&quot; even though it does not work for you? Probably not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our intent has been to get individuals who have found Niapads(TM) to truly help them with their acne issues and tell the world about it. When they write, we can feel the passion in their words and it provides us with the much needed encouragement to move forward. Those endorsements are worth much more to us than any paid endorsements by celebrities.&lt;br /&gt;While we certainly cannot afford celebrity endorsements in the near future, we assure you that we would continue to seek endorsements from real users even when we can afford to pay celebrities.&lt;br /&gt;Our intent has never been to mislead anybody about Niapads(TM). We sincerely hope that this helps change your opinion about Niapads(TM).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer Service&lt;br /&gt;Niapads(TM)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I have continued to order these for the past few months because I do like the product. However, the price has increased. I&#x27;m going to order it one more time and do a final evaluation and comparison of whether the effectiveness is worth the price. Right now I am leaning towards \\&quot;no.\\&quot; I&#x27;d consider it a worthwhile buy as long as they kept it to $15 (which would be $1 per day for the product if used as directed), since I do not consider it sufficiently effective to use on its own. If the item was a one-stop product for my skin needs, it might be worth the higher price. But it isn&#x27;t. Your mileage may vary..

            <li> Made my skin super dry.  It did help some pimples but I am needing something a little more gentle and not so drying.</li>
            <li> love these. My skin had improved so so much! My acne is gone and if I do get a pimple it clears up very quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave the damage that it used to. I stopped using all other acne products that I have tried over the years and started using these, a niaciminide serum (by skin daily), CereVe moisturizers, a clairsonic brush and wash, and niacin orally. Huge difference, I wish I would have known about this when I was a teenager (I&#x27;m 32 now, acne my whole life). the texture of my skin has improved so much, I look younger and am confident enough to go without make up (this NEVER happened before all of this Niacin stuff). I hope it works for you too!</li>
            <li> Everything said by most reviews is true, they are AMAZING!</li>
            <li> Love these pads. I like to use them all over my face as a face scrub occasionally. But as a spot treatment they are excellent. I have had a blemish on my cheek that would not go away and I mean this has gone on for months, no matter what I did, which is why I got this product in the first plce. Niapads ® is the only product that is working, this blemish is almost gone completely now. I honestly don&#x27;t believe there is a better product out there.</li>
            <li> I have acne and wanted to try something to clear my face.  These worked great and I plan on re-ordering before I run out.</li>
            <li> I really liked them however because of what happened with the serum that I ordered from you I won&#x27;t be ordering anything again. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I spent so much time and money on so many useless products to treat and clear my adult acne! When I came across Niapads and read all the positive reviews, I knew I had to try them, and WOW! Granted I do also take niacinamide orally, my face has never been more clear, smooth, and beautiful since I&#x27;ve been using these things. Highly, highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many products that have done me no good. Niapads is something new and different- it clears and prevents acne and also gets rid of my acne hyper pigmentation. Acne is a nightmare, but the hyper pigmentation that follows can be even worse. Just recently, I got a pimple that I popped and I picked (bad choice, trust me).  And I ended up with a red burned like skin about the size of your thumb. Oh my lord, it was an absolute nightmare and I didn&#x27;t even want to leave my house. When I got my Niapads, I cut a small piece, wet it, and then placed it on the mess. It completely cleared and returned back to normal when nothing else helped. I also had a few zits brewing that Niapad quickly diminished. I am honestly so glad that I bought Niapads! I promise you will be glad also!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an Item that would help me stop break outs. I found Niapads, I use the pads right after i wash my face. I place a total of three on my face. One on each cheek and one on my four head. The ingredients help my skin from future breakouts. I am glad i found and tried out this product. I will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Great product and seller.</li>
            <li> I am a female in my early 20s and have a history of moderate-severe acne since the age of 12. I started birth control when I was 18, partially in hopes to help my skin. The pill helped my complexion, but I was still having really bad breakouts almost all the time (from white heads to deep painful pimples). I have tried OTC, Rx, and natural products to manage my skin. And while natural products have always worked best (Dermagist is good), my skin has never been completely clear... Until NiaPads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Struggling with acne for over ten years, I came to terms with my bad skin and learned how to apply makeup and just live with it. But not anymore! I have been using NiaPads in combination with a 12% Nicinamide serum by Acnessentials (I got it for free when I ordered another product!) for 3 months and I have seen AMAZING results-- a complete 180! For the first time in my adult life, I can leave my house without applying any coverup, foundation, or any make up at all. Aside from the occasional spot pimple, my skin is COMPLETELY CLEAR. Not only does this clear your skin of acne, it also strengthens the immunity of your skin, making lesions (breakouts) less likely to occur and heal fast when then do.. win-win-win!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: it took about a month before I saw the full results I wanted... it takes time for our skin to heal and let the product work. So don&#x27;t give up! :)</li>
            <li> I am 35 and have struggled with moderate acne since my teenage years.  Being older, I find that most acne medications (OTC or prescription) are very drying and rather ineffective.  Niapads have been the most effective and gentle product i have ever used for acne.  I am actually amazed at how quickly they work.  For stubborn, cystic acne bumps these usually cause the tenderness to subside or at least bring it to a head much more quickly.  I recommend this product to many of my friends who have also had good results.  My skin feels very soft after using the cloths and it&#x27;s not the least bit drying which is something I always tend to struggle with.  These are definitely worth a try!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my third month of using Niapads and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results.  Not only does this product help future breakouts but it also helps current pimples heal faster by keeping a small piece of the pad over the pimple for an extended amount of time.  I was initially hesitant to try this because it had never been mentioned to me by a dermatologist.  However, I&#x27;m so glad I took the chance!  I will forever be a Niapads user!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t leave product reviews but the results I had with niapads has been so great that I have to share my experience with everyone else. I found niapads after doing some researching on products the internet for acne. I was having horrible chest acne breakouts and acne scars and I have tried just about every product but nothing seemed to help. I was pretty much about to give up and go to a dermatologist (which can be very pricey if you don&#x27;t have insurance) until I read in a forum that niapads, which contain vitamin B3 is also good for acne flareups. In less than a month after I ordered my first pack I noticed an improvement in my skin and the amount of breakouts I had.&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using niapads for about 4 months and each day the overall condition of my skin and my acne breakouts continue to get better. It is definetely worth it to try this product if you are suffering from acne on your face, chest, etc.</li>
            <li> expensive (even after cutting the pads in half for each use) and didn&#x27;t see any difference between these and say using purpose soap or just a hot washcloth.</li>
            <li> They are, however, too expensive for the amount you get.  We were cutting the cleaning wipes into little pieces.  Awesome product but not for the asking price.  Give us more.</li>
            <li> Niapads cleared my acne and left me with wonderfully smooth skin.  My only complaint is that I wish I&#x27;d found them sooner!</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive skin. It Broke me out on 3rd use. It didnt help my acne either. . I have ance prone sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> These are decent for spot treatments but beware there is SLS in it which kinda defeats the purpose. Especially if you have sensitive skin. I like using them for over night treatment and it works very well. But as others have said, I would not use all over due to SLS</li>
            <li> I realized I didn’t need the whole pad after using one the first night so I cut the pads in half to get more bang for my buck. I recently started using these pads twice a day.  Within two days I saw a huge improvement in my cystic acne. I used to wake up to 3-7 new pimples a day and within 7 days I’ve seen maybe 2 new breakouts, less redness, and clearing up of old acne scars. I’ve tried so many products that when I read the reviews I was super skeptical but figured “what the hell” and I’m so happy I did. This product is actually working for me! Super excited and already feel my confidence growing.</li>
            <li> My son &amp; I were very hopeful this would work for him after reading the reviews.  He diligently used these for about two weeks and saw no improvement in his cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually leave reviews on Amazon.  I HAD to leave a review for this product.  I just ordered it for a second time.  I am using it once a day, sometimes twice, to wash my face and after a month my face has completely cleared up.  I am 27 and although I&#x27;ve never really gotten a lot of breakouts, the couple that are always present are horrible- very inflamed and painful.  I have used many different OTC and Rx acne products.  There is usually some improvement, but I am never completely free of acne.  A few months ago I went back to a dermatologist because I will be getting married soon, and although I had come to terms with my skin in a way, I really didn&#x27;t want to have to deal with this in wedding pictures.  She put me on Duac gel and said not to worry, this should clear up before the wedding.  Needless to say, although Duac helped a bit, it was not enough for my skin.  Since trying THIS product- Niapads- my skin has completely cleared up.  I am using it in combination with the Rx I mentioned, but after the wedding I will experiment with just this and see how it goes.  I am just not looking to take any chances right now.  I will try to write a follow-up.  I should mention, that as with some other acne products, I experienced what other users mentioned about skin getting worse before it gets better.  I really felt as though this product purged my skin of impurities during the second week or so of use.  If you can make it through that, your skin stays clear :):):)</li>
            <li> These really work well and leave my face feeling refreshed. Considering I have like really sensitive skin these are perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with acne for many years (in mid 30s now).  I&#x27;ve tried almost everything and these have been one of the best things I&#x27;ve used on my skin. I think Sprintec (Rx) has done a lot to control my acne and Niapads have significantly improved the texture and clarity of my skin.  Whenever I&#x27;ve stopped using them, I start to break out a bit.  I&#x27;ve purchased these several times now.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, but didn&#x27;t help moderate acne.</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  This was the only thing that would clear up my chin. It had red pimples for months that would not go away and these finally worked.  Now I just use them when I first see a pimple appearing and after 1-2 uses the pimple goes away and never gets big.</li>
            <li> Not really sure about this product.  I tried it a couple of times and it did not seem to really do much for me but that doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work wonders for someone else.</li>
            <li> to be fair this product may be good for some and bad for others.it didnt work for me all it did was cause more and more break out and rash that cover my face.when i stop using it my face clear with garlic water.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING. After stopping birth control pills, I broke out like crazy with cysts around my jawline. I have always struggled with this kind of acne, but when I stopped birth control it became a much more serious problem. After trying the dermatologists suggestions and prescriptions for weeks, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to try Niapads. Within 2 days most of the cysts had come to a head and healed within another couple days. I use it morning and night on the affected area, and once a week on my entire face (it feels a bit more drying on the rest of my face where I don&#x27;t have acne, but I have oily skin so it it doesn&#x27;t over dry).&lt;br /&gt;It worked fast, reduced scaring, and did not sting, over dry, or make me itch.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great alternative to using antibiotics, and putting your body through other kinds of stress.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also worth noting that I used it on conduction with Zinc Cream For Problem Skin every other day.</li>
            <li> I have terrible acne, since forever, and while it&#x27;s changed as I&#x27;ve aged, it hasn&#x27;t really diminished. I&#x27;m just out of college, and the acne is now primarily on my chin/jawline, and sometimes around my nose. I like this product, and it doesn&#x27;t feel too drying, but it hasn&#x27;t been a miracle product for me. My skin adapts too quickly to any product, so that&#x27;s probably part of the issue.&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, this works at least as well as most of my other preferred face washes (by the way, if you have cystic acne, or any troublesome body acne, YOU MUST TRY CLEAROGEN. IT IS AMAZING for cystic acne and body acne, but it doesn&#x27;t do enough for the shallower pimples I mostly get now, so I use Clearogen but I&#x27;m still on the hunt to complete my perfect skin regimen). Anyway, since this does work pretty well, I buy this for when I travel, since most acne regimens will leak everywhere when you travel, and often bleach anything they touch. Niapads is perfect for travel. I do usually cut the squares smaller, and since they&#x27;ve raised the price above $15, and don&#x27;t really want to use this everyday anyway cause of the expense, but you can&#x27;t beat it for a travel face wash!</li>
            <li> Would have loved the product if it were not for the Lavender scent, the scent was too much for me and ultimately caused skin irritation, if they could remove the scent I would purchase again</li>
            <li> My 17-year-old son had had a pretty bad case of standard teenage acne vulgaris for a couple of years.  It wasn&#x27;t the sort of awful acne that you know will result in lifelong pockmarks, but he always had a fair number of angry looking pimples at any one time.  He&#x27;d gone through the standard over-the-counter medications, as well as some prescription lotions, ointments, and oral antibiotics.  Nothing seemed to do much good, and a friend of my wife suggested Accutane -- an expensive and very powerful oral retinoid with some horrendous potential side-effects (depression, liver damage, etc.).  Since payment for the Accutane (at $400/month + frequent visits to the dermatologist to monitor side effects) would have come out of my pocket, and since my son was very reluctant to take the product, I decided to do some research before jumping in.  In the course of that research I came across positive study info about the successful use of topical nicotinamide (also called niacinamide, and related to Vitamin B3 or niacin) in treating acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured this non-prescription treatment might be worth a shot before resorting to Accutane, but when I searched on Amazon, nearly all the niacinamide products were oral (about which I&#x27;d read nothing) and the few available niacinamide gels or ointments were being marketed as anti-aging, anti-wrinkle products, not acne treatments.  The sole exception was Niapads, which had lots of positive Amazon reviews, although a majority of these reviews seemed to deal with adult acne rather than the more standard teenage variety my son was suffering from.  So I placed an order, which was very promptly filled and delivered (this company has a very high level of customer service, with same-day or next-day shipping on every order I&#x27;ve placed thus far).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first my son didn&#x27;t really like the Niapads.  He didn&#x27;t care for the perfumed smell (he&#x27;s a 17-year-old boy) and he found they irritated his face.  Based on the Amazon reviews I&#x27;d read (several of which noted the same initial reactions), I urged him to keep using them for the full month, and he was willing to give it his best shot in order to avoid the Accutane. At the end of the month, he asked me to go ahead and order another pack -- the irritation had subsided, he&#x27;d gotten used to the smell, and though his acne was still there, it didn&#x27;t seem quite as \\&quot;angry\\&quot; as it had a month earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 6 months now and my son&#x27;s skin looks the best it has in years.  Yes, he will occasionally get a pimple, but he no longer has those outbreaks that are what I think of as acne.  His face looks clean and clear.  So all in all, I would recommend Niapads without any hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have tried the Niapads for about 1 month. I noticed a slight improvement, I have acne scars, milia,and  hyperpigmentation.  What can you use to stop or slow down the milia? I have it mainly on the upper chest and back.</li>
            <li> I am 27 years old and have been suffering with acne since I was 13. I have tried medicine after medicine product after product. Some would work for a little while and then my acne would come back. With Niapads, though, my acne goes away quickly! I get my pimples in the same spot most of the time so my use with the pads on that area keeps it clear. It isn&#x27;t a product that keeps acne away, sometimes I&#x27;ll get zits in the areas that I don&#x27;t focus on when using the pads but I can always get rid of them quickly! With the option of cutting off a small piece of pad and putting it on a zit to get rid of it more quickly, I have avoided embarrassing moments... repeatedly! I ran out of Niapads about a month ago and I didn&#x27;t get a chance to reorder till last week. I got a bunch of zits again but I know with certainty that my face will be clear for the outing in a week that my husband has planned for our 1 year anniversary! I STRONGLY recommend Niapads for those suffering from acne who are through with doctors and their darn prescriptions!</li>
            <li> I am a beauty product \\&quot;junkie\\&quot; and have a horrible online shopping addiction.  Ironically, I&#x27;ve never left a review for anything, anywhere.  Since this product has benefitted me sooo much, I feel compelled to do so.  I have spent hundreds upon hundreds on prescriptions, department store products, \\&quot;old wives\\&quot; remedies, and so on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NIAPADS is the only product that has prevented the \\&quot;once a month\\&quot; cystic blemish (or two) that I would dread.  If I do feel that small lump or \\&quot;twinge\\&quot; upon washing, I lather with the niapad and leave it on for 15 minutes or so, then rinse - and follow with my 2.5% hydrocortisone prescription cream.  The next day - NADA, nothing, what pimple???  Lately, I have not even had to do that - as the pimples really don&#x27;t seem to form...and my scarring is dissipating as well.  I hardly have to laser at the medical spa any more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Niapads!  I pray that this product remains available for sale FOREVER!!! In my experience, it seems that all the good stuff (beauty products, haircare, cosmetics) that I become dependent on seem to be taken off the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE DON&#x27;T LEAVE ME NIAPADS!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered these with the same high level of skepticism I usually have when trying a new product which claims to be effective in clearing up acne. I used them nearly exactly as directed on the package, however I decided to cut one pad in half and use one half in the morning and one half before bed. They are large and I didn&#x27;t figure I&#x27;d need a whole pad for my face each time. I was right, half a pad got the job done nicely. In the morning I wiped my congested skin with the wet pad, waited for it to dry on my skin and then rinsed it off. I proceeded with my make-up as normal. At night I cleansed my face, removing all make-up, then wiped my skin with the wet pad again. At night I decided not to rinse it off. When I started using these I had clogged and broken-out skin on the sides of my face along my jawline, and a few blemishes here and there on my forehead. After a month of twice-daily use my skin is mostly cleared up everywhere, with only a few blemishes left. Not only have I not have had such impressive results before, I&#x27;ve also not had results so quickly. Moreover, I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation or excessive dryness either. Truly, these things have made a tremendous difference in my skin with no negative side effects whatsoever. I am quite impressed and have already ordered another package. I doubt I&#x27;ll be without these, because they made my skin smooth and red bump-free. Thanks Niapads!!</li>
            <li> These are super expensive for what you get, I see a slight improvement in my complexion but not enough to spend $20 for this product again. It has not helped my cystic acne spots along my jawline, I do think those are hormonal so understand that I may not find anything topically to do that.</li>
            <li> I purchased Niapads for my teenage daughter after years of going to the Dermatologist and several different topical creams and lotions with very little luck.  Within a week, she saw results and within two weeks stubborn acne that she had around her chin cleared up completely.  I now purchase Niapads for my 14 year daughter too and it really keeps her skin clear most of the month.  Great product!!</li>
            <li> Did not notice any major improvement.  Did not cause any worse result though.</li>
            <li> These are a really good value. They helped keep my face clean and clear and under control..... wait well you get the point.</li>
            <li> I am yet another person who does not write reviews, but I need to share the good news and reassure my fellow acne prone folk. This product works! As soon as I turned 27, I became tormented with hormonal acne on my cheeks and chin...I&#x27;m talking the dirty, scarring kind. The pain, the embarrassment, the avoidance of face-to-face interaction needed to STOP after 6 months of this new persistent problem. I&#x27;m not into oral acne medication and Proactiv was not the miracle I had hoped and was promised. I did some research on the interwebs for other solutions to cystic acne and by happenstance (and luck) I came across this product. After a week of using two pads a day, my skin was looking and feeling like I had remembered pre-27 hormones. It&#x27;s been about 6 weeks of using this product and I have gotten my life back! I can again smile and look people in the eye with confidence because my face has cleared up so well. I am a NIA lifer...move over Proactiv, you are officially canceled!!</li>
