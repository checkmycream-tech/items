            <li>This conditioner is super awesome.</li>
            <li>I use it with the shampoo and it is an exceptional product.  </li>
            <li>Nexxus is a great brand - the best that I have found so far that is NOT hair salon price and quality.</li>

            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice</li>
            <li>However, I am not so this is a nice indulgence.</li>
            <li>Overall, I don&#x27;t know -- it&#x27;s worked perfectly well, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair gorgeously shiny or silky, and the smell is sort of chemical-floral and cloying.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products!  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is ok, it is satisfactory but I am not too thrilled about it either.</li>
            <li>love, love, love this conditioner!</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this conditioner and honestly it is pretty good but not the best conditioner that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>It is a great buy and much cheaper than the beauty supply store!</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Gets my hair smooth as silk baby!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I gave it a try.</li>

            <li>Love it, my favorite conditioner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of haircare products and I&#x27;m glad I found Nexxus.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>and I know its not Nexxus&#x27;s fault - I love their products, but this bottle came to me with smears of blood on it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo and I can no longer find it in the stores.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Was not purchased for me, but the girlfriend was pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product.  </li>
            <li>My favorite conditioner.</li>
            <li>Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li>That is what happens to all of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I switched to an organic conditioner and it worked much better than this garbage.</li>
            <li>, I look forward to continue using and getting more when this is finish.</li>
            <li>I would like to see more effect, conditioner that spreads more easily and is slightly more sleek.</li>
            <li>I let my hair air-dry and use a good quality hot iron on it and it looks just beautiful!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works pretty good.</li>
            <li>This is easily one of my favorite conditioners.  </li>
            <li>It is the best I&#x27;ve found for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this item to help with my dry and brittle hair, for me it works best after I wash my hair</li>
            <li>It rinses out clean and has a nice smell, not too strong.  </li>
            <li>I could style easily with just a blow dryer and my hair was straight, shiny, and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I love it and ordered it throught Amazon and it was quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling really soft and super smooth, and it also smells great.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair so smooth and silky...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the heavier side for my fine/thin hair but it leaves it feeling silky smooth.</li>
            <li>It is a good product for sure, the only thing would be the size of it.</li>
            <li>The original container is not that convenient to squeeze though.</li>
            <li>this conditioner is so good that i am certain it will be discontinued really soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for any hair type, human, natural, synthetic, kinky and / or curly.</li>
            <li>I like  Nexxus Hydra Sleek Silkening Smoothing Conditioner, it made my hair feel smooth quickly.  </li>
            <li>Great conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li>For the price I would have expected amazing results, but it is still pretty good.</li>
            <li>Love this product for days when I want to wear my hair straight with no curl.</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued as it&#x27;s my all time favorite conditioner, nothing else compares to it really</li>
            <li>But its not bad either.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild and it does what it should.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my hair feel!</li>
            <li>I got this for my beard, and while I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s soft as silk, I can say it&#x27;s better than it was before.</li>
            <li>Other than that it was a pretty good shampoo and conditioner set.</li>
            <li>this conditioner makes my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>VERY MUCH</li>
            <li>and if I were a little richer this would be my product for good.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft, light and manageable after one use.</li>
            <li>This was my first time with nexus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways this product is a staple in my house as I am an avid wearer of weaves &amp; wigs.</li>
            <li>It does smooth and nourish my fuzzy naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Too much fragrance!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries this conditioner (along with the shampoo) as they no longer carry it at my local shops.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t emphasize that enough - I love the scent.</li>
            <li>She wasn&#x27;t pleased enough to reorder, but did not feel ripped off at the price paid.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>I keep trying other Nexxus products, however this is still the best one for my fine thick straight hair.  </li>
            <li>It does take a little bit more to get all your hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>My hair is very long and  I&#x27;ve used other brands, but this one I always have and use it if I want my hair beautiful</li>
            <li>Nexus really makes it feels so silky.</li>
            <li>It did ship fast.</li>
            <li>it did ship fast though.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>The synthetic hair can become very unmanageable.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt; This conditioner makes it really shiny and after 12h my hair gets absolutely straight.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this conditioner  and the shampoo as well, I staighten my hair everyday and it makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other smoothing conditioners I like better, but this one is affordable and does the job of getting rid of frizz.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I do not wash my hair any more frequently than twice a week unless I&#x27;ve worked up a sweat.</li>
            <li>I looked like I&#x27;d grown new hair!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and very bouncy aafterwards</li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy and non-cooperative, so when my sister-in-law remarked how great my hair looked, I was confused for a second, but then remembered I had been using this conditioner!</li>
            <li>I like Nexxus product, it leaves hair very soft and manageable</li>
            <li>I have a totally natural and pretty straight hair and don&#x27;t blow dry</li>
            <li>It is clumsy in my shower, it has an AMAZING scent (I&#x27;ll give them an extra star for that!)</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>, it leave my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty harsh critic, I&#x27;ll admit, but this conditioner is not worth a penny more than a nickel.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down like a true conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the nexus new frizz fighting conditioner, but the results were not the same, or even close.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,</li>
            <li>I have dry hair - so if you have a different hair type maybe it&#x27;ll have a different effect, but this is definitely a product not even deserving to be on the &#x27;Other People Who&#x27;ve Looked At This Item</li>
            <li>I have really dry hair and was looking for something to really moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li>And the humidity doesnt seem to mess with my hair as much either.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I keep trying other Nexxus products, however this is still the best one for my fine thick straight hair.  </li>
            <li> It does take a little bit more to get all your hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and  I&#x27;ve used other brands, but this one I always have and use it if I want my hair beautiful</li>
            <li> Nexus really makes it feels so silky.</li>
            <li> It did ship fast.</li>
            <li> it did ship fast though.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> The synthetic hair can become very unmanageable.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt; This conditioner makes it really shiny and after 12h my hair gets absolutely straight.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner  and the shampoo as well, I staighten my hair everyday and it makes my hair so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other smoothing conditioners I like better, but this one is affordable and does the job of getting rid of frizz.  </li>
            <li> Normally, I do not wash my hair any more frequently than twice a week unless I&#x27;ve worked up a sweat.</li>
            <li> I looked like I&#x27;d grown new hair!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product...</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and very bouncy aafterwards</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy and non-cooperative, so when my sister-in-law remarked how great my hair looked, I was confused for a second, but then remembered I had been using this conditioner!</li>
            <li> I like Nexxus product, it leaves hair very soft and manageable</li>
            <li> I have a totally natural and pretty straight hair and don&#x27;t blow dry</li>
            <li> It is clumsy in my shower, it has an AMAZING scent (I&#x27;ll give them an extra star for that!)</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> , it leave my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty harsh critic, I&#x27;ll admit, but this conditioner is not worth a penny more than a nickel.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down like a true conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the nexus new frizz fighting conditioner, but the results were not the same, or even close.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately,</li>
            <li> I have dry hair - so if you have a different hair type maybe it&#x27;ll have a different effect, but this is definitely a product not even deserving to be on the &#x27;Other People Who&#x27;ve Looked At This Item</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair and was looking for something to really moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> And the humidity doesnt seem to mess with my hair as much either.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair that&#x27;s started to become a little wavy, less manageable, and more prone to breakage over the past few years.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair smoothe and soft and keeps down the frizz.  </li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m a little sensitive about the smells.</li>
            <li> I will continue buying it as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, mostly straight hair</li>
            <li> It has a very thick, oily texture, and if your back is sensitive to getting acne, you may need to be extra careful at getting every last bit off your skin.</li>
            <li> Helps with tangled hair, helps dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner after I towel dry my hair</li>
            <li> And then I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricey, but it does the job, and a small amount of product is only needed to due to make my curly and thick hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have long hair, I spent a lot of time and money to find a combination of shampoo and conditioners left their hair less tangly.  </li>
            <li> For reference, my hair is long (approximately mid-way down my back), straight and untreated.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a basic all-purpose conditioner for my long, thick, dyed hair, and the Nexxus has lasted for a long, long time (I want to say over 6 months!).</li>
            <li> AS ADVERTISED, AND WHAT I EXPECTED.</li>
            <li> there is no stiffness in it at all (be careful with the amount of conditioner used)</li>
            <li> I apply a generous amount after shampooing and use a wide tooth comb to comb through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> This product helps to tame those frizzies and releases those tangles instantly.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and this product works miracles as a leave-in conditioner, even though it is a wash out one.</li>
            <li> I only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> Also... if I need it quicker and can&#x27;t order it I can usually go to wal greens or any other local drugstore and find Nexxus products.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get this product at Ulta and was disappointed when they stopped carrying it.</li>
            <li> I tried other products and nothing came close.</li>
            <li> Not sure I am savvy enough to understand the difference.</li>
            <li> It is sharp for me.</li>
            <li> I use this with my Paul Mitchell shampoo or any of my other shampoos.</li>
            <li> This conditioner left my hair a little heavy without moisturizing it.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, dry, color-treated hair that tends to tangle.</li>
            <li> The bottle shape makes it hard to let the bottle stand upside down when the content level is low...</li>
            <li> and that was a let down.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair with color and have some chemical damage, since I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus I have noticed less damage and healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry hair.</li>
            <li> It did not clean it at all and my hair was an oily mess a few hours after using it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner lasted me a little longer than three weeks.</li>
            <li> It frizzes and tangles and is a mess 3-5 days of everyday wear (and I remove mine nightly).</li>
            <li> Only conditioner that works for my very thick, frizzy/wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This did not help my dried out hair a bit.  </li>
            <li> Helps tame your frizzy side with smoothe results</li>
            <li> It is less manageable with this shampoo compared to less expensive</li>
            <li> Bottle is too hard and you need to shake it hard and squeeze.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m in my late 30s.)</li>
            <li> Before it is too late.</li>
            <li> I use this thick conditioner with Nexxus Frizz Defy Shampoo</li>
            <li> My scalp appreciates less scent : (</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t do too bad with that.</li>
            <li> I really hated what this stuff did to my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so drying it is pathetic.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I was actually looking for Nexxus, &amp;#34;Frizz Defy, &amp;#34; but there was none!!!!</li>
            <li> This is easily one of my favorite conditioners.  It leaves my hair feeling really soft and super smooth, and it also smells great.  For reference, my hair is long (approximately mid-way down my back), straight and untreated.  This conditioner lasted me a little longer than three weeks.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and this product works miracles as a leave-in conditioner, even though it is a wash out one. I love the way it smells as well, absolutely delicious, people always compliment my hair&#x27;s scent.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. I would definitely recommend it to buy. this conditioner makes my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry hair. I&#x27;ve tried all types of conditioners, but none of them work as well as this product. I only have to use a small amount. It makes my hair so soft. A very good product!</li>
            <li> Gets my hair smooth as silk baby!</li>
            <li> This did not help my dried out hair a bit.  If you having the same issue, suggest coconut oil, shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other smoothing conditioners I like better, but this one is affordable and does the job of getting rid of frizz.  Nice product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is super awesome. My hair is so soft, light and manageable after one use. I cannot remember my hair ever feeling this wonderful! I researched a lot of products and landed on this conditioner and the entire Nexxus line. I am so glad I gave it a try. The price is more than work it. The results are magnificent. I&#x27;ve received a lot of comments about my hair at work already! I&#x27;m setting this product up on the regular delivery system since I plan to use this going forward.</li>
            <li> I Love this conditioner.  It is the best I&#x27;ve found for my dry hair.  Nexus really makes it feels so silky.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair conditioner... else where i would pay $16.00 and i found it here for $7.00...  I highly recommend this product...especially when you have hair that reaches to your butt....  you want to make your you dont get tangles...</li>
            <li> I was looking for a basic all-purpose conditioner for my long, thick, dyed hair, and the Nexxus has lasted for a long, long time (I want to say over 6 months!). It has a very thick, oily texture, and if your back is sensitive to getting acne, you may need to be extra careful at getting every last bit off your skin. Overall, I don&#x27;t know -- it&#x27;s worked perfectly well, but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair gorgeously shiny or silky, and the smell is sort of chemical-floral and cloying. I think when this bottle is done I&#x27;ll shop around for a different brand.</li>
            <li> This was my first time with nexus. The one thing I did not like is that it has that alcohol in it. Other than that it was a pretty good shampoo and conditioner set. It did ship fast. I have really dry hair and was looking for something to really moisturize my hair. This product didn&#x27;t do too bad with that. Like I said though it has that alcohol ingredient in it and that was a let down. it did ship fast though.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this conditioner! it makes my hair so smooth and silky... The best conditioner I&#x27;ve used at this price. You can&#x27;t beat it. Also... if I need it quicker and can&#x27;t order it I can usually go to wal greens or any other local drugstore and find Nexxus products. I have relaxed hair with color and have some chemical damage, since I&#x27;ve been using Nexxus I have noticed less damage and healthier hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product for days when I want to wear my hair straight with no curl. Also gives a very nice softness to the hair. Was shipped speedily and will gladly do my future shopping for this product here.</li>
            <li> THIS IS WHAT I ORDERED AND LOVE IT. IT WAS AS ADVERTISED, AND WHAT I EXPECTED. THANKS YOU VERY MUCH</li>
            <li> It is a good product for sure, the only thing would be the size of it. Perfect for taking it with to the gym or traveling. Otherwise get the bigger size in costco or somewhere else for home use. It does take a little bit more to get all your hair feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> loooooooovvvvvvve it love it love it  will defenitley buy again if possible  I also buy the shampoo to go with it</li>
            <li> My wife and daughter have long hair, I spent a lot of time and money to find a combination of shampoo and conditioners left their hair less tangly.  After a couple months of side by side testing this one came out the undisputed winner.  In use you don&#x27;t need a lot to cover all your hair so the bottle lasts longer than you would expect.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner for me and I use it on my Maltese dog also !  It rinses out clean and has a nice smell, not too strong.  Great product !</li>
            <li> I use this to maintain my synthetic lace front wigs and it works awesomely. The synthetic hair can become very unmanageable. It frizzes and tangles and is a mess 3-5 days of everyday wear (and I remove mine nightly). This product helps to tame those frizzies and releases those tangles instantly. The hair is not only renewed, it&#x27;s refreshed. The hair is soft and very bouncy aafterwards there is no stiffness in it at all (be careful with the amount of conditioner used) and the scent is amazing. Everyone in the office loves the way \\&quot;my hair\\&quot; smells (like a mixture of bananas &amp; coconut).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways this product is a staple in my house as I am an avid wearer of weaves &amp; wigs. It&#x27;s perfect for any hair type, human, natural, synthetic, kinky and / or curly. This is a must have so definitely get it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair that&#x27;s started to become a little wavy, less manageable, and more prone to breakage over the past few years. (I&#x27;m in my late 30s.) I used this conditioner along with an occational dose of Nexxus Pro Mend Overnight Treatment Crème. I looked like I&#x27;d grown new hair! I could style easily with just a blow dryer and my hair was straight, shiny, and very healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Only conditioner that works for my very thick, frizzy/wavy hair. I&#x27;ve tried the nexus new frizz fighting conditioner, but the results were not the same, or even close.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, The price for this product, has recently more than doubled on amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so drying it is pathetic.  They should discontinue it on this site also!</li>
            <li> Nexus has a great product here!  It does smooth and nourish my fuzzy naturally curly hair.  I use it with the shampoo and it is an exceptional product.  Using it without the Nexus shampoo is just as good too!  You will love it.</li>
            <li> I really hated what this stuff did to my hair. It did not clean it at all and my hair was an oily mess a few hours after using it. After more attempts and fails I just threw it away.</li>
            <li> Too much fragrance! My scalp appreciates less scent : (</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s hair is different.  I have thick, long, dry, color-treated hair that tends to tangle. Normally, I do not wash my hair any more frequently than twice a week unless I&#x27;ve worked up a sweat. This is by far the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products!  I apply a generous amount after shampooing and use a wide tooth comb to comb through my wet hair.  I let it sit in my hair for about 5 minutes and then rinse it out.  The appearance and texture of the hair is superior after using this product. No need to use anything else, like leave in conditioners, gels, mousse, etc.  I let my hair air-dry and use a good quality hot iron on it and it looks just beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;This is just a great product.  Try it and convince yourself!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries this conditioner (along with the shampoo) as they no longer carry it at my local shops. I hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued as it&#x27;s my all time favorite conditioner, nothing else compares to it really, it leave my hair silky soft. Plus for the price on here it&#x27;s an amazing deal.</li>
            <li> Love it, my favorite conditioner</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to help with my dry and brittle hair, for me it works best after I wash my hair I use it as a leave in conditioner. Helps with tangled hair, helps dry brittle hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, long, mostly straight hair so perhaps this is not the type of hair this product was meant for. This conditioner left my hair a little heavy without moisturizing it. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this conditioner and honestly it is pretty good but not the best conditioner that I have ever used. For the price I would have expected amazing results, but it is still pretty good.</li>
            <li> The scent is mild and it does what it should. I&#x27;ve tried so many brands of haircare products and I&#x27;m glad I found Nexxus. I use this thick conditioner with Nexxus Frizz Defy Shampoo and I&#x27;m satisfied with the results. The original container is not that convenient to squeeze though. I&#x27;ll get a shampoo and conditioner dispenser to solve that.</li>
            <li> I have a totally natural and pretty straight hair and don&#x27;t blow dry it.&lt;br /&gt; This conditioner makes it really shiny and after 12h my hair gets absolutely straight. My hair is very long and  I&#x27;ve used other brands, but this one I always have and use it if I want my hair beautiful next morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really love the smell and the shine&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> This smells SO GOOD. I can&#x27;t emphasize that enough - I love the scent. Makes my hair literally feel like silk, but only a mask. Has to be used weekly.</li>
            <li> So gross and I know its not Nexxus&#x27;s fault - I love their products, but this bottle came to me with smears of blood on it. I tried to get in touch with Amazon to return it or get a refund, but the item is ineligible for returns so I got stuck with it. I had to trash it.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair feel! It is definately the best hair conditioner ive tried! and ive tried alot</li>
            <li> Great Product and great price! I would recommend this for anyone. It is a great buy and much cheaper than the beauty supply store!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 4 years! I love it! Helps tame your frizzy side with smoothe results</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy and non-cooperative, so when my sister-in-law remarked how great my hair looked, I was confused for a second, but then remembered I had been using this conditioner! So I am giving credit to Nexxus, since nothing else had changed about my hair routine. Thank you, Nexxus!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and I can no longer find it in the stores.  I have been using it for over 10 years.  I keep trying other Nexxus products, however this is still the best one for my fine thick straight hair.  I will continue buying it as long as I can find it.</li>
            <li> I used to be able to get this product at Ulta and was disappointed when they stopped carrying it. I tried other products and nothing came close. I was so happy to find it on Amazon I ordered three bottles. I like this product because I can use it every day and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair feel weighted down like a true conditioner. I have blonde hair and get my hair hightlighted every 6-7 weeks. I used a deep conditioner once a week and this daily. It protects my color and I have never turned brassy or lost my color from being in the sun (I do put sunscreen in my hair if I am intentionally out gettign sun).</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner. It&#x27;s a bit on the heavier side for my fine/thin hair but it leaves it feeling silky smooth. It has a great smell as well.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is ok, it is satisfactory but I am not too thrilled about it either. The bottle shape makes it hard to let the bottle stand upside down when the content level is low...</li>
            <li> My hair is not smoother. It is less manageable with this shampoo compared to less expensive brand.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy or recommend this product based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner after I towel dry my hair and I leave it on my hair. And then I blow dry my hair. It works well with my hair type.</li>
            <li> This conditioner makes my hair feel and smell great. It is a little pricey, but it does the job, and a small amount of product is only needed to due to make my curly and thick hair feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Not sure I am savvy enough to understand the difference. I would like to see more effect, conditioner that spreads more easily and is slightly more sleek. Bottle is too hard and you need to shake it hard and squeeze.</li>
            <li> Stores, or salons, are not carryng this product on their shelves and it&#x27;s great.  It makes your hair smoothe and soft and keeps down the frizz.  I love it and ordered it throught Amazon and it was quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teen girl who likes to dye her hair and dries her hair out. It smells really nice and if I were a little richer this would be my product for good. However, I am not so this is a nice indulgence.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good. I gave 4 star because I don&#x27;t like the smell of it. It is sharp for me. But I&#x27;m a little sensitive about the smells.</li>
            <li> I like  Nexxus Hydra Sleek Silkening Smoothing Conditioner, it made my hair feel smooth quickly.  I also like the Matrix Sleek conditioner, both do a great job at conditioning your hair.  If you need to save money, the Tresemme Moisture Conditioner also works well.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and without issue. Was not purchased for me, but the girlfriend was pleased with the product. She wasn&#x27;t pleased enough to reorder, but did not feel ripped off at the price paid.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product.  I have never been a great fan of Nexxus but for some reasonkeep giving the brand a try.  Reivews were good so what the heck. Didn&#x27;t impress so I won&#x27;t be buying it again.  But its not bad either.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this conditioner  and the shampoo as well, I staighten my hair everyday and it makes my hair so smooth and soft. And the humidity doesnt seem to mess with my hair as much either.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner. I use this with my Paul Mitchell shampoo or any of my other shampoos. It makes my hair soft. Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> This is a very good conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy at all.  Have used this product for years and love it.</li>
            <li> I prefer the volumizing one and will look for that one instead. This one is great for my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> this conditioner is so good that i am certain it will be discontinued really soon. That is what happens to all of my favorite products. It is so good i even use it for my dog. Buy this. Before it is too late.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty harsh critic, I&#x27;ll admit, but this conditioner is not worth a penny more than a nickel. It is clumsy in my shower, it has an AMAZING scent (I&#x27;ll give them an extra star for that!) but it&#x27;s conditioner, not air spray. I switched to an organic conditioner and it worked much better than this garbage. I have dry hair - so if you have a different hair type maybe it&#x27;ll have a different effect, but this is definitely a product not even deserving to be on the &#x27;Other People Who&#x27;ve Looked At This Item Also Bought...\\&quot; list.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner for dry hair. Nexxus is a great brand - the best that I have found so far that is NOT hair salon price and quality.</li>
            <li> I got this for my beard, and while I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s soft as silk, I can say it&#x27;s better than it was before. It also does a good job for my hair as well, but I don&#x27;t use it unless I have grown out my hair to medium lengths. It makes the hair softer and easier to comb.</li>
            <li> I like Nexxus product, it leaves hair very soft and manageable, I look forward to continue using and getting more when this is finish.</li>
