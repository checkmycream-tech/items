            <li>So, I was very excited about receiving this in the mail.  </li>

            <li>Saw this same item at Charming Charlie for $13.99.  </li>
            <li>Also, to my surprise, it was heavier than it looked in the picture, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li>head band is too large so it doesn&amp;#34;t fit securely</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t squeeze head and super shiny and sparkly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li>This is very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>

            <li>This arrived fast and it&#x27;s pretty cute for the price.  </li>
            <li>Really like this headband!!</li>
            <li>Worth the purchase for the price and had a mother comment on it and wondered where she could get one for her daughter.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more for a child rather than an adult, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>came in super fast!</li>
            <li>Still pretty though.</li>
            <li>So pretty.</li>
            <li>N looks exactly as the picture...</li>
            <li>Broke on first use.  </li>
            <li>snapped the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>This headband was so pretty in the photos, my daughter had to have it.</li>
            <li>It broke the first time she put it on...</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Pretty girlie.  </li>
            <li>This is a great accessory for both long and short hair.</li>
            <li>This is so pretty in person.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely seen better.</li>
            <li>The headband broke the first time my daughter put it on.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Good for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li>Loved it but broke after a few used</li>
            <li>Loved this headband got tons of good feedback the first second and only times I wore it before the big center stones fell out</li>
            <li>just isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a smart purchase if you want to add some flare to your outfit.</li>
            <li>I bought this item because some of the reviews said it was loose fitting</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve also seen very high quality headbands made by Deepa Gurnani at Saks Fifth ave for $120.  </li>
            <li>They fit nicely and stay in place without punching into her head and work very well with very thick hair which she has..</li>
            <li>This item broke within 2 days of gentle wear.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and i received it on time.</li>
            <li>Stays very well.  </li>
            <li>and very well made.</li>
            <li>Very sastified.</li>
            <li>However, it is much prettier in real life.</li>
            <li>Looks very youthful.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well designed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li>I really like this headband .</li>
            <li>It will really dress up my hairstyles.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely buy from this seller again</li>
            <li>and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li>It is very well made and has held up well with use.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>The elastic string is also thick, so it does a good job of holding itself in place.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY pretty, high quality, and soft material on the inside.</li>
            <li>a Little small but looks awesome !</li>
            <li>Ahhmazing, this headband sparkles so much in the dark restaurant where i work, i received so many compliments from the clients they were all asking me where&#x27;d I bought it, i just can&#x27;t believe how one little hair accesory makes me look so elegant.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more in future from this seller it shipped a lot quicker then the estimated ship time of 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>I actually think I may start wearing this headband regularly :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this product, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased two from that seller and it is high quality.</li>
            <li>It has felt under decorative part for a nonslip effect instead of velvet and the jewels were not as high of quality</li>
            <li>High quality-</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this band.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was adorable and would have worn myself if the little punk didn&#x27;t want it herself.</li>
            <li>and I would say I have a normal sized head I guess.  </li>
            <li>look exactly the same as in picture.</li>
            <li>Glad I waited to purchase the same item for much less.  </li>
            <li>Looks more black and white than silver.</li>
            <li>pay a little extra to get much better quality at Regalia Beaded Rhinestone Elastic Stretch</li>
            <li>I hardly noticed I had it on except for the many compliments I received on it.</li>
            <li>I received my headband fast and was so much prettier than i expected</li>
            <li>but it was too loud</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s held up well so far for the price.</li>
            <li>Got this for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li>It really was a simple fix.  </li>
            <li>My 19 year old daughter loves this.</li>
            <li>:/ Not a useful review for the headband so much as a testament for how much I liked it.</li>
            <li>I bought this because it had good reviews; unfortunately it broke on me within 4 hours.</li>
            <li>The horrible experience I had with the shipping process was a real pain, but when I finally got it, I was really impressed with how pretty the product is.</li>
            <li>It was originally bought for a 60&#x27;s themed costume, however she&#x27;s worn it with some other regular outfits.</li>
            <li>so I was a little worried about the bands not being strong enough, but they are!</li>
            <li>High quality and definitely work</li>
            <li>Not super tight fitting and plastic beads.  </li>
            <li>Pretty but not worth it if you can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too big for my 10 year old daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li>, I wanted a silver looking piece not black and white.</li>
            <li>My wife has thick, short, curly hair and it stays put just fine.</li>
            <li>Idk if this 1 can handle everyday wear for more than a few months maybe...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been looking for a pretty black headband for a while (ever since my last one broke).</li>
            <li>Only thing is it was a little tight because I guess she has a big head :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend other&#x27;s purchase this headband.</li>

            <li> loved it looks so great in my hair and really sparkles use it on my forehead instead of as a headband</li>
            <li> Good quality, looks fantastic, and although it was purchased for a costume party, I&#x27;ve been trying to find reasons to wear it elsewhere</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 4-year old daughter and it was great!</li>
            <li> this catches easily!</li>
            <li> Love love love!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a 1920&#x27;s party and I&#x27;m going to put it on top of a sequence feather piece.</li>
            <li> So, I was very excited about receiving this in the mail.  </li>
            <li> headband given as a gift to a 12 year old girl who LOVED IT!  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable and super cute!</li>

            <li> Lovely and surprisingly comfortable.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price!</li>
            <li> very cute, what i expected pretty much, love it, hope it lasts thru many  wears and doesn&#x27;t fall apart, looks great but seems like it might be cheaply made,</li>
            <li> Beautiful, especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> but in this case it worked out fine.</li>
            <li> Love the headband , the color very pretty .</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable.</li>
            <li> Cheap product.</li>

            <li> right!?</li>
            <li> piece, good price and free shipping...not a bad deal for this attractive headband!</li>
            <li> Saw this same item at Charming Charlie for $13.99.  </li>
            <li> Also, to my surprise, it was heavier than it looked in the picture, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing.</li>
            <li> head band is too large so it doesn&amp;#34;t fit securely</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t squeeze head and super shiny and sparkly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pretty.</li>
            <li> This is very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  </li>
            <li> Looks pretty cheap in person, I bought it to wear to a wedding</li>

            <li> Really like this headband!!</li>
            <li> Worth the purchase for the price and had a mother comment on it and wondered where she could get one for her daughter.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s more for a child rather than an adult, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> came in super fast!</li>
            <li> Still pretty though.</li>
            <li> So pretty.</li>
            <li> N looks exactly as the picture...</li>
            <li> Broke on first use.  </li>
            <li> snapped the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> This headband was so pretty in the photos, my daughter had to have it.</li>
            <li> It broke the first time she put it on...</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Pretty girlie.  </li>
            <li> This is a great accessory for both long and short hair.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty in person.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve definitely seen better.</li>
            <li> The headband broke the first time my daughter put it on.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Good for everyday wear.  </li>
            <li> Loved it but broke after a few used</li>
            <li> Loved this headband got tons of good feedback the first second and only times I wore it before the big center stones fell out</li>
            <li> just isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a smart purchase if you want to add some flare to your outfit.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because some of the reviews said it was loose fitting</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also seen very high quality headbands made by Deepa Gurnani at Saks Fifth ave for $120.  </li>
            <li> They fit nicely and stay in place without punching into her head and work very well with very thick hair which she has..</li>
            <li> This item broke within 2 days of gentle wear.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and i received it on time.</li>
            <li> Stays very well.  </li>
            <li> and very well made.</li>
            <li> Very sastified.</li>
            <li> However, it is much prettier in real life.</li>
            <li> Looks very youthful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well designed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li> I really like this headband .</li>
            <li> It will really dress up my hairstyles.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> and she absolutely loves it.  </li>
            <li> It is very well made and has held up well with use.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The elastic string is also thick, so it does a good job of holding itself in place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY pretty, high quality, and soft material on the inside.</li>
            <li> a Little small but looks awesome !</li>
            <li> Ahhmazing, this headband sparkles so much in the dark restaurant where i work, i received so many compliments from the clients they were all asking me where&#x27;d I bought it, i just can&#x27;t believe how one little hair accesory makes me look so elegant.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more in future from this seller it shipped a lot quicker then the estimated ship time of 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I actually think I may start wearing this headband regularly :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this product, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two from that seller and it is high quality.</li>
            <li> It has felt under decorative part for a nonslip effect instead of velvet and the jewels were not as high of quality</li>
            <li> High quality-</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this band.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was adorable and would have worn myself if the little punk didn&#x27;t want it herself.</li>
            <li> and I would say I have a normal sized head I guess.  </li>
            <li> look exactly the same as in picture.</li>
            <li> Glad I waited to purchase the same item for much less.  </li>
            <li> Looks more black and white than silver.</li>
            <li> pay a little extra to get much better quality at Regalia Beaded Rhinestone Elastic Stretch</li>
            <li> I hardly noticed I had it on except for the many compliments I received on it.</li>
            <li> I received my headband fast and was so much prettier than i expected</li>
            <li> but it was too loud</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up well so far for the price.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it.</li>
            <li> It really was a simple fix.  </li>
            <li> My 19 year old daughter loves this.</li>
            <li> :/ Not a useful review for the headband so much as a testament for how much I liked it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had good reviews; unfortunately it broke on me within 4 hours.</li>
            <li> The horrible experience I had with the shipping process was a real pain, but when I finally got it, I was really impressed with how pretty the product is.</li>
            <li> It was originally bought for a 60&#x27;s themed costume, however she&#x27;s worn it with some other regular outfits.</li>
            <li> so I was a little worried about the bands not being strong enough, but they are!</li>
            <li> High quality and definitely work</li>
            <li> Not super tight fitting and plastic beads.  </li>
            <li> Pretty but not worth it if you can&#x27;t wear it.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t too big for my 10 year old daughter&#x27;s head.</li>
            <li> , I wanted a silver looking piece not black and white.</li>
            <li> My wife has thick, short, curly hair and it stays put just fine.</li>
            <li> Idk if this 1 can handle everyday wear for more than a few months maybe...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a pretty black headband for a while (ever since my last one broke).</li>
            <li> Only thing is it was a little tight because I guess she has a big head :)</li>
            <li> I highly recommend other&#x27;s purchase this headband.</li>
            <li> I wear it for formal or casual situations and always get so many compliments on it.  </li>
            <li> It stacks up to the very expensive big name kind for every day wear.</li>
            <li> Shipping was extremely slow and it started to come apart the first day I wore it.</li>
            <li> The elastic also has not gotten stretched out.  </li>
            <li> It looks way more expensive than it was!</li>
            <li> It looks so expensive my friends were surprised to know how much I got it for.</li>
            <li> It looks terrific against my long dark brown hair or across my forehead!  </li>
            <li> However, just be really careful near ANY fabric because it snags sooo easily :(.</li>
            <li> The band was too loose!</li>
            <li> As expected and does not cause discomfort as some headbands.</li>
            <li> It functioned much the same as the other expensive brand.</li>
            <li> Dress up or down headband.  </li>
            <li> Upon my warning that he was going to break it and we&#x27;d just received it, i demanded he put it down, he attempted to remove it and broke it.</li>
            <li> Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is bc the beading does look a little delicate.</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Pink Pewter headbands in the past and was looking for a cheaper alternative.</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed because this headband arrived damaged with one of the elastic bands detached.  </li>
            <li> im hoping for, bc I wore my other 1 everyday for like past 6mos.</li>
            <li> i would buy it in gold and green.</li>
            <li> I added a few feathers and some knockout makeup</li>
            <li> Heavy material</li>
            <li> , I found a less expensive one days later.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this item 3 stars because unfortunately it broke the second time I wore it..</li>
            <li> &amp; way to small.</li>
            <li> However, the beadwork on the item I received was not impressive, and the coloring of the oval stones is quite yellow.  </li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> Unable to wear anymore.</li>
            <li> It matches with almost all of the clothing item I wear, casual or semi-formal.</li>
            <li> It can be dressy or casual.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this piece!</li>
            <li> Sticking with the 20 flapper theme trending--you cannot go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> I bought two and am obsessed!</li>
            <li> Very poorly made!</li>
            <li> The beads also always got snarled in my hair and was painful to pull it out.</li>
            <li> I hate paying  10-15 dollars for headbands like this in the mall or at Walmart.  </li>

            <li> This is very pretty. It looks just like the photo shows. It wasn&#x27;t too big for my 10 year old daughter&#x27;s head. Buying on the internet, you just never know but in this case it worked out fine. The elastic string is also thick, so it does a good job of holding itself in place. It was originally bought for a 60&#x27;s themed costume, however she&#x27;s worn it with some other regular outfits. I looked in the stores and couldn&#x27;t find anything cheaper that was just as nice. It&#x27;s a smart purchase if you want to add some flare to your outfit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this headband based on the photos on Amazon. However, it is much prettier in real life. The horrible experience I had with the shipping process was a real pain, but when I finally got it, I was really impressed with how pretty the product is.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get here and when it did it was s***ty workmanship and has fallen apart twice already</li>
            <li> Really like this headband!! Will order again. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is bc the beading does look a little delicate. It may not be as sturdy as im hoping for, bc I wore my other 1 everyday for like past 6mos. &amp; it finally is giving out. Idk if this 1 can handle everyday wear for more than a few months maybe... but for the price that&#x27;s still an awesome deal &amp; it&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  Pay attention to shipping times.</li>
            <li> Only three wears and the band broke seems the glue used just isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> I really loved this cute headband!  It fit  comfortable and did not pull on my hair.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Good quality, looks fantastic, and although it was purchased for a costume party, I&#x27;ve been trying to find reasons to wear it elsewhere</li>
            <li> loved it looks so great in my hair and really sparkles use it on my forehead instead of as a headband this a good buy</li>
            <li> I love it. head band matches alot of outfits. look exactly the same as in picture. came in super fast!</li>
            <li> This headband is gorgeous. I didn&#x27;t have high hopes considering the price, but I ended up loving it. I wore it multiple times on our beach vacation and I plan to wear it constantly this summer. The fit is nice and tight and the beading is very nice quality. I highly recommend other&#x27;s purchase this headband.</li>
            <li> Love this headband! It even cuter in person than in the picture. I feel like the price is wonderful I hate paying  10-15 dollars for headbands like this in the mall or at Walmart.  Will definitely buy more in future from this seller it shipped a lot quicker then the estimated ship time of 2 weeks! I received it in 1 week!</li>
            <li> Broke on first use.  Elastic is glued into beaded/jeweled part and it broke/snapped the first time I used it.  I would not recommend! It is cheap!</li>
            <li> The product was what I envisioned and my grand daughter loves them!!!  They fit nicely and stay in place without punching into her head and work very well with very thick hair which she has..they also look beautiful on her.</li>
            <li> This headband was so pretty in the photos, my daughter had to have it. It took almost a month to arrive from overseas. It broke the first time she put it on...beads coming off everywhere. Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very cute and really sparkles like rhinestone! I like wearing it any day. It matches with almost all of the clothing item I wear, casual or semi-formal. It looks so expensive my friends were surprised to know how much I got it for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just beautiful:)</li>
            <li> Ahhmazing, this headband sparkles so much in the dark restaurant where i work, i received so many compliments from the clients they were all asking me where&#x27;d I bought it, i just can&#x27;t believe how one little hair accesory makes me look so elegant. i would buy it in gold and green.</li>
            <li> Delivered earlier than promised. Product was exactly as described. Very pretty and comfortable to wear. It was a perfect accessory for a 1920&#x27;s themed party, but I can see future use as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for a 1920&#x27;s dinner and am in love with it! I actually think I may start wearing this headband regularly :)</li>
            <li> Dress up or down headband.  Pretty girlie.  Doesn&#x27;t look cheap.  Comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very cute, love it and bought another. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This headband is beautiful and very comfortable to wear. I hardly noticed I had it on except for the many compliments I received on it. It looks and feels like a quality item. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time. The price was great and it is much prettier than the ones offered in the stores for more. I feel like I got a good deal and that&#x27;s what counts, right!?</li>
            <li> very cute, what i expected pretty much, love it, hope it lasts thru many  wears and doesn&#x27;t fall apart, looks great but seems like it might be cheaply made, great price</li>
            <li> This arrived fast and it&#x27;s pretty cute for the price.  Not super tight fitting and plastic beads.  Good for everyday wear.  Looks very youthful.  Good seller and was in perfect condition once received.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this product, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I&#x27;d been looking for a pretty black headband for a while (ever since my last one broke). I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments on it. I have a lot of hair so I was a little worried about the bands not being strong enough, but they are! It&#x27;s very well designed. I&#x27;d like to see some additional styles!</li>
            <li> Great headband! Great quality, very pretty and especially awesome when worn as a forehead headband.</li>
            <li> This is a great accessory for both long and short hair. Love it.</li>
            <li> nice headband. would recommend</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my 4-year old daughter and it was great! But my son decided to run around with it on his head and then shoot it off of a paper towel holder. Upon my warning that he was going to break it and we&#x27;d just received it, i demanded he put it down, he attempted to remove it and broke it. So my daughter only tried it on...but I cut it up and used it to make bows on Christmas presents. :/ Not a useful review for the headband so much as a testament for how much I liked it. We&#x27;ll be ordering another one.</li>
            <li> Sticking with the 20 flapper theme trending--you cannot go wrong with this! I love everything about this headband. You cannot tell it is hand made!</li>
            <li> I love this headband and got a ton of compliments on it all night. Would definitely recommend to spruce up an outfit!</li>
            <li> Saw this same item at Charming Charlie for $13.99.  Glad I waited to purchase the same item for much less.  Since this is a boutique style headband the price and quality are a great deal comparatively!  Highly recommend.  Oh and it fits great!</li>
            <li> Just a trinket I bought for my teenage granddaughter but suffice it to say the last 3x I&#x27;ve seen her she had it on. It&#x27;s a Go 😀</li>
            <li> This headband is stunning! Pictures do not do it justice! Price is very reasonable too!!! So pleased!!! Love it so much!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!  get so many compliments on it</li>
            <li> Loved it but broke after a few used</li>
            <li> Very good looking head band.  Wore it once and the bands broke</li>
            <li> As expected and does not cause discomfort as some headbands.</li>
            <li> Looks more black and white than silver. Looks pretty cheap in person, I bought it to wear to a wedding but it was too loud, I wanted a silver looking piece not black and white.</li>
            <li> I love this headband! I wear it for formal or casual situations and always get so many compliments on it.  Very elegant looking!</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this all the time.  It&#x27;s held up well so far for the price.</li>
            <li> Got this for my 10 year old daughter and she loves it. It stays in place and she says that it is very comfortable. The quality is good and nothing is falling off, seems to be pretty secure.</li>
            <li> It was perfect for my little sister - she wore it for my 1920s themed birthday party. Only thing is it was a little tight because I guess she has a big head :) But, we recommend it. It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Loved this headband got tons of good feedback the first second and only times I wore it before the big center stones fell out</li>
            <li> Love this headband! I have received so many compliments on it. It is comfortable and super cute! I highly recommend  it!</li>
            <li> I wore this to a flapper party and got nothing but compliments on it. tI went perfectly with my outfit.  Awesome</li>
            <li> Loved this was exactly ad I expected and more</li>
            <li> So, I was very excited about receiving this in the mail.  I ordered this after seeing the 4.5 star reviews. However, upon opening, I&#x27;ve realized the backing is not velvet and the jeweled area is too short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***If you want a beautifully crafted headband.... pay a little extra to get much better quality at Regalia Beaded Rhinestone Elastic Stretch No Slip Headband.  I&#x27;ve purchased two from that seller and it is high quality. ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also seen very high quality headbands made by Deepa Gurnani at Saks Fifth ave for $120.  They are of similar quality to the Regalia brand you can get on amazon.</li>
            <li> It was just what I was looking for. It looks way more expensive than it was! Great value and looks great on!</li>
            <li> Very cute and pretty. Great for the price. Shipping was extremely slow and it started to come apart the first day I wore it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty and well made. The inside has a velveteen material to help the band stay on the head.</li>
            <li> Love the headband , the color very pretty . We&#x27;ll buy from this seller again. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this because it had good reviews; unfortunately it broke on me within 4 hours. The elastic pulled out from between the fabric.</li>
            <li> I always feel like this headband is the perfect finish to my boring work dresses. I recommend for anybody wanting to jazz up their outfit without having to break out too many accessories.</li>
            <li> Once more Amazon came through! We had a Mystery Dinner Theatre in which I played a Silent Film Star in the 30s. I needed a glitsy head band, went to Amazon and there it was. I added a few feathers and some knockout makeup and there I was! I can wear it again...just for kicks!</li>
            <li> I really like this headband . It&#x27;s elegant and lightweight . I feel like it dresses up any outfit I wear with it.</li>
            <li> Just beautiful.  8th graders gift.  Was perfect. Great quality.  My daughter gave this as a gift and she wished it for herself</li>
            <li> Love this as an accent to a Great Gatsby outfit!</li>
            <li> I wore this two times, then put it in my car as a &amp;#34;just in case&amp;#34; headband. After a week of it sitting in my car, the adhesive melted off so it can no longer wrap around my head. Cheap product.</li>
            <li> Great fit. Doesn&#x27;t squeeze head and super shiny and sparkly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Pink Pewter headbands in the past and was looking for a cheaper alternative. This didn&#x27;t disappoint! It functioned much the same as the other expensive brand. It has felt under decorative part for a nonslip effect instead of velvet and the jewels were not as high of quality but I was expecting that because this was only $6 compared to $50. All in all I was satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Beautiful, especially for the price!!</li>
            <li> This is so pretty in person. It will really dress up my hairstyles. It was a great buy!</li>
            <li> I love this headband. Fits perfectly, does not look cheap, and very inexpensive. I recommend!</li>
            <li> Prettier than in the picture.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter and I&#x27;ve definitely seen better. It has a handmade, crafty look that appears as if it were made at home. I&#x27;ve seen better.</li>
            <li> This headband is really cute but it&#x27;s more for a child rather than an adult, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Love love love! Definitely worth the the buy!</li>
            <li> headband given as a gift to a 12 year old girl who LOVED IT!  I thought it was adorable and would have worn myself if the little punk didn&#x27;t want it herself.</li>
            <li> It broke after a couple of uses</li>
            <li> High quality- I would absolutely buy from this seller again</li>
            <li> I was a little bummed because this headband arrived damaged with one of the elastic bands detached.  I&#x27;m giving it four stars anyway because the headband is actually really attractive and you know what they say...things happen.  The quality is actually pretty good with the beads securely on there.  It is also a nice piece for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to send it back but decided to stitch it together myself.  It really was a simple fix.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems since.  It sits nicely on my head and doesn&#x27;t slide off.  It&#x27;s a perfect size and I like that it is so versatile.  It looks terrific against my long dark brown hair or across my forehead!  The beads are set in an attractive pattern which has a real nice sparkle to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice piece, good price and free shipping...not a bad deal for this attractive headband!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this band.  However, the beadwork on the item I received was not impressive, and the coloring of the oval stones is quite yellow.  Looks pretty cheap.  I might donate to my child&#x27;s after school program as a dress-up accessory.</li>
            <li> These are my absolute favorite headbands EVER! I bought two and am obsessed!</li>
            <li> The headband broke the first time my daughter put it on.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price! Hand made! :)</li>
            <li> Cute headband.  I got it to wear across my forehead for a &amp;#34;Roaring Twenties&amp;#34; party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 stars because a rhinestone fell out after only a week or so.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a christmas present and it was perfect! The price was great and my frind loved it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> This headband is very beautiful. Also, to my surprise, it was heavier than it looked in the picture, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing. The beading is simply gorgeous, and it&#x27;s everything I was hoping it&#x27;d be.</li>
            <li> My 19 year old daughter loves this. It can be dressy or casual.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because some of the reviews said it was loose fitting but I got headache wearing it. It looks does look great though.</li>
            <li> I REALLY, really love this product!! It&#x27;s VERY pretty, high quality, and soft material on the inside. Very comfortable. I&#x27;m back online to see what others they have now!</li>
            <li> Like it, great bang for your buck- HOWEVER- WARNING!- this catches easily! So if you plan on wearing it on your hair, it should be perfect. However, just be really careful near ANY fabric because it snags sooo easily :(.</li>
            <li> I wore this headband to prom. My hair stylist pinned it my hair and it was gorgeous.</li>
            <li> It stacks up to the very expensive big name kind for every day wear. I like it. I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife for her birthday and she absolutely loves it.  It is very well made and has held up well with use.  The elastic also has not gotten stretched out.  The backing on the headband also makes it nonslip.  My wife has thick, short, curly hair and it stays put just fine.</li>
            <li> Broke after a handful of wears. The beads also always got snarled in my hair and was painful to pull it out.</li>
            <li> This headband is a great way to accessorize when you don&#x27;t feel like gettin dressed up!</li>
            <li> Good quality! Heavy material though, I feel as though the headband will slide back on my head but the material that is in contact with the hair holds it in place well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update- 11/23/15 gem fell off in front . Unable to wear anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful and sparkly!</li>
            <li> head band is too large so it doesn&amp;#34;t fit securely</li>
            <li> a Little small but looks awesome !</li>
            <li> Just as described  Very pretty.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  Stones could be fastened to the material a bit better.</li>
            <li> The band was too loose!</li>
            <li> Lovely and surprisingly comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn it a few times, still looks perfect</li>
            <li> I received my headband fast and was so much prettier than i expected</li>
            <li> Looks awesome with my costume and I&#x27;ve worn it as a headband and got many compliments. It&#x27;s a 1920&#x27;s party and I&#x27;m going to put it on top of a sequence feather piece.</li>
