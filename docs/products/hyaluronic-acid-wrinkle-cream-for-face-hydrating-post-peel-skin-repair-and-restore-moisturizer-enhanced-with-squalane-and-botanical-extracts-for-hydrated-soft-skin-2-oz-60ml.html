            <li>It is perfect to use after a Fruit Acid peel as it rehydrates the skin and seems to calm and moisturize.</li>
            <li>This is a good pairing with one of the acid peels, but it&#x27;s also nice to have as a day-time moisturizer.</li>

            <li>I liked how my skin looked after use.</li>
            <li>used The Rose Face Wash, Glycolic Peel, and Moisturizer together from this company.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the Rose Gel Cleanser and the Glycolic Gel Peel, you really need an excellent moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Pairs well with the Rose Glow Cleanser.</li>
            <li>I use it after using the rose glow pre peel cleanser.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer is a nice finish to the peel process.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Along with the Reveal Pre-Peel Rose Glow Cleanser and Fruit Acid 15% Gel Peel, Refresh Skin Therapy sent me a jar of its Restore Hyaluronic Moisturizing Cream for review.</li>
            <li>I use this after washing my face with the rose glow</li>
            <li>This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>This product is a nice way to moisturize your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li>you are looking for a nice moisturizer for your face, this may be just the thing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I received free samples of these products for a fair and honest review</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using all three of these products together in a weekly process to get my skin in better condition and have really liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Eucerin is more effective after a peel or mask.</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this product!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to wear sunscreen during the day after using this product.</li>
            <li>i love using this product after my peel</li>
            <li>It works for its intended use following Refresh Skin Therapy&#x27;s lactic acid peel (reviewed elsewhere), but I like it best to put on my face when I get in from the pool.</li>
            <li>So many of them do leave an oily feel on your face.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizing cream makes my skin feel silky smooth!  </li>
            <li>I love how this moisturizer makes my skin feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the hyaluronic ingredient in this product.</li>
            <li>I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Those first two steps in the ReFresh skin care regimen give your face a workout--it tingles and you can tell good things are going on, but you know you need to provide something soothing as well.  </li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and it does an excellent job of moisturizing the dry areas without making the oily spots even oilier.</li>
            <li>(Full disclosure: I received a free product from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin requires pure natural ingredients, which is why I&#x27;m particularly impressed with this Refresh Skin Therapy product that I received as a free trial sample to review.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>or you have fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and went on smooth across my face.</li>
            <li>This lotion has helped my face feel so much better after doing mild chemical peels once a week.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer has a very nice sweet smell and does not leave your face feeling oily, but soft which is a plus.</li>
            <li>Our products are always free from Parabens, Perfumes, Dyes, and Phlalates.”</li>
            <li>Our products are always free from Parabens, Perfumes, Dyes, and Phlalates.”</li>
            <li>received this product free for review.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has become drier and it has been a challenge to find an effective skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I find my face feels clean, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is nice and refreshing but not moisturizing enough.  </li>
            <li>They work much better together, though if you&#x27;re using other hyaluronic, glycolic, or lactic acid formulae along with them,  the results will probably be just as good.  </li>
            <li>It even keeps my skin soft after swimming, which is amazing since I was about to try Vaseline.</li>
            <li>It may be good for someone that is much younger (say in their 20&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly as well.</li>
            <li>this product is well worth the buy...</li>
            <li>sample was provided by {Re} Fresh  for testing and evaluation.</li>
            <li>I wash the chlorine off my face, then follow with this cream, and my skin feels fresh and feeling moist for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>It looked soft and appealing.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this Refresh Skin Moisturizing Cream to review, together with the Refresh Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Facial Cleanser and the Refresh Fruit Acid Gel Peel... and all I can say is, &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I used it right away</li>
            <li>The peel removes dry skin revitalizing it and the moisturizer is a nice soother to use right after.</li>
            <li>These products will last a while since you&#x27;re not using them every day and at the current price are a GREAT value.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a nice product at a decent price point.</li>
            <li>Many over-the-counter products end up in my garbage can, simply because they cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s any better than a regular face lotion.  </li>
            <li>I only used this cream after first using the Refresh Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Deep Facial Cleanser and Refresh Skin Therapy Fruit Acid Gel Peel, so I can attest to the fact that for my skin (which tends to run on the slightly oily side), they work perfectly together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>: I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes, but a positive review was neither promised or implied.</li>
            <li>I have slightly dry skin and was hoping that it would provide a lot more hydration.  </li>
            <li>, these three products applied before bedtime help restore a smooth, fresh, vibrant glow to my facial skin.</li>
            <li>something I really like about products made by this company is they are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have something on my face, which I can&#x27;t stand, but being a humectant, it hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>If used after a peel it works very well and helps sooth your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Light enough to wear under make up too.</li>
            <li>’s also worth noting that I have moderately sensitive skin (inherited from my mom), and the Restore cream didn’t cause any issues.</li>
            <li>Refresh Skin Therapy Restore Hyaluronic Moisturizing Cream feels very cooling when applied to your face.</li>
            <li>, you should use this product in conjunction with a gentle cleanser and skin peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have to say that I really like it for use during the day</li>
            <li>Pre-peel Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Deep Facial Cleanser]].</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it alone, and with the other products and have noticed the triple whammy effect is much greater than each product used alone.  </li>
            <li>After this trial period, I still had a significant amount of moisturizer left over, so I started using it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The chemical peel is mild enough to use it once a week, but after using it you can really feel it working in the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used it after the lactic acid peel on my arms and they are very soft and smooth after only 5 days.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for a few days, but it seems to be plumping my face &amp; feels good.</li>
            <li>The fruit peel also seemed to work significantly better than some of the non-vegan products I tried back in my omni days, such as Mederma and the like.ivities.</li>

            <li>Super tiny jar, way overpriced.</li>
            <li>This facial cream actually dries my skin out more than it moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I really like the lightness of the product and the fact that it is all natural</li>
            <li>Though it’s geared toward “post-peel repair and restore,” the Restore cream is light enough that you could use it on a daily basis, with or without the peel and pre-peel face wash.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive to some cosmetics, but this formulation did not irritate it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>for the whole package, I did notice an improvement in my acne scars, with the most dramatic changes occurring in the first month.</li>
            <li>for the whole package, I did notice an improvement in my acne scars, with the most dramatic changes occurring in the first month.</li>
            <li>ReFresh moisturizer is thick without being heavy, nongreasy, and seems to be the perfect product to follow the deep cleanser and the peel.  </li>
            <li>Cooling and makes your skin so soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li>It is also very soothing when applied after using a natural facial peel, such as [[ASIN:B00IES42YK {Re} Fresh Lactic Acid 10% Gel Peel]].  </li>
            <li>, it absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I feel really good after I get out, but the chlorine in the water and the sun on my face all that time (even wearing strong sunscreen) makes my skin feel tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>Whether this is due to the passage of time or the efficacy of the products, it’s hard to tell; but it seems like the redness faded much more quickly than normal.</li>

            <li>first thing that struck me about the Restore cream is how rich and thick it is.</li>
            <li>This Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream is the last step in the process, to be used after the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After using the Refresh Skin Therapy Peel, I followed the instructions and did two applications of this due to my super dry and very, very scaly skin.</li>
            <li>my skin feels so hydrated and soft</li>
            <li>Well I used this after I did the peel to freshen and restore my skin and it makes my skin glow and baby soft</li>
            <li>All of the scaly parts came off and my skin is SOFT and does not feel like sandpaper</li>
            <li>skin is naturally oily</li>
            <li>My face feels refreshed and soft after use.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and allergies</li>
            <li>I just pat a few dots around my face and smooth it in</li>
            <li>It seems to tighten up my 63 year old skin</li>
            <li>It is not a heavy moisturizer</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old, doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>wow</li>
            <li>- my skin looks soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and&lt;br /&gt;prone</li>
            <li>It has a slightly fresh smell to it but no real fragrance or scent.</li>
            <li>My skin had suddenly become super dry and was drinking my old moisturizer with no effect.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of doing a peel, I highly recommend this post-peel lotion that&#x27;s sensitive enough to use on tender</li>
            <li>In particular, I had one flat and one atrophic scar, both newish, the appearances of which I hoped would be reduced by the fruit peel.</li>

            <li>At about $22 an ounce, it is rather pricey, but does a much better job moisturizing than my other vegan moisturizer (Jack Black, which is about $9/oz.).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used other moisturizing creams, and am very particular about what products I use, since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>In the past, I have tried many types of moisturizers for my DRY, SANDPAPER TYPE OF FACE and</li>
            <li>It leaves it completely bare so that a chemical peel can work</li>
            <li>I only need a little dab to cover my entire face, and it goes on clean -</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve used the Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream both separately and together with the other two products provided.  </li>
            <li>Hyaluronic acid also occurs naturally in the human body and is crucial to the body&#x27;s wound and skin repair and healing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>With similar products I&#x27;ve found that the results, when used together, are much more dramatic than when the products are used as standalones.  </li>
            <li>It even did an admirable job on an especially dry patch of skin that’s recently developed on my neck, though I suspect that yet another visit to the dermatologist may be in my near future</li>

            <li>long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic screw-top jar is useful when emptied for holding stamps or a few pieces of jewellery when travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a white, moderately thick cream that quickly melts into the skin, leaving it silky but not oily.  </li>
            <li>not heavy enough for use at night if you have very dry skin</li>

            <li> (Full disclosure: I received a free product from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin requires pure natural ingredients, which is why I&#x27;m particularly impressed with this Refresh Skin Therapy product that I received as a free trial sample to review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> or you have fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and went on smooth across my face.</li>
            <li> This lotion has helped my face feel so much better after doing mild chemical peels once a week.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer has a very nice sweet smell and does not leave your face feeling oily, but soft which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Our products are always free from Parabens, Perfumes, Dyes, and Phlalates.”</li>
            <li> Our products are always free from Parabens, Perfumes, Dyes, and Phlalates.”</li>
            <li> received this product free for review.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and didn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has become drier and it has been a challenge to find an effective skin moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I find my face feels clean, not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is nice and refreshing but not moisturizing enough.  </li>
            <li> They work much better together, though if you&#x27;re using other hyaluronic, glycolic, or lactic acid formulae along with them,  the results will probably be just as good.  </li>
            <li> It even keeps my skin soft after swimming, which is amazing since I was about to try Vaseline.</li>
            <li> It may be good for someone that is much younger (say in their 20&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly as well.</li>
            <li> this product is well worth the buy...</li>
            <li> sample was provided by {Re} Fresh  for testing and evaluation.</li>
            <li> I wash the chlorine off my face, then follow with this cream, and my skin feels fresh and feeling moist for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> It looked soft and appealing.</li>
            <li> but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this Refresh Skin Moisturizing Cream to review, together with the Refresh Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Facial Cleanser and the Refresh Fruit Acid Gel Peel... and all I can say is, &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew it was worth it.</li>
            <li> I used it right away</li>
            <li> The peel removes dry skin revitalizing it and the moisturizer is a nice soother to use right after.</li>
            <li> These products will last a while since you&#x27;re not using them every day and at the current price are a GREAT value.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a nice product at a decent price point.</li>
            <li> Many over-the-counter products end up in my garbage can, simply because they cause my skin to break out.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s any better than a regular face lotion.  </li>
            <li> I only used this cream after first using the Refresh Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Deep Facial Cleanser and Refresh Skin Therapy Fruit Acid Gel Peel, so I can attest to the fact that for my skin (which tends to run on the slightly oily side), they work perfectly together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> : I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes, but a positive review was neither promised or implied.</li>
            <li> I have slightly dry skin and was hoping that it would provide a lot more hydration.  </li>
            <li> , these three products applied before bedtime help restore a smooth, fresh, vibrant glow to my facial skin.</li>
            <li> something I really like about products made by this company is they are not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have something on my face, which I can&#x27;t stand, but being a humectant, it hydrates my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> If used after a peel it works very well and helps sooth your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Light enough to wear under make up too.</li>
            <li> ’s also worth noting that I have moderately sensitive skin (inherited from my mom), and the Restore cream didn’t cause any issues.</li>
            <li> Refresh Skin Therapy Restore Hyaluronic Moisturizing Cream feels very cooling when applied to your face.</li>
            <li> , you should use this product in conjunction with a gentle cleanser and skin peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I really like it for use during the day</li>
            <li> Pre-peel Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Deep Facial Cleanser]].</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it alone, and with the other products and have noticed the triple whammy effect is much greater than each product used alone.  </li>
            <li> After this trial period, I still had a significant amount of moisturizer left over, so I started using it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The chemical peel is mild enough to use it once a week, but after using it you can really feel it working in the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it after the lactic acid peel on my arms and they are very soft and smooth after only 5 days.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few days, but it seems to be plumping my face &amp; feels good.</li>
            <li> The fruit peel also seemed to work significantly better than some of the non-vegan products I tried back in my omni days, such as Mederma and the like.ivities.</li>
            <li> The fruit peel also seemed to work significantly better than some of the non-vegan products I tried back in my omni days, such as Mederma and the like.</li>
            <li> Super tiny jar, way overpriced.</li>
            <li> This facial cream actually dries my skin out more than it moisturizes.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I really like the lightness of the product and the fact that it is all natural</li>
            <li> Though it’s geared toward “post-peel repair and restore,” the Restore cream is light enough that you could use it on a daily basis, with or without the peel and pre-peel face wash.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive to some cosmetics, but this formulation did not irritate it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> for the whole package, I did notice an improvement in my acne scars, with the most dramatic changes occurring in the first month.</li>

            <li> ReFresh moisturizer is thick without being heavy, nongreasy, and seems to be the perfect product to follow the deep cleanser and the peel.  </li>
            <li> Cooling and makes your skin so soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> It is also very soothing when applied after using a natural facial peel, such as [[ASIN:B00IES42YK {Re} Fresh Lactic Acid 10% Gel Peel]].  </li>
            <li> , it absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I feel really good after I get out, but the chlorine in the water and the sun on my face all that time (even wearing strong sunscreen) makes my skin feel tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Whether this is due to the passage of time or the efficacy of the products, it’s hard to tell; but it seems like the redness faded much more quickly than normal.</li>

            <li> first thing that struck me about the Restore cream is how rich and thick it is.</li>
            <li> This Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream is the last step in the process, to be used after the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After using the Refresh Skin Therapy Peel, I followed the instructions and did two applications of this due to my super dry and very, very scaly skin.</li>
            <li> my skin feels so hydrated and soft</li>
            <li> Well I used this after I did the peel to freshen and restore my skin and it makes my skin glow and baby soft</li>
            <li> All of the scaly parts came off and my skin is SOFT and does not feel like sandpaper</li>

            <li> I am 63 years old, doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> wow</li>
            <li> - my skin looks soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and&lt;br /&gt;prone</li>
            <li> It has a slightly fresh smell to it but no real fragrance or scent.</li>
            <li> My skin had suddenly become super dry and was drinking my old moisturizer with no effect.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of doing a peel, I highly recommend this post-peel lotion that&#x27;s sensitive enough to use on tender</li>
            <li> In particular, I had one flat and one atrophic scar, both newish, the appearances of which I hoped would be reduced by the fruit peel.</li>

            <li> At about $22 an ounce, it is rather pricey, but does a much better job moisturizing than my other vegan moisturizer (Jack Black, which is about $9/oz.).  </li>

            <li> /&gt;It is a white, moderately thick cream that quickly melts into the skin, leaving it silky but not oily.  </li>
            <li> not heavy enough for use at night if you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> While the products obviously couldn’t do much to fill in the pit left by the atrophic scar (as I understand it, this usually requires laser treatment or dermal fillers), the redness of both scars faded noticeably.</li>

            <li> Garbage. It dried on my face before I finished applying. My dry peeling skin looked even worse.</li>
            <li> this product is well worth the buy...my skin feels so hydrated and soft</li>
            <li> This is good to use after a peel, but you will still need another cream to take care of redness.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have tried many types of moisturizers for my DRY, SANDPAPER TYPE OF FACE and nothing worked that well. That is until this product!

            <li> Very nice cream. I may even use it all the time and not just post peel!</li>

            <li> {Re} store hyaluronic moisturizing cream contains a blend of highly-effective ingredients to moisturize and protect the skin from drying, while softening and plumping it to improve the texture and appearance.  It can be used on the delicate areas of the face as well as on problem areas such as the elbows.  My skin is very sensitive to some cosmetics, but this formulation did not irritate it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a white, moderately thick cream that quickly melts into the skin, leaving it silky but not oily.  It has only a very neutral odor, faint and inoffensive, with no added perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be used as an everyday moisturizer after bathing or washing the skin.  It is also very soothing when applied after using a natural facial peel, such as [[ASIN:B00IES42YK {Re} Fresh Lactic Acid 10% Gel Peel]].

            <li> I am using the Refresh Fruit Acid 15% Gel Peel 3 times a week and I use this hyaluronic acid moisturizing cream by Refresh after each peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a thick, white cream that isn&#x27;t greasy at all and absorbs completely after I apply it. It has a slightly fresh smell to it but no real fragrance or scent. A little goes a long way so the jar should last for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is naturally oily so I don&#x27;t use this under makeup as it&#x27;s a little heavy for my particular skin.

I&#x27;m very happy with the results I&#x27;m getting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I was provided a sample for reviewing purposes, but a positive review was neither promised or implied.</li>
            <li> This lotion has helped my face feel so much better after doing mild chemical peels once a week. I started using the [[ASIN:B00ICXI5QI Fruit Acid Gel Peel]] made by the same company as this lotion, combined with the [[ASIN:B00IG8ZS1E Pre-peel Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Deep Facial Cleanser]]. I&#x27;ve been using all three of these products together in a weekly process to get my skin in better condition and have really liked the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser works great and doesn&#x27;t leave your face with any kind of medicines or moisturizers on it. It leaves it completely bare so that a chemical peel can work it&#x27;s best. The chemical peel is mild enough to use it once a week, but after using it you can really feel it working in the skin. Hours later my skin will still feel tender. This cream is perfect for soothing it. Just a dab goes a long way and keeps my skin moisturized and soothed for hours. If you&#x27;re thinking of doing a peel, I highly recommend this post-peel lotion that&#x27;s sensitive enough to use on tender skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also something I really like about products made by this company is they are not tested on animals. Each product states this on the label. Animal testing for cosmetic purposes is a thing of the past and I appreciate that this company chooses not to participate in the inhumane and outdated practice. Also noted on the label is these products are made in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
            <li> I promised myself I would spend at least 45 minutes a day just moving, moving, moving in the pool. I feel really good after I get out, but the chlorine in the water and the sun on my face all that time (even wearing strong sunscreen) makes my skin feel tight and uncomfortable. I received a jar of this moisturizing post-peel cream in return for an honest review. It works for its intended use following Refresh Skin Therapy&#x27;s lactic acid peel (reviewed elsewhere), but I like it best to put on my face when I get in from the pool. I wash the chlorine off my face, then follow with this cream, and my skin feels fresh and feeling moist for the rest of the day. It&#x27;s light enough that it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have something on my face, which I can&#x27;t stand, but being a humectant, it hydrates my skin. Is it the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used? No, I prefer Neutrogena&#x27;s Continuous Hydration Night in terms of how it feels and goes onto my skin, but that&#x27;s like comparing apples to oranges. The two products have completely different functions. This is a good pairing with one of the acid peels, but it&#x27;s also nice to have as a day-time moisturizer. It also doesn&#x27;t break out my skin like some moisturizers do. It is completely not greasy.</li>
            <li> I really like this moisturizer. The moisturizer has a very nice sweet smell and does not leave your face feeling oily, but soft which is a plus. So many of them do leave an oily feel on your face.  It was easy to use and went on smooth across my face. I liked how my skin looked after use. It looked soft and appealing. That is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used The Rose Face Wash, Glycolic Peel, and Moisturizer together from this company. I have to say these products work well. My face feels refreshed and soft after use. I have sensitive skin and allergies so I must take extra cautions when using a product, but I had no problems with these products and no allergies. I recommend this regiment, and these products.  I received free samples of these products for a fair and honest review</li>
            <li> The ReFresh company provided me with the three products designed around their 15% Glycolic Acid Peel.  This Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream is the last step in the process, to be used after the peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For review purposes, I&#x27;ve used the Hyaluronic Pure Moisturizing Cream both separately and together with the other two products provided.  They work much better together, though if you&#x27;re using other hyaluronic, glycolic, or lactic acid formulae along with them,  the results will probably be just as good.  With similar products I&#x27;ve found that the results, when used together, are much more dramatic than when the products are used as standalones.  Believe me when I say I&#x27;ve used enough products to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Rose Gel Cleanser and the Glycolic Gel Peel, you really need an excellent moisturizer.  Those first two steps in the ReFresh skin care regimen give your face a workout--it tingles and you can tell good things are going on, but you know you need to provide something soothing as well.  From experience and research, I know that a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid is the perfect follow-up to exfoliating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ReFresh moisturizer is thick without being heavy, nongreasy, and seems to be the perfect product to follow the deep cleanser and the peel.  I&#x27;ve used it alone, and with the other products and have noticed the triple whammy effect is much greater than each product used alone.  These products will last a while since you&#x27;re not using them every day and at the current price are a GREAT value.  Their performance and results are right up there with the best stuff on the market!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Very light and absorbs quickly. Feels great on my hands. I apply in the morning and at night - and followed the instructions on the packaging. Pairs well with the Rose Glow Cleanser. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This moisturizing cream makes my skin feel silky smooth!  I use it after using the rose glow pre peel cleanser. If used after a peel it works very well and helps sooth your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little bit goes a long way.  I just pat a few dots around my face and smooth it in, it absorbs very quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy or greasy. Light enough to wear under make up too. I love how this moisturizer makes my skin feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received sample product for fair and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to review along with the companies fruit acid peel and cleanser. The moisturizer is a nice finish to the peel process. The peel removes dry skin revitalizing it and the moisturizer is a nice soother to use right after. Alternatively you could use a Vitamin C serum or other product. Because the peel bares the skin it is receptive to treatments such as this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the hyaluronic ingredient in this product. I feel it works well to soothe rough skin. Overall, a nice product at a decent price point.</li>
            <li> (Full disclosure: I received a free product from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with the Reveal Pre-Peel Rose Glow Cleanser and Fruit Acid 15% Gel Peel, Refresh Skin Therapy sent me a jar of its Restore Hyaluronic Moisturizing Cream for review. The products were meant to be used together as part of a skin care regimen, so initially I only applied the cream three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday nights, after using the cleanser and peel; the peel can be used up to three times a week) for approximately eight weeks. After this trial period, I still had a significant amount of moisturizer left over, so I started using it as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that struck me about the Restore cream is how rich and thick it is. I only need a little dab to cover my entire face, and it goes on clean - I’m not left with a greasy feeling after applying it. I have combination skin, and it does an excellent job of moisturizing the dry areas without making the oily spots even oilier. At about $22 an ounce, it is rather pricey, but does a much better job moisturizing than my other vegan moisturizer (Jack Black, which is about $9/oz.).  Though it’s geared toward “post-peel repair and restore,” the Restore cream is light enough that you could use it on a daily basis, with or without the peel and pre-peel face wash. I didn’t notice any change in my acne while using it, which means that it didn’t clog up my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Jack Black, the Restore cream does not contain sunblock – and since the fruit peel contains Alpha Hydroxy Acid, which may increase the skin’s sensitivity to the sun, you should consider using sunscreen if you’re also undergoing the skin peel treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s also worth noting that I have moderately sensitive skin (inherited from my mom), and the Restore cream didn’t cause any issues. It has a neutral (almost nonexistent) scent, which is excellent for those with olfactory sensitivities. According to Refresh Skin Therapy’s website, “We use USP-grade ingredients which are all botanically-derived; we never test on animals or use animal-derived ingredients.  Our products are always free from Parabens, Perfumes, Dyes, and Phlalates.” It even did an admirable job on an especially dry patch of skin that’s recently developed on my neck, though I suspect that yet another visit to the dermatologist may be in my near future (it’s starting to look a lot like dermatitis!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the whole package, I did notice an improvement in my acne scars, with the most dramatic changes occurring in the first month. In particular, I had one flat and one atrophic scar, both newish, the appearances of which I hoped would be reduced by the fruit peel. While the products obviously couldn’t do much to fill in the pit left by the atrophic scar (as I understand it, this usually requires laser treatment or dermal fillers), the redness of both scars faded noticeably. Whether this is due to the passage of time or the efficacy of the products, it’s hard to tell; but it seems like the redness faded much more quickly than normal. It’s also impossible to say which of the products deserves the lion’s share of the credit, since I used all three in concert (though my money’s on the fruit peel!). The fruit peel also seemed to work significantly better than some of the non-vegan products I tried back in my omni days, such as Mederma and the like.ivities.

            <li> I was given a sample of this re Store Hyaluronic Moisturizing Cream and I am delighted with it. I have used it after a Lactic acid peel and also alone. I find my face feels clean, not greasy. It seems to tighten up my 63 year old skin and I seem to have a little glow about me. I have used it after the lactic acid peel on my arms and they are very soft and smooth after only 5 days. This product have no perfume or other irritants, this is a plus in my book. I would  definitely buy it.</li>
            <li> Refresh Skin Therapy Restore Hyaluronic Moisturizing Cream feels very cooling when applied to your face. It is perfect to use after a Fruit Acid peel as it rehydrates the skin and seems to calm and moisturize. It is not a heavy moisturizer so it is perfect for oily or acne prone skin. It absorbs quickly as well. I use this after washing my face with the rose glow cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product free for review. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Super tiny jar, way overpriced. Had to keep reapplying product to feel any moisturizing effect. Bought this to follow up my glycolic acid peel. When package arrived I was suprised by the tiny size but thought maybe it&#x27;s concentrated. After 4 peels the jar is almost empty. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using the face cream and I really like the lightness of the product and the fact that it is all natural</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, my skin has become drier and it has been a challenge to find an effective skin moisturizer.  They are either too greasy, or don&#x27;t moisturize.  This product is a nice way to moisturize your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For best results, you should use this product in conjunction with a gentle cleanser and skin peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I love this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It&#x27;s effective.  My skin feels moisturized, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;* The natural ingredients. Some of the ingredients include:  Jojoba Oil, Apricot Kernel Oil, and Hyaluronic Acid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a nice moisturizer for your face, this may be just the thing for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I received a free sample of this product for testing and review.</li>
            <li> This facial cream actually dries my skin out more than it moisturizes. Maybe it is for younger skin or oily problem skin? I am 63 years old, doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> wow i glad i gave it a shot with all the competition! but it was worth it. I was given this product as a gift and I have to say that I really like it for use during the day - my skin looks soft and hydrated. My skin is sensitive and&lt;br /&gt;prone to occasional breakouts and oilyness, so I canʼt use anything too heavy. Pros:&lt;br /&gt;light texture, doesnʼt cause me to breakout, unscented, not greasy or shiny after. Cons:&lt;br /&gt;probably not heavy enough for use at night if you have very dry skin</li>
            <li> Feels great after April! Cooling and makes your skin so soft and refreshed!</li>
            <li> Amazon recommended this moisturizer when I purchased the Fruit Acid Gel Peel by the same company. My skin had suddenly become super dry and was drinking my old moisturizer with no effect. This moisturizer did the trick. It even keeps my skin soft after swimming, which is amazing since I was about to try Vaseline. Thank you for saving me from that!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this Refresh Skin Moisturizing Cream to review, together with the Refresh Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Facial Cleanser and the Refresh Fruit Acid Gel Peel... and all I can say is, &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taken together, these three products applied before bedtime help restore a smooth, fresh, vibrant glow to my facial skin. This Refresh Moisturizing Cream works with just the smallest amount of product being applied, so a little truly goes a long way. This is similar to the other two Refresh products mentioned above. I only used this cream after first using the Refresh Hydrating Rose Glow Gel Deep Facial Cleanser and Refresh Skin Therapy Fruit Acid Gel Peel, so I can attest to the fact that for my skin (which tends to run on the slightly oily side), they work perfectly together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used other moisturizing creams, and am very particular about what products I use, since I have sensitive skin. Many over-the-counter products end up in my garbage can, simply because they cause my skin to break out. My skin requires pure natural ingredients, which is why I&#x27;m particularly impressed with this Refresh Skin Therapy product that I received as a free trial sample to review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It is nice and refreshing but not moisturizing enough.  I have slightly dry skin and was hoping that it would provide a lot more hydration.  It may be good for someone that is much younger (say in their 20&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> Great moisture for face but my neck and decolletage broke out with pimples. Will use for face only.</li>
            <li> I did not get this as a sample I purchased it. I used it right away and I Have oily skin and have a problem trying to find something that doesnt make my skin look oilier than it already looks AND moisturizes the way I want. This product is perfect for that. Im not gonna lie when I saw how small it was I was alittle upset BUT when I saw all you need is literally a dab I knew it was worth it. Must buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and didn&#x27;t make me break out. I just don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s any better than a regular face lotion.  It would be good for summer, but I prefer Eucerin q10 anti-wrinkle. Eucerin is more effective after a peel or mask.</li>
