            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Ordered one to start, she liked it</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>This product is not as good as the original thickening spray that came in a silver bottle.  </li>
            <li>I use so many products for my hair</li>
            <li>I love this fat hair.</li>
            <li>, I caused too many split ends, even with using a leave-on conditioner on my hair, or mixing it with a spray-on conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I borrowed from my mom and fell in love with this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>If they still make the spray, I would purchase it over the mist but the mist is the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE SAMY FAT HAIR PRODUCTS.  </li>
            <li>Really love this stuff</li>
            <li>Water softeners and fine hair do not mix - until now.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Samy!!!</li>
            <li>It still looks clean and shiny when you are finished blowing out your hair.  </li>
            <li>do make sure that I use the thickening spray on the roots rather than the whole strand of hair.</li>
            <li>My thin, fine hair does wonderfully with these products.  </li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this product on my fine hair and it does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>At first, I really liked it , then realized it leaves my hair so soft can not do anything with it.  </li>
            <li>and it really gives my pitiful hair much needed volume!  </li>
            <li>I really like them!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Put a dime to quarter size, smear it in your palms, gently work it in your hair &amp; leave it in.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair with so much volume.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This really works for me.</li>
            <li>THANKS, Virginia Shields</li>
            <li>Really help my hair look fuller</li>
            <li>It gives my fine hair the volume it needs on days when it&#x27;s flat.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this product and buy it 4 at a time!  </li>
            <li>The new card information is enclosed with the return.</li>
            <li>It is a little drying however, so I lightly apply a leave-in conditioner (currently using Neutrogena Triple Moisture Silk Touch Leave-In Cream, which I love) on the ends that tend to dry and split, which they sometimes did anyway, since my hair tends to be on the dry side, even before I started using this thickening spray.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I really preferred the Samy Fat Hair Thickening Spray in the grey container.  </li>
            <li>but this one allows you to go a few days without washing your hair and it still looks fresh.</li>

            <li> Using Samy Fat Hair Spray makes my hair feel thicker, style easier and lasts all day long!</li>
            <li> Let your hair dry.</li>
            <li> but I find the Amplifying Mist tends to dry my hair.  </li>

            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t get crunchy or stiff like volumizing root sprays.</li>

            <li> This product gives my hair body and bounce without any feeling of heaviness or coating the hair strand.  I&#x27;ve used it over a year now and it is part of my daily hair routine.  I also use Fat Hair Mousse, thickening cream and air spray.  My thin, fine hair does wonderfully with these products.  I really like them!&lt;br /&gt;I do make sure that I use the thickening spray on the roots rather than the whole strand of hair.</li>
            <li> My wife had a hard time finding this in stores, found it here on Amazon. Ordered one to start, she liked it so well she also reordered for her and our grandaughter.</li>
            <li> The spray is useless.    This works: Samy Fat Hair Creme Thickening 3.5 oz    Put a dime to quarter size, smear it in your palms, gently work it in your hair &amp; leave it in. Let your hair dry.</li>
            <li> I use so many products for my hair but this is the best. I have very fine hair it makes my hair with so much volume. I love this fat hair. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It gives my fine hair the volume it needs on days when it&#x27;s flat. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t get crunchy or stiff like volumizing root sprays. It is a little drying however, so I lightly apply a leave-in conditioner (currently using Neutrogena Triple Moisture Silk Touch Leave-In Cream, which I love) on the ends that tend to dry and split, which they sometimes did anyway, since my hair tends to be on the dry side, even before I started using this thickening spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/16/14. I don&#x27;t use this product anymore, I caused too many split ends, even with using a leave-on conditioner on my hair, or mixing it with a spray-on conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I use KMS California Curl Up Curling Balm. See my review of it here: http://www.amazon.com/review/R27D7R0GL0FAJ1/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_dp_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;ASIN&#x3D;B005JDPJQ8&amp;nodeID&#x3D;3760911&amp;store&#x3D;beauty. That product gives me fullness without alcohol, meaning no split ends!! And no stiffness or crunchiness.</li>
            <li> This really works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this stuff</li>
            <li> I borrowed from my mom and fell in love with this product.  After looking everywhere I could think of to find for myself I found on Amazon.  Volume and hold without the stickiness.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  For years I had to use several products to style my hair and get it to hold the style.  Water softeners and fine hair do not mix - until now.  Using Samy Fat Hair Spray makes my hair feel thicker, style easier and lasts all day long! Thanks Samy!!!</li>
            <li> I received the Samy Fat Hair Amplifying Mist in the red container but I really preferred the Samy Fat Hair Thickening Spray in the grey container.  They are almost the same, they both appear to thicken my hair but I find the Amplifying Mist tends to dry my hair.  If they still make the spray, I would purchase it over the mist but the mist is the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon service is excellent.  They aim to please their customers.</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as the original thickening spray that came in a silver bottle.  Really disappointed this not what I intended to order.</li>
            <li> I ordred the Samy Fat hair Thickening spray, bur received the Samy Fat Hair Mist.  I was told the mist replaced the thickening spray, I tried it and it is not for my hair. I am returning the 5 bottles today for a refund.  Also the credit card information you have for me was replaced with another card because someone unknown used my card.  The new card information is enclosed with the return. I LOVE SAMY FAT HAIR PRODUCTS.  THANKS, Virginia Shields</li>
            <li> Really help my hair look fuller</li>
            <li> This product thickens the look of the hair without any extra product buildup.  It still looks clean and shiny when you are finished blowing out your hair.  Some thickeners are so gunky that they have to be washed out everyday but this one allows you to go a few days without washing your hair and it still looks fresh.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff but I dilute it a bit with cheaper spray gel.</li>
            <li> The best product I&#x27;ve found for volumizing.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this product and buy it 4 at a time!  I have very fine hair and it really gives my pitiful hair much needed volume!  One time I forgot to use it and had to re-wash my hair!  I love this!!</li>
            <li> At first, I really liked it , then realized it leaves my hair so soft can not do anything with it.  Yes, it makes the hair fuller but since it is so soft, does not really help.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this product on my fine hair and it does exactly what it says. I spray it on my wet hair and comb through and my hair looks and feels thicker. I recommend this product.</li>
