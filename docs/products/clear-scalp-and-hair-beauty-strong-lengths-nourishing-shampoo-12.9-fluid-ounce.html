            <li>That means it&#x27;s still not quite as good in my experience as using a really good conditioner separately,</li>

            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>This 2 in 1 shampoo with conditioner is amazing at reducing dandruff.  </li>
            <li>Tried this and liked what it did but the smell of the product stayed in my hair all day.</li>
            <li>This shampoo/conditioner in one really works well and is probably the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I feel the combo really works best for me.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell, a nice consistency, and it seems to work well...</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a nice alternative to Head and Shoulders.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent and appeared to be effective as an antidandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on the scalp love the smell of mint and the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li>Has a nice smell&lt;</li>
            <li>This product is fairly effective in cleaning my scalp, but I&#x27;m not a fan of it&#x27;s conditioning properties.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to Head and Shoulders, try this nice quality shampoo-conditioner combination.  </li>
            <li>good product... enjoy...</li>
            <li>Very happy so far.</li>
            <li>but my husband is quite satisfied with the mixture and the times I&#x27;ve stolen it for own use</li>
            <li>It was REALLY strong!</li>
            <li>I got it for my son and his dandruff seems better, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more effective than Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li>My boyfriend liked it better than what he had been using and the smell was okay with him because it wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I notice more flakes than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product recommends that, but it&#x27;s better to wash every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>It works great for my hair and really helps with the dandruff.</li>
            <li>My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better.</li>
            <li>I will purchase again &amp; again :)</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling softer &amp; flake free, downside is that my girlfriend now steals it because it makes her hair softer too!</li>
            <li>Most notably this shampoo/conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like an anti-dandruff product.</li>
            <li>have also tried it because it doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and was pleased.</li>
            <li>But this has a better scent and</li>
            <li>the lather is better if that matters to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love the 2 in 1s because it saves time, energy, and money.</li>
            <li>It does not do anything to resolve my dandruff problem, instead, I have more flakes than ever</li>
            <li>it mostly cause it feels like it gets my hair &amp; scalp</li>
            <li>Price is okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found this to be the case with most 2-in-1s</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased as well.  </li>
            <li>and I thought it was okay.  </li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>For me, the &amp;#34;Clean and refresh&amp;#34; 2 in 1 Anti-dandruff worked better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my husbands favorite shampoo</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and the bottle size is perfect to last you for months.</li>
            <li>I was NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li>He likes the mint version of the Clear men scalp therapy shampoo slightly better but is happy using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice, rich, silky smooth and creamy shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>and so I switched to this and have seen some improvement as well as enjoy this product more.</li>
            <li>(He has a full, manly beard that is not quite ZZ Top, much more than Don Johnson.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the end I have had no coplaints and all things considered, the Clear Men Scalp Therapy product is great, we will be using it again.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it cleared up my dandruff&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is fairly strong, but does smell nice and fresh.</li>
            <li>I liked that it was also very good at reducing itching, which is particularly helpful for those like me with sensitive, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy lather.</li>
            <li>The cap does not come off easily either so</li>
            <li>Your natural oils are there for a reason, stripping them away does more harm than good.</li>
            <li>I also like that this shampoo does not carry a strong medicated odor to it.</li>
            <li>Shampoo also had a strong perfume that I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>very cheap, it&#x27;s worthy in buying them.</li>
            <li>It was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally, the bottle was easy to grip in the shower but it was overly tall and didn&#x27;t fit easily into existing holders.</li>
            <li>It seems better and more pleasant to use than other products in its category, but it also costs more as well.</li>
            <li>I workout in the mornings and use this to wash my hair leaving me dandruff free through the day.</li>
            <li>I got it on Amazon for $3.73 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li>and this is the important part.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes your hair so shiny and smooth and it does moisturize the scalp and make the dryness go away.</li>
            <li>Fantastic shampoo.</li>
            <li>They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li>As far as shampoo-and-conditioners-in-one products, this is a good one.</li>
            <li>Good for frequent use.</li>
            <li>The clear brand does a fair job, but I will just use up what I have &amp; use h&amp;s from now on.</li>
            <li>so do i. Good so far.</li>
            <li>It has a very neutral smell and lathers very easily.</li>
            <li>It does make your hair feel clean for days after using.</li>
            <li>clean.</li>
            <li>After using it, my scalp feels clean.</li>
            <li>Besides that, my girlfriend likes it and my hair stays nice and soft...</li>
            <li>and I agree it is much thicker than others and smells much better.  </li>
            <li>As wonderful as the product was, it&#x27;s also very affordable and much cheaper than the numerous inferior dandruff control shampoos out there.</li>
            <li>Not bad..</li>
            <li>The pretty smell is strong when I put it on my hair but when i am done I don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent and leaves his normally coarse feeling hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This shampoo leaves my head fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>This would probably be best suited for men with very short hair and/or women with thin-textured short hair.</li>
            <li>Quick product review...</li>
            <li>I went from having rather mild dandruff to looking like a snow globe when I ran my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li>Pyrithione zinc works well for my husband&#x27;s mild dandruff, so it&#x27;s what we use.</li>
            <li>It has a very pleasant smell, hard to describe</li>
            <li>I highly enjoyed this shampoo and highly recommend it to all men who suffer from dandruff and/or an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>2 in 1 product, but overall, I enjoyed the thickness of the shampoo, the clean feel afterwards and the light aroma.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but not too strong, and it cleared his little flaky head right up</li>
            <li>Much more silky and soft, not wiry and bristly.</li>
            <li>but I figured it was worth a</li>
            <li>try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li>far i am pleased with this.</li>
            <li>On top of all that, it leaves my hair soft and has virtually no fragrance.</li>
            <li>I also rarely use all in one shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it actually tingled a bit, which I liked.</li>
            <li>Of all the many products I have tried, including high end salon products costing more than twice as much, this is by far the best for keeping dryness and itch to a minimum, and that prevents things from getting worse.</li>
            <li>figured I would try this shampoo based on the reviews and see if it was as good as my other two shampoos.</li>
            <li>The day we used it, he was still scratching and flaking everywhere right before the bath.</li>
            <li>and it is clear that this shampoo is causing more dandruff because when I was using H&amp;S I never seen so much flakes!</li>
            <li>I generally get a softer, more manageable head of hair after using conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I think it is ok, but head &amp; shoulders men active sport works a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>The shampoo/conditioner, comes in a 12.9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily.</li>
            <li>The walmart brand did not help very much.</li>
            <li>I have used this for almost a month and while it feels nice going on, I have actually noticed my scalp is more dry</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with dry scalp or dandruff, but I consider myself lucky because most everyone else in my household experiences it to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use conditioners and am not into shampoos that have \\&quot;pretty smells.\\</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m still using the first pack.</li>
            <li>This saves showering time and hot water.</li>
            <li>At first I thought It will get better but same thing happening.</li>
            <li>This particular one obviously is a bit more specialized and it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well for me as the more general</li>
            <li>It can be very drying, and using this his hair is soft, manageable and flake free.</li>
            <li>This shampoo used every alternate day in mild doses keeps me clean.</li>
            <li>His dandruff has pretty much disappeared, and his scalp does not itch like before either.</li>
            <li>Worked very well from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>have finally found this stuff that smells good, doesn&#x27;t smell too much, and helps out with my dandruff big time.</li>
            <li>the whole, the scent is pleasant and mild, the shampoo and conditioner do their jobs very well, and the AntiDandruff ingredients they use are pretty much the standard stuff you&#x27;ll find in other products in the category.</li>
            <li>but obviously it&#x27;s a lot more convenient (particularly if you&#x27;re packing or a trip or planning to take a shower at the gym and don&#x27;t want to lug a bunch of bottles</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re happy to pay a few dollars more to smell a little better and have hair that&#x27;s slightly softer, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li>happy too, his other favorite brand has grown increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li>I have previously tried Nizral and other brands, but what makes this unique is that it also conditions the hair effectively to make it look light and</li>
            <li>For years I&#x27;ve used the more famous brand of dandruff shampoo, but after trying several different versions of this brand, I have to conclude that this shampoo is equally if not more effect than the famous brand.</li>
            <li>The bottle is hard plastic and the shape does not lend itself well to getting a good squeeze on it.  </li>
            <li>So far this has been great, it is always hard to say if this has been the problem solver for dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo has been a real godsend for me.  </li>
            <li>very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really helps me take it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My family has tried most of them and have not really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>the whole, I like that</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to bother them with something really flowering.</li>
            <li>Product came fast without any problems.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in the end result.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this would do the trick as the Scalp Therapy from Aveda is really pricey and we all use it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like much when you put it on and lather, no tingling feels but it does make dandruff go away</li>
            <li>I find that this shampoo really helped me reduce dandruff on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>My daughter of course didn&#x27;t care as much for the scent since it&#x27;s geared towards men, but her conditioner and hair products covered it up.</li>
            <li>shampoo/conditioner itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container.</li>
            <li>Hair looks good after use, and for me at least, the itching goes away.</li>
            <li>Using any other shampoo, even with medication, I did not get such a good result.</li>
            <li>It does not cause my scalp to itch like other shampoos which contain too many chemicals.</li>
            <li>He smelled great for days, his fur was SO shiny, soft and sleek and his dandruff decreased dramatically after the first bath with it.</li>
            <li>However, i&#x27;ve changed my shampoo to other better quality product.</li>
            <li>But if I couldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;Clean and refresh&amp;#34; version, this is still better than any other anti-dandruff shampoo out there.</li>
            <li>It seemed like either you had to smell like a junior high locker room with way too much axe; or you smelled like something girly and had to drink a lot beer to make up for it.  </li>
            <li>I thought that possibly, this shampoo might also help his scalp and boy, was I right!</li>
            <li>I am pretty old fashioned when it comes to my hair.</li>
            <li>I have a mild to medium case of dandruff, but enough that could be an embarrassment should I not take care of it.</li>
            <li>Not only is this the first anti dandruff treatment that has ever worked for me, it&#x27;s also the first two in one product I approve of.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product for any man.</li>
            <li>This leaves the hair feeling very clean without that weird texture of many shampoo/conditioner combos AND anti-dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li>More severe cases may need more than a few uses, but you should see an improvement after the 1st use for slight cases.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell, and a product that does everything it claims without any weird residue in the hair.</li>
            <li>I initially got it because of the cheap price, but it actually works very well.</li>
            <li>I ended up ditching the Head and Shoulders shampoo I normally buy for this.</li>
            <li>My husband usually uses the generic version Head and Shoulders and thinks this is just as good.</li>
            <li>Of course while this was in our shower I found myself out of my normal shampoos</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s been very picky in the past about shampoos, refusing to use a lot of brands and this is one of his two favorite brands.</li>
            <li>Ok so I have dandruff and always have flakes if I don&#x27;t use shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li>First issue: I&#x27;m noticing more than usual amount of hair fall!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think this is the right product for me, but it may be that others will notice a similar reaction.</li>
            <li>I have a very dry and easily irritated scalp, and this shampoo is one of my main weapons in keeping small irritations on my scalp from becoming infected.  </li>
            <li>I love that there is big lather out of a little drop of shampoo, that the length of time my hair feels clean is much longer with this shampoo than with \\&quot;the other brand\\&quot;, and that my dandruff is actually very controlled and my scalp does not itch at all when using this brand.</li>
            <li>The shampoo got my hair clean but not much</li>
            <li>For years I could not find a shampoo that I liked the smell of because I&#x27;m ridiculously picky about these things.</li>
            <li>I do have to periodically use a medication as well, but very rarely now, and for a very short time before things are back under control.</li>
            <li>though it should be said that I don&#x27;t really have issues with dandruff in the first place, just a bit of dry scalp from time to time.</li>
            <li>This product controls my better than other options like Head &amp; Shoulders or Selsum Blue.  </li>
            <li>After only 3 uses, I put on my favorite black wool suit.</li>
            <li>If you want to keep your spending as low as possible, you&#x27;ll be just fine with a generic anti-dandruff shampoo from a drug store or grocery store.</li>
            <li>scalp does feel better and not as dry as with other shampoos in the market.</li>
            <li>good buy for half the price of other shampoos that deliver the same \\&quot;quality\\&quot; as this one.</li>
            <li>I will switch it up and get her the [[ASIN:B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo]] and hope that it works just as well.</li>
            <li>Made me appreciate my old shampoo.</li>
            <li>This works at least as well, and seems to work a bit better than my prescription shampoo.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not waste your money buying this item.</li>
            <li>So, it was a natural to try the Clear Anti-Dandruff Shampoo/Conditioner.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so fresh in comparison to other shampoos.</li>
            <li>It is a decent enough product, but the packaging promises Tea Tree oil.</li>
            <li>My hair tends to curl, especially in the rain-forest environment where I live.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo for several months.</li>
            <li>He is on his third bottle so far, and it is still working well.</li>
            <li>The difference in the feel of his beard hair was apparent.</li>
            <li>This bottle will probably end up going extra far for</li>
            <li>this case, unlike the other Clear Men&#x27;s product, this shampoo was way too thick and produced too many suds.  </li>
            <li>, I actually used this fo my dog because he broke out with some serious dandruff and was constantly scratching and itching after trying a mostly grain based dog food (Beneful).</li>
            <li>I will admit I the ginseng, mint and tea tree ingredients that are listed on this product made me a little nervous as did the \\&quot;pretty smell\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This Clear scalp therapy shampoo/condtioner has pyrithione zinc for dandruff control, ginseng, natural mint, tea tree, among other things.</li>
            <li>i payed this much money but half of it was split and could not use</li>
            <li>Any dry, flakey scalp completely disappeared after 4 days with this product.</li>
            <li>it actually moistureizes your head not dry it out like headand shoulders</li>
            <li>The only complaint I would have is that the bottle is top heavy and seems to want to always fall over, but other than that it does what it is suppose to at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>His scalp is now clear of all dry skin after using this regularly for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I only use about half as much as I would with head and shoulders.</li>
            <li>I do not have a lot of dandruff, but I frequently have a very dry, itchy scalp, that can develop eczema.</li>
            <li>After a couple of times trying this out, I realized that it seemed like the amount that I&#x27;m used to using was a little too much.</li>
            <li>Really wanted to like it, but after 5 consecutive uses I needed to admit that it was drying out my scalp (more of a pro-dandruff shampoo than my regular old-tech John Frieda stuff) and making my hair look thin and dull.  </li>

            <li> That means it&#x27;s still not quite as good in my experience as using a really good conditioner separately,</li>

            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> This 2 in 1 shampoo with conditioner is amazing at reducing dandruff.  </li>
            <li> Tried this and liked what it did but the smell of the product stayed in my hair all day.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner in one really works well and is probably the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I feel the combo really works best for me.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell, a nice consistency, and it seems to work well...</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a nice alternative to Head and Shoulders.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice scent and appeared to be effective as an antidandruff shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on the scalp love the smell of mint and the tingling feeling.</li>
            <li> Has a nice smell&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is fairly effective in cleaning my scalp, but I&#x27;m not a fan of it&#x27;s conditioning properties.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to Head and Shoulders, try this nice quality shampoo-conditioner combination.  </li>
            <li> good product... enjoy...</li>
            <li> Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> but my husband is quite satisfied with the mixture and the times I&#x27;ve stolen it for own use</li>
            <li> It was REALLY strong!</li>
            <li> I got it for my son and his dandruff seems better, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more effective than Head &amp; Shoulders</li>
            <li> My boyfriend liked it better than what he had been using and the smell was okay with him because it wasn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I notice more flakes than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product recommends that, but it&#x27;s better to wash every 2-3 days.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> It works great for my hair and really helps with the dandruff.</li>
            <li> My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better.</li>
            <li> I will purchase again &amp; again :)</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling softer &amp; flake free, downside is that my girlfriend now steals it because it makes her hair softer too!</li>
            <li> Most notably this shampoo/conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like an anti-dandruff product.</li>
            <li> have also tried it because it doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and was pleased.</li>
            <li> But this has a better scent and</li>
            <li> the lather is better if that matters to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I love the 2 in 1s because it saves time, energy, and money.</li>
            <li> It does not do anything to resolve my dandruff problem, instead, I have more flakes than ever</li>
            <li> it mostly cause it feels like it gets my hair &amp; scalp</li>
            <li> Price is okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found this to be the case with most 2-in-1s</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased as well.  </li>
            <li> and I thought it was okay.  </li>
            <li> Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> For me, the &amp;#34;Clean and refresh&amp;#34; 2 in 1 Anti-dandruff worked better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my husbands favorite shampoo</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and the bottle size is perfect to last you for months.</li>
            <li> I was NOT disappointed!</li>
            <li> He likes the mint version of the Clear men scalp therapy shampoo slightly better but is happy using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice, rich, silky smooth and creamy shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and so I switched to this and have seen some improvement as well as enjoy this product more.</li>
            <li> (He has a full, manly beard that is not quite ZZ Top, much more than Don Johnson.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the end I have had no coplaints and all things considered, the Clear Men Scalp Therapy product is great, we will be using it again.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it cleared up my dandruff&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is fairly strong, but does smell nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> I liked that it was also very good at reducing itching, which is particularly helpful for those like me with sensitive, itchy skin.  </li>
            <li> Easy lather.</li>
            <li> The cap does not come off easily either so</li>
            <li> Your natural oils are there for a reason, stripping them away does more harm than good.</li>
            <li> I also like that this shampoo does not carry a strong medicated odor to it.</li>
            <li> Shampoo also had a strong perfume that I didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> very cheap, it&#x27;s worthy in buying them.</li>
            <li> It was pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, the bottle was easy to grip in the shower but it was overly tall and didn&#x27;t fit easily into existing holders.</li>
            <li> It seems better and more pleasant to use than other products in its category, but it also costs more as well.</li>
            <li> I workout in the mornings and use this to wash my hair leaving me dandruff free through the day.</li>
            <li> I got it on Amazon for $3.73 and free shipping.  </li>
            <li> and this is the important part.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes your hair so shiny and smooth and it does moisturize the scalp and make the dryness go away.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo.</li>
            <li> They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far.</li>
            <li> As far as shampoo-and-conditioners-in-one products, this is a good one.</li>
            <li> Good for frequent use.</li>
            <li> The clear brand does a fair job, but I will just use up what I have &amp; use h&amp;s from now on.</li>
            <li> so do i. Good so far.</li>
            <li> It has a very neutral smell and lathers very easily.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair feel clean for days after using.</li>
            <li> clean.</li>
            <li> After using it, my scalp feels clean.</li>
            <li> Besides that, my girlfriend likes it and my hair stays nice and soft...</li>
            <li> and I agree it is much thicker than others and smells much better.  </li>
            <li> As wonderful as the product was, it&#x27;s also very affordable and much cheaper than the numerous inferior dandruff control shampoos out there.</li>
            <li> Not bad..</li>
            <li> The pretty smell is strong when I put it on my hair but when i am done I don&#x27;t notice it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent and leaves his normally coarse feeling hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This shampoo leaves my head fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This would probably be best suited for men with very short hair and/or women with thin-textured short hair.</li>
            <li> Quick product review...</li>
            <li> I went from having rather mild dandruff to looking like a snow globe when I ran my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> Pyrithione zinc works well for my husband&#x27;s mild dandruff, so it&#x27;s what we use.</li>
            <li> It has a very pleasant smell, hard to describe</li>
            <li> I highly enjoyed this shampoo and highly recommend it to all men who suffer from dandruff and/or an itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> 2 in 1 product, but overall, I enjoyed the thickness of the shampoo, the clean feel afterwards and the light aroma.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not too strong, and it cleared his little flaky head right up</li>
            <li> Much more silky and soft, not wiry and bristly.</li>
            <li> but I figured it was worth a</li>
            <li> try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased so far.</li>
            <li> far i am pleased with this.</li>
            <li> On top of all that, it leaves my hair soft and has virtually no fragrance.</li>
            <li> I also rarely use all in one shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it actually tingled a bit, which I liked.</li>
            <li> Of all the many products I have tried, including high end salon products costing more than twice as much, this is by far the best for keeping dryness and itch to a minimum, and that prevents things from getting worse.</li>
            <li> figured I would try this shampoo based on the reviews and see if it was as good as my other two shampoos.</li>
            <li> The day we used it, he was still scratching and flaking everywhere right before the bath.</li>
            <li> and it is clear that this shampoo is causing more dandruff because when I was using H&amp;S I never seen so much flakes!</li>
            <li> I generally get a softer, more manageable head of hair after using conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I think it is ok, but head &amp; shoulders men active sport works a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner, comes in a 12.9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily.</li>
            <li> The walmart brand did not help very much.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost a month and while it feels nice going on, I have actually noticed my scalp is more dry</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with dry scalp or dandruff, but I consider myself lucky because most everyone else in my household experiences it to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use conditioners and am not into shampoos that have \\&quot;pretty smells.\\</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m still using the first pack.</li>
            <li> This saves showering time and hot water.</li>
            <li> At first I thought It will get better but same thing happening.</li>
            <li> This particular one obviously is a bit more specialized and it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well for me as the more general</li>
            <li> It can be very drying, and using this his hair is soft, manageable and flake free.</li>
            <li> This shampoo used every alternate day in mild doses keeps me clean.</li>
            <li> His dandruff has pretty much disappeared, and his scalp does not itch like before either.</li>
            <li> Worked very well from the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> have finally found this stuff that smells good, doesn&#x27;t smell too much, and helps out with my dandruff big time.</li>
            <li> the whole, the scent is pleasant and mild, the shampoo and conditioner do their jobs very well, and the AntiDandruff ingredients they use are pretty much the standard stuff you&#x27;ll find in other products in the category.</li>
            <li> but obviously it&#x27;s a lot more convenient (particularly if you&#x27;re packing or a trip or planning to take a shower at the gym and don&#x27;t want to lug a bunch of bottles</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re happy to pay a few dollars more to smell a little better and have hair that&#x27;s slightly softer, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> happy too, his other favorite brand has grown increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have previously tried Nizral and other brands, but what makes this unique is that it also conditions the hair effectively to make it look light and</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the more famous brand of dandruff shampoo, but after trying several different versions of this brand, I have to conclude that this shampoo is equally if not more effect than the famous brand.</li>
            <li> The bottle is hard plastic and the shape does not lend itself well to getting a good squeeze on it.  </li>
            <li> So far this has been great, it is always hard to say if this has been the problem solver for dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been a real godsend for me.  </li>
            <li> very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really helps me take it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My family has tried most of them and have not really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> the whole, I like that</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to bother them with something really flowering.</li>
            <li> Product came fast without any problems.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in the end result.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would do the trick as the Scalp Therapy from Aveda is really pricey and we all use it.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel like much when you put it on and lather, no tingling feels but it does make dandruff go away</li>
            <li> I find that this shampoo really helped me reduce dandruff on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> My daughter of course didn&#x27;t care as much for the scent since it&#x27;s geared towards men, but her conditioner and hair products covered it up.</li>
            <li> shampoo/conditioner itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container.</li>
            <li> Hair looks good after use, and for me at least, the itching goes away.</li>
            <li> Using any other shampoo, even with medication, I did not get such a good result.</li>
            <li> It does not cause my scalp to itch like other shampoos which contain too many chemicals.</li>
            <li> He smelled great for days, his fur was SO shiny, soft and sleek and his dandruff decreased dramatically after the first bath with it.</li>
            <li> However, i&#x27;ve changed my shampoo to other better quality product.</li>
            <li> But if I couldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;Clean and refresh&amp;#34; version, this is still better than any other anti-dandruff shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> It seemed like either you had to smell like a junior high locker room with way too much axe; or you smelled like something girly and had to drink a lot beer to make up for it.  </li>
            <li> I thought that possibly, this shampoo might also help his scalp and boy, was I right!</li>
            <li> I am pretty old fashioned when it comes to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a mild to medium case of dandruff, but enough that could be an embarrassment should I not take care of it.</li>
            <li> Not only is this the first anti dandruff treatment that has ever worked for me, it&#x27;s also the first two in one product I approve of.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product for any man.</li>
            <li> This leaves the hair feeling very clean without that weird texture of many shampoo/conditioner combos AND anti-dandruff shampoos.  </li>
            <li> More severe cases may need more than a few uses, but you should see an improvement after the 1st use for slight cases.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell, and a product that does everything it claims without any weird residue in the hair.</li>
            <li> I initially got it because of the cheap price, but it actually works very well.</li>
            <li> I ended up ditching the Head and Shoulders shampoo I normally buy for this.</li>
            <li> My husband usually uses the generic version Head and Shoulders and thinks this is just as good.</li>
            <li> Of course while this was in our shower I found myself out of my normal shampoos</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been very picky in the past about shampoos, refusing to use a lot of brands and this is one of his two favorite brands.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have dandruff and always have flakes if I don&#x27;t use shampoo everyday.</li>
            <li> First issue: I&#x27;m noticing more than usual amount of hair fall!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think this is the right product for me, but it may be that others will notice a similar reaction.</li>
            <li> I have a very dry and easily irritated scalp, and this shampoo is one of my main weapons in keeping small irritations on my scalp from becoming infected.  </li>
            <li> I love that there is big lather out of a little drop of shampoo, that the length of time my hair feels clean is much longer with this shampoo than with \\&quot;the other brand\\&quot;, and that my dandruff is actually very controlled and my scalp does not itch at all when using this brand.</li>
            <li> The shampoo got my hair clean but not much</li>
            <li> For years I could not find a shampoo that I liked the smell of because I&#x27;m ridiculously picky about these things.</li>
            <li> I do have to periodically use a medication as well, but very rarely now, and for a very short time before things are back under control.</li>
            <li> though it should be said that I don&#x27;t really have issues with dandruff in the first place, just a bit of dry scalp from time to time.</li>
            <li> This product controls my better than other options like Head &amp; Shoulders or Selsum Blue.  </li>
            <li> After only 3 uses, I put on my favorite black wool suit.</li>
            <li> If you want to keep your spending as low as possible, you&#x27;ll be just fine with a generic anti-dandruff shampoo from a drug store or grocery store.</li>
            <li> scalp does feel better and not as dry as with other shampoos in the market.</li>
            <li> good buy for half the price of other shampoos that deliver the same \\&quot;quality\\&quot; as this one.</li>
            <li> I will switch it up and get her the [[ASIN:B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo]] and hope that it works just as well.</li>
            <li> Made me appreciate my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> This works at least as well, and seems to work a bit better than my prescription shampoo.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not waste your money buying this item.</li>
            <li> So, it was a natural to try the Clear Anti-Dandruff Shampoo/Conditioner.</li>
            <li> My hair feels so fresh in comparison to other shampoos.</li>
            <li> It is a decent enough product, but the packaging promises Tea Tree oil.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to curl, especially in the rain-forest environment where I live.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo for several months.</li>
            <li> He is on his third bottle so far, and it is still working well.</li>
            <li> The difference in the feel of his beard hair was apparent.</li>
            <li> This bottle will probably end up going extra far for</li>
            <li> this case, unlike the other Clear Men&#x27;s product, this shampoo was way too thick and produced too many suds.  </li>
            <li> , I actually used this fo my dog because he broke out with some serious dandruff and was constantly scratching and itching after trying a mostly grain based dog food (Beneful).</li>
            <li> I will admit I the ginseng, mint and tea tree ingredients that are listed on this product made me a little nervous as did the \\&quot;pretty smell\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This Clear scalp therapy shampoo/condtioner has pyrithione zinc for dandruff control, ginseng, natural mint, tea tree, among other things.</li>
            <li> i payed this much money but half of it was split and could not use</li>
            <li> Any dry, flakey scalp completely disappeared after 4 days with this product.</li>
            <li> it actually moistureizes your head not dry it out like headand shoulders</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have is that the bottle is top heavy and seems to want to always fall over, but other than that it does what it is suppose to at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> His scalp is now clear of all dry skin after using this regularly for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I only use about half as much as I would with head and shoulders.</li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of dandruff, but I frequently have a very dry, itchy scalp, that can develop eczema.</li>
            <li> After a couple of times trying this out, I realized that it seemed like the amount that I&#x27;m used to using was a little too much.</li>
            <li> Really wanted to like it, but after 5 consecutive uses I needed to admit that it was drying out my scalp (more of a pro-dandruff shampoo than my regular old-tech John Frieda stuff) and making my hair look thin and dull.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses you can tell that this does hydrate your scalp and it works almost as effectively as Head &amp; Shoulders, but being a shampoo &amp; conditioner in one, it leaves hair a little flat and heavy.</li>
            <li> one in particular works very well for winter months which are very hard on hair up here in Alaska.</li>
            <li> YMMV for the shipping with the other customers shipments but after 6 shipments for the last year, the shampoo has been taped shut with no mess.</li>
            <li> Even though the bottle can sit upside down in the shower letting gravity take the product to the bottom, it still does not come out really well when the bottle is mostly empty.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did no better and no worse than the 30 others that I have tried to remedy my scaly scalp.</li>
            <li> Any odor is not apparent to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick</li>
            <li> It took the itching away in pratically one use and when the dandruff is gone gone wash your hair with it every 5 days and they bottle would last you a very long time</li>
            <li> During the winter months, dry skin is a big issue</li>
            <li> As a woman with dry itchy scalp, I have tried various dandruff shampoos.</li>
            <li> daughter has issues with dry itchy scalp during the winter months, while my boyfriend has the same problem during the summer.  </li>
            <li> 3rd issue: my hair seems to get really dry and thinner)</li>
            <li> Few weeks ago I saw commercial on CLEAR</li>
            <li> There seem to be quite a few anti-dandruff products from Clear</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how long this bottle lasts me</li>
            <li> It did make my hair soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is no different than any other products on the market.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> Sadly, dry scalp did not leave when the hair did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for years for a shampoo that clears up the dreaded dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Our family has a lot of dry scalp.</li>
            <li> but it just didn&#x27;t help with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> the weather becomes dry.  </li>
            <li> Because it has the added conditioner it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some shampoos do</li>
            <li> (same active ingredient).</li>
            <li> only takes a small amount of product to get your hair washed, therefore the bottle will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s concentrated, so for a guy with average length hair you only need to use a dollop about the size of a quarter.</li>
            <li> However, my hair never felt dried or barely see any flakes when continue to use it.</li>
            <li> While I occasionally have problems with dandruff and dry scalp, I don&#x27;t typically use a anti-dandruff shampoo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s mixed in with other items and the lid breaks off the bottle soaking all my other ordered items in shampoo.</li>
            <li> Shampoo had popped open in delivery, so I received a gooey mess inside a plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> That makes it a little easier to handle than those on the days when my sinuses are being a little sensitive</li>
            <li> The only disadvantage that I&#x27;ve noticed is that it tends to make my roots a little oily.  </li>
            <li> I bought this on sale for a Subscribe and Save run a few months back and forgot I had it on order bimonthly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard before that adding conditioner to shampoo does not really work because the shampoo just washes it out.</li>
            <li> Once the bottle is three-fourths empty</li>
            <li> My scalp is a lot less dry now.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little apprehensive of shampoo/conditioners (yes, I know they&#x27;ve come a long way over the years)</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself has a heavy scent to it while you are applying it, but does not remain long after rinsing.  </li>
            <li> , I found that using Moroccan (tree) oil in my hair instead of other products helps maintain a dandruff-free scalp.</li>
            <li> If I can use this instead of my other two shampoos I will save money as well.</li>
            <li> have been using for the past several years.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure this is necessary.</li>
            <li> your going to be fighting it one way or the other when you get to the end, and that is just a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my hair sometimes 2-3 times in a 24 hour time interval due to my active lifestyle (gym, running, swimming, etc...) and can sometimes develop sensitive/dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> bottle is somewhat ergonomic and has a slight grip feel so it doesn&#x27;t slip from wet or soapy</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is apparently a new product without artificial lathering agents, introduced in Europe and now the subject of a marketing push to increase acceptance by us American lather addicts.  </li>
            <li> I can now wear dark colors!</li>
            <li> I still get a little dandruff</li>
            <li> Sadly, the dry scalp re-appeared after starting to use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have heavy scents like products for women often do.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t perform well for heavy dandruff.</li>
            <li> It is only slightly irritating if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> but I had to use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I usually apply a nickel size amount to my hair after washing with this product but while my hair is still damp.</li>
            <li> I usually use a store brand anti-dandruff shampoo with a shampoo that has coal tar in it to treat my dandruff.</li>
            <li> In addition to dandruff, I have a small patch of psoriasis on my scalp.</li>
            <li> But it does seem pricy, so I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.  </li>
            <li> The 12.9 ounce bottle seems equivalent to approximately 18 ounces of your typical brand name shampoo.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to squeeze the rest out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned how thick this shampoo is</li>
            <li> I have a horrible scalp dandruff issue and often resort to strong medicated stuff that clears dandruff but is very hard on the hair fiber.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Also, using shampoo every day is actually not good at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to H&amp;S again :(</li>
            <li> I had bad dry scalp leading to flaking.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind.</li>
            <li> I had really bad dandruff and it works for people of color because I&#x27;m black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if its skin or hair product that flakes off from my scalp, at its worst I could notice flakes when I wore black suits.</li>
            <li> What i needed but came split all over the box and bags really sad</li>
            <li> The shampoo has an expensive look and feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel weird on your scalp</li>
            <li> Also I would get a lot of dandruff in the cold season that would not go</li>
            <li> I suspect that it will not work as well on oily hair or on bad cases of dandruff.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I wish I could buy this not as an add-on item...but whatever, it&#x27;s a good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve been using H&amp;S for years, but decided to switch to see what else was out there and how it worked.  During the winter months, dry skin is a big issue and so I switched to this and have seen some improvement as well as enjoy this product more.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo. It does not cause my scalp to itch like other shampoos which contain too many chemicals. This shampoo leaves my head fresh and clean. It is easy to use and the bottle size is perfect to last you for months.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my boyfriend who was having problems with a lot of dandruff and an itchy scalp. I initially got it because of the cheap price, but it actually works very well. His dandruff has pretty much disappeared, and his scalp does not itch like before either. He is on his third bottle so far, and it is still working well. In addition, because this is a combined shampoo and conditioner his hair also feels nicer than before. So if you are looking for a budget friendly solution to dandruff then this is good stuff!</li>
            <li> What i needed but came split all over the box and bags really sad i payed this much money but half of it was split and could not use</li>
            <li> Great product. Any dry, flakey scalp completely disappeared after 4 days with this product. Pleasant smell. Easy lather.</li>
            <li> I have used this for almost a month and while it feels nice going on, I have actually noticed my scalp is more dry and I notice more flakes than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think this is the right product for me, but it may be that others will notice a similar reaction. Definitely not worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;I would go with Neutrogena T-Gel or T-Sal then use an intensive moisturizing conditioner as a follow-up and of course rinse well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, using shampoo every day is actually not good at all. This product recommends that, but it&#x27;s better to wash every 2-3 days. Your natural oils are there for a reason, stripping them away does more harm than good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does what it is suppose to, I did have a reduction in dandruff.  The shampoo itself has a heavy scent to it while you are applying it, but does not remain long after rinsing.  The only complaint I would have is that the bottle is top heavy and seems to want to always fall over, but other than that it does what it is suppose to at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve used the more famous brand of dandruff shampoo, but after trying several different versions of this brand, I have to conclude that this shampoo is equally if not more effect than the famous brand. I love that there is big lather out of a little drop of shampoo, that the length of time my hair feels clean is much longer with this shampoo than with \\&quot;the other brand\\&quot;, and that my dandruff is actually very controlled and my scalp does not itch at all when using this brand. I also like that this shampoo does not carry a strong medicated odor to it. I think I&#x27;m going to permanently switch to this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Whoa whoa whoa! Get your mind out of the gutter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband is... well... lacking in the hair department. After fighting the gradual expansion of his forehead, he shaved himself bald and moved on. Sadly, dry scalp did not leave when the hair did. I thought that possibly, this shampoo might also help his scalp and boy, was I right! His scalp is now clear of all dry skin after using this regularly for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus is that he washed his beard as well each time he did his head. The difference in the feel of his beard hair was apparent. Much more silky and soft, not wiry and bristly. (He has a full, manly beard that is not quite ZZ Top, much more than Don Johnson.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has had no complaints what so ever about this shampoo, from the scent to the outcome, its all good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked for years for a shampoo that clears up the dreaded dry scalp. I have psoriasis, which causes dandruff of the scalp. Since I&#x27;ve started using this (for about a year now) I have had zero flakes. Absolutely amazing. I can now wear dark colors! Hopefully they never discontinue this stuff.</li>
            <li> Tried this and liked what it did but the smell of the product stayed in my hair all day. It was REALLY strong! I won&#x27;t be using this again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has been a real godsend for me.  I have a very dry and easily irritated scalp, and this shampoo is one of my main weapons in keeping small irritations on my scalp from becoming infected.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I had bad dry scalp leading to flaking. The walmart brand did not help very much. I tried this, and it helped a lot. My scalp is a lot less dry now.</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner in one really works well and is probably the best I have ever used. It does not make hair feel greasy. It does make your hair feel clean for days after using. Highly recommended product for any man.</li>
            <li> smells so good great stocking stuffer or just because gift.</li>
            <li> Finally shampoo I like!</li>
            <li> This is a great product in controlling scalp itch. It also makes you&#x27;re hair very soft.&lt;br /&gt;It only takes a small amount of product to get your hair washed, therefore the bottle will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works well. Leave in for the recommended time and you should see results. I have a mild to medium case of dandruff, but enough that could be an embarrassment should I not take care of it. This really helps me take it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, I found that using Moroccan (tree) oil in my hair instead of other products helps maintain a dandruff-free scalp. I usually apply a nickel size amount to my hair after washing with this product but while my hair is still damp. I feel the combo really works best for me. My hair isn&#x27;t greasy looking, yet I can manage it.</li>
            <li> My hubs has wavy shiny hair but the driest scalp known to mankind,my hairstylist recommended this product,i will update with results later</li>
            <li> I bought this on sale for a Subscribe and Save run a few months back and forgot I had it on order bimonthly. I ended up ditching the Head and Shoulders shampoo I normally buy for this. It works great for my hair and really helps with the dandruff. I workout in the mornings and use this to wash my hair leaving me dandruff free through the day. Great product and shipping has been great. YMMV for the shipping with the other customers shipments but after 6 shipments for the last year, the shampoo has been taped shut with no mess. Try it out!</li>
            <li> I am pretty old fashioned when it comes to my hair. I usually use a store brand anti-dandruff shampoo with a shampoo that has coal tar in it to treat my dandruff. I don&#x27;t use conditioners and am not into shampoos that have \\&quot;pretty smells.\\&quot; In short I want to keep my dandruff under control and that is about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figured I would try this shampoo based on the reviews and see if it was as good as my other two shampoos. I will admit I the ginseng, mint and tea tree ingredients that are listed on this product made me a little nervous as did the \\&quot;pretty smell\\&quot; but I figured it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased so far. This seems to be keeping my dandruff under control without having to use a second product. The pretty smell is strong when I put it on my hair but when i am done I don&#x27;t notice it. A little of this product goes a long way. This is labled as a daily shampoo and I use it every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far i am pleased with this. If I can use this instead of my other two shampoos I will save money as well.</li>
            <li> This anti-dandruff shampoo contains Pyrithione Zinc (1.0%), which is the same anti-dandruff ingredient found in Head and Shoulders shampoos. Head and Shoulders is the shampoo my family (husband and sons) have been using for the past several years. They tried this line of anti-dandruff products and have had good results so far. My son says he prefers this line over Head and Shoulders because they smell better. They are lightly scented and I find that they are similar to the scent of the non anti-dandruff line we have tried from Clear.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard before that adding conditioner to shampoo does not really work because the shampoo just washes it out. There seem to be quite a few anti-dandruff products from Clear and I&#x27;m not sure this is necessary. My family has tried most of them and have not really noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> After a couple of times trying this out, I realized that it seemed like the amount that I&#x27;m used to using was a little too much. This bottle will probably end up going extra far for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I like that it doesn&#x27;t have heavy scents like products for women often do. That makes it a little easier to handle than those on the days when my sinuses are being a little sensitive and I don&#x27;t want to bother them with something really flowering. It works well as 2-in-1 products go. That means it&#x27;s still not quite as good in my experience as using a really good conditioner separately, but obviously it&#x27;s a lot more convenient (particularly if you&#x27;re packing or a trip or planning to take a shower at the gym and don&#x27;t want to lug a bunch of bottles around).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, the scent is pleasant and mild, the shampoo and conditioner do their jobs very well, and the AntiDandruff ingredients they use are pretty much the standard stuff you&#x27;ll find in other products in the category. It seems better and more pleasant to use than other products in its category, but it also costs more as well. If you want to keep your spending as low as possible, you&#x27;ll be just fine with a generic anti-dandruff shampoo from a drug store or grocery store. If you&#x27;re happy to pay a few dollars more to smell a little better and have hair that&#x27;s slightly softer, this is worth a try.</li>
            <li> This is apparently a new product without artificial lathering agents, introduced in Europe and now the subject of a marketing push to increase acceptance by us American lather addicts.  It sounded like a good story so I gave it a shot.  Shampoo had popped open in delivery, so I received a gooey mess inside a plastic bag.  Washed it off and used it the next day.  Really wanted to like it, but after 5 consecutive uses I needed to admit that it was drying out my scalp (more of a pro-dandruff shampoo than my regular old-tech John Frieda stuff) and making my hair look thin and dull.  Shampoo also had a strong perfume that I didn&#x27;t like.  Made me appreciate my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> This is a good product I&#x27;ve bought again.  Product came fast without any problems.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a great job hydrating your scalp.  I wash my hair sometimes 2-3 times in a 24 hour time interval due to my active lifestyle (gym, running, swimming, etc...) and can sometimes develop sensitive/dry scalp.  The only disadvantage that I&#x27;ve noticed is that it tends to make my roots a little oily.  This would probably be best suited for men with very short hair and/or women with thin-textured short hair.</li>
            <li> I like this line of shampoos.  This particular one obviously is a bit more specialized and it didn&#x27;t seem to work as well for me as the more general 2 in 1 product, but overall, I enjoyed the thickness of the shampoo, the clean feel afterwards and the light aroma.</li>
            <li> As far as shampoo-and-conditioners-in-one products, this is a good one. It has a nice smell, a nice consistency, and it seems to work well...though it should be said that I don&#x27;t really have issues with dandruff in the first place, just a bit of dry scalp from time to time. I do prefer the individual products (shampoo and conditioner), though, to the all-in-ones...hence the 4 star rating. If you like them combined, this product is great.</li>
            <li> Dandruff all gone.......I will purchase again &amp; again :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t perform well for heavy dandruff. I used the shampoo for a month , I coudn&#x27;t see any change in dandruff . My hair was shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> For years I could not find a shampoo that I liked the smell of because I&#x27;m ridiculously picky about these things. It seemed like either you had to smell like a junior high locker room with way too much axe; or you smelled like something girly and had to drink a lot beer to make up for it.  Also I would get a lot of dandruff in the cold season that would not go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have finally found this stuff that smells good, doesn&#x27;t smell too much, and helps out with my dandruff big time. I still get a little dandruff but I guess that&#x27;s part of living in Alaska... Besides that, my girlfriend likes it and my hair stays nice and soft... like a teddy bear. No complaints.</li>
            <li> This stuff works and smells really good. Lathers well. Good for frequent use. They give you a good amount too. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> It is a decent enough product, but the packaging promises Tea Tree oil. I did not detect any, and there was no tell tale feel of it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> smells great and works good</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling softer &amp; flake free, downside is that my girlfriend now steals it because it makes her hair softer too!</li>
            <li> Most notably this shampoo/conditioner doesn&#x27;t smell like an anti-dandruff product. I got it for my son and his dandruff seems better, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s any more effective than Head &amp; Shoulders (same active ingredient). It is nice that it has conditioner in it, too, so it&#x27;s best for hair that isn&#x27;t oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried it because it doesn&#x27;t smell \\&quot;manly\\&quot; and was pleased. I suspect that it will not work as well on oily hair or on bad cases of dandruff.</li>
            <li> In addition to dandruff, I have a small patch of psoriasis on my scalp. I&#x27;ve used prescription shampoo for it, which seems to help a bit, but does not eliminate it. This works at least as well, and seems to work a bit better than my prescription shampoo. It&#x27;s concentrated, so for a guy with average length hair you only need to use a dollop about the size of a quarter. The 12.9 ounce bottle seems equivalent to approximately 18 ounces of your typical brand name shampoo. No perfume that I can smell--not that I have the best smeller. Hair looks good after use, and for me at least, the itching goes away.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It has a pleasent sent. It&#x27;s pretty thick so I only use about half as much as I would with head and shoulders. But it does seem pricy, so I&#x27;m not sure I would buy it again.  I got it on Amazon for $3.73 and free shipping.  It was on sale, I used a $1.00 coupon and used subscribe and save.  I&#x27;ll see how long this bottle lasts me then I&#x27;ll decide if I want to cancell the subscription.</li>
            <li> The shampoo has an expensive look and feel to it.  The results are actually comparable to head and shoulders though when all is said and done.  I didn&#x27;t notice any real difference in the end result.  But this has a better scent and the lather is better if that matters to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What annoys me about this product is the packaging.  Once the bottle is three-fourths empty it&#x27;s hard to squeeze the rest out.  The bottle is hard plastic and the shape does not lend itself well to getting a good squeeze on it.  Even though the bottle can sit upside down in the shower letting gravity take the product to the bottom, it still does not come out really well when the bottle is mostly empty. The cap does not come off easily either so your going to be fighting it one way or the other when you get to the end, and that is just a pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is why I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 - The packaging was just not well thought out.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo.  My hair feels so fresh in comparison to other shampoos.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a nice alternative to Head and Shoulders.  It has a nice scent and appeared to be effective as an antidandruff shampoo.  I love the 2 in 1s because it saves time, energy, and money.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is no different than any other products on the market. It does not do anything to resolve my dandruff problem, instead, I have more flakes than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money buying this item.</li>
            <li> This Clear scalp therapy shampoo/condtioner has pyrithione zinc for dandruff control, ginseng, natural mint, tea tree, among other things. It feels good on the scalp love the smell of mint and the tingling feeling. In the end I have had no coplaints and all things considered, the Clear Men Scalp Therapy product is great, we will be using it again. Definetly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this just to try it out. I think it is ok, but head &amp; shoulders men active sport works a whole lot better. I use (h&amp;s) it mostly cause it feels like it gets my hair &amp; scalp clean. The clear brand does a fair job, but I will just use up what I have &amp; use h&amp;s from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the best. I work in television, on air 5 days a week. I&#x27;m not sure if its skin or hair product that flakes off from my scalp, at its worst I could notice flakes when I wore black suits. Won&#x27;t use anything else to take care of it. Great product.</li>
            <li> Quick product review...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Has a nice smell&lt;br /&gt;2. Doesn&#x27;t feel weird on your scalp&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue&lt;br /&gt;4. Price is okay (we&#x27;re not at Walmart people)&lt;br /&gt;5. Most importantly, it cleared up my dandruff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;five stars... good product... enjoy...</li>
            <li> After a few uses you can tell that this does hydrate your scalp and it works almost as effectively as Head &amp; Shoulders, but being a shampoo &amp; conditioner in one, it leaves hair a little flat and heavy. I&#x27;ve found this to be the case with most 2-in-1s and this is no acception. The scent is great and the price is competetive.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but not too strong, and it cleared his little flaky head right up lol! Glad he doesnt read this  lol</li>
            <li> Our family has a lot of dry scalp. I was hoping this would do the trick as the Scalp Therapy from Aveda is really pricey and we all use it. Sadly, the dry scalp re-appeared after starting to use this shampoo. Once we used the Scalp Therapy again, it went away. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it did cleanse the hair but it just didn&#x27;t help with dry scalp.</li>
            <li> This shampoo did no better and no worse than the 30 others that I have tried to remedy my scaly scalp. It did make my hair soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several months now. I do not have a lot of dandruff, but I frequently have a very dry, itchy scalp, that can develop eczema. Of all the many products I have tried, including high end salon products costing more than twice as much, this is by far the best for keeping dryness and itch to a minimum, and that prevents things from getting worse. I do have to periodically use a medication as well, but very rarely now, and for a very short time before things are back under control. Using any other shampoo, even with medication, I did not get such a good result. On top of all that, it leaves my hair soft and has virtually no fragrance. This has been a really good find for me.</li>
            <li> I have to use a dandruff controlling shampoo anything the weather becomes dry.  This product controls my better than other options like Head &amp; Shoulders or Selsum Blue.  However it does take longer to work than Neutrogena T-Gel shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have mentioned how thick this shampoo is and I agree it is much thicker than others and smells much better.  It doesn&#x27;t feel like much when you put it on and lather, no tingling feels but it does make dandruff go away and this is the important part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I&#x27;ve found is that I still need to use a conditioner to avoid the frizzy hair look.  I&#x27;m a guy guy with short and curly hair, and if I don&#x27;t condition well it just goes everywhere.  This might not be a problem for others.</li>
            <li> While I occasionally have problems with dandruff and dry scalp, I don&#x27;t typically use a anti-dandruff shampoo. I also rarely use all in one shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this case, unlike the other Clear Men&#x27;s product, this shampoo was way too thick and produced too many suds.  I didn&#x27;t notice any conditioning benefits from the product.  I generally get a softer, more manageable head of hair after using conditioner.  The shampoo got my hair clean but not much more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the bottle was easy to grip in the shower but it was overly tall and didn&#x27;t fit easily into existing holders.</li>
            <li> So far this has been great, it is always hard to say if this has been the problem solver for dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice, rich, silky smooth and creamy shampoo and conditioner. A small amount goes a long way. It has a very pleasant smell, hard to describe but i guess \\&quot;clean\\&quot; sums it up.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is somewhat ergonomic and has a slight grip feel so it doesn&#x27;t slip from wet or soapy hands.&lt;br /&gt;The closure method leaves some residual shampoo on the edge of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;My scalp does feel better and not as dry as with other shampoos in the market. I guess it returns some amount of moisture to my scalp even if its temporarily short lived in 100+ degree weather.&lt;br /&gt;A good buy for half the price of other shampoos that deliver the same \\&quot;quality\\&quot; as this one.</li>
            <li> This 2in1 shampoo &amp; conditioner works surprisingly well. It makes your hair so shiny and smooth and it does moisturize the scalp and make the dryness go away. It makes the itch go away as well. More severe cases may need more than a few uses, but you should see an improvement after the 1st use for slight cases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is fairly strong, but does smell nice and fresh. It lathers well and rinses well. It doesn&#x27;t leave any residue behind. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair feel greasy or way. You hair will look and feel healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an additional bonus, I actually used this fo my dog because he broke out with some serious dandruff and was constantly scratching and itching after trying a mostly grain based dog food (Beneful). I had read that Head and Shoulders works for pets, so I figured i&#x27;d give this one a try since we had it on hand. It did an amazing job! He smelled great for days, his fur was SO shiny, soft and sleek and his dandruff decreased dramatically after the first bath with it. He stopped scratching and itching too. It was pretty amazing. I will remember to use this again if we ever have any skin issue with him. He had been scratching and flaking with dandruff for about 4 days. The day we used it, he was still scratching and flaking everywhere right before the bath. Immediately after the bath it was such a drastic change for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended for human and pet use!</li>
            <li> My husband usually uses the generic version Head and Shoulders and thinks this is just as good. It has a nice light scent and leaves his normally coarse feeling hair nice and soft. He has no problems with dandruff when usuing this shampoo. The only drawback for me is the price, I think we will stick with the generic unless this is on sale and we have a coupon.</li>
            <li> As a woman with dry itchy scalp, I have tried various dandruff shampoos. Tried this brand on a lark because it was&lt;br /&gt;on sale at Meijer. Worked very well from the first time I used it. I bought a shampoo/conditioner combo and a shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Alternate between the two. Very happy so far.</li>
            <li> ive been on this shampoo for a week not and its helped out alot it actually moistureizes your head not dry it out like headand shoulders</li>
            <li> Not bad.. i&#x27;m still using the first pack. I have given another one to my roommate. He is happy to use it so do i. Good so far. However, i&#x27;ve changed my shampoo to other better quality product.</li>
            <li> This product is fairly effective in cleaning my scalp, but I&#x27;m not a fan of it&#x27;s conditioning properties.  I still have to add additional conditioner for my hair to remain manageable.  Great scent.</li>
            <li> I find that this shampoo really helped me reduce dandruff on my scalp.  I have previously tried Nizral and other brands, but what makes this unique is that it also conditions the hair effectively to make it look light and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though the manufacturer says, It is not recommended to use this shampoo daily, use it once a week/twice a week.  Remember that dandruff cannot be cured, it can only be maintained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little apprehensive of shampoo/conditioners (yes, I know they&#x27;ve come a long way over the years) but my husband is quite satisfied with the mixture and the times I&#x27;ve stolen it for own use I&#x27;ve been pleased as well.  This leaves the hair feeling very clean without that weird texture of many shampoo/conditioner combos AND anti-dandruff shampoos.  Nice clean smell, and a product that does everything it claims without any weird residue in the hair.</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with dry scalp or dandruff, but I consider myself lucky because most everyone else in my household experiences it to some degree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has issues with dry itchy scalp during the winter months, while my boyfriend has the same problem during the summer.  Both gave this shampoo a try for over a week each and both saw improvement.  My daughter of course didn&#x27;t care as much for the scent since it&#x27;s geared towards men, but her conditioner and hair products covered it up. My boyfriend liked it better than what he had been using and the smell was okay with him because it wasn&#x27;t overpowering. Of course while this was in our shower I found myself out of my normal shampoos so I gave it a try and I thought it was okay.  Because it has the added conditioner it didn&#x27;t dry out my hair like some shampoos do and it actually tingled a bit, which I liked. I would have no problem using this as a regular shampoo, but I would like a different scent for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;ve been asked to buy this in the future to replace another name brand that we had always bought, of course for my daughter I will switch it up and get her the [[ASIN:B007JT7AIK CLEAR SCALP &amp; HAIR BEAUTY THERAPY Anti-Dandruff Shampoo]] and hope that it works just as well.</li>
            <li> I went from having rather mild dandruff to looking like a snow globe when I ran my fingers through my hair. In my opinion, this is a piece of turd.</li>
            <li> Pyrithione zinc works well for my husband&#x27;s mild dandruff, so it&#x27;s what we use. He&#x27;s been very picky in the past about shampoos, refusing to use a lot of brands and this is one of his two favorite brands. It&#x27;s affordable, works well, smells good and it&#x27;s no fuss as a two in one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one in particular works very well for winter months which are very hard on hair up here in Alaska. It can be very drying, and using this his hair is soft, manageable and flake free. He likes the mint version of the Clear men scalp therapy shampoo slightly better but is happy using this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy too, his other favorite brand has grown increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> Fantastic shampoo. I have a horrible scalp dandruff issue and often resort to strong medicated stuff that clears dandruff but is very hard on the hair fiber. This shampoo used every alternate day in mild doses keeps me clean. Good delivery from Amazon. Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li> very cheap, it&#x27;s worthy in buying them. i bought three packs at one time. this is a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. For me, the &amp;#34;Clean and refresh&amp;#34; 2 in 1 Anti-dandruff worked better. But if I couldn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;Clean and refresh&amp;#34; version, this is still better than any other anti-dandruff shampoo out there.</li>
            <li> I went out on a limb with this product. After only 3 uses, I put on my favorite black wool suit. This suit collects anything. If my neighbor had any flakes, you&#x27;d see them on here. I was NOT disappointed! Not only is this the first anti dandruff treatment that has ever worked for me, it&#x27;s also the first two in one product I approve of. This stuff works! My years of searching are over. Please keep this on the market!</li>
            <li> I had really bad dandruff and it works for people of color because I&#x27;m black. It took the itching away in pratically one use and when the dandruff is gone gone wash your hair with it every 5 days and they bottle would last you a very long time</li>
            <li> I have been using the Clear Men Scalp Therapy Anti-Dandruff Shampoo for several months. So, it was a natural to try the Clear Anti-Dandruff Shampoo/Conditioner. The shampoo/conditioner, comes in a 12.9 ounce bottle with convenient flat ends on both top and bottom, which means that when the bottle starts to empty, it can be stored on its top in order to get the remaining contents out easily. The ingredients include: ginseng, mint, and tea tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo/conditioner itself is a milky cream which emerges readily from the container. It is not oily or greasy and appears not to leave residues. Any odor is not apparent to me. After using it, my scalp feels clean. My hair tends to curl, especially in the rain-forest environment where I live. However, this shampoo/conditioner seems to flatten my curls. You may or may not like that effect. It is only slightly irritating if you get it in your eyes. Maybe this is caused by the mint. The big advantage is that instead of using a separate shampoo and a separate conditioner, you can do everything on one step. This saves showering time and hot water. Altogether, I like this shampoo/conditioner and plan to continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Every time I order this product it&#x27;s mixed in with other items and the lid breaks off the bottle soaking all my other ordered items in shampoo. It&#x27;s my husbands favorite shampoo so I guess I&#x27;ll be buying elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Ok so I have dandruff and always have flakes if I don&#x27;t use shampoo everyday. For my problem H&amp;S worked best for me but I had to use it everyday. However, my hair never felt dried or barely see any flakes when continue to use it. Few weeks ago I saw commercial on CLEAR (Yes I fell for the shiny bottle lol) Anyways I ordered it here and started using it for couple of weeks. First issue: I&#x27;m noticing more than usual amount of hair fall! 2nd issue: I see flakes! and it is clear that this shampoo is causing more dandruff because when I was using H&amp;S I never seen so much flakes! 3rd issue: my hair seems to get really dry and thinner) At first I thought It will get better but same thing happening. I&#x27;m going back to H&amp;S again :(</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an alternative to Head and Shoulders, try this nice quality shampoo-conditioner combination.  It has a nicer scent that&#x27;s not overpowering like some shampoos.  I&#x27;ve tried it side by side with Head and Shoulders and it works just as well in fighting dandruff--it&#x27;s just a little more expensive.</li>
            <li> This 2 in 1 shampoo with conditioner is amazing at reducing dandruff.  I liked that it was also very good at reducing itching, which is particularly helpful for those like me with sensitive, itchy skin.  It has a very neutral smell and lathers very easily. As wonderful as the product was, it&#x27;s also very affordable and much cheaper than the numerous inferior dandruff control shampoos out there. I highly enjoyed this shampoo and highly recommend it to all men who suffer from dandruff and/or an itchy scalp.</li>
