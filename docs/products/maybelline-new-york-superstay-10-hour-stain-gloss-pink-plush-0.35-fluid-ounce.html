            <li>I would have been happy with 5 hrs.</li>
            <li>Really great, long-lasting color.</li>
            <li>It is fairly neutral and not too bright.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
            <li>good on your lips.  </li>
            <li>great product and better than pricier brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this lip stain for a couple weeks now, and it goes on smooth, has a pleasant odor/taste, and looks great.  </li>
            <li>I love love love love love love love love love love these!</li>
            <li>Super pigmented, great staying power and ultra cheap.  </li>
            <li>I love all of Maybelline product  </li>
            <li>I love the color of this lipstick.  </li>
            <li>stays moist for hours, no waxy feel and easy application wand love it</li>
            <li>I was so glad to find my favorite colors online, as this product is no longer available in the stores.  </li>
            <li>other than that it was a nice color and had a very nice scent to it.</li>
            <li>I love how this looks and feels when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>After about 45 minutes the glossy look is gone and I am left with just the color which still looks good.</li>
            <li>This is a unique product  -- a nice sheen and long-lasting stain that never feels dry.  </li>
            <li>I like this stain, fast shipping, and excited to keep using it.</li>
            <li>This product is nice and the color is pretty, but it does NOT last 10 hours.</li>
            <li>to me it last longer --i order three more of this</li>
            <li>the most it last on for me was 2-3 hours.</li>
            <li>This lip gloss had no stopper at the top - a feature that is so necessary for any lip gloss!</li>
            <li>Love it - ordered several before they run out, for myself and sisters.</li>
            <li>Lasts pretty well on lips if you layer it on.  </li>
            <li>but when i used this as a lip liner and mix this with my favorite lipstick, not only it make a new color but</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last the full 10 hours</li>
            <li>but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying.</li>
            <li>A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other kind I use.  </li>
            <li>Overall I really like this and use it frequently.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why they seem to be going away and pray that they are just going to re-package and bring them back.  </li>
            <li>This color is lovely and does stain the lips but only lasts maybe a few hours before another application is needed.</li>
            <li>A really pretty light/medium pink.  </li>
            <li>I would change it to have a little more pigment if possible so less layering is needed though (for faster application).  </li>
            <li>This particular color was too orange for me - I was expecting pink</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This particular color was too orange for me - I was expecting pink</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and not sticky like other long lasting glosses I have tried.</li>
            <li> When you unscrew the top globs of lip gloss are completely covering the applicator, making it impossible to apply the gloss.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t timed how long it stays on but</li>
            <li> not cake or flake or dry your lips.</li>
            <li> I ues this as a lip liner -- I agree with Ms. Regina - that this make my lips dry --</li>
            <li> Does not last long as expected the taste is a little off as well.  </li>
            <li> It is vibrant but not bright.  </li>
            <li> I like the Pink Plush color.  </li>
            <li> Not pretty.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better than usual, but I hate reapplying, so if you&#x27;re only looking to be covered half the day, this is what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> but it goes on flat and looks dull.</li>
            <li> Typically, it&#x27;s gone within about three hours.</li>
            <li> I had to throw it away because it was so messy.</li>
            <li> but this is a major fail.</li>
            <li> It does have an odd smell but not in a bad way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of reapplying all day, so I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t last longer. :(</li>
            <li> Flat boring color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m quite disappointed.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Very goopy and messy. DId not like.</li>
            <li> I  fell for the 10 hr. claim. I applied it after dinner and watched tv &amp; read. No food, no drink, no kissing after 2 hrs. no stain. I would have been happy with 5 hrs. but this is a major fail.</li>
            <li> I love love love love love love love love love love these! Super pigmented, great staying power and ultra cheap.  What else could you ask for from a lip product.</li>
            <li> Such a shame these are getting discontinued!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not cake or flake or dry your lips. A really light weight gloss, not even a little sticky that lasts quite some time. Definnitely not 10 hours... but for such a blissful stain gloss, its worth reapplying. It tastes pleasant, too!!</li>
            <li> I ues this as a lip liner -- I agree with Ms. Regina - that this make my lips dry -- but when i used this as a lip liner and mix this with my favorite lipstick, not only it make a new color but to me it last longer --i order three more of this but as a lipliner -- try it and see if you like what i did&lt;br /&gt;Reena</li>
            <li> Flat boring color. It&#x27;s supposed to be gloss but it goes on flat and looks dull. This particular color was too orange for me - I was expecting pink but it has an orange color to it. Not pretty.</li>
            <li> I love all of Maybelline product  but this does not last for 10 hours, the most it last on for me was 2-3 hours. other than that it was a nice color and had a very nice scent to it.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find my favorite colors online, as this product is no longer available in the stores.  This is a unique product  -- a nice sheen and long-lasting stain that never feels dry.  I really don&#x27;t understand why they seem to be going away and pray that they are just going to re-package and bring them back.  I have not found anything at any price, even in the high-end department stores, that compares.  I like the Pink Plush color.  It is fairly neutral and not too bright.</li>
            <li> This product is nice and the color is pretty, but it does NOT last 10 hours. I&#x27;d give it 2 hours tops. I&#x27;m not a fan of reapplying all day, so I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t last longer. :(</li>
            <li> This lip gloss had no stopper at the top - a feature that is so necessary for any lip gloss! I had to throw it away because it was so messy. When you unscrew the top globs of lip gloss are completely covering the applicator, making it impossible to apply the gloss. I&#x27;m quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> This color is lovely and does stain the lips but only lasts maybe a few hours before another application is needed. Does not bleed at all but is a bit watery. For the money it is great and if you don&#x27;t mind a lot of reapplication it will work!</li>
            <li> I like this stain, fast shipping, and excited to keep using it. It does have an odd smell but not in a bad way. I think it&#x27;s just from the stain.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and not sticky like other long lasting glosses I have tried. It didn&#x27;t last the full 10 hours but it&#x27;s still a good product. Lots of color choices.</li>
            <li> Love it - ordered several before they run out, for myself and sisters.</li>
            <li> I love how this looks and feels when I first put it on. After about 45 minutes the glossy look is gone and I am left with just the color which still looks good. After about 3 or 4 hours there is just a hint of color left. Doesn&#x27;t last 10 hours for me .</li>
            <li> Even prepping my lip (exfoliating) I can&#x27;t seem to get it to stay on longer than 4 hours. It&#x27;s better than usual, but I hate reapplying, so if you&#x27;re only looking to be covered half the day, this is what you&#x27;re looking for!</li>
            <li> It does not have a duration of 10 hours. I used and in 3 hours I was without gloss.</li>
            <li> I love the color of this lipstick.  It is vibrant but not bright.  It&lt;br /&gt;feel good on your lips.  I haven&#x27;t timed how long it stays on but&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this lipstick.</li>
            <li> Really great, long-lasting color. Can&#x27;t find this in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lip stain for a couple weeks now, and it goes on smooth, has a pleasant odor/taste, and looks great.  It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the other kind I use.  Typically, it&#x27;s gone within about three hours.</li>
            <li> Does not last long as expected the taste is a little off as well.  Guess that is why they are no longer making them,  I use them over anohter produce that does stay on for a moist look</li>
            <li> A really pretty light/medium pink.  Lasts pretty well on lips if you layer it on.  I would change it to have a little more pigment if possible so less layering is needed though (for faster application).  Overall I really like this and use it frequently.</li>
            <li> great product and better than pricier brands. stays moist for hours, no waxy feel and easy application wand love it</li>
            <li> Never buying again. I bought 2-3 different shade but they looked the same.</li>
