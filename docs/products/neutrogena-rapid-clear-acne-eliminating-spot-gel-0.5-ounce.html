    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product.</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy :</li>
            <li>Love it!!</li>
            <li>so it should be good.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product after reading some good things on the internet</li>
            <li>within days this product worked amazing on the breakout area.  </li>
            <li>Dries up zits that are visible but also effectively works on the stealth zit that you can feel forming under your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products and Neutrogena worked, which was surprising to me.</li>
            <li>So glad it worked for me.  </li>
            <li>Like most people, I tend to break out more during my period and if I eat a lot of junk food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and i love ot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get many pimples anymore</li>
            <li>Since I received the product I had one pimple that I was able to use the product on.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>this product is okay,</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product.</li>
            <li>recommend this product to everyone who misses there acne free skin.</li>
            <li>For five months I&#x27;ve not managed to go more than two days without a fresh breakout of pimples and nothing has helped; they&#x27;ve taken forever to go away whether I treat them or not, and as soon as they begin to disappear new ones take their place.  </li>
            <li>This works okay, but is far too overpriced for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>I lucked out the first time around and never had pimples when I was a teenager</li>
            <li>really well!</li>
            <li>only thing that I can say is that it has a pleasant odor (for those who don&#x27;t mind the smell of salicylic acid), and it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin at all.</li>
            <li>Really works to eliminate breakouts in two days.  </li>
            <li>and instead it made my whole forehead break out.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really get blemishes anymore</li>
            <li>Before I get into this product review, let me first say that I am a teenager with mild- acne--usually two to four noticable pustules or papules on my face at once (maybe more inflamed ones every few weeks) and tiny, unnoticeable-unless-close-to-the-mirror whiteheads all over my forehead.</li>
            <li>When you put it on, you feel a cool, tingly sensation, as if it&#x27;s actually working.</li>
            <li>However, with skin care products, much depends on the type of skin you have, and mine is oily and acne-prone, so this might work for those with normal skin, or with occasional, mild breakouts.</li>
            <li>Seems like there&#x27;s more bad than good effect.</li>
            <li>Costs less than most brands.  </li>
            <li>So never ever will I put this stuff on my entire face again, only spot treating, until I run out of it and buy a better product.</li>
            <li>Put it on at night and woke up the next day to see that 80 percent of my acne was gone definitely worth</li>
            <li>I understand certain products will work differently for everyone, this one just happened to not work at all for me.</li>
            <li>and I swear under oath that my face was completely clear within 36 hours.  </li>
            <li>Thank god for \\&quot;Neutrogena rapid clear acne eliminating spot gel, SALICYLIC ACID acne</li>
            <li>the side I used the rapid clear on cleared up clear up.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t do without my rapid clear, I&#x27;ve found clear skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The gel is clear.</li>
            <li>Does it help clear spots?</li>
            <li>It is helping my skin clear up.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to almost everything.</li>
            <li>I purchased it before a big event because this product is advertised as a fast spot treatment.</li>
            <li>As someone with acne problem, I have been trying different products over the years and this one seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>fact that this acne spot gel is called \\&quot;rapid clear\\&quot; completely baffles me.</li>
            <li>I hope you guys know that putting so much alcohol on your skin only aggravates your acne and oil over production, as your skin gets stressed out, not even talking about the aging effect...</li>
            <li>In addition my skin became extremely red and ugly looking, lost its natural luster and beautiful tone after just a couple of days of use...</li>
            <li>and I swear, nearly gone the next day.  </li>
            <li>It works really well for preventing breakouts, but you need enough to cover your whole face &amp; the tube is so small that it&#x27;s not worth it to be spending so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those lucky women suddenly breaking out in my late thirties.  </li>

            <li> The bottle even claims to reduce redness, but did the opposite and increased redness and made it look like I was a burn victim.</li>

            <li> But besides that, I don&#x27;t understand how this helps clear acne, over a few days OR overnight.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and doesn&#x27;t irritate it either.</li>
            <li> I never new</li>
            <li> I spent thousands of $ @ the Dr. and on meds.</li>
            <li> I got tired of spending so much money on prescription drugs</li>
            <li> its just like any other  neutrogena acne product just use it  as you need it or every skin type is differant</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect overnight miracle - the pimple won&#x27;t disappear entirely but its size will be reduced at least 50%.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried a couple others including doctor miracle acne system well for one because I am black and he specialize in black women products, nope didn&#x27;t work either</li>
            <li> The bottle is small, but only a small amount of the product is needed.</li>
            <li> I was allergic to Bp &#x27;til I went crazy and decided to use a product (oxy spot treatment) on one side of my face and my new found miracle on the other side and</li>
            <li> The only complaint is that the gel flakes and rubs off into weird little ribbons if you put moisturizer or makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I use this on breakouts in small confined area.  </li>
            <li> I follow the directions and apply it after cleansing my face, usually before bed and throughout the day, but still see no reduction in size at all.  </li>
            <li> It did not magically make the pimple go away.</li>
            <li> At that moment I was greatful that I was stupid enough to do what I did ( use two different product at once.)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Desperate, I picked up some of this at the local drug store</li>
            <li> So, looking at the negative reviews guess it just doesn&#x27;t work on some skin types.  </li>
            <li> but it was after that I found out that my problem with all those products was the one thing they all have in common (benzoyl peroxide)I was allergic.</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s helpful, but not exceptional.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a really bad breakout on my back and</li>
            <li> On my forehead it made my skin worse, broken out like a rash.</li>
            <li> When you apply it, you might get a cold tingling feeling for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried rubbing it in, putting on a thin layer, and just globbing it</li>
            <li> BECAUSE ALMOST HALF OF IT IS ALCOHOL!!!!</li>
            <li> nothing worked everything irritated my skin, so my dermatologist told me about accutane which was rather expensive and have a lot of side effects.</li>
            <li> was one such product I tried which failed miserably, so</li>
            <li> Anways its expensive</li>
            <li> Non irritating my butt!!!</li>
            <li> Hence anything that has it in would make me look worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent product. Dries up zits that are visible but also effectively works on the stealth zit that you can feel forming under your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those lucky women suddenly breaking out in my late thirties.  For five months I&#x27;ve not managed to go more than two days without a fresh breakout of pimples and nothing has helped; they&#x27;ve taken forever to go away whether I treat them or not, and as soon as they begin to disappear new ones take their place.  Desperate, I picked up some of this at the local drug store and I swear under oath that my face was completely clear within 36 hours.  I almost couldn&#x27;t believe it!  After eight hours the pimples had noticeably begun to fade and from there they vanished altogether.  I lucked out the first time around and never had pimples when I was a teenager but I&#x27;m making up for it now and I just wanted to share my experience with this gel for others seeking relief.  I won&#x27;t be leaving the house without this stuff.</li>
            <li> Really works to eliminate breakouts in two days.  Costs less than most brands.  Best product I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!</li>
            <li> Pros-&lt;br /&gt;Goes on clear&lt;br /&gt;Clean scent&lt;br /&gt;Works well at prevention&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons-&lt;br /&gt;The bottle gushes out the serum if squeezed to hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that it only helps with the redness of the blemish but doesn&#x27;t affect size \\&quot;rapidly\\&quot; but after the course of 2 to 3 days it does prevent growth and help the blemish shrink.</li>
            <li> Tried this, figured it was from a well known skin treatment brand so it should be good. On my forehead it made my skin worse, broken out like a rash. I have oily skin but only used it to treat a single pimple and instead it made my whole forehead break out. I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Don&#x27;t really get blemishes anymore (thank gawd) but razor burns issues &amp;#34;pop&amp;#34; up now and then.  A little dab of Rapid Clear and I swear, nearly gone the next day.  No, I don&#x27;t work for Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Love it!! 5 stars*****</li>
            <li> I use this on breakouts in small confined area.  It has a tingling sensation when applied but it does the trick for me.  I&#x27;ve had a really bad breakout on my back and within days this product worked amazing on the breakout area.  So, looking at the negative reviews guess it just doesn&#x27;t work on some skin types.  So glad it worked for me.  I will be purchasing in the future.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and am allergic to almost everything. I never had acne problems until a couple of years ago about &#x27;2008&#x27; I started having breakouts. I spent thousands of $ @ the Dr. and on meds. nothing worked everything irritated my skin, so my dermatologist told me about accutane which was rather expensive and have a lot of side effects. I got tired of spending so much money on prescription drugs so I started trying over the counter products of course the &#x27;the all talked about proactive&#x27; was one such product I tried which failed miserably, so I tried a couple others including doctor miracle acne system well for one because I am black and he specialize in black women products, nope didn&#x27;t work either but it was after that I found out that my problem with all those products was the one thing they all have in common (benzoyl peroxide)I was allergic. Hence anything that has it in would make me look worst. Thank god for \\&quot;Neutrogena rapid clear acne eliminating spot gel, SALICYLIC ACID acne treatment.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;P.S I never new I was allergic to Bp &#x27;til I went crazy and decided to use a product (oxy spot treatment) on one side of my face and my new found miracle on the other side and in literally 2-3 days the result was obvious the side I used the Oxy spot treatment on broke out and the side I used the rapid clear on cleared up clear up. At that moment I was greatful that I was stupid enough to do what I did ( use two different product at once.)&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t do without my rapid clear, I&#x27;ve found clear skin. I&#x27;m happy :-)&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everyone who misses there acne free skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased it before a big event because this product is advertised as a fast spot treatment. The bottle even claims to reduce redness, but did the opposite and increased redness and made it look like I was a burn victim. I WILL NEVER BUY THIS AGAIN.</li>
            <li> This works okay, but is far too overpriced for the amount you get. It doesn&#x27;t last very long &amp; since it&#x27;s salicylic acid, it&#x27;s not a spot treatment. It works really well for preventing breakouts, but you need enough to cover your whole face &amp; the tube is so small that it&#x27;s not worth it to be spending so much.</li>
            <li> As someone with acne problem, I have been trying different products over the years and this one seems to work very well. The gel does NOT prevent acne but it treats pimple breakouts. Don&#x27;t expect overnight miracle - the pimple won&#x27;t disappear entirely but its size will be reduced at least 50%.&lt;br /&gt;The gel is clear. When you apply it, you might get a cold tingling feeling for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Before I get into this product review, let me first say that I am a teenager with mild- acne--usually two to four noticable pustules or papules on my face at once (maybe more inflamed ones every few weeks) and tiny, unnoticeable-unless-close-to-the-mirror whiteheads all over my forehead. Like most people, I tend to break out more during my period and if I eat a lot of junk food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this acne spot gel is called \\&quot;rapid clear\\&quot; completely baffles me. It just does not work for me. Before anyone jumps to conclusions and claims that perhaps I&#x27;m using this product incorrectly, let me tell you:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this gel before/after/without cleansing my face and before/after/without morturizing. I&#x27;ve used it one, two, and even three times per day. I&#x27;ve tried rubbing it in, putting on a thin layer, and just globbing it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And...&lt;br /&gt;NOTHING works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I can say is that it has a pleasant odor (for those who don&#x27;t mind the smell of salicylic acid), and it doesn&#x27;t dry out skin at all. When you put it on, you feel a cool, tingly sensation, as if it&#x27;s actually working. But besides that, I don&#x27;t understand how this helps clear acne, over a few days OR overnight.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for a week or two and its working really well! It does like make the pimple less red and smaller but doesnt completely go away. Anways its expensive but it did work and i love ot.</li>
            <li> EXREMELY DRYING FOR THE SKIN BECAUSE ALMOST HALF OF IT IS ALCOHOL!!!! I hope you guys know that putting so much alcohol on your skin only aggravates your acne and oil over production, as your skin gets stressed out, not even talking about the aging effect... In description of the product it says \\&quot;non irritating\\&quot;... Non irritating my butt!!! In addition my skin became extremely red and ugly looking, lost its natural luster and beautiful tone after just a couple of days of use... Does it help clear spots? Seems like it&#x27;s helpful, but not exceptional. Seems like there&#x27;s more bad than good effect. So never ever will I put this stuff on my entire face again, only spot treating, until I run out of it and buy a better product.</li>
            <li> cleared my skin within 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get many pimples anymore but once in a while I will get one and it definitely stands out.  I purchased this product after reading some good things on the internet and I have tried it several different times on several different pimples and it seems to have no affect whatsoever.  I follow the directions and apply it after cleansing my face, usually before bed and throughout the day, but still see no reduction in size at all.  I understand certain products will work differently for everyone, this one just happened to not work at all for me.</li>
            <li> Since I received the product I had one pimple that I was able to use the product on.  It did not magically make the pimple go away. As a matter of fact I didnt notice any reduction in time from the clearing of the pimple. The jury is out because next time I will have to ensure that I apply the gel immediately upon realizing the onset of a possible pimple.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product. It is helping my skin clear up.</li>
            <li> Has been working well for me since 8 years ago! Only wish I didn&#x27;t still need it, but oh well. :) Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, and doesn&#x27;t irritate it either. The only complaint is that the gel flakes and rubs off into weird little ribbons if you put moisturizer or makeup over it.</li>
            <li> I received the product and it was expired and I wasn&#x27;t allowed to return it</li>
            <li> This product works overnight. I&#x27;ve tried so many products and Neutrogena worked, which was surprising to me. The bottle is small, but only a small amount of the product is needed.</li>
            <li> this product is okay,its just like any other  neutrogena acne product just use it  as you need it or every skin type is differant</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a teen who&#x27;s been using acne prouducts forever but none of them work&lt;br /&gt;I tryed this because it was recommended . Put it on at night and woke up the next day to see that 80 percent of my acne was gone definitely worth the money trust me!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this, hoping it would work like the Proactiv version, but though it stings, I have not seen any noticeable improvements when used, even overnight. However, with skin care products, much depends on the type of skin you have, and mine is oily and acne-prone, so this might work for those with normal skin, or with occasional, mild breakouts.</li>
            <li> Iv used a prescription medication for over 7 years which has worked wonders. However the price of said prescription medication has sky rocketed and I just can&#x27;t pay for it, so I gave this a try as I knew I would break out once I went off my medication. This stuff does not work in the slightest. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t reduce redness nor does it get rid of the blemish over time.</li>
