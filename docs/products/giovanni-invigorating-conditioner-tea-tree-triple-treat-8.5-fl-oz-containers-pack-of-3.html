            <li>/&gt;Buying this three-pack through Amazon is like getting one for free!</li>
            <li>Ok, I bought for the tee tree oil to help scalp.</li>
            <li>I think there are better products.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo and</li>
            <li>/&gt;You&#x27;ll be very happy if you are former St. Ives customer!</li>
            <li>co-wash most of the month, but I don&#x27;t know about using this as a co-wash.</li>
            <li>My fianc√© and I LOVE this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>Love this conditioner.</li>
            <li>Safe to use on dyed hair.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has been wonderful and has relieved me of the dry, flaky itchies.  </li>
            <li>Why does the original Giovanni Conditioner which was amazing free of parabens and not this one?</li>
            <li>Love that it is free of harmful chemicals, yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I love that this product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Not to mention CRUELTY FREE :)</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, good buy.</li>
            <li>Giovanni conditioners are smooth and creamy, offering great slip for comb-outs followed by soft moisturized hair.</li>
            <li>I love the scent - not too overpowering but fresh and minty.  </li>
            <li>I feel better using organic than department store conditioners as the list of ingredients sounds so much healthier!</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean.</li>
            <li>This product is also much more gentle on your hair than any dandruff shampoo I tried.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just be completely up front and honest.  </li>
            <li>It is very luxurious feeling and smells fabulous!  </li>
            <li>I think for now I will just enjoy the success of how well it worked for me.</li>
            <li>I IMMEDIATELY SWITCHED BACK TO THIS , MAKES MY HAIR MORE MANAGEABLE AND SOFT , ALSO FEELS REFRESHING ON THE SCALP !!</li>
            <li>Better than Wen by far and so much more reasonable in cost!</li>
            <li>THE TEA TREE OIL SMELL GOES AWAY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>I concentrate this particular conditioner on my scalp and make sure to let it sit for about 5-10min.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair super soft and smooth, which is ideal if you live in a hot and high humidity area, like I do.  </li>
            <li>Great conditioner to use after the harsh corresponding shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This is worth the money and time to try.  </li>
            <li>This is the 4th conditioner (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth far more than it sells for</li>
            <li>and I did in fact pay far more until I found it here.</li>
            <li>I think this is my favorite hair conditioner of the natural brands that I have tried.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty good moisturizer, but my hair is ultra dry and damaged</li>
            <li>The smell is very nice (even for a guy) and relatively inexpensive for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>the price is right on Amazon</li>
            <li>I have medium thickness hair and it leaves just the right amount of body.</li>
            <li>I struggled with an very itchy scalp for years, this is the first product that has kept me comfortable.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for several years and am super glad to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>They are organic and leave my hair clean and soft and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I am really happy with my results as of now, even though this product is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first got this conditioner at Walmart</li>
            <li>Very invigorating!</li>
            <li>First let me say if you need lots of moisture</li>
            <li>We used to buy it at Walmart, but it&#x27;s pretty pricey 8 Oz for 7/8$.</li>
            <li>but this light conditioner is great for the dry winter months without weighing down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous about buying this in bulk without trying it first, but I took a chance and am so glad I did!</li>
            <li>and it really balances out my hair.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT AND THE FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li>It moisturized my 4a type hair very well</li>
            <li>A lot of products don&#x27;t do the job because my hair is so pick at what it wants and needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I love the slight tingle it gives my scalp.</li>
            <li>let me recommend it highly.  </li>
            <li>But I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have normal ends and an oily scalp</li>
            <li>I love peppermint and tea tree oils; so if you&#x27;re in to those natural essential oils, then this shampoo is definitely for you!  </li>
            <li>TJ&#x27;s brand always left my hair feeling stripped and dry after using it, but this Giovanni one is much more moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I use this 2-3 times per week and on the other days I use a heavier, more moisturizing conditioner since this one is quite light and doesn&#x27;t condition as heavily as I need.</li>
            <li>Within days of not using this product my scalp starts right back up again.</li>
            <li>It took me forever to find this product along with the shampoo, and two states (I live on the borderline.)</li>
            <li>My only wish; it&#x27;s available in larger sizes.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS &#x27;GREEN&#x27; PRODUCT !</li>
            <li>I first discovered this shampoo and conditioner elsewhere and paid double the price that I paid on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It also does a pretty good job of adding some volume to my slowly thinning hair without leaving it weighed down.  </li>
            <li>Because of that, I&#x27;ve only been using this combo for one wash per week, but, so far, it seems to be working really well!</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and nourished.  </li>
            <li>IT LEAVES THE HAIR SOFT AND SHINNY AND DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE ANY RESIDUE.  </li>
            <li>; It works wonders on my 3 girls and my naturally kinky hair.</li>
            <li>Since I had bought the conditioner, I decided to try it and found it made my hair soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I have old bottle of the St. Ives and</li>
            <li>I tend to leave the conditioner on for about 5 minutes, and my hair is soft, bouncy, and shiny after every wash.</li>
            <li>Whenever I have a headache I shower and use this shampoo it almost always relives my headaches, (which I get frequently).</li>
            <li>Leaves hair soft with no residue.</li>
            <li>and I love it for when the dew points are low because it has very little  humectants in it</li>
            <li>I have seen a major reduction in scalp itchiness after using this and its accompanying shampoo.</li>
            <li>(I added a few drops of sweet almond oil to it as I do any conditioner I use) and I even deep conditioned with it by sitting under the hair dryer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean and the tangles can easily be removed by running my fingers through or with a brush.</li>
            <li>My sensitive scalp never feels irritated, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry or stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am trying to only use natural products and this product is not natural at all!</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical at first by buying this product because I fear it would be too strong for me</li>

            <li> AND THIS WAS THE FIRST SHAMPOO AND CONDITION I HAVE TRIED ON MY VERY LONG AND THICK HAIR..</li>
            <li> I am of a certain age and my hair was dull, lifeless and seemed to be falling out by the handful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Giovanni conditioners; I&#x27;ve been using the Direct Leave-In and Deeper Moisture for a little over a year now.  </li>
            <li> how long I leave it in.</li>
            <li> IF you were hooked on (long discontinued)</li>
            <li> I have greasy roots and dry ends</li>
            <li> St. Ives Hair Repair Intensive Conditioner Moisture Treatment for Dry Or Damaged hair</li>
            <li> so I generally rotate this with a heavy mask.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft without leaving any icky residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree shampoo and conditioner for a few years since I had heard that it was the same formulation as the Giovanni one.</li>
            <li> I tried the shampoo as well, but for me it dried out my long hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived in the midwest off and on over the past decade, and have always struggled to find haircare products that don&#x27;t leave my hair a total frizzball in the winter.</li>
            <li> One state had the shampoo and the other state had the conditioner</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, itchy scalp for a few years, so I decided to give the Giovanni Tea Tree Oil a try.  </li>
            <li> The dry air and cold absolutely destroys my hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly dry hair and usually an itchy scalp.  </li>
            <li> making my hair frizz less in the colder months.  </li>
            <li> This also helps with a slightly flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Giovanni Tea Tree Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for a few years now</li>
            <li> Let it sit a few minutes too.</li>
            <li> This is not a easy thing to find.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair, which requires lots of conditioner, so we go through quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li> I bought this conditioner on a whim about a month ago and have made it through some pretty bad weather &amp; wind with my hair intact.</li>
            <li> Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll probably be switching lines after I&#x27;m done with the three-pack because I&#x27;m not a fan of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have terrible scalp psoriasis and using the conditioner daily is showing improvement where nothing else ever has, not even prescription products.</li>
            <li> and it proved that I was wrong, so</li>
            <li> very sad because all product ingredients should be uniform.</li>

            <li> Great conditioner to use after the harsh corresponding shampoo.  Has that nice mint/tea tree tingle.  Unfortunately, I&#x27;ll probably be switching lines after I&#x27;m done with the three-pack because I&#x27;m not a fan of the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love these hair products. They are organic and leave my hair clean and soft and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I follow the curly girl routine so I have to use conditioner that doesn&#x27;t have any silicones in it.  This is not a easy thing to find.  I first got this conditioner at Walmart and I love it for when the dew points are low because it has very little  humectants in it making my hair frizz less in the colder months.  And the price saving on Amazon makes it even better!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner! It leaves my hair soft without leaving any icky residue. I would suggest this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Very invigorating! Love that it is free of harmful chemicals, yet moisturizing.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Giovanni Tea Tree Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for a few years now and it&#x27;s excellent!! Your hair is so soft &amp; manageable without being weighed down. I have greasy roots and dry ends and it really balances out my hair. Plus it&#x27;s organic so what more can you ask for!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner, it leaves my hair soft and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> conditioner did not impress me. Wen better.</li>
            <li> Giovanni Invigorating TTTT Conditioner is one of my favorite products! It does what it claims to do and uses organic ingredients.  I love the smell and feel of it.  It leaves my hair soft and nourished.  I feel better using organic than department store conditioners as the list of ingredients sounds so much healthier!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD CONDITIONER.  IT LEAVES THE HAIR SOFT AND SHINNY AND DOESN&#x27;T LEAVE ANY RESIDUE.  THE TEA TREE OIL SMELL GOES AWAY QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> First let me say if you need lots of moisture this is not for you. I have normal ends and an oily scalp so this works perfect for me. I don&#x27;t get any tingle no matter how long I leave it in. This also helps with a slightly flaky scalp.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS &#x27;GREEN&#x27; PRODUCT ! I JUST RECENTLY BECAME ECO-FRIENDLY AND THIS WAS THE FIRST SHAMPOO AND CONDITION I HAVE TRIED ON MY VERY LONG AND THICK HAIR.. DECIDED TO TRY NATURES GATE AND WAS SO DISPLEASED! I IMMEDIATELY SWITCHED BACK TO THIS , MAKES MY HAIR MORE MANAGEABLE AND SOFT , ALSO FEELS REFRESHING ON THE SCALP !! THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT AND THE FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I love this product! I use this and the shampoo. I struggled with an very itchy scalp for years, this is the first product that has kept me comfortable. Within days of not using this product my scalp starts right back up again. This product is also much more gentle on your hair than any dandruff shampoo I tried. The mint makes it feel soothing while the tea tree oil does it&#x27;s work.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Great Price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree shampoo and conditioner for a few years since I had heard that it was the same formulation as the Giovanni one. When I finished up my last bottle of the TJ&#x27;s brand, I decided to get the Giovanni one -- and there is a world of difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TJ&#x27;s brand always left my hair feeling stripped and dry after using it, but this Giovanni one is much more moisturizing. My sensitive scalp never feels irritated, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry or stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days when I use this, I also use the matching Giovanni shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also Curly-Girl-friendly for those who don&#x27;t use sulfates or silicones on their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that this ended up damaging her hair and her boyfriend&#x27;s hair, so I&#x27;m worried about long-term use. Because of that, I&#x27;ve only been using this combo for one wash per week, but, so far, it seems to be working really well!</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner! Tingles &amp; Softens; It works wonders on my 3 girls and my naturally kinky hair. My only wish; it&#x27;s available in larger sizes.</li>
            <li> I started using this conditioner when I bought the shampoo in a health food store for a friend who likes it for his scalp.  I tried the shampoo as well, but for me it dried out my long hair.  Since I had bought the conditioner, I decided to try it and found it made my hair soft and silky.  I am reordering it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST CONDITIONER I&#x27;VE EVER USED!  I have curly dry hair and usually an itchy scalp.  I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;had no problems since using this product.  I recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Awesome conditioner for unruly hair. Curly hair can be kept close by using this conditioner</li>
            <li> Better than Wen by far and so much more reasonable in cost! I have terrible scalp psoriasis and using the conditioner daily is showing improvement where nothing else ever has, not even prescription products. I hope it keeps helping. I recommend you shampoo maybe every two to three days but confusion daily if you have psoriasis. Let it sit a few minutes too. Agree about four days of doing this you&#x27;ll notice a change hopefully like I did.</li>
            <li> I am a picky girl.  Let&#x27;s just be completely up front and honest.  I don&#x27;t hold back and I certainly don&#x27;t pull any punches or round house kicks to the groin!  This is worth the money and time to try.  It is very luxurious feeling and smells fabulous!  I love peppermint and tea tree oils; so if you&#x27;re in to those natural essential oils, then this shampoo is definitely for you!  It leaves your hair super soft and smooth, which is ideal if you live in a hot and high humidity area, like I do.  And, great for taming frizz.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th conditioner (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite. I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean and the tangles can easily be removed by running my fingers through or with a brush. By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean. This Tea Tree Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes. I love that this product is cruelty free. I recommend search around for a lower price on the internet (vitacost has great prices).</li>
            <li> The scent of this conditioner is what keeps me coming back. It is a pretty good moisturizer, but my hair is ultra dry and damaged so I generally rotate this with a heavy mask.</li>
            <li> I have seen a major reduction in scalp itchiness after using this and its accompanying shampoo. The smell is very nice (even for a guy) and relatively inexpensive for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I skip conditioner in the summer and just use the Tea Tree shampoo--- but this light conditioner is great for the dry winter months without weighing down my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying this three-pack through Amazon is like getting one for free!</li>
            <li> Smells great and I love the slight tingle it gives my scalp. Works great on my fine oily hair. great value..</li>
            <li> Nice to have an organic option!  I use this 2-3 times per week and on the other days I use a heavier, more moisturizing conditioner since this one is quite light and doesn&#x27;t condition as heavily as I need.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works wonders for my hair. Really good price for 3! At my Target, one of them alone is like 9 bucks. Awesome stuff! Not to mention CRUELTY FREE :) (And vegan I believe)</li>
            <li> I like this hair conditioner. Smells very pleasant and does its job.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this shampoo and conditioner elsewhere and paid double the price that I paid on Amazon.  If you haven&#x27;t used Tea Tree shampoo and conditioner let me recommend it highly.  I am of a certain age and my hair was dull, lifeless and seemed to be falling out by the handful.  Not anymore.  This product is indeed the holy grail of hair products.  My hair is shiny, bouncy and thicker than before I begain using it.  Don&#x27;t let the price fool you.  It&#x27;s worth far more than it sells for and I did in fact pay far more until I found it here.</li>
            <li> minty, burns eyes. Ok, I bought for the tee tree oil to help scalp. I think there are better products.</li>
            <li> behentrimonium methosulfate and chloride!! Why does the original Giovanni Conditioner which was amazing free of parabens and not this one? very sad because all product ingredients should be uniform. I am trying to only use natural products and this product is not natural at all! I am not using this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several years and am super glad to find this on Amazon.  I love the scent - not too overpowering but fresh and minty.  The scent also does not linger in my hair.  It also does a pretty good job of adding some volume to my slowly thinning hair without leaving it weighed down.  Very refreshing to use - I use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and the price is right on Amazon</li>
            <li> IF you were hooked on (long discontinued) St. Ives Hair Repair Intensive Conditioner Moisture Treatment for Dry Or Damaged hair (white bottle with maroon pump) then get this as an almost perfect replacement. The smell is the same, the feel is the same. Does all the same. I have old bottle of the St. Ives and the ingredients are almost identical. I&#x27;ll bet St. Ives sold the formula to Giovanni.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll be very happy if you are former St. Ives customer!</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lived in the midwest off and on over the past decade, and have always struggled to find haircare products that don&#x27;t leave my hair a total frizzball in the winter. The dry air and cold absolutely destroys my hair. I bought this conditioner on a whim about a month ago and have made it through some pretty bad weather &amp; wind with my hair intact. I tend to leave the conditioner on for about 5 minutes, and my hair is soft, bouncy, and shiny after every wash. The smell is delicious &amp; a great wakeup in the morning. I was a little nervous about buying this in bulk without trying it first, but I took a chance and am so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of Giovanni conditioners; I&#x27;ve been using the Direct Leave-In and Deeper Moisture for a little over a year now.  I&#x27;ve had dry, itchy scalp for a few years, so I decided to give the Giovanni Tea Tree Oil a try.  I&#x27;m so glad I did!  This conditioner has been wonderful and has relieved me of the dry, flaky itchies.  I concentrate this particular conditioner on my scalp and make sure to let it sit for about 5-10min. to allow the tea tree to work, then I rinse.  I started out with one bottle, and I just  reordered the 3-bottle deal.  Giovanni conditioners are smooth and creamy, offering great slip for comb-outs followed by soft moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> It took me forever to find this product along with the shampoo, and two states (I live on the borderline.) One state had the shampoo and the other state had the conditioner lol! Anyway, just like the shampoo, I was very happy with this conditioner. It moisturized my 4a type hair very well (I added a few drops of sweet almond oil to it as I do any conditioner I use) and I even deep conditioned with it by sitting under the hair dryer for 15 minutes. I am really happy with my results as of now, even though this product is hard to find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I co-wash most of the month, but I don&#x27;t know about using this as a co-wash. It is a tea tree based product by the way. I was very skeptical at first by buying this product because I fear it would be too strong for me and it proved that I was wrong, so I think for now I will just enjoy the success of how well it worked for me. A lot of products don&#x27;t do the job because my hair is so pick at what it wants and needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this a four star because it has only been one time that I have tried it. We&#x27;ll see if it works the same 3 or 4 weeks from now, but I doubt that it will disappoint me. I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> My fianc√© and I LOVE this shampoo &amp; conditioner. Whenever I have a headache I shower and use this shampoo it almost always relives my headaches, (which I get frequently). I never knew shampoo could make your head tingle. We used to buy it at Walmart, but it&#x27;s pretty pricey 8 Oz for 7/8$. here we get three bottles for under $20. And I don&#x27;t have to travel out of town to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is, I wish they came in different sizes. I have very thick long hair, which requires lots of conditioner, so we go through quite a bit of it. But I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner. Leaves hair soft with no residue. Safe to use on dyed hair.</li>
            <li> I think this is my favorite hair conditioner of the natural brands that I have tried. I have medium thickness hair and it leaves just the right amount of body. My hair is never greasy.</li>
