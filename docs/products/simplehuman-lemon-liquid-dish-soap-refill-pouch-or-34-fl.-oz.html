            <li>The soap foams well and cuts through grease nicely.</li>
            <li>Buying this to make sure the soap is compatible.</li>
            <li>Make sure you use simplehuman branded soap for their auto-dispensers to prevent clogging.</li>
            <li>I just read all the 15 reviews that are posted for this dish soap and most mention how they like the lemon scent.</li>
            <li>I cook from scratch a lot and wash my hands many, many times while I cook.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell of this soap, always makes me want to taste it when I am washing dishes.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I love this dish soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did this; it is one of those</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product as the quality is great.</li>
            <li>but I love how easy it is to refill my SIMPLEHUMAN soap dispensers.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to pay more for a &#x27;proprietary&#x27; dish soap, figuring SoftSoap or Costco brand that we already had would do just fine.</li>
            <li>The packaging is awesome also, we love the little screw cap.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and refreshing and lingers in the kitchen after the work is done.</li>
            <li>The package design with the screw top is great as it allows you to easily open and close it to fill your dispenser.</li>
            <li>and they work fine.  </li>
            <li>The smell is great and the suds get big.</li>
            <li>It smells great and works great in the simple human soap dispenser.</li>
            <li>The soap has done the job keeping my hands clean.  </li>
            <li>The Lemon is a nice natural smelling scent.  </li>
            <li>I love all Simple Human items and this particular soap is the best.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m particularly fond of the appealing lemon scent.  </li>
            <li>and while they would work for a while, quickly they would clog!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works as advertised in the sensor pump, smells good and doesnt dry out my hands like the cheaper dish soaps.  </li>
            <li>As far as it working in the dispenser, it works ok, not a problem.</li>
            <li>Okay, that is starting to sound like a feminine wash ad...</li>
            <li>Other soaps have clogged my dispensers and this has a nice light scent.  </li>
            <li>Despite what Simple Human says about it&#x27;s soap dispensers, a good liquid detergent doesn&#x27;t always work in their machine!  </li>
            <li>The screw cap for dispensing works perfectly, easy to remove, easy to put back on and the cap doesn&#x27;t leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is a mild dish soap, but certainly does the job.  </li>
            <li>There is absolutely no way my wife and I will go back - it&#x27;s a great soap, lathers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t gum up unless not used for several days.</li>
            <li>Our first time having an automatic dispenser soap...</li>
            <li>For most of us, washing dishes is a necessary household chore.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also discovered to my happiness that it&#x27;s very gentle on my hands and doesn&#x27;t dry them out as my former name-brand dish soap did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The lemon scent is very light, but it does clean your hands well with very little soap used.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require a large amount, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li>I have a soap dispenser built into my stainless steel.  </li>
            <li>run applicator sponge under spout and works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Really like the scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this with my new simple human dispenser mostly out of laziness as I just wanted to have a pouch of soap to use right away.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, it is designed to work perfectly in Simplehuman dispensers and takes a whole lot less soap to do the same amount of cleaning.</li>
            <li>We appreciate the fruit scent with no floral or musk overtones since we have allergies to highly scented items.</li>
            <li>I actually use it for hand soap too, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and leaves me feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Even though this is a dishwashing soap, it&#x27;s not too harsh on your hands, which I love.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of cutting through grease and food residue, leaving dishes and glasses sparkling and squeaky clean and it rinses easily with no dulling film left behind.  </li>
            <li>Even when it does - it&#x27;s easier to clean up than the other</li>
            <li>So I dug out my old dispensers that I couldn&#x27;t stand to throw away (after paying so much money for something that wouldn&#x27;t work!!), cleaned them out and replaced with the Simple Human detergent</li>
            <li>I guess that means there is something in this soap I am sensitive to, thus I cannot detect any lemon scent.</li>
            <li>So far we like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>More cost, but MUCH LESS FRUSTRATION!!!</li>
            <li>I have had multiple machines &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; and cease functioning until I tried using this on a new dispenser I bought for ONE</li>
            <li>Keep the setting on low and this should last a few months easy.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin, especially my hands.  </li>
            <li>When I washed the sink out with this soap I was really surprised the shine came back to the sink</li>
            <li>star off for Simple Human not making a larger refill package - we love to buy in bulk and stay green!</li>
            <li>packaging is minimal for this much soap.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive</li>
            <li>like the light lemon smell, subtle and present.</li>
            <li>I have a stainless steel sink that is fairly new and over time it has become dull.</li>
            <li>I am now realizing the previous dish soaps I have used must have left a residue on the stainless steel.</li>

            <li> I tend to have a reaction to dishwashing soaps and cannot usually use antibacterial hand soaps because they are too harsh.  </li>
            <li> It smells really awful, like chemically, for lack of a better word.</li>
            <li> After buying one Simplehuman hand soap dispenser, I kind of went stupid crazy in our house with these dispensers - two bathrooms and kitchen for hand soap.</li>
            <li> However, I will shop around for an alternative product that is less expensive.</li>
            <li> Well... they&#x27;re too thick!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no reason it should be unpleasant, though.  </li>

            <li> Its a great deal for alot of soap.  Works as advertised in the sensor pump, smells good and doesnt dry out my hands like the cheaper dish soaps.  Keep the setting on low and this should last a few months easy.</li>
            <li> Buying this to make sure the soap is compatible. Wish the soap came in larger packages so I don&#x27;t feel guilty about wasting natural resources.</li>
            <li> Make sure you use simplehuman branded soap for their auto-dispensers to prevent clogging. Even though this is a dishwashing soap, it&#x27;s not too harsh on your hands, which I love.</li>
            <li> This soap and the dispenser are great.  The packaging is awesome also, we love the little screw cap.  These guys know what they are doing.</li>
            <li> I love the dispenser, and this soap seems to be a good consistency to use.  It is also an effective dishwashing liquid,  Doesn&#x27;t require a large amount, but gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I just read all the 15 reviews that are posted for this dish soap and most mention how they like the lemon scent. As for me,  this soap does not have a lemon scent. It smells really awful, like chemically, for lack of a better word. I guess that means there is something in this soap I am sensitive to, thus I cannot detect any lemon scent. As far as it working in the dispenser, it works ok, not a problem. I just need to avoid smelling it as I use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the dispenser for this soap.  This soap is the correct consistancy for the no touch Simple Human soap dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap was recommended by another reviewer who suggested that this could be used as hand soap as well as the dish soap it is intended.  I have used it exclusively for hand washing.  The lemon scent is very light, but it does clean your hands well with very little soap used.  I cook from scratch a lot and wash my hands many, many times while I cook.  This lasted far longer than I expected.  The soap lasted longer than the batteries in the dispenser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin, especially my hands.  I tend to have a reaction to dishwashing soaps and cannot usually use antibacterial hand soaps because they are too harsh.  This has never given me a reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dispenser has worked well, I don&#x27;t have to touch the dispenser to wash my hands.  The soap has done the job keeping my hands clean.  This is what I&#x27;m buying from now on.</li>
            <li> We have the Simplehuman dispenser and as per the reviews we choose to use the same brand soap.  The Lemon is a nice natural smelling scent.  We appreciate the fruit scent with no floral or musk overtones since we have allergies to highly scented items.</li>
            <li> Works well with their dispenser.  Other soaps have clogged my dispensers and this has a nice light scent.  I get the dish soap since it cleans greasy hands.</li>
            <li> I have a soap dispenser built into my stainless steel.  I like using this soap refill because the packaging is very nice.  Unlike a soap plastic bottle, this container can take various shapes and occupies less space below the kitchen sink between refills.  Oh and the soap works great too &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this soap, always makes me want to taste it when I am washing dishes. I actually use it for hand soap too, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin and leaves me feeling clean and fresh. Okay, that is starting to sound like a feminine wash ad...I will stop there.</li>
            <li> I love all Simple Human items and this particular soap is the best.  I also have the lavender soap without the aloe and there&#x27;s a big difference.  The aloe leaves your skin feeling NOTICEABLY softer.  Plus it smells like Lemon Joy so it&#x27;s perfect for the kitchen!</li>
            <li> So far we like it a lot.  Our first time having an automatic dispenser soap...the smell is nice and washing nicely.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive but I love how easy it is to refill my SIMPLEHUMAN soap dispensers.</li>
            <li> The soap works great with the auto dispensers.</li>
            <li> People, if you buy a Simple Human automatic soap dispenser, never put anything other than this in it. This stuff is legit and will keep your dispenser operating without clogging.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it. Does a good job with hand washing dishes. run applicator sponge under spout and works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Smells like kitchen soap should.</li>
            <li> This is a mild dish soap, but certainly does the job.  Cleans and rinses well with a slight hint of lemon.  Love it!</li>
            <li> For most of us, washing dishes is a necessary household chore.  That&#x27;s no reason it should be unpleasant, though.  Enter Simple Human Liquid Dish Soap.  It does an excellent job of cutting through grease and food residue, leaving dishes and glasses sparkling and squeaky clean and it rinses easily with no dulling film left behind.  I&#x27;ve also discovered to my happiness that it&#x27;s very gentle on my hands and doesn&#x27;t dry them out as my former name-brand dish soap did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m particularly fond of the appealing lemon scent.  It&#x27;s clean and refreshing and lingers in the kitchen after the work is done.</li>
            <li> I really like the Simple Human soap dispenser for messy hands. I haven&#x27;t found the lemon soap in the stores. Really like the scent. I have gotten compliments.</li>
            <li> Despite what Simple Human says about it&#x27;s soap dispensers, a good liquid detergent doesn&#x27;t always work in their machine!  I have had multiple machines &amp;#34;clog&amp;#34; and cease functioning until I tried using this on a new dispenser I bought for ONE LAST TRY!!  It has worked unfailingly for the last 8 months!  So I dug out my old dispensers that I couldn&#x27;t stand to throw away (after paying so much money for something that wouldn&#x27;t work!!), cleaned them out and replaced with the Simple Human detergent and they work fine.  Note that I had cleaned them before and tried a DIFFERENT commercial dish detergent and while they would work for a while, quickly they would clog!&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE...  if you buy the Simple Human dispenser, you need to use their detergent!!  More cost, but MUCH LESS FRUSTRATION!!!</li>
            <li> An excellent product to go with their handsome pumps. The smell is great and the suds get big. And great smell!</li>
            <li> We use this for the in-sink dispenser, which was not made by Simple Human. We previously used a couple different brands. One was too thick, and the other didn&#x27;t remove fats (butter, olive oil, etc.) from my hands--I had to use dish detergent if my hands were greasy. This dispenses nicely and works on fats.</li>
            <li> Great consistency, perfect for the machine</li>
            <li> I think that this product cleans well and it is great that it reduces the amount of plastic in the environment. However, I will shop around for an alternative product that is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this with my new simple human dispenser mostly out of laziness as I just wanted to have a pouch of soap to use right away. I was very impressed with the quality of this soap! I have a stainless steel sink that is fairly new and over time it has become dull. When I washed the sink out with this soap I was really surprised the shine came back to the sink (by this point I figured the sink wasn&#x27;t that great in quality). I am now realizing the previous dish soaps I have used must have left a residue on the stainless steel. This soap rinses very clean and has a pleasant scent. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I love this dish soap. It smells great and works great in the simple human soap dispenser. We use it for both dishes and for washing hands. The package design with the screw top is great as it allows you to easily open and close it to fill your dispenser. I would highly recommend this product as the quality is great.</li>
            <li> The best part about this soap is how easily it rinses off.  Same for the hand soap.  A bit expansive though.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to pay more for a &#x27;proprietary&#x27; dish soap, figuring SoftSoap or Costco brand that we already had would do just fine. Well... they&#x27;re too thick! They tend to gum up the dispenser tip, so we went ahead and tried the Simple Human branded product - and in, a word - perfection! There is absolutely no way my wife and I will go back - it&#x27;s a great soap, lathers nicely, and doesn&#x27;t gum up unless not used for several days. Even when it does - it&#x27;s easier to clean up than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One star off for Simple Human not making a larger refill package - we love to buy in bulk and stay green!</li>
            <li> Simplehuman dish soap is excellent. After buying one Simplehuman hand soap dispenser, I kind of went stupid crazy in our house with these dispensers - two bathrooms and kitchen for hand soap. I decided to try the kitchen dispenser for dish soap. I&#x27;m so glad I did this; it is one of those great luxuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combined with the soap dispenser and caddy ([[ASIN:B00AZSNWNE Simplehuman Sensor Pump with Caddy, 13 Fluid Ounce]]) this dish soap can&#x27;t be beat. We use about half the amount of dish soap now and get the dishes cleaner. This soap is more expensive than the bottles at the grocery store. On the other hand, it is designed to work perfectly in Simplehuman dispensers and takes a whole lot less soap to do the same amount of cleaning. In the end, it is probably about the same price per dish cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is minimal for this much soap. The screw cap for dispensing works perfectly, easy to remove, easy to put back on and the cap doesn&#x27;t leak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the light lemon smell, subtle and present. The soap foams well and cuts through grease nicely. It is a great product.</li>
