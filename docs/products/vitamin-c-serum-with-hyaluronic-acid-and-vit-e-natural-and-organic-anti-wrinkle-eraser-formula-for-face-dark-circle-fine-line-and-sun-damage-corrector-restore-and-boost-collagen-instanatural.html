            <li>This serum is great, and the smell is good.</li>
            <li>I love it under my makeup because Vitamin C also is a great sunscreen!</li>
            <li>The customer service is impeccable in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it to be honest!</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s a good product and will greatly help my skin .</li>
            <li>The results today are remarkable; it&#x27;s like nothing even happened.</li>
            <li>My face feels wonderful after using it and I make sure not to neglect my neck, decolletage and hands.</li>

            <li>my friends comment on how good my face looks</li>
            <li>I will be fair and try another bottle</li>
            <li>so I can fairly rate it after a couple months.</li>
            <li>Had filler put under my eyes on Wednesday and needed a good serum to make my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>Good bye</li>
            <li>A good Vitamin C Serum is sold in an amber bottle just like this one to extend its shelf life.</li>
            <li>because it goes on smooth and best of all, it does not leave any oily spots or film residue.</li>
            <li>will, although, after seeing some actors I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good option either.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved it.  </li>
            <li>Great product and nice smell</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and have seen good results.</li>
            <li>I have read about the good benefits of using Vit C serum.</li>
            <li>how good it was for the skin as well.</li>
            <li>What I have found with the Vitamin C serum is its incredible ability to shrink pores and maintain a healthy balance of moisture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good.</li>
            <li>all product is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into writing reviews, but decided that this product is SO good, that I needed to let everyone know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Friends and family have been asking how my skin looks as good as it does</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>When that happened, I picked up a Clairsonic Mia (cheapest model), a good cream cleanser, and instanaturals vitamin c serum for use after washing.</li>
            <li>Both products are superior for my skin</li>
            <li>The good thing that, you don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer after this serum unless you want to.</li>
            <li>I still think this is a good serum if you would like to help even your skin texture and complexion, InstaNatural&#x27;s vitamin c serum will be</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that my face feels refreshed along with a great citric smell but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>good price</li>
            <li>good under skin cream or makeup</li>

            <li>It feels good going on and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>I can tell you it smells really good</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t understand the great reviews.</li>
            <li>smell is good</li>
            <li>Definitely a good investment if you want clearer skin.</li>

            <li>This serum feels good on my face.  </li>
            <li>From what I have read that means it&#x27;s no longer good.</li>
            <li>I would cleanse well, use a good moisturizing toner (InstaNatural&#x27;s rose water works great with this), apply the serum, then the oils over that.</li>

            <li>I used three kinds of serum and so far this is the best.</li>
            <li>I went for a pre-facial consultation and was told that Vitamin C serums are one of the best products to clear skin and combat aging..</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s incredible how much of a difference it&#x27;s made even in a week.</li>
            <li>This serum is one of the best things that has happened to me i am 31 years old</li>
            <li>The smell is wonderful, a soft orangey smell.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff love how it glides on.</li>
            <li>This serum is truly amazing. :)</li>
            <li>the folks over at Insta Natural are awesome!</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li>I used it in conjunction with InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer, so I can&#x27;t speak to how effective the product would be alone, but combined with the moisturizer, it was outstanding.</li>
            <li>the first 15-20 seconds after you put it on, but just pat it and soaks in beautifully</li>
            <li>So far, I think all of your products are excellent.</li>
            <li>received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback, however, this does not change how much I love the InstaNatural skin care line.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely in love with the InstaNatural brand and their amazing products.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say that this is probably the most effective serum I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>The best natural vitamin C serum on the market.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best beauty product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t hesitate on their products, safe and effective.</li>
            <li>We all know how amazing vitamin C is for keeping a healthy balance in the body, fighting infections and stabilizing your immune system.</li>
            <li>This serum has been excellent so far...</li>
            <li>So far I am very impressed by this vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>the scent does not linger, but sure smells nice going on.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with the serum.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural has done a wonderful thing and listed the ingredients in the product</li>
            <li>It is natural and has a delicious smell..</li>
            <li>Her skin looks smoother , she did peel some from it, but wow now she looks great!</li>
            <li>BUT SOO FAR LOVE IT!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>I used this after washing my face and toning with rosewater, and love how it absorbs immediately and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This was a nice serum, smells like oranges and what not, but doesn&#x27;t do much more than brighten and make my skin look &amp;#34;cleaner.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the citrus smell, goes on nicely and</li>
            <li>The smell is nice too - refreshing.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural is one of my favorite brands and their products are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and fresh.</li>
            <li>The serum is the perfect natural toner to set the palette for moisturizer and/or makeup.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this in combination with their Moroccan Rose Water, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing like a refreshing glass of fresh squeezed orange juice and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Most of these items I have bought  &amp; made my own mix of oils.  </li>
            <li>Studies have repeatedly shown L-Ascorbic Acid as having the most effective antioxidant properties as it is the purest form of vitamin C. I won&#x27;t be using this</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m very happy with my complexion since I started using Insta Natural.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews before buying it, and I wonder if it is getting good reviews because the company is supplying free bottles?</li>
            <li>Many of the products that did amazing for me no longer suffice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive, so I have found that using nightly is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>Some of the ingredients are argon oil, rose hip oil, and plant stem cells in addition to the vitamin C, so, it is packed full of good stuff for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great serum, it smells good, not thick or too liquidy either.</li>
            <li>Great investment right here.</li>
            <li>* Lighter and smoother looking, with a reduction in very fine</li>
            <li>Easy!</li>
            <li>The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin really fresh, it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy and very nice to use in the summer.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely face serum, very light but effective.  </li>
            <li>Anyone who wants their fine lines to start to disapesr they should try this awesome product</li>
            <li>My favorite vitamin c serum- easy to apply, great consistency, helps get rid of fine lines</li>
            <li>For a high concentration, the chemical balance seems very good as there is no stinging or reddening and my skin feels smoother and a bit brighter/clearer.</li>
            <li>I have not seen the disappearance of fine lines, but I am very pleased with this serum.</li>
            <li>Awesome natural ingrediants that are healthy for the skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum; it smells nice and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
            <li>I never write online reviews unless the product is more than worthwhile erring on spectacular.</li>
            <li>I have been researching what goes into the lotions and potions we put on our faces, and this has all the simple and best ingredients that I was contemplating buying alone and mixing up on my own.  </li>
            <li>It absorbes nicely and My skin feel nice and smooth</li>
            <li>It was nice and light and smelled nice too.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural vitamin C serum is great because it has the good stuff in it, like vitamin E, Ferulic and Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C is a great skincare ingredient on its own, but its very unstable.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>I am 100% pleased as the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to continue using this Great Product!!</li>
            <li>Pleasant feeling, mild scent.</li>
            <li>The bottle is perfectly sealed, glass is blue to protect the ingredients, the dropper is perfectly functional, and the actual product seems to be as good as most serums, Vitamin C or others.  </li>
            <li>anyway I own several and all of them are awesome.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to find a great product at such a reasonable price, works beautifully.</li>
            <li>This serum is doing a great job at exfoliating my skin very gently.  </li>
            <li>Right now I am happy but will update if it maintains and I see more improvements.</li>
            <li>but it turned out to be very pleasant and did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When you feel attractive you actually are attractive and have more confidence.</li>
            <li>you have successfully tried moisturizers from Lancôme, Estee Lauder, or Borghese, this might be worth a try.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, great citrus smell, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Like the refreshing clean smell and the good results when combined with the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>I love that it is absorbed so quickly and has a very pleasant citrus scent.</li>
            <li>Fine lines are diminishing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light , it smells fruity and it leaves my face looking refreshed.  </li>
            <li>It applies evenly and very smoothly to the face.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>and I found that my skin is looking very smooth and radiant,</li>
            <li>I emailed a question or two to them and got a very detailed answer as well as an offer for a sample of another product, and a repeated offer to assist with information any time I need it to reach all of my skincare goals.</li>
            <li>It smells very lightly of citrus.  </li>
            <li>and I needed a very light serum to help aid in skin repair.</li>
            <li>AMAZING great price and natural ingredients!!</li>

            <li>Surprised me, very good product.  </li>
            <li>but since I started using this product,  I have noticed a huge improvement !</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is lovely, bright and citrusy which goes away after it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>

            <li>/&gt;First and foremost, I looked at the ingredients of the product and made sure that they were there for the correct reasons.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s even better in this formulation.</li>

            <li>Absolutely wonderful and a total bargain for the results I have seen!</li>
            <li>I feel I should note after reading many reviews on any product I purchase</li>
            <li>After a couple of months I should know more.</li>
            <li>I use it often, mostly every night.</li>
            <li>Make sure you follow the directions and use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It is sticky, but makes your skin appear more youthful.  </li>
            <li>I have used a couple different serums and this one is the best yet.  </li>
            <li>, my powder blends better, my moisturizer is almost never used now..</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels going on my face and love the way my face feels after using.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>

            <li>Love this serum.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it made my skin feel and was not greasy and also adsorbed well.</li>
            <li>Love the smell</li>
            <li>More time will tell if this product makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>but I am considering Age-defying Skin clearing or Skin Brightening serum, may be it will deliver better, faster result ????</li>
            <li>So, each bottle costs over $6 more than for US customers.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this looking for a more affordable Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>The price is great and it works very well.</li>
            <li>I love it, I&#x27;m worried the price will creep up.</li>
            <li>I chose the exchange since I do love the brand and what they stand for.</li>
            <li>I can see the healing and rejuvenating effects from this product - I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have one wrinkle around my eyes, my neck is in great shape, my skin is clear and no one EVER believes I am 62.I date men in their forties, but I am honest about my age.</li>
            <li>I love this serum</li>
            <li>Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>My skin appears more radiant, brighter and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>but i think it would help with antiaging if i used it more.</li>
            <li>I have used many vitamin C serums and this one is a favorite.  </li>
            <li>I have the scar gel (which I just ran out of and will b purchasing more)</li>
            <li>but I love this Vitamin C Serum and would recommend it everyone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad i picked this brand&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of aroma every time I apply it to my face.</li>
            <li>I was able to try 2 products before I purchased.</li>
            <li>For those who don&#x27;t love citrus, the scent goes away almost immediately after application/absorption.  </li>
            <li>I felt like it stayed where you applied it, but when i dotted it around my face a bit and then smoothed it out, that seemed to work better for me.  </li>
            <li>I would have to say this is my favorite along with the hyalouronic acid serum.</li>
            <li>and I find the hyalournic plumps and hydrates it the most</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>My skin feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love the vitamin C serum.</li>

            <li>My skin tone seems more balanced as well.</li>
            <li>I just turned 60 and have been noticing my wrinkles a lot more.</li>
            <li>After trying many, instanatural tops them all at 1/5 of the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I was still able to wear makeup over it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the benefits of vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li>my face become brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>

            <li>the texture of my skin is firmer and more toned.  </li>
            <li>Product smells great and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover your whole face.  </li>
            <li>However, my skin does look healthy.</li>
            <li>My face is noticeably clearer and more radiant.</li>
            <li>and I love the vitamin c moisturizer too</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will order more of this when I run out.</li>

            <li>Smells really nice ang goes on light.</li>
            <li>I love the price too&lt;</li>
            <li>Its ok....</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied with this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Love the serum and how it feels on my face</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with the price though,</li>
            <li>but i dont see a difference with the wrinkles yet, need more time.</li>
            <li>I will be satisfied and I buy again.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll switch to those for a while, until I find something better at a lower price.</li>

            <li>I bought this product without any intentions of having better looking skin, I don&#x27;t believe in products that reverse aging.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s lovely to apply to my face.</li>
            <li>My skin feels more softer and looks brighter.  </li>
            <li>so you get the most out of this product, and then moisturize.  </li>
            <li>Night time is when your body renews your skin the most so use it before you go to sleep.</li>
            <li>After more than a month of use</li>

            <li>This is better than all of them in my opinion.</li>

            <li>The Vitamin C Serum is fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I am sure it is what my skin needs to keep it healthy.  </li>
            <li>I love to spend a lot of time outdoors gardening and playing with my dogs, and have some hyperpigmentation from the sun.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also noticing some evening out of skin tone and anticipate more of it the longer I use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s antioxidants properties I find detoxifying in many ways.</li>
            <li>I love serums and am kinda hooked to these</li>
            <li>Since I began using this serum, my face has felt softer than it has in many years.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>I do mix it with another serum just because I want the benefits of both, but I love the smell</li>
            <li>Of all of the hyaluronic acids I&#x27;ve tried I think this one is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I reviewed this product for I love to review.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>i received this for free for my own opinion</li>
            <li>You can always tell those reviews, they go on and on, about how many ounces in the bottle, listing ingredients and what they are suppose to do....</li>
            <li>Lovely citrus smell.</li>
            <li>i love it...</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>Love see the diffrence in my skin</li>
            <li>I love using this at night.</li>
            <li>I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>this one from InstaNatural is in my top 3.</li>
            <li>Yes, it is orange in color, and smells like grapefruit, but I find that a refreshing scent.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are top notch.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li>Simply The best product!  </li>
            <li>I love this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this great product.</li>
            <li>This has helped me gain more energy.  </li>
            <li>I love the citrus smell and once applies doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or sticky.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>My complexion is better, as well as helped with pores.</li>
            <li>My skin is beginning to become a more even, spot-free tone.</li>
            <li>I will add more info as I use it longer but</li>
            <li>I have used this product for a couple of weeks and really love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite part is that it also contains Hyaluronic Acid to help moisturize the skin, very useful in the winter!</li>
            <li>I like 20% Vitamin C serum because it provides my skin the right source of moisturizing and bright up my skin.</li>
            <li>It seems like a good product and a lot of people have noticed improvements, I just do not think it is necessarily right for my skin</li>
            <li>My skin soaks it right up and feels so good.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think this would be a good thing, right?</li>
            <li>There are some vitamin C serums that are super tacky, very potent smelling...</li>
            <li>The oil is light, has a pleasant citrusy smell, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>and so I don&#x27;t have very significant improvement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very very excited I stepped out of my comfort zone for this one.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product, and it arrived very quickly in nice packaging.</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich &amp; has a nice texture to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I bought this serum and don&#x27;t have to keep spending a fortune trying out new products that don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>first i saw clearness and a more bright complexion of my face.</li>
            <li>But it was pretty costly so decided to go cheaper because this product had many good reviews.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to work with, and they really want to make sure you are happy with your purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am very familiar with skin care products and have tried many, MANY products to get to the great routine that I have presently, so I&#x27;m no amateur when it comes to serums and that like.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I wash with my own special face wash before application of serum and my moisturizer after the serum dries (which is seconds).</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft and it smells great!!!</li>
            <li>very good its like a potion that makes your skin bright and tight</li>
            <li>The smell is very pleasant and in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it, I can see it&#x27;s brightening properties at work already.</li>
            <li>It did however maintain the bright complexion i&#x27;ve maintained since using the first serum</li>
            <li>About me: I&#x27;m 30, pretty good skin</li>
            <li>Goes a long way and feels wonderful!</li>
            <li>Most importantly almost immediately my skin had a healthy glow and looked and felt more taut.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is becoming more even</li>
            <li>Storing it in the refrigerator makes it feel even more refreshing and also keeps it safe from light and heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell pretty good</li>
            <li>I’ve been using the serum twice a day and already notice my complexion becoming more even.</li>
            <li>Smells good and my face looks and feels so much softer!</li>
            <li>have always had pretty good skin, aside from a blemish or two and the once a month</li>
            <li>Most important I found the Original version to be more effective.</li>
            <li>The first thing I loved was the texture and absorbtion and fragrance..</li>
            <li>This is a must-have product because it has improved my skin significantly!</li>
            <li>This serum smells like fresh orange!!</li>
            <li>and I can notice my acne scar has lightened significantly!</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C serum smells amazing and absorbs really quickly on skin.</li>
            <li>my skin is dry so this combination is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li>I would say it absorbs very quickly  and make my lines appear more blurred .</li>
            <li>It spreads nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It has a nice, mild citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li>Well, I don&#x27;t think so, but they do have an oil that is super nice</li>
            <li>It smells nice and feels nice on my skin, but the older formulation of this product was much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to put good Vitamin C on your skin, especially you feel your skin like {drying}.</li>
            <li>Shipping was so fast, and the bottle  were bubble wrapped very well and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>It has great components that help the heathy cell naturally generate and to have the healthy glow in my face.</li>
            <li>1 ounce has lasted me for almost 3 months which is ideal because any skincare product with vitamin c oxidizes so you will not be able to keep an open bottle for years.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I&#x27;m loving the smell and feel of this when I rub it into my face.</li>
            <li>I love this soooo much and was weary because the price is so good.</li>
            <li>However, at 67 and seeking great products, natural and organic, I give this serum top billing.</li>
            <li>Because of its advance ingredients it is able to provide many fantastic combinations to maximize the benefits to your skin.</li>
            <li>actually requested a free sample, the customer service was great!</li>
            <li>SO after reading all the reviews and I must  say: this company would benefit avoiding these free loaders, because so many of these views made me wonder if this product has any value, not to mention all the precious time going through those.</li>
            <li>Great product for my very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I liked this serum from the very first application -</li>
            <li>Using this together with the Retinol cream is keeping my skin fairly happy and although I&#x27;ve had some breakouts, they heal pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy the very light scent that it has.</li>
            <li>Been using this for a month it works fine --- hoping for more clearness and youthful look.</li>
            <li>Even if you aren’t looking to get rid of pesky wrinkles or fine lines, this will provide your skin with a better and smoother complexion by shrinking pores and evening out your skin tone to impart a youthful glowing radiance.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s also loaded with other good stuff like hyaluronic acid that are recommended for great skin.  </li>
            <li>I have used 2 other top seller brands of vitamin C and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more serums than I can recall and this one for me has no discernible scent, absorbs more quickly than most, and seems to be competitively priced (not the suggested or list price, but the cost of under twenty dollars).  </li>
            <li>Overall, I feel it is a valid, very good</li>
            <li>I have used a lot of vitamin c products, and this one is just as good as the very high priced ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product since it smells like citric, very fresh, very smooth, very convenient to use since it contains both Vitamin C and Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to purchase this at a special promotion price to try it out.  </li>
            <li>If my skin wasn&#x27;t sensitive to it, it is a great serum</li>
            <li>So far I am extremely happy....</li>
            <li>Because of that, I&#x27;m giving it just two stars, as it probably won&#x27;t be able to fight free radicals.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum in combination with the Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer for about two weeks now, and I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>I received my shipment in a timely manner and so far am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Great results so far - 2 weeks in and brighter complexion with smoother skin.</li>
            <li>are becoming my go to brand for serums.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and smells great</li>
            <li>I like the natural ingredience in the instanatural products and have been happy with everything I have received from them.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feeling more smooth.  </li>
            <li>And I love knowing that it&#x27;s feeding my skin as is lightly moisturizes.  </li>
            <li>At my age I can&#x27;t expect any formula to work a miracle but it makes my skin feel really smooth and creates a healthy glow...</li>
            <li>natural has a great Guarantee-----------great product</li>
            <li>I love the serum when it&#x27;s on my face and the smooth feel .  </li>
            <li>It helps my skin heal faster and more smoothly.</li>
            <li>My acne cleared up and my skin started becoming brighter.</li>
            <li>The serum is thicker than most and goes on so smoothly.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth this product goes on.</li>
            <li>I happy with the result thus far.  </li>
            <li>it feels great going on and leaves skin really soft.  </li>
            <li>Soaks nicely into the skin, no bad smell, no greasy or oily feelings, great to use after a toner and before a moisturizer as an extra measure to prevent aging :)</li>
            <li>I have received compliments from friends and acquaintances about how great my skin looks and how young I look at my age.</li>
            <li>Smells lightly like orange, which i love.</li>
            <li>I love how light this product feels on my skin</li>
            <li>I would love to get a free sample of this product</li>
            <li>But so far it has been a great experience.</li>
            <li>I love the smooth feel on my face after using it.its non sticky and absorbs well in skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but decided it was time to really start taking care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked that it absorbed well into the skin and didn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.  </li>
            <li>My skin is looking better by the day, so far so good. :)</li>
            <li>Not only are there products effective providing great results, there customer service is fabulous as well.</li>
            <li>Love Love Love Great Product I will use this as long as that keep making it!</li>
            <li>I quickly noticed a better texture with my skin and a more even tone.</li>
            <li>I really like it, the texture is great, glides on skin easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I am quite happy with the results; the nasolabial folds are noticeably lighter and the fine surface lines are nearly unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product, does not cause irritation or redness but does help clear my blemishes and soften fine lines.</li>
            <li>I have used other Vitamin C Serums, but this one works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin has been a lot more glowing and has cleared up and evened out significantly since I&#x27;ve started using this product.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff, worth the try!</li>
            <li>I will say that in no way influenced my review as I am very happy with this and all the other Instanatural products I have.</li>
            <li>The other vitamins in this product are all wonderful for your skin.</li>

            <li>also I use the combination on my face (acne discoloration and very mild scarring)</li>
            <li>I love how nicely and fast it absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>That is my preference for easy control of use.  </li>
            <li>My face breaks out so easily</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I like the dropper design which makes it really easy to use.</li>

            <li>After using the Vitamin C Serum, within the first 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed amazing results of my aging spots lightening.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on week 2 of the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum, and so far I am loving it!</li>
            <li>This was my first c serum, but I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li>This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve bought to reduce dark spots.</li>
            <li>After about a week of use, my dark circles under my eyes began to look lighter, which was awesome.</li>
            <li>Still waiting to see if it will fade my sunspots, but so far I am loving this!</li>
            <li>Firstly, I received this moisturizer as a sample to provide my honest feedback on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve heard awesome things about using vitamin C on your skin -- to both treat wrinkles and dark spots on your face, but also to help prevent them from even appearing.</li>
            <li>Also , it has a citrus scent which I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about at first</li>
            <li>I was wondering how many true users reviews were posted here.</li>
            <li>My first time ordering this I liked the product so decided to order it again.</li>
            <li>its  ok  not  bad  </li>
            <li>I compared it with the best selling Vitamin C Serum on Amazon, and it won hands down for me.</li>
            <li>I have very fine lines when I smile.  </li>
            <li>The product is very high quality, has a very pleasant odor and so far seems to be helping</li>
            <li>Perfect texture, wonderful, subtle citrus scent, and my skin in general seems more &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; and has a glow, to the point where I rarely wear foundation anymore.</li>
            <li>Great Vitamin C Serum that makes my skin feel super soft!  </li>
            <li>The new serum smells so good and glides on my face without being tacky nor sticky.</li>
            <li>While there is a bit of tackiness, it is overall very light and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>the vitamin c serm works ive been useing it for 2 weeks now and see the diffence on my fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li>Now with about a month&#x27;s use Ive notice fine lines are gradually diminishing.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C helps to boost collagen production which in turn helps diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and even sun or age spots.</li>
            <li>which is fine because we should be moisturizing our face all the time anyway.</li>
            <li>My fine lines around the eyes are almost gone</li>
            <li>My fine lines around the eyes are almost gone</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed fewer of the fine lines I used to have.</li>
            <li>I focus on the fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead.</li>
            <li>but now I can easily cover it with light foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li>Lessens fine lines.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin dewy and plumped, works wonders on fine lines.</li>
            <li>Yes, I would recommend this to anyone that is concerned with fine lines and would like a smoother texture to their skin.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks, so at this point I dont feel Im able to give it a completely fair review.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>

            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Really good stuff so far.  </li>
            <li>so its good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard Vitamin C is good for many purposes when it comes to the human body.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>it has other good things as well that support healthy skin!  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good....</li>
            <li>so you really need to make sure you put some on top of this serum.</li>
            <li>I think this serum is keeping my skin in good shape (62 years old) but no drastic changes.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed significant results with my complexion and the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, absorbs quickly, is a great first step in combination with my 10% Glycolic Acid Cream (by Reviva) for my 55 year old skin.</li>
            <li>As for my daughter&#x27;s acne, she said for the first time in a very long time, she feels beautiful!</li>
            <li>This is a great product from insta natural as well as all the other great oils they have.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very nice &amp; smooth after using it &amp; I use it daily.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li>company is very good about replacements or refunds--once the product has been tried of course; so I&#x27;m not concerned other than:  </li>
            <li>This made my face really glow!!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very effective in treating acne and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li>Serum looks and smells very fresh.  </li>
            <li>a very useful</li>
            <li>The pink grapefruit oil has a very light and pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I hope Instanatural will keep this original formula (caffeine free) and its affordable price, so</li>
            <li>This product is rich, goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>I first started using the Insta natural eye gel and absolutely loved it, so I decided to try more products.</li>
            <li>It works great - saw my brown spots lighten considerably and my wrinkles less noticeable - plus, it feels very refreshing on my skin!</li>
            <li>Smells good, dries quickly, and seems to be evening out my skin tone so far!</li>
            <li>However, the great ingredients lean me to give this a better than average, four-star rating.</li>
            <li>The dropper makes it easy to apply and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I noticed that after my first use, the oils absorbed nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li>Without a doubt I will recommend this product to anybody who wants soft, even toned, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that tends to \\&quot;shine\\&quot; pretty easily, so I have kind of avoided serums, since I am pretty nervous about using anything with oil in it.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>As with most products it&#x27;s important to use it consistently and as directed...</li>
            <li>Smell is ok, and it goes on smoothly on the skin and gets absorbed rather quickly.</li>
            <li>and he really likes it and his skin is looking pretty good.  </li>
            <li>Their price is very affordable and I think works just as good as a higher priced product.</li>
            <li>C serum by Insta natural full of good ingredients that our skin needs .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily dispensed in an eyedropper and spreads on quickly on your face.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easy, and dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice stuff, great orange smell but not sure if I see any difference in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It glides on and absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>But, this serum goes on easily and drys quickly and does not bother my eyes.</li>
            <li>and this is a new and improved version that I LOVE!</li>
            <li>This serum is great and more concentrated than my previous serum.</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and has a light grapefruit smell - if you don&#x27;t like smells don&#x27;t worry, it quickly fades.  </li>
            <li>The addition of Sea Buckthorn Oil makes it unique.</li>
            <li>I use this product along with derm roller and haven&#x27;t seen significant result yet.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used many more expensive Vit C brands, from Obagi to Ole&#x27; Henriksen: those products have nothing over InstaNatural - there are excellent skin nutrients included</li>
            <li>As of now, I&#x27;ve seen a significant difference in my face.</li>
            <li>Not only has this cleared up all of my blemishes, but I have a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that I am loving!</li>
            <li>Fell in love with my first application:  </li>
            <li>I wait for the serum to get absorbed into my skin (sometimes hours), but my skin always feel sticky!  </li>
            <li>So far, I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have used Vitamin C serum before so I am familiar with its use and texture.</li>
            <li>Love this product.it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I am floored with how well this serum has worked so far and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Have been using for about 3 weeks, have seen a significant improvement on skin texture.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The discoloration on my skin has been improving significantly, it is still there</li>
            <li>Excited to have found this product.</li>
            <li>This serum is a keeper and I&#x27;m also very satisfied with the eye gel and retinol moisturizer from insta natural.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure that this one would do anything for me, especially since it was relatively cheap.</li>
            <li>the service was prompt , the price is a bit pricey , but worth it !&lt;</li>
            <li>Within the first couple of days after using it, my face felt smoother, tighter, and more refreshed.</li>
            <li>This has a rich feel to it.</li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m sure Vitamin C is good in general if applied consistently.</li>
            <li>The original was too &amp;#34;gel-y&amp;#34; and I didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and it helps reduce fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Had some areas of discoloration from sun and acne and it has significantly improved those areas.</li>
            <li>It has a rich, silky feel to it,which makes it a pleasure to aply.  </li>
            <li>So when I had a chance to try again in liquid form, I was excited.  </li>
            <li>I would get more when I am done with my first bottle.</li>
            <li>This product has brightened up my face significantly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was love at first use with me.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this</li>
            <li>I really love this serum straight away my skin feels plumper and brighter!</li>
            <li>the service was prompt , the price is a bit pricey , but worth it !&lt;</li>
            <li>The laugh lines around my mouth are softer &amp; my skin seems brighter &amp; clearer too!  </li>
            <li>I have used several Vitamin C serums, and this is the best so far!  </li>
            <li>My skin looks fresh when I wake up!</li>

            <li>Bought this for my wife, because she wanted to compare it to another similar brand we recently purchased, and it&#x27;s honestly just as good!</li>
            <li>Smells great ,It is the texture of  water, non greasy, goes on nicely and soaks right in, I&#x27;m 52 and can&#x27;t really say whether it will help my wrinkles, I will have to see over a long period of time.</li>
            <li>Great product.. so gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years and this one, by far, is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>hoping it would clean up some scaring</li>
            <li>I have used several of Insta Natural products now and have been very happy with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used several of Insta Natural products now and have been very happy with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used several of Insta Natural products now and have been very happy with all of them.</li>
            <li>Skin feels clean</li>
            <li>I really like that I can smooth out my irritated skin from the day and be able to apply make up on a more&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;smooth canvas&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>I wish they&#x27;d settle on a formula or they&#x27;d clean out their inventory and restock from scratch.</li>
            <li>Its smell is lightly citrus, and the serum absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>see a marked difference for the better for better</li>
            <li>Every am, I clean my face and neck.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and the serum absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It is absorbed easily by the skin and does not leave skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li>It absorbs really quick and can be used with oils because it is so light.</li>
            <li>I find the product works best if used just prior to going to sleep; this helps take advantage of the natural healing ability of my skin during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Clean.  </li>
            <li>My skin is more hydrated, even, and clear, and it just looks better as well.</li>
            <li>like oranges and so clean.</li>
            <li>but I needed to repair my face from the damage of the Caribbean sun, to regain moisture and to clean clogged pores.</li>
            <li>The great ingredients should be helpful with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>It has a clean, citrus aroma.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li>It is a bright sherbet orange color which comes naturally from an ingredient not artificially colored.  </li>
            <li>I was excited to receive these oils to try, I use the  rosehip seed oil in a rose petal salve and used it on my elbows and they have stayed soft for along time!  </li>
            <li>My laugh lines around my eyes are greatly diminished, and overall skin tone is healthier.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels clean, freshening and also makes my face glow.</li>
            <li>I apply it after using the toner on clean skin.</li>
            <li>it makes your face look so nice and smooth and clear</li>
            <li>The serum absorbs very quickly and smells like fresh oranges.</li>
            <li>The liquid is actually orange and has a pleasant citrus note to it.  </li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite vitamin c serums!</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>It smells nice (kind of like oranges, albeit a little chemical-y), absorbs easily, is lightweight and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She says that one bottle lasts her a little over two months, which we both consider to be a very good value considering what noticeable results she&#x27;s gotten already.  </li>
            <li>After 3 days, when I was getting ready in the morning, I realized the fine lines through my cheeks had almost disappeared!</li>
            <li>The toner leaked during transit and CS instantly and graciously shipped a replacement bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a Fave company now!!&lt;br /&gt;Great natural ingredients, good pricing with Outstanding communication, what more can we ask for Ladies??!!&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t think I will be asking for a refund since I&#x27;m pretty satisfied, knowing that you can get your money back if unsatisfied is pretty great.</li>
            <li>Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li>The formula soaks right in, it&#x27;s not sticky and does not have any strong odors.</li>
            <li>On it&#x27;s own or combined with other products, I do find that it leaves my skin looking and feeling plump and also leaves a nice glow on my face.</li>
            <li>These new wave serums are great for improving dry skin and smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, after a couple of weeks you can start to see the effects work their magic.</li>
            <li>(hey, exfoliation right?!).  </li>
            <li>Smells very nice and doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li>It spreads easily and is absorbed fairly quickly .</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C Serum has improved my skin tone and texture,  giving me smooth clean and fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and went on easily.</li>
            <li>love how Vitamin C is very very high up on the ingredient</li>

            <li>Fine to use under makeup or right before bed.</li>
            <li>First, let me be upfront about the fact that the good people at Insta Natural sent me this product to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have never really tried any serums before so I was happy to review this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I had great results with the moisturizer, I expected to see results with this serum.</li>
            <li>It does make my face feel better, as long as I use my own skin conditioner (as recommended by the seller)</li>
            <li>I used my first bottle and can&#x27;t honestly say that I see much improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

            <li>MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SERUM.</li>
            <li>full blown pimple</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous Vitamin C serum, one of the best ones I have tried (and I have tried several), this will definitely be a repurchase for me!!</li>
            <li>To say the least I am very impressed by the products they provide, the effectiveness of the product and the price point is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was kind of orange and from what I have researched is that it is to be clear somewhat.  </li>
            <li>No bad reaction from it.</li>
            <li>I will keep using it since I&#x27;ve had no bad side effects whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using another vitamin C product for a while but decided to switch to this brand because of the great reviews and ingredients in this product-it seemed to contain more vitamins and other great, natural ingredients that my current one didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now</li>
            <li>It smells great and it sinks quickly into the skin.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t find it to do anything super noticeable on my skin, the smell is not my favourite (citrus)</li>
            <li>I have just started using it on my eyes along with the eye gel and am pleased with the combined effect, my eyes even seem to be more open.</li>

            <li>Vitamin C serum is a natural way to produce collagen and great natural moisturizer for the skin.</li>

            <li>I will say though, don&#x27;t put too much on, or you&#x27;ll be left with some orange colored residue - LOL.  </li>
            <li>The serum goes on quickly and keep my skin moisturized for hours.</li>

            <li>Smells amazing and goes on smooth, having only used it a couple of weeks and not every day</li>
            <li>Seems I must use a LOT of product to feel like I&#x27;m getting adequate coverage.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to be fading quickly.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs in the skin quickly but leaves the skin feeling hydrated and looking rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>Thanks to InstaNatural for such a great item that allows me to no longer feel embarrassed by my complexion.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and I can put my sunscreen and makeup over it.</li>
            <li>I used this product because it was provided free for me to test out and give my honest feedback, but I doubt that I would repurchase it simply because I did not notice any difference in the way</li>
            <li>but it absorbs quickly and does not have any sort of sticky/residue feel.</li>
            <li>It was delivered quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Vitamin C capsule before, quickly gave up use</li>

            <li>It dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized</li>
            <li>It leaves a mild matte feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly rather than just filling in the wrinkles and then flaking off.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find it sticky and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li>As I continue to use, I notice my skin becomes smooth, soft and plump, I really love the vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li>Skin is nice &amp; smooth &amp; it is definitely smoothing out the crows feet.</li>
            <li>This serum absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling after using it.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>First product I&#x27;ve found, short of prescription anti-virals, that I can successfully use against Shingles.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used it steadily for a month, and I am pleased with the application ( and hopefully results)</li>
            <li>I have seen an improvement in my skin and it seems firmer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t honestly say if I&#x27;ve seen a major difference</li>
            <li>Fantastic packaging and very high quality product!</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve not been able to notice any major skin improvements regarding any fine lines or age spots</li>
            <li>I will update review as I use this product more, I really was not expecting any kind of results right away, but I cannot deny my skin has a clean even tone, not drastic but enough that I can tell and have gotten a couple of comments.</li>
            <li>1 month and am very pleased to say that I&#x27;ve actually noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>third notable thing about this product I&#x27;ve noticed, and perhaps the most exciting, is that the wrinkles around my eyes seem to be smoothing out.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results of this product after only using it for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>One of the times I mixed it with a homemade face mask, and got a great, bright, and firm face from it.</li>
            <li>I normally put a cream on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I noticed a shine and smoothness to my face after my very first use.  </li>
            <li>My daughter is impressed with how smooth and silky my 50 year old male face feels, and from a 15 year old that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li>You then leave it absorb naturally into your skin followed by the addition of a suitable moisturiser.</li>
            <li>First of all, I did not receive a free bottle or any sort of promotion for this item.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it</li>
            <li>With Great results, Diminishing The Look Dark circles.</li>
            <li>At first I broke out but with continued use my face became smooth.</li>
            <li>This was like watered down orange juice, smelled great</li>
            <li>but with consistent use, her skintone, fine lines, forehead and smile lines are noticeably diminished.  </li>
            <li>I end up using more than the 2-3 drops (more like a dropper full) and let it dry before applying the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I love all the attributes and pay way less than the serum from my dermatologist and this has more vitamin C %. !</li>
            <li>It absorbs pretty nice, it has a pleasant smell, a little bit of product covers my whole face, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and it works well even under make</li>
            <li>The new, improved formula has a slightly more viscous consistency, which makes it easier to apply to the skin.</li>
            <li>And this is now my new favorite skin serum.</li>
            <li>I have used Timeless Vitamin C serum previously and it was great on my pores and scars.</li>
            <li>also feel great because you sent another bottle since first shipment does not arrive as expected.</li>
            <li>This serum glides on my skin and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>So far so good, too soon for more results...an old scar on my cheek is healing and not red and sore looking any more.  </li>
            <li>Absorbed quickly into the skin after face washed.</li>
            <li>I like the consistency of this serum  and how quickly it gets absorbed</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference for spots and small wrinkles, but has a nice smell and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and many products cause severe dermatitis but not this.</li>
            <li>i am pushing 40 and look very early 30s :)</li>
            <li>I love that this has so many great ingredients that are beneficial to the skin for many different concerns but is a natural product not filled with garbage and fillers.</li>
            <li>I immediately feel my face tighten and smooth and have noticed a significant difference around my eyes in particular.  </li>
            <li>I used it for 3 weeks, 2 drops every night after toner and before facial cream, it&#x27;s very light and absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone interested improving the look of her skin!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m getting compliments about how healthy and young I look!</li>
            <li>It is also nice &amp; soft, without the &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; patches I have experienced in the past.  </li>
            <li>I cannot attest to what it does long term, but it feels refreshing, goes on light, and gives a light moisturizing feel.</li>
            <li>For the price and quality, you simply cannot find anything better!</li>
            <li>In the first place, it smells like oranges!</li>
            <li>,exactly I being looking for!</li>
            <li>Once dry top of with your favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My skin drinks this in and it really diminishes the fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I really does get rid of fine lines and skin discolorations.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much smoother and with no visible fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed the fine lines were no longer as noticeable and my skin felt much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li>Seems to work fine, but is very watery.  </li>
            <li>it has removed some brown spots and helped on my pores...can&#x27;t say it has done much for fine lines or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I think it is really helping my fine lines and pores.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a great product, I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks and have used other brand name products that are considerably higher in price.</li>
            <li>I use it 2 weeks, I have had little spots and I was waiting for this great serum to test it on the spot.</li>
            <li>Fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable and it does make my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I tried this with my hot/cold infuser machine, this vitamin c serum work really well, I notice the fine lines on my forehead is lighter, also the laugh lines.</li>
            <li>I have most definitely noticed a difference in skin tone and also seen a diminished of fine lines around the mouth and eyes.  </li>
            <li>but the fine lines under my eyes and forehead are also starting to smooth out!</li>
            <li>I am a retired woman with very fair skin who has lived her entire life in beach states that advertise themselves as being sunny all the time, and a woman whose career kept her outside in the sun a majority of her work hours.  </li>
            <li>My skin routine is pretty simple, I either use regular soap, baby wash (cheap, gentle makeup remover), or L&#x27;Oreal &amp;#34;Go 360 Clean, Ideal Clean&amp;#34; to wash and follow up with a bit of moisturizer in my T zone.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since switch to another C product that has 22% + 5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum (available on Amazon) and am using their moisturizer product they have as a combo after using Clinique #1 and #2 prep lotions (not moisturizers) that ready the skin to receive serum</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly and and is very concentrated.</li>
            <li>I do need to note that this product was reviewed free for testing purposes, but I can assure you this product is the real deal</li>
            <li>It really works I have noticed a huge difference in my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li>It has made such an amazing difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li>The serum is light yet very moisturizing, but not greasy.</li>
            <li>The price is fantastic, real affordabale for those of us on a budget.</li>
            <li>The ingredients in this serum are nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>Lastly, their customer service is amazing.</li>

            <li>Love it so far, does pumped up my skin and keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li>The ingredients such as Sea Buckthorn oil, Rose HIp Seed Oil, Ferulic Acid, Carrot Seed Oil, Apricot, Kernel Oil, etc .</li>
            <li>This Company is awesome and stand behind their product 100%.</li>
            <li>After some research on InstaNatural and their Vitamin C Serum, I concluded that it was in the clear, and let me tell you, I am so glad I did that.</li>
            <li>This is not a one time thing, as I noticed that over continued use, my skin has become much more soft than before.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the retinol serum thus far.  </li>
            <li>After I wash my face clean, pat dry and apply a warm towel on my skin for 10 seconds or so</li>
            <li>This serum is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my skin feel fresh and soft :)</li>
            <li>A couple of them seem smaller, but honestly, your pores serve a purpose.</li>
            <li>Not for $50 though...them seem smaller, but honestly, your pores serve a purpose.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but at 31 I have a forehead line and a laugh line beginning to show.</li>
            <li>The company has emailed me to check to see how I liked their products and give me proper instructions on how to apply their products.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect for rehydrating skin, leaving it soft and healthy</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re like me and you plan to use the two in combination, you&#x27;ll be ordering the serum more frequently.</li>
            <li>Then put on this serum, and finally some carrot seed, rose hip, jojoba face oil.</li>
            <li>I started to do some personal &amp;#34;research&amp;#34; of my own with products and found&lt;br</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re young, it&#x27;s good to take care of your skin early with Vitamin C serum and Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>which I don&#x27;t like and a lot of vitamin C serums are like; however, it completely absorbed into skin and did NOT leave a tacky/greasy residue, which is a pet peeve of mine.  </li>
            <li>It goes on a bit tacky/sticky but is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li>The serum arrived on time, well-packed and so far I am enjoying using it.  </li>
            <li>and I have to allow time for it to be absorbed (maybe 8 minutes) into my skin before adding moisturizer in the evening.  </li>
            <li>This review was given after receiving a complimentary bottle of the serum for an open and honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li>and I do see a noticeably firmer, more clear complexion.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok, sort of like old oranges</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin moisturised,  firmer and a more clear complexion.  </li>
            <li>I like to add an extra drop or two of organic rose hip oil</li>
            <li>It makes skin feel soft and smells not bad!!</li>
            <li>It smells nice and is orange in color, absorbs instantly</li>
            <li>I am really pleased so far</li>
            <li>and so far I love them.</li>
            <li>I have come to love Insta Natural and all of it&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li>received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh orange smell and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin sticky.  </li>
            <li>I love the results so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two weeks now,  and I&#x27;m so satisfied with Instanatural, I placed their Rose Hips and B3 serum in my shopping cart and will be purchasing extra bottles to bring home to my country.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of Vit C serum and this one seems to be doing the job quite nicely.</li>
            <li>The addition of the rose hip oil is such a bonus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that protects and repairs your skin.</li>
            <li>Nice absorption and overall hydration</li>
            <li>but I can notice an improvement in my smile lines.</li>
            <li>This is a company worth dealing with.</li>
            <li>For $20, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li>but I will say that my skin has never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li>Smells nice but left my face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I have always had skin issues ranging from sensitivity and Rosaceae to adult acne and many products irritate or cause flare ups</li>
            <li>I love that the InstaNatural products are all natural.</li>
            <li>So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
            <li>useful.amin c serum will be useful.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This is the fifth product I&#x27;ve tried from Insta Natural, and once again, I love everything about it.</li>
            <li>This serum smells fantastic, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Looks and smells like fresh squeezed oranges.</li>
            <li>Gives my skin a nice glow - Will definitely keep using it!</li>
            <li>I can say I like this serum because it contains vitamin C , tea tree oil, AND salicylic acid which WORKS WELL for acne and the powerful anti aging retinol.</li>
            <li>I attribute this to a comprehensive approach of phytoceramides, vitamin c serum, eye serum, vitamin c toner or rose water toner and rosehip seed oil or emu oil, although, I may not use the rosehip seed oil of emu oil daily.</li>
            <li>I squeeze out the dropper in one hand and immediately place the top back on, securely, even before I apply the product.  </li>
            <li>not extremely heavy or harsh, another great product from InstaNatural!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying this so far and plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is also naturally occurring and not at all offensive by comparison to the perfumes added to most cosmetics sold.  </li>
            <li>This one smells like fresh oranges.  </li>
            <li>I love natural beauty products that work</li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>A rarely have to use foundation anymore</li>
            <li>Hi I am a 41 year old female and I am always looking for what works great with my skin.</li>
            <li>I have now used it for a couple of weeks, and I noticed that the darker spot of sun damage I had has lightened considerably, and my complexion is more even.  </li>
            <li>So far I really love this serum.  </li>
            <li>I will order more at Amazon.com, since it is affordable and gives as good results as more expensive products I have tried.</li>
            <li>Been using vitamin C for a while, but this s my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve become Leary of many products.</li>
            <li>It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with all the InstaNatural products that I have tried so far and</li>
            <li>I was getting low and just couldn&#x27;t see spending that kind of money on it any longer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to try their face moisturizer and Rose Hip oil next.</li>
            <li>I love the face that this is all natural.</li>
            <li>I love how soft my skin is with thi.</li>
            <li>Like the toner, it has a fresh citrus scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To get the most out of the product its best to wash and gently dry the skin and then add a small amount to your face, neck and surrounding areas with your hands.</li>
            <li>My skin tone has eened out significantly and even super old acne scars, and one chemical burn on my face have faded significantly.</li>
            <li>I love the citrus-y scent, and the serum absorbs very quickly — sometimes so quickly, in fact, that I have to use a few more drops to make sure my entire face has been treated.</li>
            <li>so I am very excited about this unexpected result.  </li>
            <li>I had nothing to loose, I was very happily surprised to find some great items and they are not all full of chemicals that I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li>I do not appreciate becoming a test market for new products without a choice.  </li>
            <li>At my age, expectations weren&#x27;t high, but I think it does make my skin a little more supple--and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li>tried Vitamin C and in the last 2 weeks I see a significant change in the coloration, I believe it might take couple of more</li>
            <li>In particular, we noticed that it has reduced some of the fine lines and discoloration that she had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other products from this company &amp; absolutely love all of them (from their hair products to face products).  </li>
            <li>First two days everything was fine but next day she had many pimples, so she stoped using it.</li>
            <li>And it soaked into my skin pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Nice fresh citrus scent, fast absorbing and fast fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It absorb in the skin pretty quickly and my skin has lightened just after using it for a week.</li>
            <li>and they sent it pretty quickly</li>
            <li>my skin looks great and the little lines around my eyes are looking better and less there - love this stuff</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought many different items from InstaNaturals and all I can say is between the very attentive customer service to the products themselves - they live up to the raving reviews they receive.</li>
            <li>No other product compares &amp; their prices are really great too compared to similar products out there.  </li>
            <li>GOOD, OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li>if you have some brown spots, this is a good serum to have for those or any other kinds of discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>Just remember not to get excited and use too much...</li>
            <li>Brightens skin, can see a difference right away.</li>
            <li>Even without my makeup on it doesn&#x27;t feel right on me and my face also feels itchy.</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>and I was right.</li>
            <li>Soaks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>I get right before I start</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and drinks right into the skin.</li>
            <li>It is not oily and it goes right into my skin.</li>
            <li>It soaks right into your skin, like giving it a drink.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t break out anymore, and if I do, I notice it right from the start and</li>
            <li>It just didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells wonderful, goes on smooth - a few drops go a long way!  </li>
            <li>Talk about making a positive difference!</li>
            <li>My face positively glows!</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a huge improvement in my sunspots, which is my main area of concern.</li>
            <li>I really feel like it  absorbs b/c the formula is so light, it really feels and smells like a drop of orange juice!  </li>
            <li>The first night I used this under my rose hip seed oil mixed into some moisturizer.</li>
            <li>good way to use this is to add it onto your normal moisturizer or even your sunscreen for some extra skin benefits.</li>
            <li>They sent a nice email explaining how to take care of the bottle and how long you can expect the serum to remain useful before it expires.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s thick and sticky,The fragrance is very nice though, a clean orange smell.</li>
            <li>Customer service was very professional and answered my questions promptly… My package was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li>I have very very large pores.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly leaving my face soft, smooth and brighter looking.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Since using this product my skin is brighter, wrinkles appear less around my eyes, skin has more clarity and feels much more supple.  </li>
            <li>This is a very high quality product and I will definitely get more when it runs out!  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C Serum is full of wonderful ingredients (vitamin c, argan oil, rosehip oil, plan stem cells, and pomegranate, just to name a few).&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on smoothly, smells amazing, has a slight cooling effect, and over the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;m actually seeing results!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So happy I was given this to try for a small fee, will defineatly buy it again.</li>
            <li>I use everyday and has helped my skin look tighter and has a nice glow to it!</li>
            <li>I love the entire InstaNatural product line, but this serum is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li>In general, I love this serum.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled across this serum and began using it on freshly cleansed skin as the first step of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li>I love this serum because it&#x27;s natural, cruelty free and has high concentrations of vitamin C to clear my pores and keep my skin smooth and glowing;)</li>
            <li>I end up getting more sun exposure than I should and &amp;#34;beauty sleep&amp;#34; gets interrupted by my precious little baby.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the new formula.  </li>
            <li>I finish up with pure rosehip seed oil and my face feels flipping amaze like all day!</li>
            <li>like this, and will actually purchase this again for the sole fact that it made my skin look bright, clean and have an even complexion(of course under my acne and wrinkles)</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel really soft, absorbs very quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li>Not much difference in the smile lines (nice way to say wrinkles)</li>
            <li>I’m battling dry skin every night after I take a shower, so I’m always happy to try something that provides quick and lasting moisture.</li>
            <li>but feels great on skin especially when I follow up with my daily moisturizer as it recommends.</li>
            <li>The formula is completely gentle and super moisturizing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I made sure to wait a few weeks after using this product to write a review, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m big on how things smell (especially on my face) and this smells great and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>I bought this vitamin c serum after really wanting to just try a healthier, more natural formula for my face.  </li>
            <li>Very orange smell, absorbs in skin quickly.</li>
            <li>This product contain so many healthy ingredients which is a major plus for me especially the vitamin E.</li>
            <li>Face is very soft and smooth .</li>
            <li>My face felt very soft and oil free.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen drastic changes yet, but my skin does feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I like it very much , but have to admit that i absolutely LOVED the previous formula, (just Vitamin C 20%)</li>
            <li>Look at me being all smart and responsible with my skin!!  </li>
            <li>I really was blown away the very first time I used this.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s pretty good but only been using it.</li>
            <li>and it is helping very much with the feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I like the Vitamin C Serum very much.  </li>
            <li>I Recomend it very much</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li>very fast delivery also.</li>
            <li>and I very much like them all.</li>
            <li>And the cost of both are very reasonable</li>
            <li>Absorb into skin in about 15 second, my face feels very smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin and very VERY oily.</li>
            <li>Very highly recommend!</li>
            <li>while pores warm and open, I applied the serum, and face was super soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could look young, but I am fine with how I look now.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>: It works well on my oily, sensitive skin, and should be fine for others.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthier than ever, more stable in terms of not getting too dry or oily than ever before, and even some redness I have dealt with for MANY YEARS has lessened considerably.</li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and it has softened the wrinkles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li>Last but not least, I love the price!</li>
            <li>I have purchased other Vitamin C serums, and though they were ok, this one  is really fantastic.  </li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t super strong and it is very light and delicate on your skin once the serum is absorbed.</li>
            <li>but this magic made the dark circles disappear and the fine lines to go away too.</li>
            <li>Now that I am getting older, it&#x27;s really nice to have a product that turns the clock back.</li>
            <li>I am huge believer of natural products.</li>
            <li>My skin appears more youthful and I&#x27;m noticing that some of my fine lines are getting somewhat less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I took the opportunity to asked them for a product to target dark spots; they recommended Rosehip oil (they sent me this huge bottle of it to try out for free!</li>
            <li>Her appearance as a professional is of paramount importance; thus, she has an incentive to accurately review this product.  </li>
            <li>I ve been use it for 2 weeks only at night time and my skin  looks better.</li>
            <li>and I love how much smaller my pores have been getting.</li>
            <li>Can I tell you how many different products I&#x27;ve tried over the years???</li>
            <li>I was using a different c serum by ncn which cost more</li>
            <li>You can feel it tightening your skin but not too much!</li>
            <li>but overall I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I did want to update my first review anyway, which is how I noticed it was removed.</li>
            <li>I use it as a moisturizer as my face produces so much oil!</li>
            <li>Love it only after 3 days!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now, and as of about a week ago I can say I see consistent change.</li>
            <li>Of course when I first used it there were immediate results, but those tend to go away.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;first product I have used where I have actually been able to notice a&lt;br /&gt;change.  </li>
            <li>the color and scent are enough to throw me off even if I did get better results.  </li>
            <li>As a 40+ year old woman, this is important to me.</li>
            <li>Yet I don&#x27;t see a great difference in using this in place of the Vitamin C moisturizer or with it (at least not yet).</li>
            <li>I finally jumped the bandwagon of Vitamin C serum users and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>skin felt smoother after the first three days of using it.</li>
            <li>i use their anti-aging facial moisturizer cream on top.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks healthy now and the lines above my lips are not so visible.</li>
            <li>I put this on first.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels great, it felt softer even after the first use, and the feeling lasts at least two days for me.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for products that would actually work on my face because most don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I am sure I have finally found what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>My face felt smooth and soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;Serums contain up to three times as many nutrients as creams and in the highest possible concentration,&amp;#34; says Eric Gooris, director of Clairns Laboratories in Paris.  </li>
            <li>Fruit acids such as vitamin C  help to regulate Melanin production and leave the complexion looking more even.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this serum has higher concentration for my skin but</li>
            <li>my face is so much softer since using this serum!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I use it after my toner and it glides on the skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>I love this serum for multiple reasons.</li>
            <li>My skin really drinks this Serum up!  </li>
            <li>Like straight up yummy yummy citrus!</li>
            <li>I have hope that in the next three months I will notice better results with my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product applied once per day after cleansing with the witch hazel has left the skin smoother and more even looking.  </li>
            <li>I love this entire product line.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li>Do the peel instructions first, then after you&#x27;ve healed from the peel, use this to keep your skin glowing.</li>
            <li>From the first use it made my skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li>if you order this Vitamin C Serum make sure before you open it that you received the correct order.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going on a week of using the products every day and my skin feels hydrated, firmer and overall better looking.</li>
            <li>Well, unfortunately no.  </li>
            <li>I have been using several InstaNatural products, and the love affair continues.  </li>
            <li>I personally use and love InstaNatural Vitamin C Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It only take a couple drops for my face, and a couple more for my neck and décolletage.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>In hot weather I wear it alone, but in dryer times, I pair it with the Instanatural Vit C moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>this is one of this terrific line that I just love.</li>
            <li>I did have some breakout during first two weeks of use</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
            <li>if more the subsequent moisturiser ‘balls’.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was unbelievably fast!  </li>
            <li>I see a difference from when I first began applying it.</li>
            <li>so I definitely intend to give it more time.</li>
            <li>Love the result the second morning.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware my skin needed vitamin C till a friend said so.</li>
            <li>First time using it</li>
            <li>It smells great and is thick dose not  burn when you put it on.</li>
            <li>I will probably update my review after I finish my first bottle.</li>
            <li>Be aware it may almost feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; &#x27;</li>
            <li>I would suggest using a regular moisturizer on top of this at night, and some sort of a sunscreen moisturizer during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>- smells funny sort like over ripe/spoilt citrus fruit smell</li>
            <li>a day is that my overall complexion looks brighter and more translucent.</li>
            <li>I love that it doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in it, the company doesn&#x27;t pop up in the ewg&#x27;s skin deep website, but I checked all the ingredients</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product 2 times, the first time it was the end of winter</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the color and the fact that many oils added to it which caused me breakouts and above all of that</li>
            <li>She had tried many anti aging products in the past but most haven&#x27;t done anything.</li>
            <li>I have only been doing this once a day, in the mornings - though it may work better at night.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and my pores are visibly smaller, my skin looks healthy too.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel soft and smooth, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in either lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li>love that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance because I can get massive headaches with products that feel they need to add some type of fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love it and currently using it.</li>
            <li>My eyes feel different and look so much better.</li>
            <li>Not only do I love the product</li>
            <li>It makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Thanks Instanatural!</li>
            <li>I noticed her skin looked pretty too, and it turns out she had been using a vitamin c cream.</li>
            <li>Try it, but exfoliate well first  </li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>I will definitely order more</li>
            <li>I have been using it for two weeks consistently.</li>
            <li>My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li>If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li>This one did exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>At first use,  you may think that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s just the first application.</li>
            <li>so your face stays hydrated longer, which is why you use it in the first place.</li>
            <li>THE 1 OZ GOES SO FAST!</li>
            <li>I really wished this serum had worked!  </li>
            <li>I love the vitamin c serum it plumps my skin up almost instantly, and it stays that way all day.</li>
            <li>The first couple of uses made me think this serum would be too drying, but I stuck with it.  </li>
            <li>It work just as well as  the more expensive kind I will be reordering!</li>
            <li>and you will be pleased with the result soon enough.</li>
            <li>This has helped soooooo much!</li>
            <li>have been using this serum on daily basis for about a month now and my skin seems firmer, more hydrated and healthier-looking.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li>serum,,,I love how a tiny bit goes along way and</li>
            <li>It is a bit tacky when it&#x27;s first applied, but if you follow it up with moisturizer, it just adds to the healing qualities of this serum.  </li>
            <li>Smell is light, natural, and uplifting.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it...but am at a loss to what exactly it *might* be helping me with skin-wise.  </li>
            <li>This serum does exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The only thing that would make it better is to be in a pump instead of a dropper.  </li>
            <li>My skin is soft and acne free.</li>
            <li>I started using this about 2 weeks ago and while I can&#x27;t see any dramatic changes just yet, I&#x27;m enjoying the refreshing scent and easy application.  </li>
            <li>plus I also receive compliments on my pretty skin.</li>
            <li>Having purchased several products from this line, I must say this ties the Youth Express Eye Gel as my favorite.  </li>
            <li>my skin felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>but I think I actually used more than I needed to so</li>
            <li>The product comes in a dark bottle as vitamin C should not be exposed to light to remain potent.</li>
            <li>It is so light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and my skin immediately feels soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It definitely made my skin feel softer and more elastic.</li>
            <li>It also feels a bit tightened but not uncomfortable just noticeable and brightened if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li>I have finished my first bottle of the Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li>My pores do seem smaller and my skin seems to be more even in color.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to carry an immediate impact but if used consistently you will see result and the results are undeniable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not had that problem with this product, and I was back on here looking to see what more I can find that is made by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have never written a review of any product,  </li>
            <li>I am curious to see if the Rose Oil will works as well as this serum did, I will have to wait until it goes on sale.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li>, brighter, more even, even some in spots are already starting to fade!</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth and moisturized without feeling oily at all..</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer after using this!</li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this product and will definitely be buying again when I run out! ...</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this skin care line</li>
            <li>My skin looks healthier after the first week.</li>
            <li>Did notice sun spots fading within the first month of using it.  </li>
            <li>For the first week, I used it before going to sleep.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of the Vitamin C Serum however, the Retinol Serum and Youth Express Eye Serum</li>
            <li>It works different then a moisturizer more like an oil but not oily.</li>
            <li>I hope in the future days to see much better results.</li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of this product</li>
            <li>It really has made my face brighten up!  </li>
            <li>I use with a derma roller first at night, then let the serum soak in.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think that this has helped improve the tone and texture of my skin, and I plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>I received the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum for free for use and review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 51 and most people think I&#x27;m much younger.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Vitamin C on my face.</li>
            <li>Thanks again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first bottle (use it twice a day -</li>
            <li>The product works exactly as the description states.</li>
            <li>Now my nose and chin are clear and smooth</li>
            <li>I use this twice daily along with an appropriate morning/evening moisturizer.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I really like the consistency and the price!  </li>
            <li>I also love that this is a serum and penetrates deep into my skin, I will definitley reorder.</li>
            <li>and I found that my skin was not only hydrating a lot better, but also found myself not needing to hydrate as often.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the company and product, so that will definitely have me coming back for more when I run</li>
            <li>I am in love with the company and product, so that will definitely have me coming back for more when I run</li>
            <li>InstaNaturals was the first to introduce me to Ferulic Acid.</li>
            <li>I love it, does wonders for my skin, I will definitely continue to us it.</li>
            <li>so I could put moisturiser on straight after!</li>
            <li>yet it&#x27;s also light and absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li>This is an absolute favourite!</li>
            <li>It is my first time to try vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>I first dab some under my eyes then on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li>It gave glow to my face, this does not unfortunately...</li>
            <li>.. Real results!</li>
            <li>I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum sold by same company afterwards for even more effect.  </li>
            <li>and I have such a lovely glow all day.</li>
            <li>exactly as it should be] morning and night on my face.</li>
            <li>I will surely buy the next bottle of this serum when I finish my first bottle.</li>
            <li>My skin seemed brighter, toned, firmer and had an overall healthy glow.  </li>
            <li>I battled acne for many years and was left with a lot scaring &amp; blotches.</li>
            <li>If anything, I am getting more red splotches  on my skin.  </li>
            <li>#34;This is exactly what</li>
            <li>Yes, people have noticed that there is something different about my skin,  my smoother, more radiant and perky skin.  </li>
            <li>I am still on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li>that will only reflect even more on their products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thankful for a product like this that first, does not test on animals and second,&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li>-Thanks Melissa for your help!</li>
            <li>first time I used it</li>
            <li>I used this with the Vitamin C facial toner and my skin is so smooth!</li>
            <li>I love this InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum, not only does it have vitamin c</li>
            <li>The packaging is very simple and I love that about it .</li>
            <li>I love this product , definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li>I really like the ingredients, that is the reason why I thought I will try it!</li>
            <li>At first I was using two drops night and day as advised on the label.</li>
            <li>I got through my first bottle and actually ordered more.</li>
            <li>Vendor was anxious too know how I liked it and offered a free sample of another product.</li>
            <li>the results after two weeks of the product applied twice daily were smoother softer skin, brightening, more even skin tone, and fading of scars/</li>
            <li>I think it works better than another serum I recently tried.</li>
            <li>My complexion does seem smoother, less fine lines, and with more even tone.</li>
            <li>I use it only at night and feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>But, I am willing to give it a chance .</li>
            <li>This product soakes into your skin, it is not oily, it really helps with wrinkles, and smells like an orange cream ice cream bar!</li>
            <li>Second, I love the texture.</li>
            <li>From first use.</li>
            <li>I use this serum first and my Vitamin C oil over it which I feel maximized the result.  </li>
            <li>i recommend  Vitamin C Serum by instanatural for any one wanting a clear and smooth face</li>
            <li>It left me wanting to apply more of it to my skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>this is the first serum i ever tried..</li>
            <li>How do you know if you like something if you don&#x27;t have more than enough for a night or two?</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s pretty unavoidable.</li>
            <li>This product really delivers!  </li>
            <li>I was unsure at first but this product really works!</li>
            <li>There are quite a few wonderful ingredients in it, it makes my skin feel and look better, and the price is quite reasonable relative to similar products out there.</li>
            <li>The scent of this very orange and viscous serum was at first like vanilla and fresh orange juice.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>I use it everyday and it makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li>I used it on my clean skin and it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>, That helps skin feel very fresh, anti aging, dark spots, and more.</li>
            <li>So it basically did more harm than help because I now have more dark spots as a result of the new breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I love that this product has a combo of all of the best ingredients so that I do not have to have a million little bottles around or spend ridiculous amounts of time applying them all separately.</li>
            <li>Overall, super product to even complexion and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>Easy to dispense the few drops you need, rub it in your palms and smooth it on your skin!</li>
            <li>I started out late taking care of my skin, mid-forties, but was lucky, good genes or something.</li>
            <li>Wow !!!!</li>
            <li>The fine print on the bottle label in the ad is not shopper friendly and it was not easy to see that the name changed to Advanced Formula.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin and have used many products so far in my life.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered quite a few of them, and I&#x27;m impressed with every single one.</li>
            <li>I have used other vitamin C serums &amp; this one is hands down the best!</li>
            <li>I use it on my face and neck and I would recommend the Vitamin C moisturizer to use after this serum to anyone wants a natural moisturizer that hydrates your face all day and improves your skin texture and radiance while helping diminish fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It only takes a few drops to cover my whole face, it dries within seconds and have a very pleasant citric smell.</li>
            <li>All if the other oils and extracts are amazing</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s all I need if I want to go light, but I usually follow it with the InstaNatural eye gel, which is also a fantastic light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I wanted the Original Formula that I ordered and please don&#x27;t make product changes without clearly stating it in your Amazon Ad.</li>
            <li>I also make my own but also like to keep this brand around to use a couple times a week due to the added ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can not review the effectiveness of this product on its own as I use it with some other products in my skin care</li>
            <li>I’ve even gone a few days without my normal makeup routine because I just feel more confident.</li>
            <li>but it has a faint sweet and natural herbal scent to it that smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>But even if a reviewer did, in this particular case, the products are worth every rave revue</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and did not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is as good, or better, than the expensive serums.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoy drinking it in OJ, I take the gummy vitamin C, and I love applying it to my face at night as it&#x27;s one of the few skin products that makes a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Loved it have tried more expensive items which didn&#x27;t deliver, this does.</li>
            <li>You have to use vitamin C serum for at least 2 months to see the results, but once you continue to use you will see that your skin is brighter and more has more even tone.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a short time, but I am hoping for good results.</li>
            <li>The sun completely drained my youthful glow and this vitamin C serum along with the instanatural rose hip oil has brought my confidence back.</li>
            <li>Also the skin under my eyes both feels and appears more firm and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions and look forward to seeing more results after 2-4 more weeks.</li>
            <li>Thank you InstaNatural, I have already recommended you to several of my co-workers, and now they are using it, and hopefully they love it as much as I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really like to try InstaNatural Niacinamide 5% Serum as it has better ingredient&#x27;s then the one I currently use.    </li>
            <li>Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t tell how it&#x27;s affecting my dark spots quite yet, but my skin looks beautiful in terms of smoothness and overall radiance.</li>
            <li>This definitely helps smooth fine lines and keeps the skin quite soft.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The serum has a virus smell which is pleasant and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I found a lot of positive review</li>
            <li>but I decided try  InstaNatural  after I read all the positive comments...  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural also has a very pleasant faint scent that disappears within minutes of application.</li>
            <li>It was really hydrating from the first time of use and continued to be with continue use.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product that long, and am buying two more as we speak.  </li>
            <li>If this were available in liquid form (toner/spray bottle, etc) with the same ingredients, I would be more likely (re)purchase this.    </li>
            <li>and I am pretty much set to invest in another bottle when this one finishes.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and my pores are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum is almost clear and has a sweet smell with a hint of citrus and just the slightest whiff of spice.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t wait to see its long term results :)</li>
            <li>Wish the bottle was bigger but other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li>i am a first time user of this product, i am the type of girl who doesnt know much about beauty products</li>
            <li>They really are interested in the customer&#x27;s beauty desires.</li>
            <li>The product shipped fast, arrived fast, and leaves my skin glowing!</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will show some greater benefits in the long run.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if this would would work for all skin types, but I do have some good insight.</li>
            <li>It works really good with other Insta Natural</li>
            <li>The results were good enough to continue using the product until the bottle finished and overall it worked very well</li>
            <li>I loved this product so much, I purchased one for my picky sister (who was also blown away by how it left her face and by how inexpensive it was compared to the ones she buys), for my mom, and for a friend who keeps on asking what i&#x27;m doing different.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice any significant changes as far as diminished wrinkles yet</li>
            <li>Good feel to serum and a little goes a long way easily.  </li>
            <li>It has a pleasant orange-y aroma and is fast absorbing when placed on the skin without leaving any greasiness and very little sticky-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many problems with my skin , just mainly acne- and oddly enough</li>
            <li>I highly recommend their entire product line &amp; love</li>
            <li>I have to say this one may take the cake with awesome smell of fresh oranges, a thick consistency that absorbs quickly and has been slowly but surely tightening up my pores and possibly evening out</li>
            <li>The best part is that it is cheaper than several other similar products that I have tried or researched.</li>
            <li>InstaNatural was kind enough to let me try a couple of their other items so this &amp;#34;product was provided for free for testing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.</li>
            <li>I dont use this daily as I have other products to test, so I may need to give it more love</li>
            <li>No negative side effects as  of right now</li>
            <li>InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum has a nice feel, slightly tingly, as it dries on my skin.</li>
            <li>Make sure you let everything dry.</li>
            <li>It has a nice but slight citrus scent.</li>
            <li>At first the color threw me (very orange) but the results came fast.  </li>
            <li>I am very particular about the stuff I put on my skin</li>
            <li>I have combination skin (running more dry these days)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and seems to be improving my skin tone and even making my pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li>Make sure it&#x27;s fully dry before you put anything else on your face.</li>
            <li>so it tends to get red easily.</li>
            <li>The serum is clear yet creamy and absorbs into the skin and has a citrus scent to it but quickly fades away.</li>
            <li>I have not observed anything extraordinary, but then my sensitive skin has had no adverse reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to tell when your skin has enough because it plumps up and smooths out.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly super food for my skin, I feel like my skin soaks it up eagerly and it replenishes vital nutrients.  </li>
            <li>Dries very quickly, skin feels tighter and not as red and blotchy, citrusy smell grows on you.</li>
            <li>It was easy to add to my daily face cleansing regiment too.</li>
            <li>Dry areas are disappearing, and the color is more even.</li>
            <li>I have combo skin with dry cheeks, and don&#x27;t experience many break outs.  </li>
            <li>I see no dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li>It is good but did not last long.</li>
            <li>It is a somewhat thick serum that has a pleasant citrus scent.</li>
            <li>This certainly is all of those things.  </li>
            <li>My oily combination skin has large pores and I&#x27;ve literally had coworkers asking what I&#x27;ve done to my make up..</li>
            <li>and you can tell its pure.</li>
            <li>it suits certain skin tones.</li>
            <li>I have large pores and this product seems to make them disappear.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy using InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum, it is truly helping my completion, it is making my face so much smoother looking with out leaving a oily residue like most serums I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Was originally going to be for my mom, but apparently this isn&#x27;t sensitive-skin-friendly.</li>
            <li>After a bit more than 1month of use, the dark spots are lightening, my eyes look brighter, my overall complexion looks more youthful.  </li>
            <li>Ascorbyl Phosphate is a relatively new derivative of Vitamin C, it is considered a powerful antioxidant that is gentle on your skin and shouldn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even, age spots seem to be lighter , and my laugh lines seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it’s so easy to use, I definitely will consider purchasing this when my bottle runs out (which will be a while with how much you get in a bottle)</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite so far, it does not dry my skin out like others.</li>
            <li>I naturally have good black skin</li>
            <li>After a few weeks, once her skin adjusted, a mild tingle at most is all she feels when applying.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>BTW, the customer service in general is very responsive and personal, and they seem to really care about your experience of their products, encouraging honest feedback.</li>
            <li>But my very sensitive skin never has a problem with this formulation, and my skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this product, and other Instanatural products, as I really feel they are made of pure and fresh ingredients, and they keep my face feeling fresh and clean and well fed.  </li>
            <li>I will update later to advise on my experience and if it is has made a difference in my dryness, fine lines, age spots, and pore size.</li>
            <li>I love how quickly it smooths into my skin, and the slightly citrus smell is yummy!  </li>
            <li>Fine lines disappear instantly.</li>
            <li>Once a day is not enough to keep the fine lines/ wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li>I still have some fine lines on my forehead and it has only been a week</li>
            <li>I still have some fine lines on my forehead and it has only been a week</li>
            <li>It absorbed easily in to my skin, and left it feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I use 4 drops and smooth it over my entire face - it absorbs very quickly and I only have to wait a minute or so before applying my BB cream.</li>
            <li>It absorbs fine but then leaves my skin oily shortly thereafter.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m older, I&#x27;m just trying to prevent the decay from accelerating!</li>
            <li>This is the first time buying this particular Vit C serum for me.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin bright, tight, and soft.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly so I can put my facial oil right away.</li>
            <li>the serum itself looks a little goopy but it smells and feels amazing as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li>So far this product does exactly what it says it will do for your skin!</li>
            <li>Then I appy Insta Natural Toning Rose Water with a clean cotton pad using small upward circles again.</li>
            <li>However, since recently falling madly in love with high quality argon oil, I am becoming a little more open minded.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it felt tingly, due to my open pores, right after a warm face wash.</li>
            <li>That is amazing since I have only been using it a short time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s and have always tried to keep a bottle at home if at all possible.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the seller has answered personal questions through email which was a huge surprise.  </li>
            <li>Instant noticeable difference in my skin tone and really helps to smooth out the wrinkles  </li>
            <li>This product has made an amazing difference in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li>After using this serum, my skin appeared much brighter.</li>
            <li>Specifically, my forehead lines softened immediately, and my cheeks are so much smoother and even textured.</li>
            <li>This serum has cleared my face so much since I started using it.</li>
            <li>If you have use something similar to this before you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li>This product works really well.</li>
            <li>It really has seemed to speed healing of any blemishes.</li>
            <li>It really concerned me.</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>The droplet it comes with doesn&#x27;t fill up much.</li>
            <li>(thanks Mom for getting me started).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This stuff really seems to help combat aging.</li>
            <li>This vitamin nourishes my skin and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li>It works for really oily skin too, which I have.</li>
            <li>Im really liking this serum.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very oily and I think it was just an overload of products on my face.</li>
            <li>: my skin feels and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>Since I don&#x27;t see any real signs of anything, I would have no reason to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to notice a difference around my eyes, but nothing.</li>
            <li>I really like the glow of my face since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li>My skin appears to be much smoother.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it morning and night under a second moisturizer by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see a change in my complexion..  </li>
            <li>I have used this for three nights straight</li>
            <li>I must say I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li>i think it really helps with wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>So, for me, InstaNatural advanced Vitamin C Serum has multiple uses for my family&#x27;s needs</li>
            <li>and I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t really noticed a reduction in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my face at all.</li>
            <li>Results can be seen from 2 to 4 weeks after gently massaging the serum into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HYDRATE</li>
            <li>/&gt;Aging, UV radiation or hormonal changes often show up as brown skin discoloration (sun spots or age spots), an indication that too much melamine pigment is produced by the skin.</li>
            <li>Wants you to use it again.</li>
            <li>That being said, the consistency of this serum is fantastic - a light texture, no silicone, not oily at all (as you may expect given the various oils listed in the ingredients), and it dries almost instantly after application with no tacky or sticky feeling/residue.</li>
            <li>In fact, even without the silicone, I have noticed a very silky finish to my skin after application.</li>
            <li>didnt really see a difference on my skin did not brighten it</li>
            <li>I use it in conjunction with a derma roller for maximum penetration and have seen some real changes in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This serum is light and doesn&#x27;t make me break out; plus, the bottle it big</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much like this at this price point.</li>
            <li>Really rejuvenates your skin.</li>
            <li>I really like how this product works.</li>
            <li>Lips are fully healed from breaking out and pores are shrinking to disappearance, much finer wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>i really see the difference</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve given it a real try for 2 bottles which equals 2 months.</li>
            <li>My face feels very &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and oily with it on</li>
            <li>Tia works really wel.</li>
            <li>I was having a bit of a hyper-pigmentation problem under the corners of my lips and this really helped.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend giving this serum a shot!</li>
            <li>It really if affective.</li>
            <li>I have now used this whole bottle</li>
            <li>It seems to fit the bill of my prior use of this type of product to the highest standards.</li>

            <li>I really didn&#x27;t notice much change in the appearance in my skin.</li>
            <li>I really can see a difference of my skin tone and clarity.</li>

            <li>Thanks for helping enhance my skin.</li>
            <li>However, my skin seemed much brighter when I used the product.</li>
            <li>This product also contains Vitamin E, which is important to actually rejuvenating the texture of skin and not just the appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Too much citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>

            <li>Fast drying, citrus scented, non sticky formula.</li>
            <li>My acne marks are a lot lighter and it really did the job of brightening my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed that I don&#x27;t need as much foundation to cover my discoloration so it must be fading.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You really should try it because the price is also quite reasonable.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>

            <li>They&#x27;re products really work.</li>
            <li>I really like the ingredients</li>

            <li>I do recommend this to anybody who&#x27;s thinking about buying it because it absolutely delivers.</li>
            <li>I have been using vitamin C for 6 months now, and my skin is much brighter and has an even tone.</li>
            <li>but I really appreciate the email conversation.</li>
            <li>But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very sticky on the skin</li>
            <li>I noticed my face was much brighter.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t noticed much change in skin discolorations yet,</li>
            <li>so having saying that i didnt notice much changes in my skin with using this product</li>
            <li>but i do enjoy the smoothness and moisterizing that it left of my skin that i do continue to use it</li>
            <li>The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li>After years of trying every product out there to maintain youth, I didn&#x27;t have much faith, but thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t really work on me</li>
            <li>Very soothing feeling and smells like oranges</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product for your use!</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li>serum has a very watery texture but glides on like silk.</li>
            <li>Make sure to store it away from heat and sunlight and that the cap is tightly closed.</li>
            <li>I really like using the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>After removing the lid, I place a drop or two on my index finger and gently massage the product onto my face.</li>
            <li>I am being very patient</li>
            <li>have a problem reviewing this product though, the biggest being that it may take months to see real results and</li>
            <li>and I really appreciated the &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This serum is responsible for his words.</li>
            <li>He is responsible for its price.</li>
            <li>Since nothing else in my lifestyle had really changed, I decided to turn to products.</li>
            <li>I spent some time looking for a serum that contained both vitamin C and hyaluronic acid and this one also contains vitamin E which has many added benefits.  </li>
            <li>but she is really happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t see much difference yet.  </li>
            <li>This Vitamin C serum works very well along with the Vitamin C moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li>It has a very clean-citrus smell which I like.</li>
            <li>No5hing else has ever really helped it much</li>
            <li>and you get fast results.</li>
            <li>and I have very picky skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this product</li>
            <li>product was provided to me for free for testing purposes, and would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li>I have a light case of Melasma on my face from my last two pregnancies and sun over exposure</li>
            <li>I used this serum along with the Vitamin C moisturizer for about a month now, and it worked really well.</li>
            <li>The consistency is a bit heavier , and the color when putting on your face is very orange but fades within minutes.</li>
            <li>and I really like the dropper applicator.</li>
            <li>My skin is really stubborn</li>
            <li>Really moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky</li>
            <li>However, while my skin felt better I did not really notice a difference in how it looked.</li>
            <li>I really like using it.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and it works really well for age spots.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product every evening and really don&#x27;t see any differences .</li>
            <li>that makes my skin feel really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product was packed very well in bubblewrap.  </li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need anything else when using Vitamin C.</li>
            <li>The formula is very nourishing to the skin.</li>
            <li>It did absolutely NOTHING for my skin.</li>
            <li>My face feels much brighter and smoother after applying this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li>but I think this serum will become a staple in my skin care collection, I like it that much.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly Recommend!  </li>
            <li>In conjuction with this I am using the planet eden intense repair.</li>
            <li>But it really does work.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with the Niacinamide serum and the two work really well together.</li>

            <li>thanks insta naturals</li>
            <li>The rosehip oil has a very soothing affect as it goes on.</li>

            <li>Thanks.</li>

            <li>It is gentle on the face and my skin</li>
            <li>and it did not do as much for my skin as the Instanatural Vit C serum.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much.</li>
            <li>I can say it has really improved the appearance of my post acne scars on my face.</li>

            <li>and I don&#x27;t see much, if any, difference in my skin since I started using the product.</li>
            <li>I have found InstaNatural to be a manufacturer of products I really like using.  </li>
            <li>I really like this serum and use it every morning under my moisturizer/makeup and every night after washing my face.</li>
            <li>A month after purchase it smells like very spoiled orange juice.  </li>
            <li>The serum has a nice texture that&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li>Love products by Insta Natural - definitely will continue to purchase these products</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only tried this product and their Hyaluronic Acid so far, and love the results to date.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of expensive vitamin c&#x27;s and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li>Only time will tell, but so far, I think the product is okay.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell and texture of it, and how fast it sinks into my skin when I pat it in.</li>
            <li>The product has a nice smell to it , but so far it is not what I expected .</li>
            <li>Ive seen how my skin getting soft, nice and no much wrinkles!&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing that I wish it came in a bigger bottle like the Rose Oil 4 oz.</li>
            <li>I was able to replaced a lot of my daily products with the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say InstaNatural worked as well as what I&#x27;m used to, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the dropper, which was kind of drippy, which then wastes product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i love it, received 3 compliments, 2 from strangers and one whom i had not seen in a very long time!!</li>
            <li>You can easily pay close to $100.00 for these ingredients from high end retailers of big name companies.</li>
            <li>-Wrinkles, smile lines and other fine lines - Age spots, sun spots, and discoloration]  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a high quality product!!!!</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a clear liquid with no smell and no stickiness!!!).  </li>
            <li>Only wish they sold it in the gallons as i would dip my whole body in it!!!</li>
            <li>I also have to mention again the insta natural phytoceramides !!!</li>
            <li>No new spots appearing, no darkening of spots already there (some have lightened) and my skin looks pretty smooth for my age.  </li>
            <li>Ordered a 3rd of what I thought to be the original formula only to receive another advanced bottle.</li>
            <li>If it is your first time, it will be a new experience all around.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I smells like orange but not for long and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>but once I hit 40 I started having a problem with my skin becoming dry and flaky.</li>
            <li>I love vitamin C but all the other products in this one has really made a difference.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s why I avoided C serums afterward, even though I really like most other</li>
            <li>I realize that the secret to beautiful skin is the nutrients taken internally and good facial care products applied externally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be happy even if having soft and clear skin are the only two benefits that I experience as a result using this product long term.</li>
            <li>The second time I ordered it, the packaging changed to a dark blue bottle with an orange label... also the product changed from a clear sticky liquid to now this orange delicious smelling liquid that isn&#x27;t sticky anymore .</li>
            <li>The smell is slight and pleasant and you get a lot that will last a while.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the process of ordering more and am considering purchasing their other products too.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect to see a major change because I had been using a vitamin C product for many years just a different brand, but this brand and mixture has made my face glow and reduced wrinkle appearance dramatically.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a month but feel that over time I will continue to achieve significant results.</li>
            <li>I had tried the Paula&#x27;s choice vitamin c and didn&#x27;t like it at all (even though I love all her other products).</li>
            <li>It only takes such a small amount of VC and you must use a pressing motion when applying for best results.</li>
            <li>Working better than other vitamin C series I have used.  </li>
            <li>I feel that their other serums (skin brightening &amp; age defying/skin clearing) work much better.</li>
            <li>Funny thing is this c serum worked better than a more expensive c cream i bought that was 4 times the price by a well known skin line.  </li>
            <li>In the past I had tried a facial lotion that had vitamin C in it and found it helped my face look clearer and more healthy but have not used it in over a year.  </li>
            <li>I have used other serums that cost a lot more money and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.</li>
            <li>It is rich in anti-oxidants that repairs and revives the cells and give the skin a healthier younger appearance.</li>
            <li>I was seeing the normal signs of aging in my40&#x27;s,and I need all the help I can get!</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin tone is more even and hydrated, and it both layers well under other serums or works by itself.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if makes a difference, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Will not be buying again unless Instanatural goes back to the original formula.</li>
            <li>but I have had better results with a Vitamin C Serum not containing any other oils or ingredients.</li>
            <li>but I know with time and using this product daily the effects will be significant.</li>
            <li>This product was way better than expected!</li>
            <li>It does seem to have improved my skin texture more than the other vitamin C serum I was using.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like many other vitamin C serums I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I noticed rosehip oil was an ingredient, which makes me break out, but I was hoping in a blend of many other ingredients that it wouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li>I discussed it with my dermatologist and she recommends using a Vitamin C serum in tandem with my other skin treatments and medicines and this is the one I love.</li>
            <li>After reading that topical Vitamin C was recommended by &amp;#34;Dr Oz&amp;#34; as highly beneficial for the skin, and after my dermatologist confirmed this to me, I decided to purchase a bottle of Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li>This serum is thick enough that is easy to spread on your skin, but light enough that it absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as two other brands I have used-they were able to fade a dark patch on cheek this one has not-it&#x27;s coming back since using this oroduct</li>
            <li>I had dark skin on my forehead on both the sides and so many creams applied nothing really working</li>
            <li>/&gt;Hyaluronic acid, one of the many active ingredients in this serum, has been shown to tighten skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I use it on my clean face daily, at night.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is light, but not too light, and the fragrance is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>The first bottle I bought at the end of September ran out at the end of the first week of February (about 4.5 months, using it every other day), not a bad ratio.</li>
            <li>It spreads on very nicely and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It dries fast, and leaves your skin feeling tight; however, once I put the Insta Natural Rose Hip Seed Oil on over it, my skin glows.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to any one who wants a high quality product with visible results  </li>
            <li>The small fine lines at the corners are less noticeable and appear more smooth.  </li>
            <li>I had high expectations in view of the reviews because my skin is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very gentle serum that can be used on sensitive skin and it has kept my acne away too.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and it seems to be a consistent, solid product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to let this serum completely dry on your skin before applying anything else as that allows the product to really penetrate your skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed the difference on my chest first with the sun spots and freckles becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone is more even, my skin is much smoother, and I&#x27;ve had less breakouts.</li>
            <li>I have used a good number of serums, and a couple of vitamin C serums, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen a Vitamin C serum that wasn&#x27;t clear with a slight yellow tint.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty clear to begin with.</li>
            <li>I have used several of Insta Natural products now and have been very happy with all of them.ve not gotten any worse.</li>
            <li>But this vitamin c serum is not only more cost effective than many other products she&#x27;s tried in the past, but it actually works for a change.</li>
            <li>When you first apply this serum to your face it feels a bit sticky, but that is due to Hyaluronic acid and the feeling disappears within seconds leaving your face smooth.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the results and have nothing negative to report.</li>
            <li>this  serum smells delicious,.... and on and on never really being specific about the concrete actual personal changes in their skin.</li>
            <li>Either way, I&#x27;m not sure how effective vitamins are sitting on the skin as opposed to ingesting them and circulating through your system.</li>
            <li>My eyes are still puffy but it&#x27;s more toned than baggy and my dark acne scars from like</li>
            <li>I use this in the morning(would be better before bed, however I am currently only washing my face once a day) and notice some light redness, uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty early to tell if this product has made a difference, that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s mostly all gone), gotten rid of any infections and lightened dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li>First time using this product but liking it so far.  </li>
            <li>so my sleep levels were much lower than normal and my stress levels were way up</li>
            <li>I usually mix my own face oils which i use along with some hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li>Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for.</li>
            <li>Since I just recently found InstaNatural, I have come full circle.</li>
            <li>This one is not bad as I&#x27;ve only used it for a week.  </li>
            <li>overall complexion is not bad.  </li>
            <li>Using a hot wet clean washcloth</li>
            <li>Since I have started using Insta-natural faithfully, the fine lines on my forehead, which I have had since I was in my early 20&#x27;s, are not so deep.</li>
            <li>and it is cheaper than many other ones!</li>
            <li>Later that day beautiful skin, less wrinkles, deep lines are fainter, and my face held moisture longer.</li>
            <li>I wish the bottle were a little larger, but it&#x27;s definitely a good product.</li>
            <li>I can never ever live without it anymore!</li>
            <li>The consistency of the product is a little more watery than I particularly care for, but it&#x27;s easy to overlook that as long as the product works!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time, but I think it&#x27;s pretty solid and a nice price point.  </li>
            <li>Also if during the day I was exposed to humid outdoor air or warmth due to my own activity, my skin would not breathe and perspiration caused the return of the sticky feeling as if the Vit. C. serum had just been applied,  tI requires more product usage because of its thick consistency.  </li>
            <li>It has really helped even out my skin tone and get rid of acne scars and is helping prevent new acne along with the witch hazel.</li>
            <li>Love the consistency and slight citrus smell.</li>
            <li>I used a couple of drops of the VC serum before applying lotion and my skin is less irritated and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>It is also less acne prone, which I love.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and it works as expected.</li>
            <li>but most serums have that slightly sticky feel.</li>
            <li>Not any better than products I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li>Collagen will increase your skins elasticity making it tighter, firmer and more plump - which means less of that sagging feeling.</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better and my age spots are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Wrinkles less prominent.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone is more even and less blotchy.</li>
            <li>I love what this does for my skin, and I don&#x27;t wear half the makeup I used to.</li>
            <li>I was using about 8 drops per application, but noticed I was going through it quickly and now only use 4 drops.  </li>
            <li>already ordering my second bottle, my skin is so much more balanced now with daily use of this serum.  </li>
            <li>Most times, I use along with organic coconut oil and its also a great base coat to wear underneath makeup.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and instantly hydrates skin.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any particular improvement in my skin&#x27;s discoloration or texture, but this may require extended use.</li>
            <li>Have only used this product for several weeks but am satisfied with the results.</li>

            <li>This particular product did not work for me.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for the drak spots removal.  </li>
            <li>Also, this product works particularly well after dermarolling and using a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>am using the Vit C serum in the mornings after a quick wash, following with Instanatural&#x27;s Vit C moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I am struggling with rosacea on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li>After which, I looked on amazon and read several reviews on more than one such product before using this one.  </li>
            <li>I have had one particularly troublesome spot on my forehead for about 10 or so years now that has all but disappeared since I began using this vitamin CC serum.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised to see that this serum is a bit on the thick side and is a bright orange color.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t particularly like it .I</li>
            <li>Will keep using as it does a decent job.  </li>
            <li>After I became eligible for Medicare, I noticed for the first time that nasolabial folds and some slight, fine wrinkles and lines were beginning to appear on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t heavy when applied (though it depends on how much you massage into the skin).</li>
            <li>For sure i will became addicted!:)</li>
            <li>This is literally the first time I&#x27;ve seen one that is milky in consistency, the color of yellow (Yes, I&#x27;m aware that they said the color could change depending on weather/season/blahblah.</li>
            <li>I can instantly feel my skin tightening as it absorbs in, which is rather quickly.</li>
            <li>in the PM I do the same, minus the make up Loving it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  </li>
            <li>I love natural products, what we put on our skin we have to be careful with , out skin is our biggest organ.</li>
            <li>The Sea Buckthorn and Algae extracts are the key factors that make this serum extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s my main concern</li>
            <li>My older skin is softer and clearer.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog</li>
            <li>I do not think it has done a lot for the wrinkles, but the skintone and healthy glow definitely make me look younger.</li>
            <li>I am fair and a few age spots were starting to appear.</li>
            <li>OK the only thing I could add is a pump bottle so that the product does not get oxidized every time you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li>OK the only thing I could add is a pump bottle so that the product does not get oxidized every time you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin (as in VERY), and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin in the slightest.</li>
            <li>But gets very dry and I am getting a lot of fine lines and crows feet.</li>
            <li>So far I have not seen any positive results</li>
            <li>I have a few fine lines and dark spots that looked much better after the first week of use.  </li>
            <li>I hope the long term effects are as positive as the first 3 days have been!</li>
            <li>i-herb shipping is $8 for a large order, so if getting supplements anyway,  other products basically have free shipping – so will investigate what products are on offer.</li>
            <li>Face is very soft!</li>
            <li>It was the very first product I used in their facial care line.</li>
            <li>As for the efficacy of the actual product, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a fair assessment.</li>
            <li>I cannot post any claims that this product helps to diminish fine lines or wrinkles because I have not used it long enough, but it has many other positive qualities.</li>

            <li>My skin feels very smooth and firm after using this underneath moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Not sure how it has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Love this serum and love the citrus smell too bad it goes quickly</li>
            <li>I also like that unlike some other serums, this one doesn&#x27;t make my skin more sensitive to the sun, so I don&#x27;t need to layer sunscreen over it.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t the most sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any other product.</li>
            <li>, it has a light fresh citrus-like scent, a quick drying thin serum texture, and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 27 yrs old with brown patchy skin with some large pores and acne scars.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this little magic potion for approx.</li>
            <li>Would prefer something with a little more emollient.  </li>
            <li>A little pricy as I am so in love with it and use it every day on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love putting it on in the morning, the citrus smell and the little jolt of moisture and energy</li>
            <li>I just wish it did a little more with the wrinkles/dark circles under my eye, but that may not be it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>With all the abuse my skin takes on a daily basis, it really appreciated this serum!!  </li>
            <li>Love the fruity scent, and the little cream texture.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work fine for me for a first few days</li>
            <li>and it really helps my super dry skin stay hydrated.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and does not leave a sticky feeling like some other products I used to use.  </li>
            <li>Due to my age, moisturizer was the only product available for the first 25 years or so of my life, and sunscreen with SPF only became available when I was close to 30.  </li>
            <li>Although topical are not going to achieve the same results as fillers and surgery, I have noticed that the fine lines look much softer.</li>
            <li>A few drops with other serums is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li>The serum has a very faint smell, perhaps from the Rosehip Oil, which is very pleasant.</li>

            <li>The serum has a very faint smell, perhaps from the Rosehip Oil, which is very pleasant.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t return it as its older than a month but its a new bottle</li>
            <li>However, I really do like it so far.</li>
            <li>Really makes my face glow and has helped face some old acne scars.</li>
            <li>All natural products that really work as they claim.</li>
            <li>So far VERY staisfied with this product..</li>
            <li>So far I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li>I was fine the first two weeks I was using the product [Used product once a day as part of my PM routine], but I noticed that once I applied the product later on that the dry areas of my face would burn.</li>
            <li>It is too soon to tell if it is of any real benefit to my 80-year old face</li>
            <li>So far really like this product.  </li>
            <li>My wife ordered this serum and it has been working very well on her face and skin so far.</li>
            <li>My scars are fading, pores are nearly history, my skin is much brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li>Needless to say i am a happy customer.</li>
            <li>The serum isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t sting my skin, it&#x27;s early yet, but I&#x27;m very optimistic about it.</li>
            <li>and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>Seems to work really well, so far.</li>
            <li>Soft lines have disappeared and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li>I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I arranged for this product to be tried by a professional model, who is very well-acquainated with these types of products.  </li>
            <li>​I really like this product, and I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li>Is this normal?</li>
            <li>Overall, the product has proved it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>and she has a pretty moderate to severe case that has been very stubborn.&lt;br</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;-Gets absorbed instantly into your skin without any greasiness</li>
            <li>and I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a different in the fading of dark spots or discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a short while and so far I am satisfied with using it with the hyarluronic acid and my moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My face became itchy, splotchy, and now I have breakouts in places I don&#x27;t normally break out.</li>
            <li>I bought this Vitamin C serum a couple weeks ago as a boost to my normal skincare regimen.</li>
            <li>Since I do not like products that are heavy or oily, I really love that it is neither.  </li>
            <li>I use it under foundation and my make up actually stayed fresh longer  </li>
            <li>I will be able to tell you if it works in a few months.</li>
            <li>I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin.</li>
            <li>The Vitamin C Serum would definitely be a product worth reordering when I finish my bottle.</li>
            <li>I was a tad sceptical about the numerous reviews of those that had been given complimentary products but after a week of using this serum I am seeing a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and most facial products make my face turn red.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to let it soak on your skin for a few minutes before applying your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s smoother, feels more firm.  </li>
            <li>Love it and will continue to use everyday.</li>
            <li>Skin seems to be more firm.</li>
            <li>I have been using it everyday and feel confident that i am not putting chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li>No negative effects.</li>
            <li>BUT I WILL KNOW MORE IN A FEW WEEKS.</li>
            <li>I recently changed my entire skin care product collection to a more natural, organic-based alternative.</li>
            <li>I also use and love GREEN CREAM retinal cream that can also be bought here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally give reviews.</li>
            <li>Only what my skin needs and what the product needs to keep it stable and fresh.</li>
            <li>It definitely works the magic that only these serums can do, and my skin is clear, moisturized, and radiant.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin is tighter and more firm.</li>
            <li>, I normally go out with sunscreen</li>
            <li>Most days I mix it with a few drops of emu oil and skip moisturizer, just depends on my skin and the weather.</li>
            <li>and I can also report no negative effects.</li>
            <li>My skin feels refreshed,  and hydrated and not dull.  </li>
            <li>My pores appear so much smaller and my skin looks fresh and new.  </li>
            <li>The only thing i was concerned about is that the plastic seal onand around the cap was easily screwed off when i turned the cap to open it.</li>
            <li>The labels are easy to read and overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However,  I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this company,  they gave me a full refund, with no trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using the eye gel.</li>
            <li>Every night and morning, I apply this serum to the left hand and none on the right.</li>
            <li>Third, it is helping to fade my sunspots right underneath my eye.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this natural anti-oxidant for your skin&#x27;s sake!</li>
            <li>~The former version was a clear, freely adsorbing thinner liquid which was light on skin, relatively little aroma, and soaked into the skin immediately leaving no sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>The ingredient list is fantastic - all powerful antioxidants and nourishing oils, and I really appreciate the absence of fragrance, as well as other chemicals, typically found in skincare.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>for those of you who are in doubt, trust me you wont be sorry it does all it say&#x27;s and more and in record time...into my 5th day and yay!!</li>
            <li>a lot more clear and tight - vitamin c is the way to go.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product also for people who have dry skin, it makes you skin a lot less dry and more healthy.</li>
            <li>To my horror, I recently notice that I had fine &amp;#34;ruffles&amp;#34; on my cheek bones on the left side of my face.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to give it another star, but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li>I also enjoy the sharp scent of orange that I get when I apply it.  </li>
            <li>and that is gone, and that is huge to me, because for the life of me I would have to do multiple treatments to make that go away for like 24 hours, and last but not least the lines and a bit of puffines that I began to notice rt after my42nd BD, are gone.</li>
            <li>and that is gone, and that is huge to me, because for the life of me I would have to do multiple treatments to make that go away for like 24 hours, and last but not least the lines and a bit of puffines that I began to notice rt after my42nd BD, are gone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;InstaNatural&#x27;s serum includes good choices for preservatives that are not known to be irritating and comes in a dark bottle to minimize light exposure on the vitamin ingredients.</li>
            <li>My skin has a new glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a drugstore product for over a year, but decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li>I have anything new to report as I continue using this product, I&#x27;ll update this review</li>
            <li>so the Vitamin C should be new and stable as if it just came from the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am almost done with this serum and its time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>This product is new to me, but i may say it does wonders.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this because I&#x27;ve been looking for a new serum to wear under my moisturizer in the evening.</li>
            <li>While looking for a new serum, I stumbled across this.</li>
            <li>Am relatively new to its usage....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a product junkie, always like to try new moisturizers, cleaners and serums but this one just didn&#x27;t sit well.  </li>
            <li>I am new to Vitamin C Serum as a face treatment.  </li>
            <li>But for the past week I have not seen a blemish, and my skin is very smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>I have started applying a vitamin c moisturizer on my face, very light and small amount, after I use the serum.  </li>
            <li>I had a break out last month due to stress and I have been using all kinds of vitamin C serums to try to deal with the scars left on my skin and so far I have to see I do see a good result.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since I started law school my eye bags have been so dark it looks like I got hit in the face and the increased stress has caused some fine lines to appear on my face.</li>
            <li>My skin is losing that vibrant look, its not as smooth and its not just a slight difference, it&#x27;s quite noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Made my skin soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li>My pores are clear and I&#x27;ve noticed a more even tone where it was previously uneven.  </li>
            <li>I only recommend products/services I use personally &amp; believe my readers will enjoy and/or benefit from.</li>
            <li>skin is clear, vibrant, and acne doesnt appear like it has been.</li>
            <li>I bought it mainly to hopefully diminish the old crone lines around my mouth, and it will take longer for that, I think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a slight citrus scent to it but nothing too strong.</li>
            <li>Oh yes...nothing like the real stuff, it really works on your skin like magic, a little goes a long way, will buy it again,</li>
            <li>This product is a little sticky at first but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>No better feeling then knowing what goes onto your skin is rich and effective with out harsh chemical</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant, not strong like some other reviewers shared.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells very clear and comfort, I will recommend my friends to use it.</li>
            <li>and my skin is usually very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Smells like orange juice but skin feels very soft in morning.</li>
            <li>my face was very soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>have very sensitive skin, so give it a try, it may be alright for you.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face very soft.</li>
            <li>It does leave your skin very soft and moisturized without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>In the morning my skin a very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I use it at night with a night moisturizer and my skin feels very soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>My face is very sensitive to a lot product</li>
            <li>As a note I have very sensitive skin which is probably why I felt the burning.</li>
            <li>Skin feels very soft and supple.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Have only been using this item a little under three weeks , so far it goes on smooth and drys quickly with no oder.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>If i notice a difference in my skin, i will definitely buy it again, but right now it&#x27;s a bit too early to tell.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft after applying it and my fine lines seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not using a lot and am following the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing to finally find a Vitamin C serum which is a pleasure to use and smell and does not sting like some of the other brands.</li>
            <li>I have fell in love with Instanaturals oils, but I doubt I will buy their vitamin C serum due to the above.  </li>
            <li>I can say that this makes my face so very,very soft!  </li>
            <li>I actually feel as if my skin looks pretty.</li>
            <li>I am almost through first bottle, and have ordered 2nd.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure other people have, but personally speaking i did not.</li>
            <li>Skin feels better and difference in pores after a few days of use!  </li>
            <li>So Far!</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old and refuse to look it!</li>
            <li>(some people may not love the smell, but I enjoy it!).</li>
            <li>I have tried several different Vitamin C, HC with botanicals, anti-aging, anti-hypermigmentation products, and this is my favorite, daily go to serum.  </li>
            <li>So far the skin clearing serum has been working out!</li>
            <li>Of course, regular application over a period of many weeks or months is necessary to see the promised benefits--it is not an instant cure for damaged skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if I could only choose one product I would choose this one because it contains both the hyalournic acid and vitamin c (in higher concentration).</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>plan on buying every product instaNatural offers!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin soft and moist!</li>
            <li>from first use my skin started improving .. smoother texture blowy smaller pores</li>
            <li>Not to mention my face feels incredibly soft!</li>
            <li>The serum has a slightly sticky consistency and it does smell of oranges, I purchased it to help decrease the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>There was actually a difference after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Immediately my skin looks brighter and feels more moisturized, no more flaking.</li>
            <li>;)  I am on my second bottles of both serums.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the first that I bought and will use this next.  </li>
            <li>recently had a burn mark on my hand from spilling a hot beverage.</li>
            <li>, I looked at a picture that was taken the first week of March, and my face was red all over.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get breakouts very often, but I do tend to get a few around &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34;, and applying this serum seemed to have helped significantly.</li>
            <li>I think as time goes on I may just be able to fade this melasma without harsh ingredients!</li>
            <li>OMG - I bought this product awhile back when it first came out</li>
            <li>First picture was taken third day after using.</li>
            <li>I use a few of the Instanatural products and I love all of them and just absolutely cannot say enough of the quality of their products and ingredients.</li>
            <li>Would not recommend this and am disappointed in myself for not buying the best for my skin.</li>
            <li>no glow as I usually experience with better brands.</li>
            <li>That means it&#x27;s definitely natural!  </li>
            <li>My first bottle was problematic in that the cap wouldn&#x27;t screw on properly.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and the company behind it.</li>
            <li>The company is extremely customer friendly.</li>
            <li>It came in a pretty blue glass bottle with an orange-reddish label.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>and I have noticed the fine lines on my forehead are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Skin felt moisture and soft in the morning after one-night use!</li>
            <li>no harsh ingredients!</li>
            <li>When someone finds out my age they are surprised!</li>
            <li>This product is non-irritating and I have sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li>The first batch was yellow.</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m too young for this!  </li>
            <li>I am into skin, in the beauty industry and have spent a considerable amount of time and money on sooo many products during the course of countless years.</li>
            <li>This one has some added ingredients that I was not getting before, and the combination works well for my skin type (older, formerly oily but now on the normal to dry side, tendency to larger pores) and I believe some of my darker spots (no, they are NOT age spots) are fading more.</li>
            <li>far as price goes, this is a steal!</li>
            <li>I live in New Zealand, and Instanatural doesn’t send directly to NZ –</li>
            <li>I find the product easy to apply because it has a little dropper in the lid.</li>
            <li>I find the product easy to apply because it has a little dropper in the lid I used the dropper and dropped some on my hand and used my fingers to massage it on my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;1.) I&#x27;ve spent time researching what active, beneficial and effective ingredients are recommended by experts (like Paula Begoun, who cites her sources) and this serum is a winner.  </li>
            <li>Critically important in keeping down the effects of the occurrence on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>I changed a few products around the same time, so it&#x27;s hard to say what makes the biggest difference, but as a skin care professional I can confirm that the product is enhancing my appearance, and at a GREAT price point!</li>
            <li>A little does go a long way which is a nice feature for the price point.</li>
            <li>I am 58yrs old and live in the desert southwest which is tuff on skin</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I have to bear that in mind whenever trying a new product.</li>
            <li>I have used other serums from other companies and for the price this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It works, but I also use a cleanser and moisturizer and I typically wear the serum doing the day because it is so light weight and does not make my face shiny or oily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and one half squeeze is all you need so the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li>It does not matter what type of skin you have (dry, oily, or combo) as this products is &amp;#34;one size fits all.&amp;#34; There was a noticeable difference in the diminishing of fine lines especially around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>The serum is silky and light and dries in less than a minute.</li>
            <li>So I am just using on top of a couple of dark spots but cannot use it in my entire face.</li>
            <li>it just turns back time and my skin is much more even and a lot of dark spots have said ....</li>
            <li>Dark spots under my eyes are also slowly fading away and my skintone has GREATLY improved.  </li>
            <li>It dries quick, sinks into the</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest use a moisturizer when the serum has dried.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin and nearly everything makes me break out</li>
            <li>as you aged, if you don&#x27;t look older, that already means you have been working hard to look good, and young.  </li>
            <li>but I think my fine lines have been reduced around my eyes and my skin looks a little brighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a couple of weeks now but can already see positive results in my skins appearance.</li>
            <li>I love her products but they are very expensive and a big to do honestly.  </li>
            <li>Having tried many anti aging products, and some were very expensive, I found this Vitamin C Serum better than anything I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li>It is nice on the skin and doesn&#x27;t bother me with strong smells (i can&#x27;t have smells because I get bad Migraines).  </li>
            <li>Instead of buying the outrageously expensive serums from the mainstream cosmetic companies, this is an excellent alternative for much less money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>no more no less I think it may take more time and another bottle</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not very consistent with using most products on my face because I usually just feel like I&#x27;m slathering something on that is not doing anything except clogging my pores which leads to a break out in a few days.</li>
            <li>Just like the other serums I’ve tried, it was easy to apply and dried fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure that I have seen any significant results relative to fine lines or pore size, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li>The formula improves the appearance of the skin by increasing hydration, reducing the effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>Packed full of active ingredients for healing, improving skin elasticity, reducing inflammation, and fighting signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I emailed them with a few questions and the response was quick and helpful!</li>
            <li>Also - and this is a major plus for a city girl like me whose makeup can get wiley in the summer months - it really does lay smoothly underneath makeup and it doesn&#x27;t make it run or wear off like other serums and facial products</li>
            <li>My skin certainly looks younger.  </li>
            <li>I use pure argon oil after applying this following all showers I take.</li>
            <li>Future leading me to believe it was ca certain ingredient in the serum to cause the reaction.</li>
            <li>and I will continue to purchase them because some of these products are my Holy Grail items, however I most likely will not repurchase this because they make other items that are much better for hydrating my very dry skin and diminishing dark marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Feels sort of thick right out of the bottle, but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>To me, it seems to work better when skin pores open just a little bit to absorb the serum.</li>
            <li>My bought me a tube of vitamin C cream from the dermatologist for 89 dollars (with a discount no less!)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a chance to try out a lot of vitamin c serums for a particular skin condition I have and InstaNatural&#x27;s was the first that had such a vast mix of ingredients that all worked together.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a little over a week, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li>Make sure you spend as little time as possible with the top off as vitamin C loses it&#x27;s strength when not preserved.  </li>
            <li>I love the high percentage of vitamin C as well as the other active ingredients.  </li>
            <li>All were clear or clear/cloudy in color--</li>
            <li>My skin is softer and clear.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the refund...VERY unexpected as I didn&#x27;t ask for it - THANK YOU for standing by your products - all of our genetics is just made up different and it happened to not work for me ;0)  </li>
            <li>It dries clear.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if it has really improved skin or helped lines and wrinkles, but if I see improvement will definitely re-order from this vendor.</li>
            <li>I like the expiry data printed clearly on the bottle.  </li>
            <li>This serum and the skin-clearing serum are the only two that I really like for my skin type out off all the products from this line I have tried so far</li>
            <li>My complexion is brighter, even and clear.</li>
            <li>Vitamin C serum should be clear and not yellowish.</li>
            <li>my niece loves it and it has helped to clear her acne</li>
            <li>However, I was hoping it would help clear up some some damage and scarring.  </li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s really helping &amp; will only use these products on my skin!  </li>
            <li>Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum  uses the natural power of Ferulic Acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E to keep the skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum [which is clear and unscented-</li>
            <li>~I will not order again and look for a clear, thinner product .   </li>
            <li>I have had so many compliments lately on how young I look.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid-30s and have combination/dry skin that is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any thing drastic so far.</li>
            <li>After using product now for three months I can say that discolorations in my skin have improved, the skin tightening continues and I am completely hooked.</li>
            <li>Being all natural, whats not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my skin drinks it up and feels really soft and moisturized after.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft..</li>
            <li>The serum is an orange color, and smells citrus-y, which should not be unexpected.</li>
            <li>My skin feels luxurious, soft, supple.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use until product is completely used to allow time to see if it will make a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>So far, this product did not irritate my skin and did not cause blemishes.</li>
            <li>It is quite soft to the touch.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really attest to its anti aging properties, but it definitely hydrates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had an old pimple bump (or</li>
            <li>Today for the first time in a long time (I&#x27;m 39)</li>

            <li>My face feels cleaner with out stripping away my natural oils in my face.</li>
            <li>Immediately followed with this Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum and just one squirt of Insta Natural Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li>I have bags which I know that can only really be taken care of by surgery , bags run in the family , so</li>
            <li>This makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>63 year old skin</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my face breaking out, and I have sensitive skin in that regard.</li>
            <li>But, I do at least feel like using the serum is better than doing nothing, since my skin does not seem to be having</li>
            <li>I have purchased vitamin C serum that cost nearly $100 from my aesthetician and this stuff works just as well.</li>
            <li>I use this every day and my skin feels so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>sensitive skin and sun screen seems to make my skin flake off  </li>

            <li>(tocopheryl acetate),pomegranate, organic carrot seed oil,apricot kernel oil,organic gotu kota,wildcrafted horsetail,wildcrafted dandelion, wilcrafted wild geranium, phenoxyethanaol,ethyl hexyl gylcerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Both serum seem to have regulated my otherwise sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>It stripped my face of its natural barrier in the process.</li>
            <li>and I am considering repurchasing, though I&#x27;m not totally sold on it because I can&#x27;t really say it did anything.  </li>

            <li>Plus I am using it on an age spot and it has faded considerably.  </li>
            <li>We recently went on vacation and took a whole lot of photos.  </li>
            <li>All the ingredients are all natural.</li>

            <li>I am 58 years old.</li>
            <li>I also like that it has natural ingredients</li>
            <li>my skin looks and feels much smoother and firmer - this is a definite keeper!</li>
            <li>it is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li>I believe it is because my skin have always been quite sensitive.</li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>This product is natural &amp; certified organic.</li>
            <li>Does not leave skin soft and no longer helps my rosacea.</li>
            <li>Came on time, It is a bit early to see skin results</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive,  so I must be allegric to one of the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had no harsh reactions, because the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li>It is 98% natural and 72% Organic.</li>
            <li>sample was provided by Insta Natural to conduct my review.</li>

            <li>sample was provided by Insta Natural to conduct my review.</li>
            <li>so i really don&#x27;t see it working like an instant cure.</li>
            <li>but I am surprised at your inquiry,love it that you care.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 11 year old daughter uses it and loves it too.</li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I do feel my skin better, but I am also using a dermaroller lately so it could be a bit of both.</li>
            <li>I look forward to continue to do business with Insta Natural.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling soft, smooth, firm and looking MUCH healthier.</li>
            <li>and I tend to have an overly sensitive sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I am going to stick with the Insta Natural.</li>
            <li>Really seems to tighten the facial skin.</li>
            <li>I also have old acne scars and they seem to be getting smoother, not so pronounced.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be surprised.  </li>
            <li>my old acne scars seems to be fading.</li>
            <li>They are all natural and have given me the opportunity to try a number of their products.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin too and haven&#x27;t had any reaction to this product.</li>
            <li>I do however have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and prone to redness.</li>
            <li>This was before you could get wonderfully natural products that nurtured skin rather than stripping it and adding chemicals.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft after using it.</li>
            <li>If coconut oil even looks my way my skin morphs into a 13 year old boy&#x27;s.)</li>
            <li>I dont know what others do, but I put it on at night and wake up with glowing skin, soft and supple.</li>
            <li>Im young</li>
            <li>It does smell like orange juice which is kind of weird and gets sticky if you put too much on</li>
            <li>I purposely waited a few weeks to leave feedback to be sure my opinion didn&#x27;t change after the initial uses.  </li>
            <li>Your face will love it &amp; you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>last week a order two more because I don&#x27;t want to stop using it, I got everyday complements on my skin been using mornings and at night</li>
            <li>Another aspect that I love is that it does not feel heavy on your skin as it absorbs deep into the skin.</li>
            <li>The dropper bottle makes application easier, especially if applying a few drops to the dorsal (top) sides of the hands to help lighten sun spots or discoloration.  </li>
            <li>A bit skeptical but because of good reviews, I gave it a try, even bought 2 items with the Vit C from this brand&#x27;s line of products.</li>
            <li>Sorry, would like to write a good review, but this is the fact</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice serum, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out, and I will use it til it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>Fine lines have lessened as well as minimized other facial imperfections.  </li>
            <li>Initially, expect your skin to look a bit worse, especially if you have lines around your eyes, which I don&#x27;t, or on your forehead, which I do, because this serum helps your skin shed its older layers and brings up fresh, healthy skin.</li>
            <li>A very small few drops rubbed over the problem areas on the face and your skin is silky smooth and hydrated for 16hrs or more.</li>
            <li>It has replaced several other products that I used to use because it is more of an all-in-one rather than being for one specific problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and sinks right in.  </li>
            <li>What really sets this apart from other serums is that it is not thin and runny, nor does it feel sticky after applied.  </li>
            <li>The company contacted me as a follow-up to my order with helpful tips and tricks on how to use the product - you can layer it with other serums and moisturizers - it will fit into your regular routine.  </li>
            <li>This serum smells delicious, and is thin and relatively watery as they all are in my experience, but stays juicy long enough for me to spread two big drops all over my face, including around my eyes, then absorbs and dries in a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li>and you push syringe and sometimes takes a full one or half of one.</li>
            <li>, it is not oily, absorbs quickly and I have noticed a difference in the brightness of my skin and the fading of dark spots.  </li>
            <li>After I use my toner, I put a little of this onto my clean fingertips, then rub it onto my face.</li>
            <li>I use it as a spot treatment on the dark spots and scars and fine lines on my face daily.</li>
            <li>The ingredients are natural, and there is a slight odor of caffeine, again this vanishes quickly.</li>
            <li>Because I have sensitive skin, I generally read reviews like crazy before trying anything new, and I am very cautious about what I put on my skin (I no longer even use toner, only pure rose water or nothing at all before moisturizing).</li>
            <li>it smells a little funny, but that goes away fast.</li>
            <li>After a couple of weeks of using this serum under my normal moisturizer, my skin is getting more dried out, rough, and irritated (I&#x27;m breaking out and</li>
            <li>I am using it in a combination with Vitamin E Oil to lighten dark skin in bikini area resulting from friction and old pimples (I Live in a desert like weather, tooo hot 40+ C )</li>
            <li>Leaves an unpleasant texture on the skin, if i try to put my light moisturizer on top product will ball up and roll off my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m not actually sure if this does anything for the rest of my face as I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines.</li>
            <li>I was paying much more for a small vial of the same percentage of vitamin c before I discovered this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I’ve used a different Vitamin C Serum in the past and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>My beauty routine is pretty simple, but I think I&#x27;ll add this product to my daily schedule.  </li>
            <li>Trust me, I have already ordered my second bottle after only having my first bottle for 2 days.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without a greasy heavy feeling!</li>
            <li>used this in conjunction with the vitamin C moisturizer, and I left a pretty similar review on that as well.</li>
            <li>After a few traumatic microdermabrasion treatments, my normally clear skin started breaking out badly- not just pimples, but with zits and infected bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it is a little sticky in my face and gets on my pillow easy.</li>
            <li>After  you apply it make sure you use a moisturizer because your face will feel a little dry,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a crock full of vitamin and oil goodness; I like to use it on those days my skin needs a little TLC</li>
            <li>Sinks in very fast.</li>
            <li>A company with high quality personal service!</li>
            <li>This is a high quality serum delivered by glass dropper in a blue glass bottle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to conclude for sure because I used a myriad of products, but for the price and my perception so far, I am a fan!</li>
            <li>I am 60 yrs old and have very sensitive skin that can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s dry, oily, breakout prone or normal.  </li>
            <li>use it along with an organic active moisturizer to get better results, indeed, this serum compliments the active moisturizer</li>
            <li>although prone to hormonal breakouts once a month, only oily on my nose, I don&#x27;t go tanning - only general sun exposure, only starting to get some fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li>(if required).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for several days twice a day no doubt it was relatively easy to apply although it did require patience at times due to the amount of time it took, especially in the morning before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>usually have circles and bags under my tired mom-eyes, and after a couple weeks of this, my eyes haven&#x27;t looked this bright since pre-kids!</li>
            <li>/&gt;InstaNatural’s Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum is produced in small batches to ensure quality and freshness.</li>
            <li>My skin was left with a natural, radiant glow and it was not harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I would try to identify what&#x27;s really working for me, in the long list of ingredients, and go for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I lightly rub a small amount over my face, neck and decolette.</li>
            <li>It helped return the dark spots back to its original skin color.</li>
            <li>I usually have an issue with oily serums because they clog my pores and make my skin feel heavy and gross, but this was nice!</li>
            <li>I work outside, and I noticed that my skin was feeling drier than normal despite using moisturizer over the serum.</li>
            <li>I did see more improvement in dark spots and other pigmented areas around my face, neck and hands.   </li>
            <li>Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li>I use it full strength on my face and mix a few drops with body lotion and apply all over.</li>
            <li>This review is for skin that is: sensitive to dry, mature, thin, light laugh wrinkles around eyes.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using InstaNatural vitamin C, and I am surprised how it changed my face since the first session, I am 31 years old, I have normal skin type, uneven skin tone and dark circles under my eyes, I use 1.5 dermaroler on my face</li>
            <li>I have used numerous vitamin c serum products and this is the first with the strong fruity scent and unappealing yellow/orange color.</li>
            <li>It is hard to judge effects when I use more than one product regularly.  </li>
            <li>My sun spots came back and I live in rainy Oregon.</li>
            <li>This is the only new product that I have been using that would be making me break out, and I now have patches on my cheeks of what looks like eczema-</li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t make a fuss over my issue, they simply apologized for the mishap and sent me a new bottle.</li>
            <li>so I decided to use the Insta  Natural vitamin c serum to help tighten them up and get my young girl glow back.</li>
            <li>Have only used it for 2wks and has left my skin very soft😊</li>
            <li>It really has become an essential part of my daily face regimen.  </li>
            <li>All indications are that the product is fresh and my only complaint is that because it is absorbed almost immediately upon application to the skin, it&#x27;s necessary to drop the serum directly onto a section of the face and rub it in before applying to another section.  </li>
            <li>This product made my skin look really refreshed without causing breakouts or aggravating any existing acne, and after multiple weeks of using it on a regular basis, you could see a difference.</li>
            <li>You can see the  difference in your skin in as quick as a few days.</li>
            <li>It was the least expensive, with the best reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This vitamin C Serum is easy to use, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll get right down to it - summer</li>
            <li>I think its too soon to see any major improvements.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend $70 on other products for men</li>
            <li>I also am aware that this form of vitamin c is not prone to oxidation, so that is an improvement over some other products.</li>
            <li>It is as lightweight and silky as other higher end serums.</li>
            <li>This has always been a major problem with my face.</li>
            <li>so I dont have any major issues.  </li>
            <li>It has truly done wonders, softened scars and  makes my skin look tight and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be picking up a few things from this line, ingredients are better than ANY Caudalie, Clinique, Body Shop, or other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>There are so many products out there that do not live up to their claims, and believe me, I previously wasted a lot of money on some of those, but this one actually surpasses them.</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 different Vitamin C serums and I like yours even better than OZ Naturals (a close 2nd) for a few reasons, one being the orange fragrance, absorption is better and cost is less, seems to last a little longer.</li>
            <li>and I only have some fine lines on my forehead and some small sun spots and discoloration on my face.</li>
            <li>The main issue for me is an aging spot on my upper left cheak.</li>
            <li>They are so light you can hardly see them.  </li>
            <li>I had been using a more expensive product with a high hyaluronic acid percentage, in a pump bottle.  </li>
            <li>a little over couple of weeks, will know more down the road</li>
            <li>It had a love scent, and bright ,vibrant color, but like the toner, after application, it took a little long to dry, and left a stickiness behind, that made my face feel gross and weighted down.</li>
            <li>I use their Vitamin C Toner first &amp; let dry, then apply this Vitamin C Serum (a little goes a long way!), then follow with their Vitamin C Moisturizer in the morning &amp; their Retinol Moisturizer at night to really zap those wrinkles &amp; prevent new ones!  </li>
            <li>I also haven&#x27;t noticed any hormonal breakouts this month, could be a coincidence, but I&#x27;ve noticed a general improvement with my complexion</li>
            <li>Strangers generally guess that I&#x27;m 24.  </li>
            <li>People generally think I am in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Repeated or extended exposure to light and/or air can have a negative effect on efficacy.  </li>
            <li>Guys don&#x27;t generally put a ton of effort into face cleansing until the wrinkles start.</li>
            <li>In general, I felt that this serum was pretty average.</li>
            <li>Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li>Because of the clear color, I could see if the serum was turning even the slightest shade of yellow, and I would know to throw it out and start over.  </li>
            <li>Has definitely brighten up my skin and clear acne and spots.  </li>
            <li>The serum looks dense and yellow, smells a bit strange like fruit, absorb fast.</li>
            <li>and I believe it will last me a long time, as it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t change the product back to the clear sticky liquid.</li>
            <li>At nearly $17 a bottle this bottle lasted me just under 3 weeks with daily and sometimes twice a day use.  </li>
            <li>I am 25 and have tried various preventative aging products, but because my skin is so sensitive they tend to not pan out.</li>
            <li>There is really nothing negative to say about this product; it is well priced and effective, at least for my needs.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, so I am only using every three (3) days to increase my tolerance.</li>
            <li>and it provides the necessary strength and resilience that we attribute to young looking skin.</li>
            <li>If you use too much you will get a tacky film so be careful.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li>It definitely brightens and refines the pores and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>No film or barely perceptible film.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 50+ year old skin is definitely clearer, smoother, &amp; brighter!!  </li>
            <li>anything natural with all the key ingredients.</li>
            <li>These are apparently sleep lines caused by burying my face in the pillow every night for years.  </li>
            <li>I received this today and only just applied it once so far.</li>
            <li>I rated this product a 4 because it did give my skin a natural glow and also helped my skin with a recent breakout.</li>
            <li>It has helped me with my crows feet around the eye area and with the deep wrinkles near the nose and cheek area.</li>
            <li>I hope to see them completely disappear with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li>My pores look a lot smaller and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>My face feels soft after several usage of this serum.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week so far</li>
            <li>I have only been using this product for a week and tried it on an old cut on my hand</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s too early to tell, but definitely does nothing for discoloration,</li>
            <li>My daughter used it on her skin last night and followed with Insta Natural Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li>only been using for a couple of weeks, but skin does feel smoother so far</li>
            <li>i have some hyper-pigmentation around my face that i&#x27;ve developed in the last year or so, and i&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of it for a bit.</li>
            <li>and I had a red spot on my face that is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels ultra soft and my deep wrinkles seems to have smoothed out!</li>
            <li>Also, Insta Natural has 100-day hassle-free money back guarantee, no matter where the product was purchased.</li>
            <li>I recently had the opportunity to try this Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic and Ferulic Acid from Insta Natural.</li>
            <li>I have spent so much money on products that did not deliver 10% of the results that InstaNatural provide not to mention there</li>
            <li>The design of the product using the eye dropper is a real plus for keeping the serum minimally exposed to air which depletes the potency over time.</li>
            <li>old female still struggling with acne and combination skin.</li>
            <li>Additionally, HA can often make sensitive skin red or feel a momentary burn/tingle.  </li>
            <li>and i realize it is early to tell, my pores are reduced like all the way, leaving my skin texture smoother, also I see clarity and an even tone now, I had discoloration around my chin and side of my face since my20&#x27;s and that is gone, in specific yellowing around the mouth.</li>
            <li>I have been making natural skincare for ten years.</li>
            <li>but it has been only a couple of weeks so far since I started using it.</li>
            <li>The serum has a nice consistency and a faint citrusy aroma.</li>
            <li>It’s a thick serum that’s very easy to spread with your fingers, and the Hyaluronic Acid in the serum enhances hydration further by boosting the skin’s ability to retain moisture throughout the day to help combat dry and/or damaged</li>
            <li>Really made my skin feel soft and cut down on my redness.</li>
            <li>She uses 4 drops, twice a day after washing, but started at just once a day for several weeks to allow time for her skin to adjust to the vitamin C.  Burned just a little right after application during weeks one and two, but the pinkness and mild burning sensation subsided after a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give an accurate review, but I&#x27;m seeing a slight improvement after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>By the very next morning after her first use, we noticed she looked clearer and less oily, but, not dried out like some products.</li>
            <li>Also as the days go by, i am noticing the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable, skin tone is even and bright; and the forehead lines have decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li>Something about being outside in the sun for extended periods of time causes dryness with this serum, so if you work outdoors and/or have very sensitive skin as I do, I would only use this at night.</li>
            <li>I cannot say these sunspots were gone for a week usage, but I am pretty hopeful because I can see the slight change in colors already.</li>
            <li>Pleasant, very faint herbal scent.  </li>
            <li>It comes out literally coated and dripping with the serum, and that makes it kind of messy and hard to get the right amount without getting too much/too little.</li>
            <li>For my age, I have minimal (but enough) wrinkles around my eyes, I do have forehead lines and large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum as the consistency is thicker and easier to apply than other Vitamin C Serums I have tried.</li>
            <li>I really like the vitamin c and all the other components of this serum .At</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice a glow but did leave skin feeling supple and hydrated due to the vitamin c and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s herbal and quite sharp, but not to the point to irritate or really bother you.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried a couple of other vitamin c serums, but didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>and it really packs a punch without the burn of other serums.</li>
            <li>I do use the InstaNatural Vitamin C moisturizer after and they compliment each other very well.</li>
            <li>They compliment each other well and seem to really work together to make your skin healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion, its a little too heavy to wear during the day, but OK at night.  </li>
            <li>so it had that clear blue tint and smelled like grapefruit and the second time it was the beginning of spring and had that orange tint</li>
            <li>Recently I went to a spa to have a professional facial  </li>
            <li>I regularly get sun spots and have some old acne scars, and while using this serum, I do feel like my skin has lightened up a bit, especially the scars and sun spots, and my skin looks brighter!</li>
            <li>It does not dry out skin but also keeps it from being too oily.</li>
            <li>Also, It does not dry my face out which I was worried about because of the strength.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t experience improvement of my dark spots or other imperfections like with the Original formula.  .  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I used it on a little spot at first</li>
            <li>i hope this helps some people out thererk spot nothing major but def obvious and that has faded.</li>
            <li>This Vitamin C serum is very thick and a little drop is good for the entire face.</li>
            <li>The apparent stickiness only lasts until serum is fully absorbed, it only takes a few drops.</li>
            <li>It instantly makes my skin feel a little more firm, which I like.</li>
            <li>one feels cool on my face and stings just a tiny bit that you forgot about it, you wont have to use a lot of drops, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin is no longer dry; it is smooth - no more flakiness.</li>
            <li>This new product is a watered down, version of the old one.</li>
            <li>This serum was very disappointing, after reading so many positive reviews I was expecting a high quality serum</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is thick and consistent, smells like citrus and it feels very natural to me.</li>
            <li>Disappointed they changed what used to be a great product.</li>
            <li>But in general, 2 - 4 drops of this after washing is enough.  </li>
            <li>But other than that I am starting to see real results..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least 2 other vitamin c serums and I really love these products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been noticing a significant reduction in my skin hydration recently, especially coming out of a Minnesota winter, but by April, my skin usually snaps back well enough.</li>
            <li>I have been trying some different InstaNatural brand all natural facial products on a promotion and overall these</li>
            <li>Not long for words, I have been using this serum for 2 months.  </li>
            <li>Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  </li>
            <li>I am old and my have waited too long for a miracle.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;The reason is that serums have very small molecules and lipophilic - fat friendly</li>
            <li>is a little bit high to buy frequently</li>
            <li>I have a few dark spots on my forehead and some fine lines around my eyes that could use a bit of help.  </li>
            <li>I also have very oily skin and was worried about the serum making my skin feel weighted down, but that is not the case.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine whether it will eventually lighten some of the age spots I&#x27;m starting to see, but I have high hopes and will provide a future update on my results.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li>I know that I get frustrated with many products because I run out of the product right around the same time I start seeing results.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if the product offers any &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; improvement, but it certainly smoothes and tightens the skin when applied.</li>
            <li>I also love that they do not add any artificial fragrance, my skin is very sensitive, I can not use perfumes or products that contain them, it causes me to break out in eczema on my face and neck!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really explain what is different about my face, other than it simply looks radiant.  </li>
            <li>I do not mean artificial candy orange, but pure orange like juice from a fresh squeezed orange.</li>
            <li>This is a great price for Vitamin C serum, though not sure what percentage it is compared to the highly expensive serums.  </li>
            <li>I feel this product has really help with the slight sun damage I have on my chest.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t really give this anything less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I was MUCH happier with the CE+Ferulic combination I bought on amazon previously.</li>
            <li>I could feel a very slight tingling when I first started using it, which told me it was working..</li>
            <li>first then I apply few amount of the serum all over my face one a week and the glowing last for a week, not alot of change under my eyes</li>
            <li>The consistency is like a thick orange juice between your finger tips and although it absorbs quickly after cleansing and toning I have seen no results or any of the advertised added benefits after quite a bit of time of use.</li>
            <li>Right away ya skin soaks it up so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t really seen any dramatic results since I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a month, I&#x27;m convinced that I will see positive, long-lasting results in the near future.</li>
            <li>little goes a long way too, so you will definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day faithfully and can honestly state that it does no more or less than any other Vitamin C serums on the market.</li>
            <li>Each of those ingredients are hard to find in a product by themselves, much less all combined, so you know you are getting top quality.</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve always had these creases, even as a teen) and just generally look gross to me after several hours, but this has seemed to help that</li>
            <li>The reason for 4 stars is that even though I see no long term effects I see an instant effect after applying this: my skin feels tighter with a glow to it.</li>
            <li>so I have those on my forehead but seeing the results so far  am hoping I can loose those.</li>
            <li>so I have those on my forehead but seeing the results so far  am hoping I can loose those.</li>
            <li>skin has become from oily to dry in just 2 weeks and white patches show up in morning near under eye area.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s very sticky feeling and leaves my face feeling tight after applied.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any results, but it doesn&#x27;t break me out and it sinks in decently enough without leaving much of a film.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really pleasant, as it is citrus so it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical smell that will make you sick.</li>
            <li>I received multiple positive complements after using products for just a few days.  </li>
            <li>It smells a little bit strange but absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li>They are amazing, Although I have a typical oily &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone somethat typical of black skin, I was suffering from dry pockets pockets as skin ages.</li>
            <li>With the dropper, you can use as little or as much as you want.</li>
            <li>I noticed it was just a little bit thinner than another vitamin c serum I’d recently tried, so I had to act fast after I applied it to my face</li>
            <li>First, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It used to come in a dark blue bottle, left my skin feeling soft, and was a thick serum and rich in color.</li>
            <li>Its almost as good as the expensive one.. just a little thicker.</li>
            <li>sometimes your skin is striped and very sensitive due to chemical treatments and cleansers.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Had filler put under my eyes on Wednesday and needed a good serum to make my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> Good bye</li>
            <li> A good Vitamin C Serum is sold in an amber bottle just like this one to extend its shelf life.</li>
            <li> because it goes on smooth and best of all, it does not leave any oily spots or film residue.</li>
            <li> will, although, after seeing some actors I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good option either.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved it.  </li>
            <li> Great product and nice smell</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and have seen good results.</li>
            <li> I have read about the good benefits of using Vit C serum.</li>
            <li> how good it was for the skin as well.</li>
            <li> What I have found with the Vitamin C serum is its incredible ability to shrink pores and maintain a healthy balance of moisture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells good.</li>
            <li> all product is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into writing reviews, but decided that this product is SO good, that I needed to let everyone know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like using good ingredients on my skin but not breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> This is a good produce</li>
            <li> Iknow the pictures aren&#x27;t that good, but I looked and looked in the mirror.</li>
            <li> Friends and family have been asking how my skin looks as good as it does</li>
            <li> Good price</li>
            <li> When that happened, I picked up a Clairsonic Mia (cheapest model), a good cream cleanser, and instanaturals vitamin c serum for use after washing.</li>
            <li> Both products are superior for my skin</li>
            <li> The good thing that, you don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer after this serum unless you want to.</li>
            <li> I still think this is a good serum if you would like to help even your skin texture and complexion, InstaNatural&#x27;s vitamin c serum will be</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that my face feels refreshed along with a great citric smell but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li> good price</li>
            <li> good under skin cream or makeup</li>
            <li> it smells good and has healing properties to help tighten and moisturize my skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels good going on and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I can tell you it smells really good</li>
            <li> I honestly can&#x27;t understand the great reviews.</li>
            <li> smell is good</li>
            <li> Definitely a good investment if you want clearer skin.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how good my skin looked in all of them</li>
            <li> This is a superior product with superior customer support-  </li>
            <li> good product satified</li>
            <li> SURPRISINGLY THE PRODUCT ARRIVED MAY10TH AS PROMISED,</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep using it, because it never hurts to do good things for your skin.  </li>

            <li> I mix it with peptides and it feels GOOD.</li>
            <li> my friends comment on how good my face looks</li>

            <li> and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>

            <li> They make good stuff at a good price.</li>
            <li> This serum feels good on my face.  </li>
            <li> From what I have read that means it&#x27;s no longer good.</li>
            <li> I would cleanse well, use a good moisturizing toner (InstaNatural&#x27;s rose water works great with this), apply the serum, then the oils over that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely a great value and very easily incorporated into any skin care regime.  </li>
            <li> Her face feels radiant and more beautiful than ever before.</li>

            <li> Either the users aren&#x27;t familiar with skin care and can&#x27;t tell whether a product is actually good or not, or they&#x27;re falling for the hype with all the great reviews that people are probably being paid to write and the placebo effect kicked in.</li>

            <li> This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is amazing stuff, I read about it on a YOU Tube video on aging skin care, and what a find.</li>

            <li> I used it in conjunction with InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer, so I can&#x27;t speak to how effective the product would be alone, but combined with the moisturizer, it was outstanding.</li>
            <li> the first 15-20 seconds after you put it on, but just pat it and soaks in beautifully</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate on their products, safe and effective.</li>
            <li> We all know how amazing vitamin C is for keeping a healthy balance in the body, fighting infections and stabilizing your immune system.</li>
            <li> This serum has been excellent so far...</li>
            <li> So far I am very impressed by this vitamin C serum.  </li>

            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with the serum.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural has done a wonderful thing and listed the ingredients in the product</li>
            <li> It is natural and has a delicious smell..</li>
            <li> Her skin looks smoother , she did peel some from it, but wow now she looks great!</li>
            <li> BUT SOO FAR LOVE IT!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> I used this after washing my face and toning with rosewater, and love how it absorbs immediately and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This was a nice serum, smells like oranges and what not, but doesn&#x27;t do much more than brighten and make my skin look &amp;#34;cleaner.&amp;#34;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the citrus smell, goes on nicely and</li>
            <li> The smell is nice too - refreshing.</li>

            <li> The serum is the perfect natural toner to set the palette for moisturizer and/or makeup.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in combination with their Moroccan Rose Water, my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing like a refreshing glass of fresh squeezed orange juice and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Most of these items I have bought  &amp; made my own mix of oils.  </li>
            <li> Studies have repeatedly shown L-Ascorbic Acid as having the most effective antioxidant properties as it is the purest form of vitamin C. I won&#x27;t be using this</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very happy with my complexion since I started using Insta Natural.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews before buying it, and I wonder if it is getting good reviews because the company is supplying free bottles?</li>
            <li> Many of the products that did amazing for me no longer suffice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive, so I have found that using nightly is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> Some of the ingredients are argon oil, rose hip oil, and plant stem cells in addition to the vitamin C, so, it is packed full of good stuff for your skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great serum, it smells good, not thick or too liquidy either.</li>
            <li> Great investment right here.</li>
            <li> * Lighter and smoother looking, with a reduction in very fine</li>
            <li> Easy!</li>
            <li> The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> It makes my skin really fresh, it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy and very nice to use in the summer.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely face serum, very light but effective.  </li>
            <li> Anyone who wants their fine lines to start to disapesr they should try this awesome product</li>
            <li> My favorite vitamin c serum- easy to apply, great consistency, helps get rid of fine lines</li>
            <li> For a high concentration, the chemical balance seems very good as there is no stinging or reddening and my skin feels smoother and a bit brighter/clearer.</li>

            <li> I have been researching what goes into the lotions and potions we put on our faces, and this has all the simple and best ingredients that I was contemplating buying alone and mixing up on my own.  </li>
            <li> It absorbes nicely and My skin feel nice and smooth</li>
            <li> It was nice and light and smelled nice too.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural vitamin C serum is great because it has the good stuff in it, like vitamin E, Ferulic and Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is a great skincare ingredient on its own, but its very unstable.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> I am 100% pleased as the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to continue using this Great Product!!</li>
            <li> Pleasant feeling, mild scent.</li>
            <li> The bottle is perfectly sealed, glass is blue to protect the ingredients, the dropper is perfectly functional, and the actual product seems to be as good as most serums, Vitamin C or others.  </li>
            <li> anyway I own several and all of them are awesome.</li>
            <li> I am so happy to find a great product at such a reasonable price, works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This serum is doing a great job at exfoliating my skin very gently.  </li>
            <li> Right now I am happy but will update if it maintains and I see more improvements.</li>
            <li> but it turned out to be very pleasant and did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> When you feel attractive you actually are attractive and have more confidence.</li>
            <li> you have successfully tried moisturizers from Lancôme, Estee Lauder, or Borghese, this might be worth a try.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, great citrus smell, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> Like the refreshing clean smell and the good results when combined with the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I love that it is absorbed so quickly and has a very pleasant citrus scent.</li>
            <li> Fine lines are diminishing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light , it smells fruity and it leaves my face looking refreshed.  </li>
            <li> It applies evenly and very smoothly to the face.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> and I found that my skin is looking very smooth and radiant,</li>
            <li> I emailed a question or two to them and got a very detailed answer as well as an offer for a sample of another product, and a repeated offer to assist with information any time I need it to reach all of my skincare goals.</li>
            <li> It smells very lightly of citrus.  </li>
            <li> and I needed a very light serum to help aid in skin repair.</li>

            <li> Surprised me, very good product.  </li>
            <li> but since I started using this product,  I have noticed a huge improvement !</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is lovely, bright and citrusy which goes away after it&#x27;s absorbed.</li>

            <li> I have thoroughly enjoyed the product for almost two months</li>
            <li> /&gt;First and foremost, I looked at the ingredients of the product and made sure that they were there for the correct reasons.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s even better in this formulation.</li>
            <li> However, since starting, my skin, which is acne-prone, has never looked so great!</li>

            <li> And it does not take more than a drop or two.  </li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more when this runs out.</li>

            <li> Absolutely wonderful and a total bargain for the results I have seen!</li>
            <li> I feel I should note after reading many reviews on any product I purchase</li>
            <li> After a couple of months I should know more.</li>
            <li> I use it often, mostly every night.</li>
            <li> Make sure you follow the directions and use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It is sticky, but makes your skin appear more youthful.  </li>
            <li> I have used a couple different serums and this one is the best yet.  </li>

            <li> I love it.  </li>

            <li> give it a minute to absorb then apply your favorite moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I will be a lifetime buyer. :)</li>
            <li> Love this serum.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it made my skin feel and was not greasy and also adsorbed well.</li>
            <li> Love the smell</li>
            <li> More time will tell if this product makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> but I am considering Age-defying Skin clearing or Skin Brightening serum, may be it will deliver better, faster result ????</li>
            <li> So, each bottle costs over $6 more than for US customers.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this looking for a more affordable Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The price is great and it works very well.</li>
            <li> I love it, I&#x27;m worried the price will creep up.</li>
            <li> I chose the exchange since I do love the brand and what they stand for.</li>
            <li> I can see the healing and rejuvenating effects from this product - I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have one wrinkle around my eyes, my neck is in great shape, my skin is clear and no one EVER believes I am 62.I date men in their forties, but I am honest about my age.</li>
            <li> I love this serum</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> My skin appears more radiant, brighter and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> but i think it would help with antiaging if i used it more.</li>
            <li> I have used many vitamin C serums and this one is a favorite.  </li>
            <li> I have the scar gel (which I just ran out of and will b purchasing more)</li>
            <li> but I love this Vitamin C Serum and would recommend it everyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad i picked this brand&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of aroma every time I apply it to my face.</li>
            <li> I was able to try 2 products before I purchased.</li>
            <li> For those who don&#x27;t love citrus, the scent goes away almost immediately after application/absorption.  </li>
            <li> I felt like it stayed where you applied it, but when i dotted it around my face a bit and then smoothed it out, that seemed to work better for me.  </li>
            <li> I would have to say this is my favorite along with the hyalouronic acid serum.</li>
            <li> and I find the hyalournic plumps and hydrates it the most</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> My skin feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> I love the vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes me look and feel.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin tone seems more balanced as well.</li>
            <li> I just turned 60 and have been noticing my wrinkles a lot more.</li>
            <li> After trying many, instanatural tops them all at 1/5 of the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I was still able to wear makeup over it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the benefits of vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> my face become brighter and more radiant.</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> but I will put again love it.</li>

            <li> For me is a keeper :)</li>
            <li> I have seen my pores become more refined and</li>
            <li> the texture of my skin is firmer and more toned.  </li>
            <li> Product smells great and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover your whole face.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin does look healthy.</li>
            <li> My face is noticeably clearer and more radiant.</li>
            <li> and I love the vitamin c moisturizer too</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I will order more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> It tightens the skin and leaves it feeling nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Smells really nice ang goes on light.</li>
            <li> I love the price too&lt;</li>
            <li> Its ok....</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and am noticing a brighter more radiant complexion overall.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied with this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Love the serum and how it feels on my face</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with the price though,</li>
            <li> but i dont see a difference with the wrinkles yet, need more time.</li>
            <li> I will be satisfied and I buy again.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll switch to those for a while, until I find something better at a lower price.</li>
            <li> I ended up using again my Image Skincare serum, works much better for my sun spots.</li>
            <li> I have been able to try this product through a promotion from tomoson.</li>
            <li> You will love</li>

            <li> It is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I asked many questions to the company about their products, and got quick/polite responses.</li>
            <li> Top notch....</li>
            <li> I bought this product without any intentions of having better looking skin, I don&#x27;t believe in products that reverse aging.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>

            <li> Night time is when your body renews your skin the most so use it before you go to sleep.</li>
            <li> After more than a month of use</li>
            <li> so I feel like I am not wasting anything like most Vitamin C serums.</li>
            <li> This is better than all of them in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have had normal/combination skin most of my life</li>
            <li> I love this serum.</li>
            <li> Smells ok.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have some type of moisturizer to apply afterwards.</li>

            <li> The ingredients are top notch.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> Simply The best product!  </li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this great product.</li>
            <li> This has helped me gain more energy.  </li>
            <li> I love the citrus smell and once applies doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or sticky.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> My complexion is better, as well as helped with pores.</li>
            <li> My skin is beginning to become a more even, spot-free tone.</li>
            <li> I will add more info as I use it longer but</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks and really love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite part is that it also contains Hyaluronic Acid to help moisturize the skin, very useful in the winter!</li>
            <li> I like 20% Vitamin C serum because it provides my skin the right source of moisturizing and bright up my skin.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good product and a lot of people have noticed improvements, I just do not think it is necessarily right for my skin</li>
            <li> My skin soaks it right up and feels so good.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think this would be a good thing, right?</li>
            <li> There are some vitamin C serums that are super tacky, very potent smelling...</li>
            <li> The oil is light, has a pleasant citrusy smell, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> and so I don&#x27;t have very significant improvement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very very excited I stepped out of my comfort zone for this one.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, and it arrived very quickly in nice packaging.</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich &amp; has a nice texture to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I bought this serum and don&#x27;t have to keep spending a fortune trying out new products that don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> first i saw clearness and a more bright complexion of my face.</li>
            <li> But it was pretty costly so decided to go cheaper because this product had many good reviews.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to work with, and they really want to make sure you are happy with your purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am very familiar with skin care products and have tried many, MANY products to get to the great routine that I have presently, so I&#x27;m no amateur when it comes to serums and that like.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wash with my own special face wash before application of serum and my moisturizer after the serum dries (which is seconds).</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft and it smells great!!!</li>
            <li> very good its like a potion that makes your skin bright and tight</li>
            <li> The smell is very pleasant and in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it, I can see it&#x27;s brightening properties at work already.</li>
            <li> It did however maintain the bright complexion i&#x27;ve maintained since using the first serum</li>
            <li> About me: I&#x27;m 30, pretty good skin</li>
            <li> Goes a long way and feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> Most importantly almost immediately my skin had a healthy glow and looked and felt more taut.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is becoming more even</li>
            <li> Storing it in the refrigerator makes it feel even more refreshing and also keeps it safe from light and heat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell pretty good</li>
            <li> I’ve been using the serum twice a day and already notice my complexion becoming more even.</li>
            <li> Smells good and my face looks and feels so much softer!</li>
            <li> have always had pretty good skin, aside from a blemish or two and the once a month</li>
            <li> Most important I found the Original version to be more effective.</li>
            <li> The first thing I loved was the texture and absorbtion and fragrance..</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product because it has improved my skin significantly!</li>
            <li> This serum smells like fresh orange!!</li>
            <li> and I can notice my acne scar has lightened significantly!</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C serum smells amazing and absorbs really quickly on skin.</li>
            <li> my skin is dry so this combination is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I would say it absorbs very quickly  and make my lines appear more blurred .</li>
            <li> It spreads nicely and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It has a nice, mild citrus smell to it.</li>
            <li> Well, I don&#x27;t think so, but they do have an oil that is super nice</li>
            <li> It smells nice and feels nice on my skin, but the older formulation of this product was much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to put good Vitamin C on your skin, especially you feel your skin like {drying}.</li>
            <li> Shipping was so fast, and the bottle  were bubble wrapped very well and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> It has great components that help the heathy cell naturally generate and to have the healthy glow in my face.</li>
            <li> 1 ounce has lasted me for almost 3 months which is ideal because any skincare product with vitamin c oxidizes so you will not be able to keep an open bottle for years.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m loving the smell and feel of this when I rub it into my face.</li>
            <li> I love this soooo much and was weary because the price is so good.</li>
            <li> However, at 67 and seeking great products, natural and organic, I give this serum top billing.</li>
            <li> Because of its advance ingredients it is able to provide many fantastic combinations to maximize the benefits to your skin.</li>
            <li> actually requested a free sample, the customer service was great!</li>
            <li> SO after reading all the reviews and I must  say: this company would benefit avoiding these free loaders, because so many of these views made me wonder if this product has any value, not to mention all the precious time going through those.</li>
            <li> Great product for my very sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I liked this serum from the very first application -</li>
            <li> Using this together with the Retinol cream is keeping my skin fairly happy and although I&#x27;ve had some breakouts, they heal pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoy the very light scent that it has.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a month it works fine --- hoping for more clearness and youthful look.</li>
            <li> Even if you aren’t looking to get rid of pesky wrinkles or fine lines, this will provide your skin with a better and smoother complexion by shrinking pores and evening out your skin tone to impart a youthful glowing radiance.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s also loaded with other good stuff like hyaluronic acid that are recommended for great skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used 2 other top seller brands of vitamin C and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more serums than I can recall and this one for me has no discernible scent, absorbs more quickly than most, and seems to be competitively priced (not the suggested or list price, but the cost of under twenty dollars).  </li>
            <li> Overall, I feel it is a valid, very good</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of vitamin c products, and this one is just as good as the very high priced ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product since it smells like citric, very fresh, very smooth, very convenient to use since it contains both Vitamin C and Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to purchase this at a special promotion price to try it out.  </li>
            <li> If my skin wasn&#x27;t sensitive to it, it is a great serum</li>
            <li> So far I am extremely happy....</li>
            <li> Because of that, I&#x27;m giving it just two stars, as it probably won&#x27;t be able to fight free radicals.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum in combination with the Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer for about two weeks now, and I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment in a timely manner and so far am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great results so far - 2 weeks in and brighter complexion with smoother skin.</li>
            <li> are becoming my go to brand for serums.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and smells great</li>
            <li> I like the natural ingredience in the instanatural products and have been happy with everything I have received from them.</li>

            <li> And I love knowing that it&#x27;s feeding my skin as is lightly moisturizes.  </li>
            <li> At my age I can&#x27;t expect any formula to work a miracle but it makes my skin feel really smooth and creates a healthy glow...</li>

            <li> I happy with the result thus far.  </li>
            <li> it feels great going on and leaves skin really soft.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but decided it was time to really start taking care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I liked that it absorbed well into the skin and didn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.  </li>

            <li> I really like it, the texture is great, glides on skin easily and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I am quite happy with the results; the nasolabial folds are noticeably lighter and the fine surface lines are nearly unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product, does not cause irritation or redness but does help clear my blemishes and soften fine lines.</li>
            <li> I have used other Vitamin C Serums, but this one works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing.</li>
            <li> This line in general is great.</li>
            <li> After using the Vitamin C Serum, within the first 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed amazing results of my aging spots lightening.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on week 2 of the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum, and so far I am loving it!</li>
            <li> This was my first c serum, but I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve bought to reduce dark spots.</li>
            <li> After about a week of use, my dark circles under my eyes began to look lighter, which was awesome.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see if it will fade my sunspots, but so far I am loving this!</li>
            <li> Firstly, I received this moisturizer as a sample to provide my honest feedback on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard awesome things about using vitamin C on your skin -- to both treat wrinkles and dark spots on your face, but also to help prevent them from even appearing.</li>
            <li> Also , it has a citrus scent which I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about at first</li>
            <li> I was wondering how many true users reviews were posted here.</li>
            <li> My first time ordering this I liked the product so decided to order it again.</li>
            <li> its  ok  not  bad  </li>
            <li> I compared it with the best selling Vitamin C Serum on Amazon, and it won hands down for me.</li>
            <li> I have very fine lines when I smile.  </li>
            <li> The product is very high quality, has a very pleasant odor and so far seems to be helping</li>
            <li> Perfect texture, wonderful, subtle citrus scent, and my skin in general seems more &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; and has a glow, to the point where I rarely wear foundation anymore.</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C Serum that makes my skin feel super soft!  </li>
            <li> The new serum smells so good and glides on my face without being tacky nor sticky.</li>
            <li> While there is a bit of tackiness, it is overall very light and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> the vitamin c serm works ive been useing it for 2 weeks now and see the diffence on my fine lines under my eyes</li>
            <li> Now with about a month&#x27;s use Ive notice fine lines are gradually diminishing.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C helps to boost collagen production which in turn helps diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and even sun or age spots.</li>
            <li> which is fine because we should be moisturizing our face all the time anyway.</li>
            <li> My fine lines around the eyes are almost gone</li>
            <li> My fine lines around the eyes are almost gone</li>
            <li> My fine lines around the eyes are almost gone</li>
            <li> the rest of my face has been fine) and the bumps went away.</li>
            <li> It also helps smoothe out the fine lines.</li>
            <li> – I didn’t notice any difference changing to Instanatural serums except that I now seem to have fine ‘smokers lines’.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed fewer of the fine lines I used to have.</li>
            <li> I focus on the fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> but now I can easily cover it with light foundation or concealer.</li>
            <li> Lessens fine lines.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin dewy and plumped, works wonders on fine lines.</li>
            <li> Yes, I would recommend this to anyone that is concerned with fine lines and would like a smoother texture to their skin.  </li>
            <li> After the first day, I could use it under my eyes and couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my face moist and is visibly reducing the appearance of fine lines around my eyes and elsewhere on my face.</li>
            <li> Consistency is smooth, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many vitamin C serums in the past and have always been very impressed with the power of vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I can see the fine lines diminishing.  </li>
            <li> this is my first because I really like this great product.</li>

            <li> It look brighter and my fine lines have been reduced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many vitamin C serums in the past and have always been very impressed with the power of vitamin C.</li>

            <li> So far so good.</li>

            <li> So far so good....</li>
            <li> so you really need to make sure you put some on top of this serum.</li>
            <li> I think this serum is keeping my skin in good shape (62 years old) but no drastic changes.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed significant results with my complexion and the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, absorbs quickly, is a great first step in combination with my 10% Glycolic Acid Cream (by Reviva) for my 55 year old skin.</li>
            <li> As for my daughter&#x27;s acne, she said for the first time in a very long time, she feels beautiful!</li>
            <li> This is a great product from insta natural as well as all the other great oils they have.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very nice &amp; smooth after using it &amp; I use it daily.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and quality is outstanding.</li>
            <li> company is very good about replacements or refunds--once the product has been tried of course; so I&#x27;m not concerned other than:  </li>
            <li> This made my face really glow!!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very effective in treating acne and occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> Serum looks and smells very fresh.  </li>
            <li> a very useful</li>
            <li> The pink grapefruit oil has a very light and pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I hope Instanatural will keep this original formula (caffeine free) and its affordable price, so</li>
            <li> This product is rich, goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> I first started using the Insta natural eye gel and absolutely loved it, so I decided to try more products.</li>
            <li> It works great - saw my brown spots lighten considerably and my wrinkles less noticeable - plus, it feels very refreshing on my skin!</li>
            <li> Smells good, dries quickly, and seems to be evening out my skin tone so far!</li>
            <li> However, the great ingredients lean me to give this a better than average, four-star rating.</li>
            <li> The dropper makes it easy to apply and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I noticed that after my first use, the oils absorbed nicely into my skin.</li>
            <li> Without a doubt I will recommend this product to anybody who wants soft, even toned, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that tends to \\&quot;shine\\&quot; pretty easily, so I have kind of avoided serums, since I am pretty nervous about using anything with oil in it.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> As with most products it&#x27;s important to use it consistently and as directed...</li>
            <li> Smell is ok, and it goes on smoothly on the skin and gets absorbed rather quickly.</li>
            <li> and he really likes it and his skin is looking pretty good.  </li>
            <li> Their price is very affordable and I think works just as good as a higher priced product.</li>
            <li> C serum by Insta natural full of good ingredients that our skin needs .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily dispensed in an eyedropper and spreads on quickly on your face.  </li>
            <li> It goes on easy, and dissolves quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, great orange smell but not sure if I see any difference in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It glides on and absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> But, this serum goes on easily and drys quickly and does not bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> and this is a new and improved version that I LOVE!</li>
            <li> This serum is great and more concentrated than my previous serum.</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and has a light grapefruit smell - if you don&#x27;t like smells don&#x27;t worry, it quickly fades.  </li>
            <li> The addition of Sea Buckthorn Oil makes it unique.</li>
            <li> I use this product along with derm roller and haven&#x27;t seen significant result yet.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used many more expensive Vit C brands, from Obagi to Ole&#x27; Henriksen: those products have nothing over InstaNatural - there are excellent skin nutrients included</li>
            <li> As of now, I&#x27;ve seen a significant difference in my face.</li>
            <li> Not only has this cleared up all of my blemishes, but I have a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that I am loving!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with my first application:  </li>
            <li> I wait for the serum to get absorbed into my skin (sometimes hours), but my skin always feel sticky!  </li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have used Vitamin C serum before so I am familiar with its use and texture.</li>
            <li> Love this product.it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I am floored with how well this serum has worked so far and am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 3 weeks, have seen a significant improvement on skin texture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The discoloration on my skin has been improving significantly, it is still there</li>
            <li> Excited to have found this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is a keeper and I&#x27;m also very satisfied with the eye gel and retinol moisturizer from insta natural.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure that this one would do anything for me, especially since it was relatively cheap.</li>
            <li> the service was prompt , the price is a bit pricey , but worth it !&lt;</li>
            <li> Within the first couple of days after using it, my face felt smoother, tighter, and more refreshed.</li>
            <li> This has a rich feel to it.</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m sure Vitamin C is good in general if applied consistently.</li>
            <li> The original was too &amp;#34;gel-y&amp;#34; and I didn&#x27;t care for the scent.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and it helps reduce fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Had some areas of discoloration from sun and acne and it has significantly improved those areas.</li>
            <li> It has a rich, silky feel to it,which makes it a pleasure to aply.  </li>
            <li> So when I had a chance to try again in liquid form, I was excited.  </li>
            <li> I would get more when I am done with my first bottle.</li>
            <li> This product has brightened up my face significantly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was love at first use with me.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this</li>
            <li> I really love this serum straight away my skin feels plumper and brighter!</li>
            <li> the service was prompt , the price is a bit pricey , but worth it !&lt;</li>
            <li> The laugh lines around my mouth are softer &amp; my skin seems brighter &amp; clearer too!  </li>
            <li> I have used several Vitamin C serums, and this is the best so far!  </li>
            <li> My skin looks fresh when I wake up!</li>
            <li> First, I love the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> Love the product-great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I have also noticed the blackheads on my face have been reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> I love this brand so much!</li>
            <li> I love the feeling, my face feels very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft and smooth and is becoming more even-toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife, because she wanted to compare it to another similar brand we recently purchased, and it&#x27;s honestly just as good!</li>
            <li> Smells great ,It is the texture of  water, non greasy, goes on nicely and soaks right in, I&#x27;m 52 and can&#x27;t really say whether it will help my wrinkles, I will have to see over a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Great product.. so gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years and this one, by far, is my favorite.</li>
            <li> It is light and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> hoping it would clean up some scaring</li>
            <li> I have used several of Insta Natural products now and have been very happy with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used several of Insta Natural products now and have been very happy with all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used several of Insta Natural products now and have been very happy with all of them.</li>
            <li> Skin feels clean</li>
            <li> I really like that I can smooth out my irritated skin from the day and be able to apply make up on a more&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;smooth canvas&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I wish they&#x27;d settle on a formula or they&#x27;d clean out their inventory and restock from scratch.</li>
            <li> Its smell is lightly citrus, and the serum absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> see a marked difference for the better for better</li>
            <li> Every am, I clean my face and neck.</li>
            <li> The scent is light and the serum absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It is absorbed easily by the skin and does not leave skin feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> It absorbs really quick and can be used with oils because it is so light.</li>
            <li> I find the product works best if used just prior to going to sleep; this helps take advantage of the natural healing ability of my skin during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Clean.  </li>
            <li> My skin is more hydrated, even, and clear, and it just looks better as well.</li>
            <li> like oranges and so clean.</li>
            <li> but I needed to repair my face from the damage of the Caribbean sun, to regain moisture and to clean clogged pores.</li>
            <li> The great ingredients should be helpful with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It has a clean, citrus aroma.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample.</li>
            <li> It is a bright sherbet orange color which comes naturally from an ingredient not artificially colored.  </li>
            <li> I was excited to receive these oils to try, I use the  rosehip seed oil in a rose petal salve and used it on my elbows and they have stayed soft for along time!  </li>
            <li> My laugh lines around my eyes are greatly diminished, and overall skin tone is healthier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels clean, freshening and also makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> I apply it after using the toner on clean skin.</li>
            <li> it makes your face look so nice and smooth and clear</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs very quickly and smells like fresh oranges.</li>
            <li> The liquid is actually orange and has a pleasant citrus note to it.  </li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite vitamin c serums!</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> It smells nice (kind of like oranges, albeit a little chemical-y), absorbs easily, is lightweight and leaves no residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She says that one bottle lasts her a little over two months, which we both consider to be a very good value considering what noticeable results she&#x27;s gotten already.  </li>
            <li> After 3 days, when I was getting ready in the morning, I realized the fine lines through my cheeks had almost disappeared!</li>
            <li> The toner leaked during transit and CS instantly and graciously shipped a replacement bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a Fave company now!!&lt;br /&gt;Great natural ingredients, good pricing with Outstanding communication, what more can we ask for Ladies??!!&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t think I will be asking for a refund since I&#x27;m pretty satisfied, knowing that you can get your money back if unsatisfied is pretty great.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  </li>
            <li> The formula soaks right in, it&#x27;s not sticky and does not have any strong odors.</li>
            <li> On it&#x27;s own or combined with other products, I do find that it leaves my skin looking and feeling plump and also leaves a nice glow on my face.</li>
            <li> These new wave serums are great for improving dry skin and smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, after a couple of weeks you can start to see the effects work their magic.</li>
            <li> (hey, exfoliation right?!).  </li>
            <li> Smells very nice and doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate the skin.  </li>
            <li> It spreads easily and is absorbed fairly quickly .</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum has improved my skin tone and texture,  giving me smooth clean and fresh looking skin.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and went on easily.</li>
            <li> love how Vitamin C is very very high up on the ingredient</li>
            <li> /&gt;Customer service from Insta Natural is like no other first off, they have some of the best I have yet to deal with!</li>
            <li> I put this on after I wash my face at night and in the morning my face feels super soft and healthy!</li>
            <li> Fine to use under makeup or right before bed.</li>
            <li> First, let me be upfront about the fact that the good people at Insta Natural sent me this product to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have never really tried any serums before so I was happy to review this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I had great results with the moisturizer, I expected to see results with this serum.</li>
            <li> It does make my face feel better, as long as I use my own skin conditioner (as recommended by the seller)</li>
            <li> I used my first bottle and can&#x27;t honestly say that I see much improvement in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me start off by saying I am very meticulous in researching a product and it&#x27;s company.</li>

            <li> an energy boost, refreshing and tightening, while giving it much needed nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just put  a full dropper on your fingers and apply to face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with the various InstaNatural products I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I really have enjoyed the process of getting to know about InstaNatural</li>

            <li> To say the least I am very impressed by the products they provide, the effectiveness of the product and the price point is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was kind of orange and from what I have researched is that it is to be clear somewhat.  </li>
            <li> No bad reaction from it.</li>
            <li> I will keep using it since I&#x27;ve had no bad side effects whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another vitamin C product for a while but decided to switch to this brand because of the great reviews and ingredients in this product-it seemed to contain more vitamins and other great, natural ingredients that my current one didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now</li>
            <li> It smells great and it sinks quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Excelent product- easy to use, your face feels refreshed - love all the natural components to it</li>

            <li> This particular brand also contains aloe and vitamin e, and also vitamin c, msm (which is supposed to reduce inflammation, a major cause of aging), witch hazel (great for your skin), and jojoba.</li>
            <li> I used the InstaNatural advanced Vitamin C Serum and saw an improvement in my skin right away.</li>
            <li> The sun spots and other brown spots are lightening and are being replaced with beautiful, new, healthy, glowing skin.</li>
            <li> It has a strong orange fragrance at first but quickly disapates.  </li>
            <li> If you want a quality Vitamin C serum look into OST Original Pure Vitamin C20 Serum, this product actually works in the most amazing ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want to use it every day, then it is great for applying for a healing serum after microdermabrasion or other treatments.</li>
            <li> I had an issue with one of their other products and they rectified the situation and made me happy.</li>

            <li> Absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feels and how fast it was being absorbed by my skin.</li>
            <li> It quickly dries and leaves my skim moisturized.</li>
            <li> My skin looked more vibrant with the use of the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> Using this serum, along with the Insta-Natural Vitamin C Cream, has made my skin look more vibrant &amp; healthy looking, and with long-term use should only get better.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find it to do anything super noticeable on my skin, the smell is not my favourite (citrus)</li>
            <li> I have just started using it on my eyes along with the eye gel and am pleased with the combined effect, my eyes even seem to be more open.</li>
            <li> I received my order quite quickly</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin quickly.  </li>
            <li> I use this serum after cleaning with a clarisonic and I mild exfoliating cleanser with salicylic acid.</li>
            <li> It smells like oranges and absorbs into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly , then  I follow with my bb cream.</li>
            <li> This has been a tremendous boost for my skin.  </li>
            <li> Only fault would be that I would have preferred a pump dispenser, so product would&#x27;ve remained more potent.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin tacky for a minute but absorbs fairly quickly without leaving any residue.  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is a natural way to produce collagen and great natural moisturizer for the skin.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS give HONEST opinions of everything no matter if I received it for free, a discounted price, or regular price.</li>
            <li> Pros - it absorbs quickly, non greasy, no breakouts&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I will say though, don&#x27;t put too much on, or you&#x27;ll be left with some orange colored residue - LOL.  </li>
            <li> The serum goes on quickly and keep my skin moisturized for hours.</li>
            <li> I am over 40 and think this helps tremendously.</li>

            <li> super i like,I bought it through a discount</li>
            <li> This serum makes my skin look smoother, reduces pores tremendously, and increases hydration.  </li>
            <li> I use 3-4 drops and apply mainly on my cheeks where I have the most amount of breakouts.</li>
            <li> The serum absorbs into your skin quickly and leaves it feeling</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and goes on smooth, having only used it a couple of weeks and not every day</li>
            <li> Seems I must use a LOT of product to feel like I&#x27;m getting adequate coverage.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to be fading quickly.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs in the skin quickly but leaves the skin feeling hydrated and looking rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> Thanks to InstaNatural for such a great item that allows me to no longer feel embarrassed by my complexion.</li>

            <li> I used this product because it was provided free for me to test out and give my honest feedback, but I doubt that I would repurchase it simply because I did not notice any difference in the way</li>
            <li> but it absorbs quickly and does not have any sort of sticky/residue feel.</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Vitamin C capsule before, quickly gave up use</li>
            <li> Who&#x27;s a lucky lady?</li>
            <li> It dries fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized</li>
            <li> It leaves a mild matte feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin quickly rather than just filling in the wrinkles and then flaking off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it sticky and it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it</li>
            <li> As I continue to use, I notice my skin becomes smooth, soft and plump, I really love the vitamin c serum.  </li>
            <li> Skin is nice &amp; smooth &amp; it is definitely smoothing out the crows feet.</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling after using it.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve found, short of prescription anti-virals, that I can successfully use against Shingles.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used it steadily for a month, and I am pleased with the application ( and hopefully results)</li>
            <li> I have seen an improvement in my skin and it seems firmer and more vibrant.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t honestly say if I&#x27;ve seen a major difference</li>
            <li> Fantastic packaging and very high quality product!</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve not been able to notice any major skin improvements regarding any fine lines or age spots</li>
            <li> I will update review as I use this product more, I really was not expecting any kind of results right away, but I cannot deny my skin has a clean even tone, not drastic but enough that I can tell and have gotten a couple of comments.</li>
            <li> 1 month and am very pleased to say that I&#x27;ve actually noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> third notable thing about this product I&#x27;ve noticed, and perhaps the most exciting, is that the wrinkles around my eyes seem to be smoothing out.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results of this product after only using it for about 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> One of the times I mixed it with a homemade face mask, and got a great, bright, and firm face from it.</li>
            <li> I normally put a cream on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a shine and smoothness to my face after my very first use.  </li>
            <li> My daughter is impressed with how smooth and silky my 50 year old male face feels, and from a 15 year old that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li> You then leave it absorb naturally into your skin followed by the addition of a suitable moisturiser.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not receive a free bottle or any sort of promotion for this item.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it</li>
            <li> With Great results, Diminishing The Look Dark circles.</li>
            <li> At first I broke out but with continued use my face became smooth.</li>
            <li> This was like watered down orange juice, smelled great</li>
            <li> but with consistent use, her skintone, fine lines, forehead and smile lines are noticeably diminished.  </li>
            <li> I end up using more than the 2-3 drops (more like a dropper full) and let it dry before applying the moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I love all the attributes and pay way less than the serum from my dermatologist and this has more vitamin C %. !</li>
            <li> It absorbs pretty nice, it has a pleasant smell, a little bit of product covers my whole face, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and it works well even under make</li>
            <li> The new, improved formula has a slightly more viscous consistency, which makes it easier to apply to the skin.</li>
            <li> And this is now my new favorite skin serum.</li>
            <li> I have used Timeless Vitamin C serum previously and it was great on my pores and scars.</li>
            <li> also feel great because you sent another bottle since first shipment does not arrive as expected.</li>
            <li> This serum glides on my skin and absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li> So far so good, too soon for more results...an old scar on my cheek is healing and not red and sore looking any more.  </li>
            <li> Absorbed quickly into the skin after face washed.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this serum  and how quickly it gets absorbed</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference for spots and small wrinkles, but has a nice smell and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and many products cause severe dermatitis but not this.</li>
            <li> i am pushing 40 and look very early 30s :)</li>
            <li> I love that this has so many great ingredients that are beneficial to the skin for many different concerns but is a natural product not filled with garbage and fillers.</li>
            <li> I immediately feel my face tighten and smooth and have noticed a significant difference around my eyes in particular.  </li>
            <li> I used it for 3 weeks, 2 drops every night after toner and before facial cream, it&#x27;s very light and absorbed very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone interested improving the look of her skin!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m getting compliments about how healthy and young I look!</li>
            <li> It is also nice &amp; soft, without the &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; patches I have experienced in the past.  </li>
            <li> I cannot attest to what it does long term, but it feels refreshing, goes on light, and gives a light moisturizing feel.</li>
            <li> For the price and quality, you simply cannot find anything better!</li>
            <li> In the first place, it smells like oranges!</li>
            <li> ,exactly I being looking for!</li>
            <li> Once dry top of with your favorite moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks this in and it really diminishes the fine lines and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I really does get rid of fine lines and skin discolorations.</li>
            <li> My skin is so much smoother and with no visible fine lines around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed the fine lines were no longer as noticeable and my skin felt much smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine, but is very watery.  </li>
            <li> it has removed some brown spots and helped on my pores...can&#x27;t say it has done much for fine lines or wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I think it is really helping my fine lines and pores.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great product, I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks and have used other brand name products that are considerably higher in price.</li>
            <li> I use it 2 weeks, I have had little spots and I was waiting for this great serum to test it on the spot.</li>
            <li> Fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable and it does make my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I tried this with my hot/cold infuser machine, this vitamin c serum work really well, I notice the fine lines on my forehead is lighter, also the laugh lines.</li>
            <li> I have most definitely noticed a difference in skin tone and also seen a diminished of fine lines around the mouth and eyes.  </li>
            <li> but the fine lines under my eyes and forehead are also starting to smooth out!</li>
            <li> I am a retired woman with very fair skin who has lived her entire life in beach states that advertise themselves as being sunny all the time, and a woman whose career kept her outside in the sun a majority of her work hours.  </li>
            <li> My skin routine is pretty simple, I either use regular soap, baby wash (cheap, gentle makeup remover), or L&#x27;Oreal &amp;#34;Go 360 Clean, Ideal Clean&amp;#34; to wash and follow up with a bit of moisturizer in my T zone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since switch to another C product that has 22% + 5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum (available on Amazon) and am using their moisturizer product they have as a combo after using Clinique #1 and #2 prep lotions (not moisturizers) that ready the skin to receive serum</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly and and is very concentrated.</li>
            <li> I do need to note that this product was reviewed free for testing purposes, but I can assure you this product is the real deal</li>
            <li> It really works I have noticed a huge difference in my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> It has made such an amazing difference in my complexion.  </li>
            <li> The serum is light yet very moisturizing, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic, real affordabale for those of us on a budget.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this serum are nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> Lastly, their customer service is amazing.</li>
            <li> I really like using the Vitamin C Serum by instanatural because it goes on smooth</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> By far the most reliable product I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love it so far, does pumped up my skin and keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li> The ingredients such as Sea Buckthorn oil, Rose HIp Seed Oil, Ferulic Acid, Carrot Seed Oil, Apricot, Kernel Oil, etc .</li>
            <li> This Company is awesome and stand behind their product 100%.</li>
            <li> After some research on InstaNatural and their Vitamin C Serum, I concluded that it was in the clear, and let me tell you, I am so glad I did that.</li>
            <li> This is not a one time thing, as I noticed that over continued use, my skin has become much more soft than before.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the retinol serum thus far.  </li>
            <li> After I wash my face clean, pat dry and apply a warm towel on my skin for 10 seconds or so</li>
            <li> This serum is definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes my skin feel fresh and soft :)</li>
            <li> A couple of them seem smaller, but honestly, your pores serve a purpose.</li>
            <li> Not for $50 though...them seem smaller, but honestly, your pores serve a purpose.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but at 31 I have a forehead line and a laugh line beginning to show.</li>
            <li> The company has emailed me to check to see how I liked their products and give me proper instructions on how to apply their products.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Perfect for rehydrating skin, leaving it soft and healthy</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re like me and you plan to use the two in combination, you&#x27;ll be ordering the serum more frequently.</li>
            <li> Then put on this serum, and finally some carrot seed, rose hip, jojoba face oil.</li>
            <li> I started to do some personal &amp;#34;research&amp;#34; of my own with products and found&lt;br</li>
            <li> My face looks more even toned and clear.</li>
            <li> and my time were worth this serum.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth checking out.</li>
            <li> When used with the Argan Oil above, it gives your skin a nice glow.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re young, it&#x27;s good to take care of your skin early with Vitamin C serum and Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> which I don&#x27;t like and a lot of vitamin C serums are like; however, it completely absorbed into skin and did NOT leave a tacky/greasy residue, which is a pet peeve of mine.  </li>
            <li> It goes on a bit tacky/sticky but is quickly absorbed into the skin.  </li>
            <li> The serum arrived on time, well-packed and so far I am enjoying using it.  </li>
            <li> and I have to allow time for it to be absorbed (maybe 8 minutes) into my skin before adding moisturizer in the evening.  </li>
            <li> This review was given after receiving a complimentary bottle of the serum for an open and honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> and I do see a noticeably firmer, more clear complexion.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok, sort of like old oranges</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin moisturised,  firmer and a more clear complexion.  </li>
            <li> I like to add an extra drop or two of organic rose hip oil</li>
            <li> It makes skin feel soft and smells not bad!!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and is orange in color, absorbs instantly</li>
            <li> I am really pleased so far</li>
            <li> and so far I love them.</li>
            <li> I have come to love Insta Natural and all of it&#x27;s products.</li>
            <li> received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh orange smell and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin sticky.  </li>
            <li> I love the results so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two weeks now,  and I&#x27;m so satisfied with Instanatural, I placed their Rose Hips and B3 serum in my shopping cart and will be purchasing extra bottles to bring home to my country.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Vit C serum and this one seems to be doing the job quite nicely.</li>
            <li> The addition of the rose hip oil is such a bonus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that protects and repairs your skin.</li>
            <li> Nice absorption and overall hydration</li>
            <li> but I can notice an improvement in my smile lines.</li>
            <li> This is a company worth dealing with.</li>
            <li> For $20, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> but I will say that my skin has never been so soft and smooth!</li>
            <li> Smells nice but left my face feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> Smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I have always had skin issues ranging from sensitivity and Rosaceae to adult acne and many products irritate or cause flare ups</li>
            <li> I love that the InstaNatural products are all natural.</li>
            <li> So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
            <li> useful.amin c serum will be useful.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This is the fifth product I&#x27;ve tried from Insta Natural, and once again, I love everything about it.</li>
            <li> This serum smells fantastic, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Looks and smells like fresh squeezed oranges.</li>
            <li> Gives my skin a nice glow - Will definitely keep using it!</li>
            <li> I can say I like this serum because it contains vitamin C , tea tree oil, AND salicylic acid which WORKS WELL for acne and the powerful anti aging retinol.</li>
            <li> I attribute this to a comprehensive approach of phytoceramides, vitamin c serum, eye serum, vitamin c toner or rose water toner and rosehip seed oil or emu oil, although, I may not use the rosehip seed oil of emu oil daily.</li>
            <li> I squeeze out the dropper in one hand and immediately place the top back on, securely, even before I apply the product.  </li>
            <li> not extremely heavy or harsh, another great product from InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this so far and plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is also naturally occurring and not at all offensive by comparison to the perfumes added to most cosmetics sold.  </li>
            <li> This one smells like fresh oranges.  </li>
            <li> I love natural beauty products that work</li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> A rarely have to use foundation anymore</li>
            <li> Hi I am a 41 year old female and I am always looking for what works great with my skin.</li>
            <li> I have now used it for a couple of weeks, and I noticed that the darker spot of sun damage I had has lightened considerably, and my complexion is more even.  </li>
            <li> So far I really love this serum.  </li>
            <li> I will order more at Amazon.com, since it is affordable and gives as good results as more expensive products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Been using vitamin C for a while, but this s my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve become Leary of many products.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with all the InstaNatural products that I have tried so far and</li>
            <li> I was getting low and just couldn&#x27;t see spending that kind of money on it any longer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try their face moisturizer and Rose Hip oil next.</li>
            <li> I love the face that this is all natural.</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin is with thi.</li>
            <li> Like the toner, it has a fresh citrus scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To get the most out of the product its best to wash and gently dry the skin and then add a small amount to your face, neck and surrounding areas with your hands.</li>
            <li> My skin tone has eened out significantly and even super old acne scars, and one chemical burn on my face have faded significantly.</li>
            <li> I love the citrus-y scent, and the serum absorbs very quickly — sometimes so quickly, in fact, that I have to use a few more drops to make sure my entire face has been treated.</li>
            <li> so I am very excited about this unexpected result.  </li>
            <li> I had nothing to loose, I was very happily surprised to find some great items and they are not all full of chemicals that I cannot pronounce.  </li>
            <li> I do not appreciate becoming a test market for new products without a choice.  </li>
            <li> At my age, expectations weren&#x27;t high, but I think it does make my skin a little more supple--and that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
            <li> tried Vitamin C and in the last 2 weeks I see a significant change in the coloration, I believe it might take couple of more</li>
            <li> In particular, we noticed that it has reduced some of the fine lines and discoloration that she had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other products from this company &amp; absolutely love all of them (from their hair products to face products).  </li>
            <li> First two days everything was fine but next day she had many pimples, so she stoped using it.</li>
            <li> And it soaked into my skin pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Nice fresh citrus scent, fast absorbing and fast fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It absorb in the skin pretty quickly and my skin has lightened just after using it for a week.</li>
            <li> and they sent it pretty quickly</li>
            <li> my skin looks great and the little lines around my eyes are looking better and less there - love this stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought many different items from InstaNaturals and all I can say is between the very attentive customer service to the products themselves - they live up to the raving reviews they receive.</li>
            <li> No other product compares &amp; their prices are really great too compared to similar products out there.  </li>
            <li> GOOD, OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> if you have some brown spots, this is a good serum to have for those or any other kinds of discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> Just remember not to get excited and use too much...</li>
            <li> Brightens skin, can see a difference right away.</li>
            <li> Even without my makeup on it doesn&#x27;t feel right on me and my face also feels itchy.</li>
            <li> , right?  </li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> and I was right.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t break out anymore, and if I do, I notice it right from the start and</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t look right.</li>

            <li> My face positively glows!</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a huge improvement in my sunspots, which is my main area of concern.</li>
            <li> I really feel like it  absorbs b/c the formula is so light, it really feels and smells like a drop of orange juice!  </li>
            <li> The first night I used this under my rose hip seed oil mixed into some moisturizer.</li>
            <li> good way to use this is to add it onto your normal moisturizer or even your sunscreen for some extra skin benefits.</li>
            <li> They sent a nice email explaining how to take care of the bottle and how long you can expect the serum to remain useful before it expires.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s thick and sticky,The fragrance is very nice though, a clean orange smell.</li>
            <li> Customer service was very professional and answered my questions promptly… My package was delivered very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have very very large pores.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly leaving my face soft, smooth and brighter looking.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Since using this product my skin is brighter, wrinkles appear less around my eyes, skin has more clarity and feels much more supple.  </li>
            <li> This is a very high quality product and I will definitely get more when it runs out!  </li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum is full of wonderful ingredients (vitamin c, argan oil, rosehip oil, plan stem cells, and pomegranate, just to name a few).&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on smoothly, smells amazing, has a slight cooling effect, and over the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;m actually seeing results!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So happy I was given this to try for a small fee, will defineatly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use everyday and has helped my skin look tighter and has a nice glow to it!</li>
            <li> I love the entire InstaNatural product line, but this serum is my favorite so far.</li>
            <li> In general, I love this serum.  </li>
            <li> I stumbled across this serum and began using it on freshly cleansed skin as the first step of my skin care routine.</li>
            <li> I love this serum because it&#x27;s natural, cruelty free and has high concentrations of vitamin C to clear my pores and keep my skin smooth and glowing;)</li>
            <li> I end up getting more sun exposure than I should and &amp;#34;beauty sleep&amp;#34; gets interrupted by my precious little baby.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the new formula.  </li>
            <li> I finish up with pure rosehip seed oil and my face feels flipping amaze like all day!</li>
            <li> like this, and will actually purchase this again for the sole fact that it made my skin look bright, clean and have an even complexion(of course under my acne and wrinkles)</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft, absorbs very quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy.</li>
            <li> Not much difference in the smile lines (nice way to say wrinkles)</li>
            <li> I’m battling dry skin every night after I take a shower, so I’m always happy to try something that provides quick and lasting moisture.</li>
            <li> but feels great on skin especially when I follow up with my daily moisturizer as it recommends.</li>
            <li> The formula is completely gentle and super moisturizing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I made sure to wait a few weeks after using this product to write a review, and I&#x27;m glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m big on how things smell (especially on my face) and this smells great and isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I bought this vitamin c serum after really wanting to just try a healthier, more natural formula for my face.  </li>
            <li> Very orange smell, absorbs in skin quickly.</li>
            <li> This product contain so many healthy ingredients which is a major plus for me especially the vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Face is very soft and smooth .</li>
            <li> My face felt very soft and oil free.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen drastic changes yet, but my skin does feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I like it very much , but have to admit that i absolutely LOVED the previous formula, (just Vitamin C 20%)</li>
            <li> Look at me being all smart and responsible with my skin!!  </li>
            <li> I really was blown away the very first time I used this.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s pretty good but only been using it.</li>
            <li> and it is helping very much with the feel of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I like the Vitamin C Serum very much.  </li>
            <li> I Recomend it very much</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  </li>
            <li> very fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> and I very much like them all.</li>
            <li> And the cost of both are very reasonable</li>
            <li> Absorb into skin in about 15 second, my face feels very smooth afterward.  </li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and very VERY oily.</li>
            <li> Very highly recommend!</li>
            <li> while pores warm and open, I applied the serum, and face was super soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could look young, but I am fine with how I look now.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> : It works well on my oily, sensitive skin, and should be fine for others.&lt;br /&gt;~</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier than ever, more stable in terms of not getting too dry or oily than ever before, and even some redness I have dealt with for MANY YEARS has lessened considerably.</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and it has softened the wrinkles and fine lines.  </li>
            <li> Last but not least, I love the price!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other Vitamin C serums, and though they were ok, this one  is really fantastic.  </li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t super strong and it is very light and delicate on your skin once the serum is absorbed.</li>
            <li> but this magic made the dark circles disappear and the fine lines to go away too.</li>
            <li> Now that I am getting older, it&#x27;s really nice to have a product that turns the clock back.</li>
            <li> I am huge believer of natural products.</li>
            <li> My skin appears more youthful and I&#x27;m noticing that some of my fine lines are getting somewhat less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I took the opportunity to asked them for a product to target dark spots; they recommended Rosehip oil (they sent me this huge bottle of it to try out for free!</li>
            <li> Her appearance as a professional is of paramount importance; thus, she has an incentive to accurately review this product.  </li>
            <li> I ve been use it for 2 weeks only at night time and my skin  looks better.</li>
            <li> and I love how much smaller my pores have been getting.</li>
            <li> Can I tell you how many different products I&#x27;ve tried over the years???</li>
            <li> I was using a different c serum by ncn which cost more</li>
            <li> You can feel it tightening your skin but not too much!</li>
            <li> but overall I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I did want to update my first review anyway, which is how I noticed it was removed.</li>
            <li> I use it as a moisturizer as my face produces so much oil!</li>
            <li> Love it only after 3 days!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now, and as of about a week ago I can say I see consistent change.</li>
            <li> Of course when I first used it there were immediate results, but those tend to go away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;first product I have used where I have actually been able to notice a&lt;br /&gt;change.  </li>
            <li> the color and scent are enough to throw me off even if I did get better results.  </li>
            <li> As a 40+ year old woman, this is important to me.</li>
            <li> Yet I don&#x27;t see a great difference in using this in place of the Vitamin C moisturizer or with it (at least not yet).</li>
            <li> I finally jumped the bandwagon of Vitamin C serum users and I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> skin felt smoother after the first three days of using it.</li>
            <li> i use their anti-aging facial moisturizer cream on top.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy now and the lines above my lips are not so visible.</li>
            <li> I put this on first.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels great, it felt softer even after the first use, and the feeling lasts at least two days for me.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for products that would actually work on my face because most don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I am sure I have finally found what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> My face felt smooth and soft</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;Serums contain up to three times as many nutrients as creams and in the highest possible concentration,&amp;#34; says Eric Gooris, director of Clairns Laboratories in Paris.  </li>
            <li> Fruit acids such as vitamin C  help to regulate Melanin production and leave the complexion looking more even.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this serum has higher concentration for my skin but</li>
            <li> my face is so much softer since using this serum!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I use it after my toner and it glides on the skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> I love this serum for multiple reasons.</li>
            <li> My skin really drinks this Serum up!  </li>
            <li> Like straight up yummy yummy citrus!</li>
            <li> I have hope that in the next three months I will notice better results with my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product applied once per day after cleansing with the witch hazel has left the skin smoother and more even looking.  </li>
            <li> I love this entire product line.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this vitamin C serum!</li>
            <li> Do the peel instructions first, then after you&#x27;ve healed from the peel, use this to keep your skin glowing.</li>
            <li> From the first use it made my skin feel like silk.</li>
            <li> if you order this Vitamin C Serum make sure before you open it that you received the correct order.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going on a week of using the products every day and my skin feels hydrated, firmer and overall better looking.</li>
            <li> Well, unfortunately no.  </li>
            <li> I have been using several InstaNatural products, and the love affair continues.  </li>
            <li> I personally use and love InstaNatural Vitamin C Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It only take a couple drops for my face, and a couple more for my neck and décolletage.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> In hot weather I wear it alone, but in dryer times, I pair it with the Instanatural Vit C moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> this is one of this terrific line that I just love.</li>
            <li> I did have some breakout during first two weeks of use</li>
            <li> and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
            <li> if more the subsequent moisturiser ‘balls’.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was unbelievably fast!  </li>
            <li> I see a difference from when I first began applying it.</li>
            <li> so I definitely intend to give it more time.</li>
            <li> Love the result the second morning.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware my skin needed vitamin C till a friend said so.</li>
            <li> First time using it</li>
            <li> It smells great and is thick dose not  burn when you put it on.</li>
            <li> I will probably update my review after I finish my first bottle.</li>
            <li> Be aware it may almost feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; &#x27;</li>
            <li> I would suggest using a regular moisturizer on top of this at night, and some sort of a sunscreen moisturizer during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> - smells funny sort like over ripe/spoilt citrus fruit smell</li>
            <li> a day is that my overall complexion looks brighter and more translucent.</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in it, the company doesn&#x27;t pop up in the ewg&#x27;s skin deep website, but I checked all the ingredients</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product 2 times, the first time it was the end of winter</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the color and the fact that many oils added to it which caused me breakouts and above all of that</li>
            <li> She had tried many anti aging products in the past but most haven&#x27;t done anything.</li>
            <li> I have only been doing this once a day, in the mornings - though it may work better at night.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and my pores are visibly smaller, my skin looks healthy too.</li>
            <li> My skin does feel soft and smooth, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in either lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> love that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance because I can get massive headaches with products that feel they need to add some type of fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love it and currently using it.</li>
            <li> My eyes feel different and look so much better.</li>
            <li> Not only do I love the product</li>
            <li> It makes my face so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Thanks Instanatural!</li>
            <li> I noticed her skin looked pretty too, and it turns out she had been using a vitamin c cream.</li>
            <li> Try it, but exfoliate well first  </li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order more</li>
            <li> I have been using it for two weeks consistently.</li>
            <li> My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use.</li>
            <li> If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did.</li>
            <li> This one did exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> At first use,  you may think that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just the first application.</li>
            <li> so your face stays hydrated longer, which is why you use it in the first place.</li>
            <li> THE 1 OZ GOES SO FAST!</li>
            <li> I really wished this serum had worked!  </li>
            <li> I love the vitamin c serum it plumps my skin up almost instantly, and it stays that way all day.</li>
            <li> The first couple of uses made me think this serum would be too drying, but I stuck with it.  </li>
            <li> It work just as well as  the more expensive kind I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> and you will be pleased with the result soon enough.</li>
            <li> This has helped soooooo much!</li>
            <li> have been using this serum on daily basis for about a month now and my skin seems firmer, more hydrated and healthier-looking.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> serum,,,I love how a tiny bit goes along way and</li>
            <li> It is a bit tacky when it&#x27;s first applied, but if you follow it up with moisturizer, it just adds to the healing qualities of this serum.  </li>
            <li> Smell is light, natural, and uplifting.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it...but am at a loss to what exactly it *might* be helping me with skin-wise.  </li>
            <li> This serum does exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The only thing that would make it better is to be in a pump instead of a dropper.  </li>
            <li> My skin is soft and acne free.</li>
            <li> I started using this about 2 weeks ago and while I can&#x27;t see any dramatic changes just yet, I&#x27;m enjoying the refreshing scent and easy application.  </li>
            <li> plus I also receive compliments on my pretty skin.</li>
            <li> Having purchased several products from this line, I must say this ties the Youth Express Eye Gel as my favorite.  </li>
            <li> my skin felt soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> but I think I actually used more than I needed to so</li>
            <li> The product comes in a dark bottle as vitamin C should not be exposed to light to remain potent.</li>
            <li> It is so light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and my skin immediately feels soft and smooth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It definitely made my skin feel softer and more elastic.</li>
            <li> It also feels a bit tightened but not uncomfortable just noticeable and brightened if that makes sense.  </li>
            <li> I have finished my first bottle of the Vitamin C Serum</li>
            <li> My pores do seem smaller and my skin seems to be more even in color.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to carry an immediate impact but if used consistently you will see result and the results are undeniable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not had that problem with this product, and I was back on here looking to see what more I can find that is made by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have never written a review of any product,  </li>
            <li> I am curious to see if the Rose Oil will works as well as this serum did, I will have to wait until it goes on sale.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle</li>
            <li> , brighter, more even, even some in spots are already starting to fade!</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth and moisturized without feeling oily at all..</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer after using this!</li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this product and will definitely be buying again when I run out! ...</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this skin care line</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier after the first week.</li>
            <li> Did notice sun spots fading within the first month of using it.  </li>
            <li> For the first week, I used it before going to sleep.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of the Vitamin C Serum however, the Retinol Serum and Youth Express Eye Serum</li>
            <li> It works different then a moisturizer more like an oil but not oily.</li>
            <li> I hope in the future days to see much better results.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of this product</li>
            <li> It really has made my face brighten up!  </li>
            <li> I use with a derma roller first at night, then let the serum soak in.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think that this has helped improve the tone and texture of my skin, and I plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I received the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum for free for use and review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 51 and most people think I&#x27;m much younger.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Vitamin C on my face.</li>
            <li> Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first bottle (use it twice a day -</li>
            <li> The product works exactly as the description states.</li>
            <li> Now my nose and chin are clear and smooth</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily along with an appropriate morning/evening moisturizer.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency and the price!  </li>
            <li> I also love that this is a serum and penetrates deep into my skin, I will definitley reorder.</li>
            <li> and I found that my skin was not only hydrating a lot better, but also found myself not needing to hydrate as often.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the company and product, so that will definitely have me coming back for more when I run</li>
            <li> I am in love with the company and product, so that will definitely have me coming back for more when I run</li>
            <li> InstaNaturals was the first to introduce me to Ferulic Acid.</li>
            <li> I love it, does wonders for my skin, I will definitely continue to us it.</li>
            <li> so I could put moisturiser on straight after!</li>
            <li> yet it&#x27;s also light and absorbs completely.  </li>
            <li> This is an absolute favourite!</li>
            <li> It is my first time to try vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> I first dab some under my eyes then on the rest of my face.</li>
            <li> It gave glow to my face, this does not unfortunately...</li>
            <li> .. Real results!</li>
            <li> I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum sold by same company afterwards for even more effect.  </li>
            <li> and I have such a lovely glow all day.</li>
            <li> exactly as it should be] morning and night on my face.</li>
            <li> I will surely buy the next bottle of this serum when I finish my first bottle.</li>
            <li> My skin seemed brighter, toned, firmer and had an overall healthy glow.  </li>
            <li> I battled acne for many years and was left with a lot scaring &amp; blotches.</li>
            <li> If anything, I am getting more red splotches  on my skin.  </li>
            <li> #34;This is exactly what</li>
            <li> Yes, people have noticed that there is something different about my skin,  my smoother, more radiant and perky skin.  </li>
            <li> I am still on my first bottle.  </li>
            <li> that will only reflect even more on their products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thankful for a product like this that first, does not test on animals and second,&lt;br /&gt;has</li>
            <li> -Thanks Melissa for your help!</li>
            <li> first time I used it</li>
            <li> I used this with the Vitamin C facial toner and my skin is so smooth!</li>
            <li> I love this InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum, not only does it have vitamin c</li>
            <li> The packaging is very simple and I love that about it .</li>
            <li> I love this product , definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I really like the ingredients, that is the reason why I thought I will try it!</li>
            <li> At first I was using two drops night and day as advised on the label.</li>
            <li> I got through my first bottle and actually ordered more.</li>
            <li> Vendor was anxious too know how I liked it and offered a free sample of another product.</li>
            <li> the results after two weeks of the product applied twice daily were smoother softer skin, brightening, more even skin tone, and fading of scars/</li>
            <li> I think it works better than another serum I recently tried.</li>
            <li> My complexion does seem smoother, less fine lines, and with more even tone.</li>
            <li> I use it only at night and feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> But, I am willing to give it a chance .</li>
            <li> This product soakes into your skin, it is not oily, it really helps with wrinkles, and smells like an orange cream ice cream bar!</li>
            <li> Second, I love the texture.</li>
            <li> From first use.</li>
            <li> I use this serum first and my Vitamin C oil over it which I feel maximized the result.  </li>
            <li> i recommend  Vitamin C Serum by instanatural for any one wanting a clear and smooth face</li>
            <li> It left me wanting to apply more of it to my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> this is the first serum i ever tried..</li>
            <li> How do you know if you like something if you don&#x27;t have more than enough for a night or two?</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s pretty unavoidable.</li>
            <li> This product really delivers!  </li>
            <li> I was unsure at first but this product really works!</li>
            <li> There are quite a few wonderful ingredients in it, it makes my skin feel and look better, and the price is quite reasonable relative to similar products out there.</li>
            <li> The scent of this very orange and viscous serum was at first like vanilla and fresh orange juice.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> I used it on my clean skin and it makes my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> , That helps skin feel very fresh, anti aging, dark spots, and more.</li>
            <li> So it basically did more harm than help because I now have more dark spots as a result of the new breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I love that this product has a combo of all of the best ingredients so that I do not have to have a million little bottles around or spend ridiculous amounts of time applying them all separately.</li>
            <li> Overall, super product to even complexion and smooth skin.  </li>
            <li> Easy to dispense the few drops you need, rub it in your palms and smooth it on your skin!</li>
            <li> I started out late taking care of my skin, mid-forties, but was lucky, good genes or something.</li>
            <li> Wow !!!!</li>
            <li> The fine print on the bottle label in the ad is not shopper friendly and it was not easy to see that the name changed to Advanced Formula.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin and have used many products so far in my life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered quite a few of them, and I&#x27;m impressed with every single one.</li>
            <li> I have used other vitamin C serums &amp; this one is hands down the best!</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and neck and I would recommend the Vitamin C moisturizer to use after this serum to anyone wants a natural moisturizer that hydrates your face all day and improves your skin texture and radiance while helping diminish fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few drops to cover my whole face, it dries within seconds and have a very pleasant citric smell.</li>
            <li> All if the other oils and extracts are amazing</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s all I need if I want to go light, but I usually follow it with the InstaNatural eye gel, which is also a fantastic light moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I wanted the Original Formula that I ordered and please don&#x27;t make product changes without clearly stating it in your Amazon Ad.</li>
            <li> I also make my own but also like to keep this brand around to use a couple times a week due to the added ingredients&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can not review the effectiveness of this product on its own as I use it with some other products in my skin care</li>
            <li> I’ve even gone a few days without my normal makeup routine because I just feel more confident.</li>
            <li> but it has a faint sweet and natural herbal scent to it that smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> But even if a reviewer did, in this particular case, the products are worth every rave revue</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and did not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is as good, or better, than the expensive serums.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoy drinking it in OJ, I take the gummy vitamin C, and I love applying it to my face at night as it&#x27;s one of the few skin products that makes a noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Loved it have tried more expensive items which didn&#x27;t deliver, this does.</li>
            <li> You have to use vitamin C serum for at least 2 months to see the results, but once you continue to use you will see that your skin is brighter and more has more even tone.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a short time, but I am hoping for good results.</li>
            <li> The sun completely drained my youthful glow and this vitamin C serum along with the instanatural rose hip oil has brought my confidence back.</li>
            <li> Also the skin under my eyes both feels and appears more firm and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions and look forward to seeing more results after 2-4 more weeks.</li>
            <li> Thank you InstaNatural, I have already recommended you to several of my co-workers, and now they are using it, and hopefully they love it as much as I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really like to try InstaNatural Niacinamide 5% Serum as it has better ingredient&#x27;s then the one I currently use.    </li>
            <li> Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t tell how it&#x27;s affecting my dark spots quite yet, but my skin looks beautiful in terms of smoothness and overall radiance.</li>
            <li> This definitely helps smooth fine lines and keeps the skin quite soft.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The serum has a virus smell which is pleasant and didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I found a lot of positive review</li>
            <li> but I decided try  InstaNatural  after I read all the positive comments...  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural also has a very pleasant faint scent that disappears within minutes of application.</li>
            <li> It was really hydrating from the first time of use and continued to be with continue use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product that long, and am buying two more as we speak.  </li>
            <li> If this were available in liquid form (toner/spray bottle, etc) with the same ingredients, I would be more likely (re)purchase this.    </li>
            <li> and I am pretty much set to invest in another bottle when this one finishes.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and my pores are barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum is almost clear and has a sweet smell with a hint of citrus and just the slightest whiff of spice.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait to see its long term results :)</li>
            <li> Wish the bottle was bigger but other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li> i am a first time user of this product, i am the type of girl who doesnt know much about beauty products</li>
            <li> They really are interested in the customer&#x27;s beauty desires.</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast, arrived fast, and leaves my skin glowing!</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will show some greater benefits in the long run.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if this would would work for all skin types, but I do have some good insight.</li>
            <li> It works really good with other Insta Natural</li>
            <li> The results were good enough to continue using the product until the bottle finished and overall it worked very well</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much, I purchased one for my picky sister (who was also blown away by how it left her face and by how inexpensive it was compared to the ones she buys), for my mom, and for a friend who keeps on asking what i&#x27;m doing different.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice any significant changes as far as diminished wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> Good feel to serum and a little goes a long way easily.  </li>
            <li> It has a pleasant orange-y aroma and is fast absorbing when placed on the skin without leaving any greasiness and very little sticky-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have many problems with my skin , just mainly acne- and oddly enough</li>
            <li> I highly recommend their entire product line &amp; love</li>
            <li> I have to say this one may take the cake with awesome smell of fresh oranges, a thick consistency that absorbs quickly and has been slowly but surely tightening up my pores and possibly evening out</li>
            <li> The best part is that it is cheaper than several other similar products that I have tried or researched.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural was kind enough to let me try a couple of their other items so this &amp;#34;product was provided for free for testing&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months.</li>
            <li> I dont use this daily as I have other products to test, so I may need to give it more love</li>
            <li> No negative side effects as  of right now</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum has a nice feel, slightly tingly, as it dries on my skin.</li>
            <li> Make sure you let everything dry.</li>
            <li> It has a nice but slight citrus scent.</li>
            <li> At first the color threw me (very orange) but the results came fast.  </li>
            <li> I am very particular about the stuff I put on my skin</li>
            <li> I have combination skin (running more dry these days)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and seems to be improving my skin tone and even making my pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li> Make sure it&#x27;s fully dry before you put anything else on your face.</li>
            <li> so it tends to get red easily.</li>
            <li> The serum is clear yet creamy and absorbs into the skin and has a citrus scent to it but quickly fades away.</li>
            <li> I have not observed anything extraordinary, but then my sensitive skin has had no adverse reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to tell when your skin has enough because it plumps up and smooths out.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly super food for my skin, I feel like my skin soaks it up eagerly and it replenishes vital nutrients.  </li>
            <li> Dries very quickly, skin feels tighter and not as red and blotchy, citrusy smell grows on you.</li>
            <li> It was easy to add to my daily face cleansing regiment too.</li>
            <li> Dry areas are disappearing, and the color is more even.</li>
            <li> I have combo skin with dry cheeks, and don&#x27;t experience many break outs.  </li>
            <li> I see no dramatic improvement.</li>
            <li> It is good but did not last long.</li>
            <li> It is a somewhat thick serum that has a pleasant citrus scent.</li>
            <li> This certainly is all of those things.  </li>
            <li> My oily combination skin has large pores and I&#x27;ve literally had coworkers asking what I&#x27;ve done to my make up..</li>
            <li> and you can tell its pure.</li>
            <li> it suits certain skin tones.</li>
            <li> I have large pores and this product seems to make them disappear.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy using InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum, it is truly helping my completion, it is making my face so much smoother looking with out leaving a oily residue like most serums I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Was originally going to be for my mom, but apparently this isn&#x27;t sensitive-skin-friendly.</li>
            <li> After a bit more than 1month of use, the dark spots are lightening, my eyes look brighter, my overall complexion looks more youthful.  </li>
            <li> Ascorbyl Phosphate is a relatively new derivative of Vitamin C, it is considered a powerful antioxidant that is gentle on your skin and shouldn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even, age spots seem to be lighter , and my laugh lines seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since it’s so easy to use, I definitely will consider purchasing this when my bottle runs out (which will be a while with how much you get in a bottle)</li>
            <li> This one is my favorite so far, it does not dry my skin out like others.</li>
            <li> I naturally have good black skin</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, once her skin adjusted, a mild tingle at most is all she feels when applying.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li> BTW, the customer service in general is very responsive and personal, and they seem to really care about your experience of their products, encouraging honest feedback.</li>
            <li> But my very sensitive skin never has a problem with this formulation, and my skin feels soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product, and other Instanatural products, as I really feel they are made of pure and fresh ingredients, and they keep my face feeling fresh and clean and well fed.  </li>
            <li> I will update later to advise on my experience and if it is has made a difference in my dryness, fine lines, age spots, and pore size.</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it smooths into my skin, and the slightly citrus smell is yummy!  </li>
            <li> Fine lines disappear instantly.</li>
            <li> Once a day is not enough to keep the fine lines/ wrinkles at bay.</li>
            <li> I still have some fine lines on my forehead and it has only been a week</li>
            <li> I still have some fine lines on my forehead and it has only been a week</li>
            <li> It absorbed easily in to my skin, and left it feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I use 4 drops and smooth it over my entire face - it absorbs very quickly and I only have to wait a minute or so before applying my BB cream.</li>
            <li> It absorbs fine but then leaves my skin oily shortly thereafter.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m older, I&#x27;m just trying to prevent the decay from accelerating!</li>
            <li> This is the first time buying this particular Vit C serum for me.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin bright, tight, and soft.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly so I can put my facial oil right away.</li>
            <li> the serum itself looks a little goopy but it smells and feels amazing as soon as you put it on.</li>
            <li> So far this product does exactly what it says it will do for your skin!</li>
            <li> Then I appy Insta Natural Toning Rose Water with a clean cotton pad using small upward circles again.</li>
            <li> However, since recently falling madly in love with high quality argon oil, I am becoming a little more open minded.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it felt tingly, due to my open pores, right after a warm face wash.</li>
            <li> That is amazing since I have only been using it a short time.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s and have always tried to keep a bottle at home if at all possible.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the seller has answered personal questions through email which was a huge surprise.  </li>
            <li> Instant noticeable difference in my skin tone and really helps to smooth out the wrinkles  </li>
            <li> This product has made an amazing difference in just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After using this serum, my skin appeared much brighter.</li>
            <li> Specifically, my forehead lines softened immediately, and my cheeks are so much smoother and even textured.</li>
            <li> This serum has cleared my face so much since I started using it.</li>
            <li> If you have use something similar to this before you will enjoy this product.</li>
            <li> This product works really well.</li>
            <li> It really has seemed to speed healing of any blemishes.</li>
            <li> It really concerned me.</li>
            <li> This product really works.</li>
            <li> The droplet it comes with doesn&#x27;t fill up much.</li>
            <li> (thanks Mom for getting me started).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff really seems to help combat aging.</li>
            <li> This vitamin nourishes my skin and really moisturizes.</li>
            <li> It works for really oily skin too, which I have.</li>
            <li> Im really liking this serum.  </li>
            <li> My skin is very oily and I think it was just an overload of products on my face.</li>
            <li> : my skin feels and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> Since I don&#x27;t see any real signs of anything, I would have no reason to purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to notice a difference around my eyes, but nothing.</li>
            <li> I really like the glow of my face since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> My skin appears to be much smoother.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it morning and night under a second moisturizer by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see a change in my complexion..  </li>
            <li> I have used this for three nights straight</li>
            <li> I must say I can really tell a difference.</li>
            <li> i think it really helps with wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> So, for me, InstaNatural advanced Vitamin C Serum has multiple uses for my family&#x27;s needs</li>
            <li> and I can really see a difference.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t really noticed a reduction in the size of my pores.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my face at all.</li>
            <li> Results can be seen from 2 to 4 weeks after gently massaging the serum into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HYDRATE</li>
            <li> /&gt;Aging, UV radiation or hormonal changes often show up as brown skin discoloration (sun spots or age spots), an indication that too much melamine pigment is produced by the skin.</li>
            <li> Wants you to use it again.</li>
            <li> That being said, the consistency of this serum is fantastic - a light texture, no silicone, not oily at all (as you may expect given the various oils listed in the ingredients), and it dries almost instantly after application with no tacky or sticky feeling/residue.</li>
            <li> In fact, even without the silicone, I have noticed a very silky finish to my skin after application.</li>
            <li> didnt really see a difference on my skin did not brighten it</li>
            <li> I use it in conjunction with a derma roller for maximum penetration and have seen some real changes in the appearance of my skin.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This serum is light and doesn&#x27;t make me break out; plus, the bottle it big</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much like this at this price point.</li>
            <li> Really rejuvenates your skin.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product works.</li>
            <li> Lips are fully healed from breaking out and pores are shrinking to disappearance, much finer wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> i really see the difference</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve given it a real try for 2 bottles which equals 2 months.</li>
            <li> My face feels very &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and oily with it on</li>
            <li> Tia works really wel.</li>
            <li> I was having a bit of a hyper-pigmentation problem under the corners of my lips and this really helped.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend giving this serum a shot!</li>
            <li> It really if affective.</li>
            <li> I have now used this whole bottle</li>
            <li> It seems to fit the bill of my prior use of this type of product to the highest standards.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any real difference, but in skin, but didn&#x27;t have any issues really, just using for preventive care.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice much change in the appearance in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really can see a difference of my skin tone and clarity.</li>
            <li> So I guess my skin is very toned</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any changes yet</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My skin really does have a glow now.</li>
            <li> Thanks for helping enhance my skin.</li>
            <li> However, my skin seemed much brighter when I used the product.</li>
            <li> This product also contains Vitamin E, which is important to actually rejuvenating the texture of skin and not just the appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> and I really like it</li>
            <li> Too much citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>

            <li> Fast drying, citrus scented, non sticky formula.</li>
            <li> My acne marks are a lot lighter and it really did the job of brightening my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also noticed that I don&#x27;t need as much foundation to cover my discoloration so it must be fading.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really should try it because the price is also quite reasonable.</li>

            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> I really do like</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much a difference.</li>

            <li> Would highly recommend this serum!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re products really work.</li>
            <li> I really like the ingredients</li>
            <li> I did also use a prescribed medicated cream to aid in getting rid of the sunburn but using both products really helped.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this to anybody who&#x27;s thinking about buying it because it absolutely delivers.</li>
            <li> I have been using vitamin C for 6 months now, and my skin is much brighter and has an even tone.</li>
            <li> but I really appreciate the email conversation.</li>
            <li> But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very sticky on the skin</li>
            <li> I noticed my face was much brighter.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed much change in skin discolorations yet,</li>
            <li> so having saying that i didnt notice much changes in my skin with using this product</li>
            <li> but i do enjoy the smoothness and moisterizing that it left of my skin that i do continue to use it</li>
            <li> The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you.</li>
            <li> After years of trying every product out there to maintain youth, I didn&#x27;t have much faith, but thought I would give it a try.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t really work on me</li>
            <li> Very soothing feeling and smells like oranges</li>
            <li> highly recommend this product for your use!</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this product</li>
            <li> serum has a very watery texture but glides on like silk.</li>
            <li> Make sure to store it away from heat and sunlight and that the cap is tightly closed.</li>
            <li> I really like using the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> After removing the lid, I place a drop or two on my index finger and gently massage the product onto my face.</li>
            <li> I am being very patient</li>
            <li> have a problem reviewing this product though, the biggest being that it may take months to see real results and</li>
            <li> and I really appreciated the &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This serum is responsible for his words.</li>
            <li> He is responsible for its price.</li>
            <li> Since nothing else in my lifestyle had really changed, I decided to turn to products.</li>
            <li> I spent some time looking for a serum that contained both vitamin C and hyaluronic acid and this one also contains vitamin E which has many added benefits.  </li>
            <li> but she is really happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see much difference yet.  </li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum works very well along with the Vitamin C moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff works.</li>
            <li> It has a very clean-citrus smell which I like.</li>
            <li> No5hing else has ever really helped it much</li>
            <li> and you get fast results.</li>
            <li> and I have very picky skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product</li>
            <li> product was provided to me for free for testing purposes, and would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have a light case of Melasma on my face from my last two pregnancies and sun over exposure</li>
            <li> I used this serum along with the Vitamin C moisturizer for about a month now, and it worked really well.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a bit heavier , and the color when putting on your face is very orange but fades within minutes.</li>
            <li> and I really like the dropper applicator.</li>
            <li> My skin is really stubborn</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky</li>
            <li> However, while my skin felt better I did not really notice a difference in how it looked.</li>
            <li> I really like using it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and it works really well for age spots.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every evening and really don&#x27;t see any differences .</li>
            <li> that makes my skin feel really good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product was packed very well in bubblewrap.  </li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t need anything else when using Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> The formula is very nourishing to the skin.</li>
            <li> It did absolutely NOTHING for my skin.</li>
            <li> My face feels much brighter and smoother after applying this Vitamin C serum.</li>
            <li> but I think this serum will become a staple in my skin care collection, I like it that much.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly Recommend!  </li>
            <li> In conjuction with this I am using the planet eden intense repair.</li>
            <li> But it really does work.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with the Niacinamide serum and the two work really well together.</li>
            <li> I am very picky about the products I put on or in my body.</li>
            <li> Then I started applying it on alternate days, and hey my skin does look smooth.  </li>
            <li> thanks insta naturals</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil has a very soothing affect as it goes on.</li>
            <li> When something did not work for me, they not only suggested a replacement but gave it to me free of charge.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how much you pay.  </li>
            <li> My face looks bright and fresh after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> My skin is tighter and complexion is much clearer, even my skin tone is improved.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t use lotion very often.</li>
            <li> I use this morning and evening to even out my skin tone and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> It works really well.  </li>
            <li> It also brightens, and gives your skin a real glow.</li>
            <li> I really like vitamin C.</li>
            <li> I really recommend  vitamin C serum .</li>

            <li> highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I like that absorbs fast and notice that helps with skin irritation.</li>
            <li> I really like the vitamin C smell</li>
            <li> but I have used vitamin c serums before this one which start to show results much faster</li>
            <li> Really like this serum.</li>
            <li> Scaring is minimal and my complexion looks 10 times better.</li>
            <li> It does tighten my pores can&#x27;t tell much on my wrinkle I guess after 30</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I have freckles on my face and really hope it can make it fade away......</li>
            <li> The price is fairly reasonable as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Protects skin from free radicals and is essential in collagen production.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are all-natural and contain no phthalates or parabens, which is important to me, especially for the face.  </li>
            <li> I had to contact the seller and received a fast reply.</li>
            <li> Has a very convenient dropper so you don&#x27;t use too much.</li>
            <li> Moreover, is a much cheaper and affordable product.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like the InstaNatural product line.</li>
            <li> This worldwide much nettere thai using Rosehip alone.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my skin smoother, but I don&#x27;t know how much it helps with wrinkles and what not.</li>
            <li> I really like this under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a real difference in the appearance and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I really can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on Saturday the 18 (the very day I received it)</li>
            <li> and this really does is doing the job for me</li>
            <li> my skin has really improved so much in about two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin after using the whole bottle</li>
            <li> and I feel very confortable.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see it yet</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soothing on the skin, gentle scent, soaks in and within an hour</li>
            <li> It is gentle on the face and my skin</li>
            <li> and it did not do as much for my skin as the Instanatural Vit C serum.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much.</li>
            <li> I can say it has really improved the appearance of my post acne scars on my face.</li>
            <li> It really does give you a glow.  </li>
            <li> Fast absorption.  </li>
            <li> Very inexpensive and without chemicals.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see much, if any, difference in my skin since I started using the product.</li>
            <li> I have found InstaNatural to be a manufacturer of products I really like using.  </li>
            <li> I really like this serum and use it every morning under my moisturizer/makeup and every night after washing my face.</li>
            <li> A month after purchase it smells like very spoiled orange juice.  </li>
            <li> The serum has a nice texture that&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Love products by Insta Natural - definitely will continue to purchase these products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only tried this product and their Hyaluronic Acid so far, and love the results to date.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of expensive vitamin c&#x27;s and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> Only time will tell, but so far, I think the product is okay.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell and texture of it, and how fast it sinks into my skin when I pat it in.</li>
            <li> The product has a nice smell to it , but so far it is not what I expected .</li>
            <li> Ive seen how my skin getting soft, nice and no much wrinkles!&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing that I wish it came in a bigger bottle like the Rose Oil 4 oz.</li>
            <li> I was able to replaced a lot of my daily products with the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say InstaNatural worked as well as what I&#x27;m used to, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the dropper, which was kind of drippy, which then wastes product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i love it, received 3 compliments, 2 from strangers and one whom i had not seen in a very long time!!</li>
            <li> You can easily pay close to $100.00 for these ingredients from high end retailers of big name companies.</li>
            <li> -Wrinkles, smile lines and other fine lines - Age spots, sun spots, and discoloration]  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a high quality product!!!!</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a clear liquid with no smell and no stickiness!!!).  </li>
            <li> Only wish they sold it in the gallons as i would dip my whole body in it!!!</li>
            <li> I also have to mention again the insta natural phytoceramides !!!</li>
            <li> No new spots appearing, no darkening of spots already there (some have lightened) and my skin looks pretty smooth for my age.  </li>
            <li> Ordered a 3rd of what I thought to be the original formula only to receive another advanced bottle.</li>
            <li> If it is your first time, it will be a new experience all around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I smells like orange but not for long and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> but once I hit 40 I started having a problem with my skin becoming dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> I love vitamin C but all the other products in this one has really made a difference.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s why I avoided C serums afterward, even though I really like most other</li>
            <li> I realize that the secret to beautiful skin is the nutrients taken internally and good facial care products applied externally.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be happy even if having soft and clear skin are the only two benefits that I experience as a result using this product long term.</li>
            <li> The second time I ordered it, the packaging changed to a dark blue bottle with an orange label... also the product changed from a clear sticky liquid to now this orange delicious smelling liquid that isn&#x27;t sticky anymore .</li>
            <li> The smell is slight and pleasant and you get a lot that will last a while.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the process of ordering more and am considering purchasing their other products too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect to see a major change because I had been using a vitamin C product for many years just a different brand, but this brand and mixture has made my face glow and reduced wrinkle appearance dramatically.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a month but feel that over time I will continue to achieve significant results.</li>
            <li> I had tried the Paula&#x27;s choice vitamin c and didn&#x27;t like it at all (even though I love all her other products).</li>
            <li> It only takes such a small amount of VC and you must use a pressing motion when applying for best results.</li>
            <li> Working better than other vitamin C series I have used.  </li>
            <li> I feel that their other serums (skin brightening &amp; age defying/skin clearing) work much better.</li>
            <li> Funny thing is this c serum worked better than a more expensive c cream i bought that was 4 times the price by a well known skin line.  </li>
            <li> In the past I had tried a facial lotion that had vitamin C in it and found it helped my face look clearer and more healthy but have not used it in over a year.  </li>
            <li> I have used other serums that cost a lot more money and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me.</li>
            <li> It is rich in anti-oxidants that repairs and revives the cells and give the skin a healthier younger appearance.</li>
            <li> I was seeing the normal signs of aging in my40&#x27;s,and I need all the help I can get!</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin tone is more even and hydrated, and it both layers well under other serums or works by itself.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if makes a difference, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Will not be buying again unless Instanatural goes back to the original formula.</li>
            <li> but I have had better results with a Vitamin C Serum not containing any other oils or ingredients.</li>
            <li> but I know with time and using this product daily the effects will be significant.</li>
            <li> This product was way better than expected!</li>
            <li> It does seem to have improved my skin texture more than the other vitamin C serum I was using.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like many other vitamin C serums I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I noticed rosehip oil was an ingredient, which makes me break out, but I was hoping in a blend of many other ingredients that it wouldn&#x27;t happen.</li>
            <li> I discussed it with my dermatologist and she recommends using a Vitamin C serum in tandem with my other skin treatments and medicines and this is the one I love.</li>
            <li> After reading that topical Vitamin C was recommended by &amp;#34;Dr Oz&amp;#34; as highly beneficial for the skin, and after my dermatologist confirmed this to me, I decided to purchase a bottle of Vitamin C serum.  </li>
            <li> This serum is thick enough that is easy to spread on your skin, but light enough that it absorbs quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as two other brands I have used-they were able to fade a dark patch on cheek this one has not-it&#x27;s coming back since using this oroduct</li>
            <li> I had dark skin on my forehead on both the sides and so many creams applied nothing really working</li>
            <li> /&gt;Hyaluronic acid, one of the many active ingredients in this serum, has been shown to tighten skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use it on my clean face daily, at night.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is light, but not too light, and the fragrance is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The first bottle I bought at the end of September ran out at the end of the first week of February (about 4.5 months, using it every other day), not a bad ratio.</li>
            <li> It spreads on very nicely and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It dries fast, and leaves your skin feeling tight; however, once I put the Insta Natural Rose Hip Seed Oil on over it, my skin glows.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to any one who wants a high quality product with visible results  </li>
            <li> The small fine lines at the corners are less noticeable and appear more smooth.  </li>
            <li> I had high expectations in view of the reviews because my skin is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very gentle serum that can be used on sensitive skin and it has kept my acne away too.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and it seems to be a consistent, solid product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to let this serum completely dry on your skin before applying anything else as that allows the product to really penetrate your skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference on my chest first with the sun spots and freckles becoming less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone is more even, my skin is much smoother, and I&#x27;ve had less breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have used a good number of serums, and a couple of vitamin C serums, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen a Vitamin C serum that wasn&#x27;t clear with a slight yellow tint.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is amazing.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty clear to begin with.</li>
            <li> I have used several of Insta Natural products now and have been very happy with all of them.ve not gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> But this vitamin c serum is not only more cost effective than many other products she&#x27;s tried in the past, but it actually works for a change.</li>
            <li> When you first apply this serum to your face it feels a bit sticky, but that is due to Hyaluronic acid and the feeling disappears within seconds leaving your face smooth.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results and have nothing negative to report.</li>
            <li> this  serum smells delicious,.... and on and on never really being specific about the concrete actual personal changes in their skin.</li>
            <li> Either way, I&#x27;m not sure how effective vitamins are sitting on the skin as opposed to ingesting them and circulating through your system.</li>
            <li> My eyes are still puffy but it&#x27;s more toned than baggy and my dark acne scars from like</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning(would be better before bed, however I am currently only washing my face once a day) and notice some light redness, uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty early to tell if this product has made a difference, that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s mostly all gone), gotten rid of any infections and lightened dark spots on my face.</li>
            <li> First time using this product but liking it so far.  </li>
            <li> so my sleep levels were much lower than normal and my stress levels were way up</li>
            <li> I usually mix my own face oils which i use along with some hyaluronic acid.  </li>
            <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for.</li>
            <li> Since I just recently found InstaNatural, I have come full circle.</li>
            <li> This one is not bad as I&#x27;ve only used it for a week.  </li>
            <li> overall complexion is not bad.  </li>
            <li> Using a hot wet clean washcloth</li>
            <li> Since I have started using Insta-natural faithfully, the fine lines on my forehead, which I have had since I was in my early 20&#x27;s, are not so deep.</li>
            <li> and it is cheaper than many other ones!</li>
            <li> Later that day beautiful skin, less wrinkles, deep lines are fainter, and my face held moisture longer.</li>
            <li> I wish the bottle were a little larger, but it&#x27;s definitely a good product.</li>
            <li> I can never ever live without it anymore!</li>
            <li> The consistency of the product is a little more watery than I particularly care for, but it&#x27;s easy to overlook that as long as the product works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time, but I think it&#x27;s pretty solid and a nice price point.  </li>
            <li> Also if during the day I was exposed to humid outdoor air or warmth due to my own activity, my skin would not breathe and perspiration caused the return of the sticky feeling as if the Vit. C. serum had just been applied,  tI requires more product usage because of its thick consistency.  </li>
            <li> It has really helped even out my skin tone and get rid of acne scars and is helping prevent new acne along with the witch hazel.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency and slight citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I used a couple of drops of the VC serum before applying lotion and my skin is less irritated and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> It is also less acne prone, which I love.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and it works as expected.</li>
            <li> but most serums have that slightly sticky feel.</li>
            <li> Not any better than products I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> Collagen will increase your skins elasticity making it tighter, firmer and more plump - which means less of that sagging feeling.</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better and my age spots are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Wrinkles less prominent.  </li>
            <li> My skin tone is more even and less blotchy.</li>
            <li> I love what this does for my skin, and I don&#x27;t wear half the makeup I used to.</li>
            <li> I was using about 8 drops per application, but noticed I was going through it quickly and now only use 4 drops.  </li>
            <li> already ordering my second bottle, my skin is so much more balanced now with daily use of this serum.  </li>
            <li> Most times, I use along with organic coconut oil and its also a great base coat to wear underneath makeup.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and instantly hydrates skin.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any particular improvement in my skin&#x27;s discoloration or texture, but this may require extended use.</li>
            <li> Have only used this product for several weeks but am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum comes in a 1 Fl oz , blue bottle and is applied after you cleanse your face with a dropper.</li>

            <li> Insta Natural Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum comes in a 1 Fl oz , blue bottle and is applied after you cleanse your face with a dropper.</li>
            <li> This particular product did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for the drak spots removal.  </li>
            <li> Also, this product works particularly well after dermarolling and using a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> am using the Vit C serum in the mornings after a quick wash, following with Instanatural&#x27;s Vit C moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I am struggling with rosacea on my cheeks and chin.</li>
            <li> After which, I looked on amazon and read several reviews on more than one such product before using this one.  </li>
            <li> I have had one particularly troublesome spot on my forehead for about 10 or so years now that has all but disappeared since I began using this vitamin CC serum.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised to see that this serum is a bit on the thick side and is a bright orange color.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly like it .I</li>
            <li> Will keep using as it does a decent job.  </li>
            <li> After I became eligible for Medicare, I noticed for the first time that nasolabial folds and some slight, fine wrinkles and lines were beginning to appear on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t heavy when applied (though it depends on how much you massage into the skin).</li>
            <li> For sure i will became addicted!:)</li>
            <li> This is literally the first time I&#x27;ve seen one that is milky in consistency, the color of yellow (Yes, I&#x27;m aware that they said the color could change depending on weather/season/blahblah.</li>
            <li> I can instantly feel my skin tightening as it absorbs in, which is rather quickly.</li>
            <li> in the PM I do the same, minus the make up Loving it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  </li>
            <li> I love natural products, what we put on our skin we have to be careful with , out skin is our biggest organ.</li>
            <li> The Sea Buckthorn and Algae extracts are the key factors that make this serum extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s my main concern</li>
            <li> My older skin is softer and clearer.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog</li>
            <li> I do not think it has done a lot for the wrinkles, but the skintone and healthy glow definitely make me look younger.</li>
            <li> I am fair and a few age spots were starting to appear.</li>
            <li> OK the only thing I could add is a pump bottle so that the product does not get oxidized every time you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li> OK the only thing I could add is a pump bottle so that the product does not get oxidized every time you open the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin (as in VERY), and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin in the slightest.</li>
            <li> But gets very dry and I am getting a lot of fine lines and crows feet.</li>
            <li> So far I have not seen any positive results</li>
            <li> I have a few fine lines and dark spots that looked much better after the first week of use.  </li>
            <li> I hope the long term effects are as positive as the first 3 days have been!</li>
            <li> i-herb shipping is $8 for a large order, so if getting supplements anyway,  other products basically have free shipping – so will investigate what products are on offer.</li>
            <li> Face is very soft!</li>
            <li> It was the very first product I used in their facial care line.</li>
            <li> As for the efficacy of the actual product, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a fair assessment.</li>
            <li> I cannot post any claims that this product helps to diminish fine lines or wrinkles because I have not used it long enough, but it has many other positive qualities.</li>

            <li> My skin feels very smooth and firm after using this underneath moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this serum and love the citrus smell too bad it goes quickly</li>
            <li> I also like that unlike some other serums, this one doesn&#x27;t make my skin more sensitive to the sun, so I don&#x27;t need to layer sunscreen over it.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t the most sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any other product.</li>
            <li> , it has a light fresh citrus-like scent, a quick drying thin serum texture, and works well under makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 yrs old with brown patchy skin with some large pores and acne scars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little magic potion for approx.</li>
            <li> Would prefer something with a little more emollient.  </li>
            <li> A little pricy as I am so in love with it and use it every day on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love putting it on in the morning, the citrus smell and the little jolt of moisture and energy</li>
            <li> I just wish it did a little more with the wrinkles/dark circles under my eye, but that may not be it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> With all the abuse my skin takes on a daily basis, it really appreciated this serum!!  </li>
            <li> Love the fruity scent, and the little cream texture.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work fine for me for a first few days</li>
            <li> and it really helps my super dry skin stay hydrated.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and does not leave a sticky feeling like some other products I used to use.  </li>
            <li> Due to my age, moisturizer was the only product available for the first 25 years or so of my life, and sunscreen with SPF only became available when I was close to 30.  </li>
            <li> Although topical are not going to achieve the same results as fillers and surgery, I have noticed that the fine lines look much softer.</li>
            <li> A few drops with other serums is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> The serum has a very faint smell, perhaps from the Rosehip Oil, which is very pleasant.</li>

            <li> The serum has a very faint smell, perhaps from the Rosehip Oil, which is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t return it as its older than a month but its a new bottle</li>
            <li> However, I really do like it so far.</li>
            <li> Really makes my face glow and has helped face some old acne scars.</li>
            <li> All natural products that really work as they claim.</li>
            <li> So far VERY staisfied with this product..</li>
            <li> So far I really like this serum.  </li>
            <li> I was fine the first two weeks I was using the product [Used product once a day as part of my PM routine], but I noticed that once I applied the product later on that the dry areas of my face would burn.</li>
            <li> It is too soon to tell if it is of any real benefit to my 80-year old face</li>
            <li> So far really like this product.  </li>
            <li> My wife ordered this serum and it has been working very well on her face and skin so far.</li>
            <li> My scars are fading, pores are nearly history, my skin is much brighter and healthier.</li>
            <li> Needless to say i am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> The serum isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t sting my skin, it&#x27;s early yet, but I&#x27;m very optimistic about it.</li>
            <li> and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work really well, so far.</li>
            <li> Soft lines have disappeared and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I arranged for this product to be tried by a professional model, who is very well-acquainated with these types of products.  </li>
            <li> ​I really like this product, and I&#x27;m surprised</li>
            <li> Is this normal?</li>
            <li> Overall, the product has proved it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> and she has a pretty moderate to severe case that has been very stubborn.&lt;br</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Gets absorbed instantly into your skin without any greasiness</li>
            <li> and I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a different in the fading of dark spots or discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a short while and so far I am satisfied with using it with the hyarluronic acid and my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My face became itchy, splotchy, and now I have breakouts in places I don&#x27;t normally break out.</li>
            <li> I bought this Vitamin C serum a couple weeks ago as a boost to my normal skincare regimen.</li>
            <li> Since I do not like products that are heavy or oily, I really love that it is neither.  </li>
            <li> I use it under foundation and my make up actually stayed fresh longer  </li>
            <li> I will be able to tell you if it works in a few months.</li>
            <li> I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin.</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum would definitely be a product worth reordering when I finish my bottle.</li>
            <li> I was a tad sceptical about the numerous reviews of those that had been given complimentary products but after a week of using this serum I am seeing a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most facial products make my face turn red.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to let it soak on your skin for a few minutes before applying your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smoother, feels more firm.  </li>
            <li> Love it and will continue to use everyday.</li>
            <li> Skin seems to be more firm.</li>
            <li> I have been using it everyday and feel confident that i am not putting chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li> No negative effects.</li>
            <li> BUT I WILL KNOW MORE IN A FEW WEEKS.</li>
            <li> I recently changed my entire skin care product collection to a more natural, organic-based alternative.</li>
            <li> I also use and love GREEN CREAM retinal cream that can also be bought here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally give reviews.</li>
            <li> Only what my skin needs and what the product needs to keep it stable and fresh.</li>
            <li> It definitely works the magic that only these serums can do, and my skin is clear, moisturized, and radiant.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin is tighter and more firm.</li>
            <li> , I normally go out with sunscreen</li>
            <li> Most days I mix it with a few drops of emu oil and skip moisturizer, just depends on my skin and the weather.</li>
            <li> and I can also report no negative effects.</li>
            <li> My skin feels refreshed,  and hydrated and not dull.  </li>
            <li> My pores appear so much smaller and my skin looks fresh and new.  </li>
            <li> The only thing i was concerned about is that the plastic seal onand around the cap was easily screwed off when i turned the cap to open it.</li>
            <li> The labels are easy to read and overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However,  I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this company,  they gave me a full refund, with no trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using the eye gel.</li>
            <li> Every night and morning, I apply this serum to the left hand and none on the right.</li>
            <li> Third, it is helping to fade my sunspots right underneath my eye.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this natural anti-oxidant for your skin&#x27;s sake!</li>
            <li> ~The former version was a clear, freely adsorbing thinner liquid which was light on skin, relatively little aroma, and soaked into the skin immediately leaving no sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> The ingredient list is fantastic - all powerful antioxidants and nourishing oils, and I really appreciate the absence of fragrance, as well as other chemicals, typically found in skincare.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> for those of you who are in doubt, trust me you wont be sorry it does all it say&#x27;s and more and in record time...into my 5th day and yay!!</li>
            <li> a lot more clear and tight - vitamin c is the way to go.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product also for people who have dry skin, it makes you skin a lot less dry and more healthy.</li>
            <li> To my horror, I recently notice that I had fine &amp;#34;ruffles&amp;#34; on my cheek bones on the left side of my face.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to give it another star, but so far I am pleased.</li>
            <li> I also enjoy the sharp scent of orange that I get when I apply it.  </li>
            <li> and that is gone, and that is huge to me, because for the life of me I would have to do multiple treatments to make that go away for like 24 hours, and last but not least the lines and a bit of puffines that I began to notice rt after my42nd BD, are gone.</li>
            <li> and that is gone, and that is huge to me, because for the life of me I would have to do multiple treatments to make that go away for like 24 hours, and last but not least the lines and a bit of puffines that I began to notice rt after my42nd BD, are gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;InstaNatural&#x27;s serum includes good choices for preservatives that are not known to be irritating and comes in a dark bottle to minimize light exposure on the vitamin ingredients.</li>
            <li> My skin has a new glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a drugstore product for over a year, but decided to try something new.  </li>
            <li> I have anything new to report as I continue using this product, I&#x27;ll update this review</li>
            <li> so the Vitamin C should be new and stable as if it just came from the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am almost done with this serum and its time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> This product is new to me, but i may say it does wonders.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I&#x27;ve been looking for a new serum to wear under my moisturizer in the evening.</li>
            <li> While looking for a new serum, I stumbled across this.</li>
            <li> Am relatively new to its usage....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a product junkie, always like to try new moisturizers, cleaners and serums but this one just didn&#x27;t sit well.  </li>
            <li> I am new to Vitamin C Serum as a face treatment.  </li>
            <li> But for the past week I have not seen a blemish, and my skin is very smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> I have started applying a vitamin c moisturizer on my face, very light and small amount, after I use the serum.  </li>
            <li> I had a break out last month due to stress and I have been using all kinds of vitamin C serums to try to deal with the scars left on my skin and so far I have to see I do see a good result.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I started law school my eye bags have been so dark it looks like I got hit in the face and the increased stress has caused some fine lines to appear on my face.</li>
            <li> My skin is losing that vibrant look, its not as smooth and its not just a slight difference, it&#x27;s quite noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Made my skin soft and vibrant.</li>
            <li> My pores are clear and I&#x27;ve noticed a more even tone where it was previously uneven.  </li>
            <li> I only recommend products/services I use personally &amp; believe my readers will enjoy and/or benefit from.</li>
            <li> skin is clear, vibrant, and acne doesnt appear like it has been.</li>
            <li> I bought it mainly to hopefully diminish the old crone lines around my mouth, and it will take longer for that, I think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a slight citrus scent to it but nothing too strong.</li>
            <li> Oh yes...nothing like the real stuff, it really works on your skin like magic, a little goes a long way, will buy it again,</li>
            <li> This product is a little sticky at first but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> No better feeling then knowing what goes onto your skin is rich and effective with out harsh chemical</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasant, not strong like some other reviewers shared.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells very clear and comfort, I will recommend my friends to use it.</li>
            <li> and my skin is usually very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Smells like orange juice but skin feels very soft in morning.</li>
            <li> my face was very soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin...</li>

            <li> It does leave your skin very soft and moisturized without an oily feeling.</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> In the morning my skin a very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I use it at night with a night moisturizer and my skin feels very soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> My face is very sensitive to a lot product</li>
            <li> As a note I have very sensitive skin which is probably why I felt the burning.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very soft and supple.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Have only been using this item a little under three weeks , so far it goes on smooth and drys quickly with no oder.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> If i notice a difference in my skin, i will definitely buy it again, but right now it&#x27;s a bit too early to tell.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft after applying it and my fine lines seem less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not using a lot and am following the instructions exactly.</li>
            <li> It is so refreshing to finally find a Vitamin C serum which is a pleasure to use and smell and does not sting like some of the other brands.</li>
            <li> I have fell in love with Instanaturals oils, but I doubt I will buy their vitamin C serum due to the above.  </li>
            <li> I can say that this makes my face so very,very soft!  </li>
            <li> I actually feel as if my skin looks pretty.</li>
            <li> I am almost through first bottle, and have ordered 2nd.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure other people have, but personally speaking i did not.</li>
            <li> Skin feels better and difference in pores after a few days of use!  </li>
            <li> So Far!</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old and refuse to look it!</li>
            <li> (some people may not love the smell, but I enjoy it!).</li>
            <li> I have tried several different Vitamin C, HC with botanicals, anti-aging, anti-hypermigmentation products, and this is my favorite, daily go to serum.  </li>
            <li> So far the skin clearing serum has been working out!</li>
            <li> Of course, regular application over a period of many weeks or months is necessary to see the promised benefits--it is not an instant cure for damaged skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if I could only choose one product I would choose this one because it contains both the hyalournic acid and vitamin c (in higher concentration).</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> plan on buying every product instaNatural offers!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin soft and moist!</li>
            <li> from first use my skin started improving .. smoother texture blowy smaller pores</li>
            <li> Not to mention my face feels incredibly soft!</li>
            <li> The serum has a slightly sticky consistency and it does smell of oranges, I purchased it to help decrease the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> There was actually a difference after the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Immediately my skin looks brighter and feels more moisturized, no more flaking.</li>
            <li> ;)  I am on my second bottles of both serums.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the first that I bought and will use this next.  </li>
            <li> recently had a burn mark on my hand from spilling a hot beverage.</li>
            <li> , I looked at a picture that was taken the first week of March, and my face was red all over.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get breakouts very often, but I do tend to get a few around &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34;, and applying this serum seemed to have helped significantly.</li>
            <li> I think as time goes on I may just be able to fade this melasma without harsh ingredients!</li>
            <li> OMG - I bought this product awhile back when it first came out</li>
            <li> First picture was taken third day after using.</li>
            <li> I use a few of the Instanatural products and I love all of them and just absolutely cannot say enough of the quality of their products and ingredients.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this and am disappointed in myself for not buying the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> no glow as I usually experience with better brands.</li>
            <li> That means it&#x27;s definitely natural!  </li>
            <li> My first bottle was problematic in that the cap wouldn&#x27;t screw on properly.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and the company behind it.</li>
            <li> The company is extremely customer friendly.</li>
            <li> It came in a pretty blue glass bottle with an orange-reddish label.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> and I have noticed the fine lines on my forehead are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Skin felt moisture and soft in the morning after one-night use!</li>
            <li> no harsh ingredients!</li>
            <li> When someone finds out my age they are surprised!</li>
            <li> This product is non-irritating and I have sensitive skin!  </li>
            <li> The first batch was yellow.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m too young for this!  </li>
            <li> I am into skin, in the beauty industry and have spent a considerable amount of time and money on sooo many products during the course of countless years.</li>
            <li> This one has some added ingredients that I was not getting before, and the combination works well for my skin type (older, formerly oily but now on the normal to dry side, tendency to larger pores) and I believe some of my darker spots (no, they are NOT age spots) are fading more.</li>
            <li> far as price goes, this is a steal!</li>
            <li> I live in New Zealand, and Instanatural doesn’t send directly to NZ –</li>
            <li> I find the product easy to apply because it has a little dropper in the lid.</li>
            <li> I find the product easy to apply because it has a little dropper in the lid I used the dropper and dropped some on my hand and used my fingers to massage it on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;1.) I&#x27;ve spent time researching what active, beneficial and effective ingredients are recommended by experts (like Paula Begoun, who cites her sources) and this serum is a winner.  </li>
            <li> Critically important in keeping down the effects of the occurrence on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I changed a few products around the same time, so it&#x27;s hard to say what makes the biggest difference, but as a skin care professional I can confirm that the product is enhancing my appearance, and at a GREAT price point!</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way which is a nice feature for the price point.</li>
            <li> I am 58yrs old and live in the desert southwest which is tuff on skin</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I have to bear that in mind whenever trying a new product.</li>
            <li> I have used other serums from other companies and for the price this stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It works, but I also use a cleanser and moisturizer and I typically wear the serum doing the day because it is so light weight and does not make my face shiny or oily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and one half squeeze is all you need so the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> It does not matter what type of skin you have (dry, oily, or combo) as this products is &amp;#34;one size fits all.&amp;#34; There was a noticeable difference in the diminishing of fine lines especially around my mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> The serum is silky and light and dries in less than a minute.</li>
            <li> So I am just using on top of a couple of dark spots but cannot use it in my entire face.</li>
            <li> it just turns back time and my skin is much more even and a lot of dark spots have said ....</li>
            <li> Dark spots under my eyes are also slowly fading away and my skintone has GREATLY improved.  </li>
            <li> It dries quick, sinks into the</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest use a moisturizer when the serum has dried.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin and nearly everything makes me break out</li>
            <li> as you aged, if you don&#x27;t look older, that already means you have been working hard to look good, and young.  </li>
            <li> but I think my fine lines have been reduced around my eyes and my skin looks a little brighter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a couple of weeks now but can already see positive results in my skins appearance.</li>
            <li> I love her products but they are very expensive and a big to do honestly.  </li>
            <li> Having tried many anti aging products, and some were very expensive, I found this Vitamin C Serum better than anything I&#x27;ve used so far.  </li>
            <li> It is nice on the skin and doesn&#x27;t bother me with strong smells (i can&#x27;t have smells because I get bad Migraines).  </li>
            <li> Instead of buying the outrageously expensive serums from the mainstream cosmetic companies, this is an excellent alternative for much less money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> no more no less I think it may take more time and another bottle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not very consistent with using most products on my face because I usually just feel like I&#x27;m slathering something on that is not doing anything except clogging my pores which leads to a break out in a few days.</li>
            <li> Just like the other serums I’ve tried, it was easy to apply and dried fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that I have seen any significant results relative to fine lines or pore size, but only time will tell.</li>
            <li> The formula improves the appearance of the skin by increasing hydration, reducing the effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> Packed full of active ingredients for healing, improving skin elasticity, reducing inflammation, and fighting signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I emailed them with a few questions and the response was quick and helpful!</li>
            <li> Also - and this is a major plus for a city girl like me whose makeup can get wiley in the summer months - it really does lay smoothly underneath makeup and it doesn&#x27;t make it run or wear off like other serums and facial products</li>
            <li> My skin certainly looks younger.  </li>
            <li> I use pure argon oil after applying this following all showers I take.</li>
            <li> Future leading me to believe it was ca certain ingredient in the serum to cause the reaction.</li>
            <li> and I will continue to purchase them because some of these products are my Holy Grail items, however I most likely will not repurchase this because they make other items that are much better for hydrating my very dry skin and diminishing dark marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Feels sort of thick right out of the bottle, but absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> To me, it seems to work better when skin pores open just a little bit to absorb the serum.</li>
            <li> My bought me a tube of vitamin C cream from the dermatologist for 89 dollars (with a discount no less!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a chance to try out a lot of vitamin c serums for a particular skin condition I have and InstaNatural&#x27;s was the first that had such a vast mix of ingredients that all worked together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a little over a week, but so far I love it.</li>
            <li> Make sure you spend as little time as possible with the top off as vitamin C loses it&#x27;s strength when not preserved.  </li>
            <li> I love the high percentage of vitamin C as well as the other active ingredients.  </li>
            <li> All were clear or clear/cloudy in color--</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and clear.</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the refund...VERY unexpected as I didn&#x27;t ask for it - THANK YOU for standing by your products - all of our genetics is just made up different and it happened to not work for me ;0)  </li>
            <li> It dries clear.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if it has really improved skin or helped lines and wrinkles, but if I see improvement will definitely re-order from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I like the expiry data printed clearly on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> This serum and the skin-clearing serum are the only two that I really like for my skin type out off all the products from this line I have tried so far</li>
            <li> My complexion is brighter, even and clear.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum should be clear and not yellowish.</li>
            <li> my niece loves it and it has helped to clear her acne</li>
            <li> However, I was hoping it would help clear up some some damage and scarring.  </li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s really helping &amp; will only use these products on my skin!  </li>
            <li> Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum  uses the natural power of Ferulic Acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E to keep the skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum [which is clear and unscented-</li>
            <li> ~I will not order again and look for a clear, thinner product .   </li>
            <li> I have had so many compliments lately on how young I look.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-30s and have combination/dry skin that is extremely sensitive.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any thing drastic so far.</li>
            <li> After using product now for three months I can say that discolorations in my skin have improved, the skin tightening continues and I am completely hooked.</li>
            <li> Being all natural, whats not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my skin drinks it up and feels really soft and moisturized after.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft..</li>
            <li> The serum is an orange color, and smells citrus-y, which should not be unexpected.</li>
            <li> My skin feels luxurious, soft, supple.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use until product is completely used to allow time to see if it will make a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> So far, this product did not irritate my skin and did not cause blemishes.</li>
            <li> It is quite soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really attest to its anti aging properties, but it definitely hydrates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an old pimple bump (or</li>
            <li> Today for the first time in a long time (I&#x27;m 39)</li>
            <li> I have to say that my mature sensitive skin is responding well to this</li>
            <li> My face feels cleaner with out stripping away my natural oils in my face.</li>
            <li> Immediately followed with this Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum and just one squirt of Insta Natural Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> I have bags which I know that can only really be taken care of by surgery , bags run in the family , so</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> 63 year old skin</li>
            <li> for a sensitive skin be cautious while using this product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my face breaking out, and I have sensitive skin in that regard.</li>
            <li> But, I do at least feel like using the serum is better than doing nothing, since my skin does not seem to be having</li>
            <li> I have purchased vitamin C serum that cost nearly $100 from my aesthetician and this stuff works just as well.</li>
            <li> I use this every day and my skin feels so soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> sensitive skin and sun screen seems to make my skin flake off  </li>
            <li> and i just started taking care of my face by using serums, using moisterizers the whole ruitine i am currently using this one in the mornings and my face is just glowing</li>
            <li> (tocopheryl acetate),pomegranate, organic carrot seed oil,apricot kernel oil,organic gotu kota,wildcrafted horsetail,wildcrafted dandelion, wilcrafted wild geranium, phenoxyethanaol,ethyl hexyl gylcerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, I get this to try on the brown aging/sunspot on the &amp;#34;drivers side&amp;#34; of my face that developed on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> I do recommend for those who like natural products as well.  </li>

            <li> Both serum seem to have regulated my otherwise sensitive skin..</li>
            <li> It stripped my face of its natural barrier in the process.</li>
            <li> and I am considering repurchasing, though I&#x27;m not totally sold on it because I can&#x27;t really say it did anything.  </li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times so far.</li>

            <li> Plus I am using it on an age spot and it has faded considerably.  </li>
            <li> We recently went on vacation and took a whole lot of photos.  </li>
            <li> All the ingredients are all natural.</li>
            <li> a professional blogger that was asked to review this product.</li>
            <li> It can be used twice a day (morning and night) and directly underneath makeup</li>
            <li> Just started using this product, but so far there are no cons to report.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I am 58 years old.</li>
            <li> I also like that it has natural ingredients</li>
            <li> my skin looks and feels much smoother and firmer - this is a definite keeper!</li>
            <li> it is not heavy or greasy.</li>
            <li> I believe it is because my skin have always been quite sensitive.</li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> This product is natural &amp; certified organic.</li>
            <li> Does not leave skin soft and no longer helps my rosacea.</li>
            <li> Came on time, It is a bit early to see skin results</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive,  so I must be allegric to one of the ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had no harsh reactions, because the ingredients are natural.</li>

            <li> sample was provided by Insta Natural to conduct my review.</li>
            <li> It is 98% natural and 72% Organic.</li>
            <li> sample was provided by Insta Natural to conduct my review.</li>
            <li> so i really don&#x27;t see it working like an instant cure.</li>
            <li> but I am surprised at your inquiry,love it that you care.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 11 year old daughter uses it and loves it too.</li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I do feel my skin better, but I am also using a dermaroller lately so it could be a bit of both.</li>
            <li> I look forward to continue to do business with Insta Natural.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling soft, smooth, firm and looking MUCH healthier.</li>
            <li> and I tend to have an overly sensitive sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I am going to stick with the Insta Natural.</li>
            <li> Really seems to tighten the facial skin.</li>
            <li> I also have old acne scars and they seem to be getting smoother, not so pronounced.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be surprised.  </li>
            <li> my old acne scars seems to be fading.</li>
            <li> They are all natural and have given me the opportunity to try a number of their products.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin too and haven&#x27;t had any reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> I do however have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and prone to redness.</li>
            <li> This was before you could get wonderfully natural products that nurtured skin rather than stripping it and adding chemicals.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft after using it.</li>
            <li> If coconut oil even looks my way my skin morphs into a 13 year old boy&#x27;s.)</li>
            <li> I dont know what others do, but I put it on at night and wake up with glowing skin, soft and supple.</li>
            <li> Im young</li>
            <li> It does smell like orange juice which is kind of weird and gets sticky if you put too much on</li>
            <li> I purposely waited a few weeks to leave feedback to be sure my opinion didn&#x27;t change after the initial uses.  </li>
            <li> Your face will love it &amp; you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> last week a order two more because I don&#x27;t want to stop using it, I got everyday complements on my skin been using mornings and at night</li>
            <li> Another aspect that I love is that it does not feel heavy on your skin as it absorbs deep into the skin.</li>
            <li> The dropper bottle makes application easier, especially if applying a few drops to the dorsal (top) sides of the hands to help lighten sun spots or discoloration.  </li>
            <li> A bit skeptical but because of good reviews, I gave it a try, even bought 2 items with the Vit C from this brand&#x27;s line of products.</li>
            <li> Sorry, would like to write a good review, but this is the fact</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice serum, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out, and I will use it til it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> Fine lines have lessened as well as minimized other facial imperfections.  </li>
            <li> Initially, expect your skin to look a bit worse, especially if you have lines around your eyes, which I don&#x27;t, or on your forehead, which I do, because this serum helps your skin shed its older layers and brings up fresh, healthy skin.</li>
            <li> A very small few drops rubbed over the problem areas on the face and your skin is silky smooth and hydrated for 16hrs or more.</li>
            <li> It has replaced several other products that I used to use because it is more of an all-in-one rather than being for one specific problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and sinks right in.  </li>
            <li> What really sets this apart from other serums is that it is not thin and runny, nor does it feel sticky after applied.  </li>
            <li> The company contacted me as a follow-up to my order with helpful tips and tricks on how to use the product - you can layer it with other serums and moisturizers - it will fit into your regular routine.  </li>
            <li> This serum smells delicious, and is thin and relatively watery as they all are in my experience, but stays juicy long enough for me to spread two big drops all over my face, including around my eyes, then absorbs and dries in a matter of seconds.  </li>
            <li> and you push syringe and sometimes takes a full one or half of one.</li>
            <li> , it is not oily, absorbs quickly and I have noticed a difference in the brightness of my skin and the fading of dark spots.  </li>
            <li> After I use my toner, I put a little of this onto my clean fingertips, then rub it onto my face.</li>
            <li> I use it as a spot treatment on the dark spots and scars and fine lines on my face daily.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural, and there is a slight odor of caffeine, again this vanishes quickly.</li>
            <li> Because I have sensitive skin, I generally read reviews like crazy before trying anything new, and I am very cautious about what I put on my skin (I no longer even use toner, only pure rose water or nothing at all before moisturizing).</li>
            <li> it smells a little funny, but that goes away fast.</li>
            <li> After a couple of weeks of using this serum under my normal moisturizer, my skin is getting more dried out, rough, and irritated (I&#x27;m breaking out and</li>
            <li> I am using it in a combination with Vitamin E Oil to lighten dark skin in bikini area resulting from friction and old pimples (I Live in a desert like weather, tooo hot 40+ C )</li>
            <li> Leaves an unpleasant texture on the skin, if i try to put my light moisturizer on top product will ball up and roll off my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m not actually sure if this does anything for the rest of my face as I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines.</li>
            <li> I was paying much more for a small vial of the same percentage of vitamin c before I discovered this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I’ve used a different Vitamin C Serum in the past and fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> My beauty routine is pretty simple, but I think I&#x27;ll add this product to my daily schedule.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, I have already ordered my second bottle after only having my first bottle for 2 days.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without a greasy heavy feeling!</li>
            <li> used this in conjunction with the vitamin C moisturizer, and I left a pretty similar review on that as well.</li>
            <li> After a few traumatic microdermabrasion treatments, my normally clear skin started breaking out badly- not just pimples, but with zits and infected bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it is a little sticky in my face and gets on my pillow easy.</li>
            <li> After  you apply it make sure you use a moisturizer because your face will feel a little dry,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a crock full of vitamin and oil goodness; I like to use it on those days my skin needs a little TLC</li>
            <li> Sinks in very fast.</li>
            <li> A company with high quality personal service!</li>
            <li> This is a high quality serum delivered by glass dropper in a blue glass bottle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to conclude for sure because I used a myriad of products, but for the price and my perception so far, I am a fan!</li>
            <li> I am 60 yrs old and have very sensitive skin that can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s dry, oily, breakout prone or normal.  </li>
            <li> use it along with an organic active moisturizer to get better results, indeed, this serum compliments the active moisturizer</li>
            <li> although prone to hormonal breakouts once a month, only oily on my nose, I don&#x27;t go tanning - only general sun exposure, only starting to get some fine lines around my eyes</li>
            <li> (if required).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for several days twice a day no doubt it was relatively easy to apply although it did require patience at times due to the amount of time it took, especially in the morning before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> usually have circles and bags under my tired mom-eyes, and after a couple weeks of this, my eyes haven&#x27;t looked this bright since pre-kids!</li>
            <li> /&gt;InstaNatural’s Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum is produced in small batches to ensure quality and freshness.</li>
            <li> My skin was left with a natural, radiant glow and it was not harsh on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I would try to identify what&#x27;s really working for me, in the long list of ingredients, and go for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I lightly rub a small amount over my face, neck and decolette.</li>
            <li> It helped return the dark spots back to its original skin color.</li>
            <li> I usually have an issue with oily serums because they clog my pores and make my skin feel heavy and gross, but this was nice!</li>
            <li> I work outside, and I noticed that my skin was feeling drier than normal despite using moisturizer over the serum.</li>
            <li> I did see more improvement in dark spots and other pigmented areas around my face, neck and hands.   </li>
            <li> Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> I use it full strength on my face and mix a few drops with body lotion and apply all over.</li>
            <li> This review is for skin that is: sensitive to dry, mature, thin, light laugh wrinkles around eyes.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using InstaNatural vitamin C, and I am surprised how it changed my face since the first session, I am 31 years old, I have normal skin type, uneven skin tone and dark circles under my eyes, I use 1.5 dermaroler on my face</li>
            <li> I have used numerous vitamin c serum products and this is the first with the strong fruity scent and unappealing yellow/orange color.</li>
            <li> It is hard to judge effects when I use more than one product regularly.  </li>
            <li> My sun spots came back and I live in rainy Oregon.</li>
            <li> This is the only new product that I have been using that would be making me break out, and I now have patches on my cheeks of what looks like eczema-</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t make a fuss over my issue, they simply apologized for the mishap and sent me a new bottle.</li>
            <li> so I decided to use the Insta  Natural vitamin c serum to help tighten them up and get my young girl glow back.</li>
            <li> Have only used it for 2wks and has left my skin very soft😊</li>
            <li> It really has become an essential part of my daily face regimen.  </li>
            <li> All indications are that the product is fresh and my only complaint is that because it is absorbed almost immediately upon application to the skin, it&#x27;s necessary to drop the serum directly onto a section of the face and rub it in before applying to another section.  </li>
            <li> This product made my skin look really refreshed without causing breakouts or aggravating any existing acne, and after multiple weeks of using it on a regular basis, you could see a difference.</li>
            <li> You can see the  difference in your skin in as quick as a few days.</li>
            <li> It was the least expensive, with the best reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This vitamin C Serum is easy to use, and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll get right down to it - summer</li>
            <li> I think its too soon to see any major improvements.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend $70 on other products for men</li>
            <li> I also am aware that this form of vitamin c is not prone to oxidation, so that is an improvement over some other products.</li>
            <li> It is as lightweight and silky as other higher end serums.</li>
            <li> This has always been a major problem with my face.</li>
            <li> so I dont have any major issues.  </li>
            <li> It has truly done wonders, softened scars and  makes my skin look tight and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be picking up a few things from this line, ingredients are better than ANY Caudalie, Clinique, Body Shop, or other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> There are so many products out there that do not live up to their claims, and believe me, I previously wasted a lot of money on some of those, but this one actually surpasses them.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different Vitamin C serums and I like yours even better than OZ Naturals (a close 2nd) for a few reasons, one being the orange fragrance, absorption is better and cost is less, seems to last a little longer.</li>
            <li> and I only have some fine lines on my forehead and some small sun spots and discoloration on my face.</li>
            <li> The main issue for me is an aging spot on my upper left cheak.</li>
            <li> They are so light you can hardly see them.  </li>
            <li> I had been using a more expensive product with a high hyaluronic acid percentage, in a pump bottle.  </li>
            <li> a little over couple of weeks, will know more down the road</li>
            <li> It had a love scent, and bright ,vibrant color, but like the toner, after application, it took a little long to dry, and left a stickiness behind, that made my face feel gross and weighted down.</li>
            <li> I use their Vitamin C Toner first &amp; let dry, then apply this Vitamin C Serum (a little goes a long way!), then follow with their Vitamin C Moisturizer in the morning &amp; their Retinol Moisturizer at night to really zap those wrinkles &amp; prevent new ones!  </li>
            <li> I also haven&#x27;t noticed any hormonal breakouts this month, could be a coincidence, but I&#x27;ve noticed a general improvement with my complexion</li>
            <li> Strangers generally guess that I&#x27;m 24.  </li>
            <li> People generally think I am in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Repeated or extended exposure to light and/or air can have a negative effect on efficacy.  </li>
            <li> Guys don&#x27;t generally put a ton of effort into face cleansing until the wrinkles start.</li>
            <li> In general, I felt that this serum was pretty average.</li>
            <li> Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li> Because of the clear color, I could see if the serum was turning even the slightest shade of yellow, and I would know to throw it out and start over.  </li>
            <li> Has definitely brighten up my skin and clear acne and spots.  </li>
            <li> The serum looks dense and yellow, smells a bit strange like fruit, absorb fast.</li>
            <li> and I believe it will last me a long time, as it doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t change the product back to the clear sticky liquid.</li>
            <li> At nearly $17 a bottle this bottle lasted me just under 3 weeks with daily and sometimes twice a day use.  </li>
            <li> I am 25 and have tried various preventative aging products, but because my skin is so sensitive they tend to not pan out.</li>
            <li> There is really nothing negative to say about this product; it is well priced and effective, at least for my needs.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I am only using every three (3) days to increase my tolerance.</li>
            <li> and it provides the necessary strength and resilience that we attribute to young looking skin.</li>
            <li> If you use too much you will get a tacky film so be careful.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> It definitely brightens and refines the pores and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.  </li>
            <li> No film or barely perceptible film.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 50+ year old skin is definitely clearer, smoother, &amp; brighter!!  </li>
            <li> anything natural with all the key ingredients.</li>
            <li> These are apparently sleep lines caused by burying my face in the pillow every night for years.  </li>
            <li> I received this today and only just applied it once so far.</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 4 because it did give my skin a natural glow and also helped my skin with a recent breakout.</li>
            <li> It has helped me with my crows feet around the eye area and with the deep wrinkles near the nose and cheek area.</li>
            <li> I hope to see them completely disappear with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> My pores look a lot smaller and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft after several usage of this serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week so far</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week and tried it on an old cut on my hand</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too early to tell, but definitely does nothing for discoloration,</li>
            <li> My daughter used it on her skin last night and followed with Insta Natural Rosehip oil.  </li>
            <li> only been using for a couple of weeks, but skin does feel smoother so far</li>
            <li> i have some hyper-pigmentation around my face that i&#x27;ve developed in the last year or so, and i&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of it for a bit.</li>
            <li> and I had a red spot on my face that is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels ultra soft and my deep wrinkles seems to have smoothed out!</li>
            <li> Also, Insta Natural has 100-day hassle-free money back guarantee, no matter where the product was purchased.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try this Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic and Ferulic Acid from Insta Natural.</li>
            <li> I have spent so much money on products that did not deliver 10% of the results that InstaNatural provide not to mention there</li>
            <li> The design of the product using the eye dropper is a real plus for keeping the serum minimally exposed to air which depletes the potency over time.</li>
            <li> old female still struggling with acne and combination skin.</li>
            <li> Additionally, HA can often make sensitive skin red or feel a momentary burn/tingle.  </li>
            <li> and i realize it is early to tell, my pores are reduced like all the way, leaving my skin texture smoother, also I see clarity and an even tone now, I had discoloration around my chin and side of my face since my20&#x27;s and that is gone, in specific yellowing around the mouth.</li>
            <li> I have been making natural skincare for ten years.</li>
            <li> but it has been only a couple of weeks so far since I started using it.</li>
            <li> The serum has a nice consistency and a faint citrusy aroma.</li>
            <li> It’s a thick serum that’s very easy to spread with your fingers, and the Hyaluronic Acid in the serum enhances hydration further by boosting the skin’s ability to retain moisture throughout the day to help combat dry and/or damaged</li>
            <li> Really made my skin feel soft and cut down on my redness.</li>
            <li> She uses 4 drops, twice a day after washing, but started at just once a day for several weeks to allow time for her skin to adjust to the vitamin C.  Burned just a little right after application during weeks one and two, but the pinkness and mild burning sensation subsided after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give an accurate review, but I&#x27;m seeing a slight improvement after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> By the very next morning after her first use, we noticed she looked clearer and less oily, but, not dried out like some products.</li>
            <li> Also as the days go by, i am noticing the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable, skin tone is even and bright; and the forehead lines have decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> Something about being outside in the sun for extended periods of time causes dryness with this serum, so if you work outdoors and/or have very sensitive skin as I do, I would only use this at night.</li>
            <li> I cannot say these sunspots were gone for a week usage, but I am pretty hopeful because I can see the slight change in colors already.</li>
            <li> Pleasant, very faint herbal scent.  </li>
            <li> It comes out literally coated and dripping with the serum, and that makes it kind of messy and hard to get the right amount without getting too much/too little.</li>
            <li> For my age, I have minimal (but enough) wrinkles around my eyes, I do have forehead lines and large pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum as the consistency is thicker and easier to apply than other Vitamin C Serums I have tried.</li>
            <li> I really like the vitamin c and all the other components of this serum .At</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really notice a glow but did leave skin feeling supple and hydrated due to the vitamin c and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s herbal and quite sharp, but not to the point to irritate or really bother you.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried a couple of other vitamin c serums, but didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> and it really packs a punch without the burn of other serums.</li>
            <li> I do use the InstaNatural Vitamin C moisturizer after and they compliment each other very well.</li>
            <li> They compliment each other well and seem to really work together to make your skin healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion, its a little too heavy to wear during the day, but OK at night.  </li>
            <li> so it had that clear blue tint and smelled like grapefruit and the second time it was the beginning of spring and had that orange tint</li>
            <li> Recently I went to a spa to have a professional facial  </li>
            <li> I regularly get sun spots and have some old acne scars, and while using this serum, I do feel like my skin has lightened up a bit, especially the scars and sun spots, and my skin looks brighter!</li>
            <li> It does not dry out skin but also keeps it from being too oily.</li>
            <li> Also, It does not dry my face out which I was worried about because of the strength.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t experience improvement of my dark spots or other imperfections like with the Original formula.  .  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I used it on a little spot at first</li>
            <li> i hope this helps some people out thererk spot nothing major but def obvious and that has faded.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum is very thick and a little drop is good for the entire face.</li>
            <li> The apparent stickiness only lasts until serum is fully absorbed, it only takes a few drops.</li>
            <li> It instantly makes my skin feel a little more firm, which I like.</li>
            <li> one feels cool on my face and stings just a tiny bit that you forgot about it, you wont have to use a lot of drops, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is no longer dry; it is smooth - no more flakiness.</li>
            <li> This new product is a watered down, version of the old one.</li>
            <li> This serum was very disappointing, after reading so many positive reviews I was expecting a high quality serum</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thick and consistent, smells like citrus and it feels very natural to me.</li>
            <li> Disappointed they changed what used to be a great product.</li>
            <li> But in general, 2 - 4 drops of this after washing is enough.  </li>
            <li> But other than that I am starting to see real results..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 2 other vitamin c serums and I really love these products.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been noticing a significant reduction in my skin hydration recently, especially coming out of a Minnesota winter, but by April, my skin usually snaps back well enough.</li>
            <li> I have been trying some different InstaNatural brand all natural facial products on a promotion and overall these</li>
            <li> Not long for words, I have been using this serum for 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  </li>
            <li> I am old and my have waited too long for a miracle.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The reason is that serums have very small molecules and lipophilic - fat friendly</li>
            <li> is a little bit high to buy frequently</li>
            <li> I have a few dark spots on my forehead and some fine lines around my eyes that could use a bit of help.  </li>
            <li> I also have very oily skin and was worried about the serum making my skin feel weighted down, but that is not the case.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine whether it will eventually lighten some of the age spots I&#x27;m starting to see, but I have high hopes and will provide a future update on my results.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and VERY dry skin.</li>
            <li> I know that I get frustrated with many products because I run out of the product right around the same time I start seeing results.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if the product offers any &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; improvement, but it certainly smoothes and tightens the skin when applied.</li>
            <li> I also love that they do not add any artificial fragrance, my skin is very sensitive, I can not use perfumes or products that contain them, it causes me to break out in eczema on my face and neck!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really explain what is different about my face, other than it simply looks radiant.  </li>
            <li> I do not mean artificial candy orange, but pure orange like juice from a fresh squeezed orange.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for Vitamin C serum, though not sure what percentage it is compared to the highly expensive serums.  </li>
            <li> I feel this product has really help with the slight sun damage I have on my chest.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t really give this anything less than 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I was MUCH happier with the CE+Ferulic combination I bought on amazon previously.</li>
            <li> I could feel a very slight tingling when I first started using it, which told me it was working..</li>
            <li> first then I apply few amount of the serum all over my face one a week and the glowing last for a week, not alot of change under my eyes</li>
            <li> The consistency is like a thick orange juice between your finger tips and although it absorbs quickly after cleansing and toning I have seen no results or any of the advertised added benefits after quite a bit of time of use.</li>
            <li> Right away ya skin soaks it up so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t really seen any dramatic results since I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a month, I&#x27;m convinced that I will see positive, long-lasting results in the near future.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way too, so you will definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day faithfully and can honestly state that it does no more or less than any other Vitamin C serums on the market.</li>
            <li> Each of those ingredients are hard to find in a product by themselves, much less all combined, so you know you are getting top quality.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve always had these creases, even as a teen) and just generally look gross to me after several hours, but this has seemed to help that</li>
            <li> The reason for 4 stars is that even though I see no long term effects I see an instant effect after applying this: my skin feels tighter with a glow to it.</li>
            <li> so I have those on my forehead but seeing the results so far  am hoping I can loose those.</li>
            <li> so I have those on my forehead but seeing the results so far  am hoping I can loose those.</li>
            <li> skin has become from oily to dry in just 2 weeks and white patches show up in morning near under eye area.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very sticky feeling and leaves my face feeling tight after applied.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any results, but it doesn&#x27;t break me out and it sinks in decently enough without leaving much of a film.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really pleasant, as it is citrus so it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical smell that will make you sick.</li>
            <li> I received multiple positive complements after using products for just a few days.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little bit strange but absorbs very fast.</li>
            <li> They are amazing, Although I have a typical oily &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone somethat typical of black skin, I was suffering from dry pockets pockets as skin ages.</li>
            <li> With the dropper, you can use as little or as much as you want.</li>
            <li> I noticed it was just a little bit thinner than another vitamin c serum I’d recently tried, so I had to act fast after I applied it to my face</li>
            <li> First, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It used to come in a dark blue bottle, left my skin feeling soft, and was a thick serum and rich in color.</li>
            <li> Its almost as good as the expensive one.. just a little thicker.</li>
            <li> sometimes your skin is striped and very sensitive due to chemical treatments and cleansers.</li>
            <li> But then I thought of using InstaNatural because it&#x27;s half the price and has high customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides helping give your face a younger healthier new look, Vitamin C serum also helps your skin repair itself from damage such as scars, age or dark spots, sun damage and even expedite the healing of wounds and reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The back of my right hand (control) still looks like a Minnesotan&#x27;s hand in late spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would much rather smell slightly citrus-y than like medicine or something strange.</li>
            <li> It goes on thin and leave a very slight tacky feeling to the skin - but it makes your skin look nice and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This serum also dried my skin out even with using my normal oilfree cream!</li>
            <li> The texture is in between thick and watery, so in order words, just right.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a Iot of different natural oils listed in the ingredients which the other brand of serum I was using didn&#x27;t contain and maybe that was the &amp;#34;heaviness&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive, so I don&#x27;t use as often as recommended but still see an improvement in dark spots, which is the reason for purchase.  </li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive brands in the past and I must say I was surprised at the quality, packaging and the results that I have gotten so far with this product.</li>
            <li> Due to some  allergie and intolerance I stay clear from all synthetics and chemicals as well as caffeine.</li>
            <li> , it was clear leaving no film after drying, and  it allowed me to apply other products over it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have tried 3 other company&#x27;s serums so far.  </li>
            <li> and you get Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid and lots of other natural oils and ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other skin serums, Vitamin C serum is a natural way to produce collagen because of it&#x27;s ascorbic acid.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum is unlike any other Vitamin C Serum that you see in the market today.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-50&#x27;s and have a lot of aging spots on my face due to sun exposure from watching my kids play sports when they were young.  </li>
            <li> Broken caps on cheeks reduced significantly.</li>
            <li> I have tried several vitC serums (some of them way more expensive than this one), and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I would occasionally get burning from my other product, and oddly, not with this one.  </li>
            <li> It was not pale white but dark orange.</li>
            <li> New skin products typically take 4-6 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see changes, but there may be some brightening.</li>
            <li> That is such a big deal, .. I have a dark spot nothing major but def obvious and that has faded.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t waste a bit, and rub what little is left on my hands on my arms and back of my hands until all is absorbed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a very old woman (30 years) but friend my age tend to comment that my skin looks even younger than I am.  </li>
            <li> sheer abundance of active ingredients, especially for a &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; price, strikes me as odd -- you don&#x27;t see these combinations very often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old female and just recently started noticing that my skin tone was starting to get uneven, almost blotchy, which is why I purchased this Vitamin C product.</li>
            <li> When I first applied it my skin looked dull but In the morning my skin has a radiating glow that is noticed by all I encounter.</li>
            <li> So far this is the only Vitamin C serum that doesn&#x27;t produce little red dots all over my face (trust me, I&#x27;ve tried ALL OF THEM).</li>
            <li> I been a big fan of Oz natural products, I decided to try it based on some of the previous reviews</li>
            <li> And, it&#x27;s hard to say how much difference any serums or moisturizers make when it comes to preventing or reversing the signs of aging, particularly in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and can usually only use a few skincare items that have 1-3 ingredients in them.  </li>
            <li> After waking up each morning, my skin feels smooth and a bit tight, but not the tightness that usually accompanies a dry face.</li>
            <li> My skin feels healthier and clearer than it usually is, Smells very nices and it is absorbs quicky in my skin,  </li>
            <li> I had a pretty negative impression of Vitamin C serum before I tried Instanatural&#x27;s Vitamin C &amp; Ferulic Acid.  </li>
            <li> Fyi, I&#x27;m not a paid spokesman, just an average 34 year old woman and I have never had a routine in the morning or night using face creams.</li>
            <li> I had 2 sun spots under my eye area and after using vitamin C serum, they have considerably faded (still there but not as dark).</li>
            <li> Waited to write a review after using the product for at least a month consistently.</li>
            <li> it is very orange , but i am not sure it is doing something to my face, i dont feel much after I put it on, so I am not sure of the benefits, it says to wake up the skin</li>
            <li> Together with taking to time to wash and tone my face and neck two times per day, a small amount of serum rubbed into my face and neck has really evened out my complexion, repair my pores</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try Vitamin C serum as I have small acne bumps on my forehead and some pigmentation .  </li>
            <li> After almost 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve already noticed my dark spots from old acne lightening up.</li>
            <li> but maybe I haven&#x27;t been using it for long enough.</li>
            <li> so this bottle will last you a long time.</li>
            <li> However, I have been using Vitamin C and Rosehip oil for a long time, this is my third bottle.  </li>
            <li> I will resport back in a few months to let you know how it&#x27;s worked on all my 57 year old facial issues.</li>
            <li> I cannot give a 5-star rating, because I have not used it long enough</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see my sun spots disappear but here&#x27;s hoping!!  </li>
            <li> As to whether it is helping with lines, age spots, and the like, the jury is still out, as I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine that.</li>
            <li> and I think my skin tone is starting to even out, not completely</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t like a fragrance you would still like this because the smell doesn&#x27;t last that long ...</li>
            <li> A bottle will last a long time if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used this for a few months, I&#x27;ve had a slight change, mainly in the early stages of using it.</li>
            <li> Due to other high reviews, I gave this a chance</li>
            <li> I have been using the serum for a little over a week and the breakouts are almost completely cleared up!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be using this product for a long time!</li>
            <li> I live in the mountains and do not wear makeup everyday</li>
            <li> Lines becomes less visible and skin has a natural glow.</li>
            <li> My skin is often red, and prone to breakouts, while also being dry.</li>
            <li> I bought this brand because it was slightly cheaper than the OZ Natural Vitamin C</li>
            <li> I had this dry red patch on my cheek.  </li>
            <li> The water content of the skin becomes out of balance and skin becomes dry and wrinkles multiply.</li>
            <li> I wash my face, then put on this serum and let it dry for a couple of minutes before using my regular moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It has made a big difference in lightening my dark spots, evening skin tone, plumping and smoothing out skin in general.  </li>
            <li> so far I see a slight difference</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice what long term effects will be.</li>
            <li> Havent used long enough to see long term results</li>
            <li> In just  few, short weeks this product has completely transformed my skin.</li>
            <li> The first thing I notice was the dark spots under my eyes started fading after a few uses, and my skin looking a lot healthier.</li>
            <li> Have only used a few weeks so far though.</li>
            <li> Of all the THOUSANDS of dollars I&#x27;ve spent on dept store and drug store products, this ranks up there as one of the few products I&#x27;ve found that really works.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Noticing a positive difference to the appearance of the skin was obvious as it looked slightly healthier and softer (there were a few wrinkles to begin with and they disappeared somewhat).</li>
            <li> and I honestly do not notice any positive effect.</li>
            <li> I work long hours, most of which is indoors at a computer, and I didn&#x27;t like how tired and dried out I was beginning to look.  </li>
            <li> Not sure which one is doing the job, or both, but my dry winter skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> especially at the end of a long day here in dry California.</li>
            <li> The only down side was when I reordered I actually received another similar product that I did not like as well, so</li>
            <li> I previously used a more expensive brand for about 10 yrs but had to cut back on costs and found this.  </li>
            <li> The back of my left hand (tester) is already softer than the other with noticeable recovery when tugged.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product have the recommended percentage of Vitamin C content (20%), it includes other beneficial products like hyaluronic acid and different plant oils.  </li>
            <li> In addition to changing my sleep habit to back only, I have been using this serum every other night with the Derma Roller by Diva d&#x27;or.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next day my face looked patchy, yellow and felt extremely</li>
            <li> I have used other hyaluronic serums from this same company which I felt didn&#x27;t give me enough moisture</li>
            <li> It simply leaves my skin soft but firm, not at all dry.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it is the mixture or one product in particular</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised to see this serum is tinted orange and smells like an orange.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say if it is any different from the other 3 I have tried-</li>
            <li> Because I am a busy mom with little kiddos, I feel like my skin has taken a beating.</li>
            <li> I transfer a small amount to a little vial to keep on my bathroom counter and refrigerate the rest to keep the product fresh.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out like other serums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll do a follow up review in a few weeks but anticipate nothing less than continued positive results.</li>
            <li> little bit goes a long way, you only use a couple of drops for your entire face so it should last a long time.</li>
            <li> Shoes are cheaply made and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> - that delicate balance of oil on the skin that maintains the pH balance of 5.5 - what I feel with the Vitamin C serum is that the moisture retention that it provides is really helping my skin maintain its balance.</li>
            <li> My routine is I apply Insta Natural Facial Cleanser to my face with a cotton pad using small upward circles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hoping that it will fade a few dark spots on my face in time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve already noticed some minor brown spots fading.</li>
            <li> It.i have found something i feel i will use for a long time.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to wait long to moisturize and put on my makeup.  </li>
            <li> I just received this, 3 days ago, so I do not yet have a long term review, however,  </li>
            <li> I used to use a long line of Sonya Dakar products.  </li>
            <li> I expected to experience the same glow with this serum</li>
            <li> , I can already tell that I&#x27;m going to run out of serum long before I run out of moisturizer, so</li>
            <li> You will probably see its anti-aging effects in the long run.</li>
            <li> serum, in a matter of a few days, has dramatically evened out my complexion and has shrunk my pores to near invisible.</li>
            <li> Will see how it works long term.</li>
            <li> I used this all summer long</li>
            <li> I firmly believe that using Vitamin C Serum can aid in Anti-Aging by helping the skin to stay plump and soft.</li>
            <li> I apply a few drops of this (4-5) in the morning after cleansing my face and then follow with moisturizer with SPF (some days I use Insta Natural Rosehip organic Oil).</li>
            <li> I have not used this product for long</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum causes no irritation to my skin and along with my lotion helps my face stay moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a tightening and can&#x27;t wait to see the long term benefits.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, and have notice a improvement in my crows feet, and it helps with old scars from acne.</li>
            <li> A couple drops goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lingers for a long time after putting it on.</li>
            <li> In addition to feeling sticky, this product gave me strange bumps on my temples after about 2-3 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long a long time.</li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time)</li>
            <li> Why did it take me so long to find this company?  </li>
            <li> Have tried all kinds of acne products including Proactiv, they would work for a while but could not completely stop the breakouts.</li>
            <li> Maybe in the long term.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few minutes for your skin to absorb, but once it does, my skin felt soft to the touch.</li>
            <li> Of course one month is not that long a time</li>
            <li> Obviously since this happens with all vitamin C products, I am unable to use it for obvious reasons but alas, my 16 year old son LOVES it so I&#x27;ll keep purchasing. :)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking tired, dehydrated, and overall just feel &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34;, give this a try - if you don&#x27;t see any difference in 2 weeks (take photos, haha, I wish I did!)</li>
            <li> I have to be careful with the products I use, so I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to try anything new.</li>
            <li> it is complete different, dry my skin and do not feel the same, it is just not good enough...</li>
            <li> My face feels supple, not tight or dried out.</li>
            <li> The only odd, in my opinion is the smell of the product, I was probably expecting the smell of fruits such as oranges</li>
            <li> They stand behind all of their products and if you are dissatisfied in anyway they will make it right.</li>
            <li> At first I was apprehensive due to my delicate skin.  </li>
            <li> You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger.</li>
            <li> I will be back for their other products-just not this one.  </li>
            <li> I just ordered another bottle and I will continue to buy this for as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> So I took a shot and ordered this and the other product at the same time.  </li>
            <li> , i would definitely purchase it again if I could not get hold of the other serum i used.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait for long term!</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C serum  is a ‘milky yellow’ colour, presumably due to the sea buckthorn.  </li>
            <li> Different than other stuff I&#x27;ve used but seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products similar to this one.  </li>
            <li> In other words, it helps it look younger and firmer.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any extreme differences yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks and these things take time!</li>
            <li> I regret the decision and should have paid the extra money for the other serum.</li>
            <li> One thing that I can say sets this serum apart from other similar serum is its scent.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be repurchasing and trying other products by this brand.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this item not only for myself, but for friends and other family as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d get tiny little white bumps on my cheeks that come and go, but not anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also includes other anti aging ingredients such as Organic Rosehip Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, Organic Argan Oil and Carrot Seed Oil!  </li>
            <li> I have also used it on some minor skin irritations, and it seems to speed healing process!  </li>
            <li> wish that you can deliver other products such as the mask and other serums internationally.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night, and alternate it with my prescription dermatology medicine.</li>
            <li> it dry</li>
            <li> I started using this product with the vitamin C moisturizer and the dry patch is gone.  </li>
            <li> and I do not have any flaking or dry skin because of this product.</li>
            <li> it just makes my skin dry</li>
            <li> and I tend to have some dry areas around my nose and mouth.</li>
            <li> It has an immediate soothing effect on dry, flakey skin.</li>
            <li> and i already have dry skin</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.  </li>
            <li> (that I bought separately) if my skin is particularly dry.  </li>
            <li> but I do see and feel improvement in my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I sprayed some rosewater on my face and patted that dry.</li>
            <li> I put it on, let it dry, then apply moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> My blemishes started to fade and my prone acne spots began to dry up.</li>
            <li> Dry skin.</li>
            <li> would wake up in the morning with dry skin, making no difference, not hydrating at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Depends on if your skin is dry or oily.</li>
            <li> Before using this toner had some patches of dry looking skin on my forehead, but that is no longer an issue.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out</li>
            <li> Take a minute to dry can feel it lifting.</li>
            <li> I use this before my moisturizer because I have extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you will be using it under sunscreen or make up, you need to let it dry for sometime.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The results from a few short weeks of using this product have gone beyond my initial expectations.</li>
            <li> Mine was milky white and thick when I received my bottle.. was expecting a clear serum.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it contain active ingredients to help your skin renew itself like vitamin c and ferulic acid</li>
            <li> I feel and look younger after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Watching dark spots that have been lingering from previous breakouts disappear within the first few weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> There are a few ingredients I wasn&#x27;t sure about, but I didn&#x27;t bother looking them up, so I could be wrong.</li>
            <li> It dried slower and also formed somewhat of a barrier that I personally found annoying because other normally applied products such as moisturizing serum, moisturizer, and perhaps foundation makeup seemed to float on top and not penetrate the Vit C Serum layer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have not notice any difference in fine lines, or other noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> but as previously stated haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on changes.</li>
            <li> It has a citrus smell, which I like, it does leave my skin feeling tight, but not dry.</li>
            <li> It may offer benefits (it is definitely helping with a couple of dark spots) but it leaves a residue that is visible after a couple of hrs.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it after several months and began using Tretinoin Cream 0.025% to get rid of the dark patches created by the C serum.  </li>
            <li> I tried this Vitamin C serum on my face for the last 2 days and it seems to give me a glow, and I know it will help fade some of my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> Dark spots are fading and I had skin cancer surgery and the scar was still red.</li>
            <li> We had a small problem with my order and they fixed it with no hesitations.  </li>
            <li> I have dark spots/acne scars all along my cheeks, chin, between my nose and upper lip and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face, so I&#x27;m not able to use any and everything.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything to my wrinkles either, and I am under 20 years old, so I have small ones.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure if that is naturally occurring or added in</li>
            <li> I will say that a small amount covers face and neck quite well and the feel is soft and not abrasive.  </li>
            <li> I know the prices on most the ingredients and some are very expensive.</li>
            <li> No matter what you try from this line you won&#x27;t loose.  </li>
            <li> I am not about to vouch that you drop years or that you loose wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I found that yellow serums mean two things: 1) the vitamin c has decayed, or 2) the company made the serum yellow to hide potential decay.  </li>
            <li> The ONLY discernable difference, is the other one needs to be refrigerated to keep it from oxidizing, but this one claims the way they make theirs, it won&#x27;t oxidize for up to 24 months!</li>
            <li> However, I will confirm that if this product is used based on the vendors instructions with fidelity (twice a day), preceded and followed by other skin care practices, then the pores start getting a little tighter, and overall facial skin health is rejuvenated (looks hydrated, supple and fresh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product help me get rid of my dry skin,my complexion is brighter!Loveeee it!</li>
            <li> Not sticky, oily, or too dry!</li>
            <li> I received this with the facial toner I previously reviewed.</li>
            <li> After the second day, I started noticing small changes and 2 weeks later.</li>
            <li> I have less deep pockets in my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is similar to a product I was using but for about half the price.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, you only need a few drops and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Oh and it smoothed out my rough, dry skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product</li>
            <li> If you have less areas to worry about, this will probably last for that</li>
            <li> I bought this serum after I ran out of my previous vitamin c serum of a different company.</li>
            <li> do recommend this product, however, it has to be noted that my skin reacted negatively the first few days that I’ve tried it.</li>
            <li> Her acne pits are so deep that she will never be rid of them, but the edges of the pits seem much less defined- as if her skin has been buffed or airbrushed somehow.&lt;br /&gt;Her</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is also less costly than some similar products that basically are just 20% vitamin c &amp; maybe some hyaluronic acid!  </li>
            <li> but this bottle may last a month or less than it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been a little over a month, now, and I already saw noticeable improvements, especially if I chase this treatment down with the proper supplements beneficial to the skin.</li>
            <li> This product turned my skin from dull, dry, flakey and lifeless to soft, dewy, glowy and moisturized.</li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s too soon to tell if it is doing anything much, but at least it isn&#x27;t doing any harm!</li>
            <li> My face was starting droop and not look as tight.</li>
            <li> a couple of drops is all you need to get your entire face and it includes a convenient little dropper</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and its got a different consistency and color than the other 2 I&#x27;ve ordered in the past.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this little bottle.</li>
            <li> This seems to add a little extra glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> There is a fragrance, I guess I would call it herbal, which takes me a back a little when I apply it, but again, the scent does not linger.  </li>
            <li> With a money back guarantee, you&#x27;ve got little to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin is even softer than before, and the sun spots are starting to fade a little.  </li>
            <li> I also had a little break out that was on the verge of being a big breakout</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I have used other (more expensive) brands of vitamin C serum in the past</li>
            <li> It even lighter my tone face little bit and my face skin look smoother and younger.</li>
            <li> though with how little is needed, I think this one should last me a while.  </li>
            <li> I have not had the product or been using for very long and have used other products</li>
            <li> That means the whole bottle is heavily oxidized!!!</li>
            <li> Every woman should look and feel radiant, but unfortunately like many other women, I tend to get a bit dry and dull looking at times.</li>
            <li> Recently however, I have been noticing my face starting to droop; sag; fall; whatever you choose to call it and a dull appearance.</li>
            <li> Hard to describe, but she actually looks younger.  </li>
            <li> Although it has a pleasing scent, I won&#x27;t be able to tell if it has gone bad.  </li>
            <li> I have used many Vitamin C Serums, but this one is bad.</li>
            <li> i was so shocked when i got this product and used it after i washed my face usually most vitamin C serums leave this sticky film on my face or break me out this one however didn&#x27;t do either</li>
            <li> The directions were to use a few drops, but  I initially found it a bit difficult to know how much to use to get proper coverage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer in the use of Vitamin C as a facial regime</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times</li>
            <li> I  have only used it a few days, and I have noticed a difference in the tone of my skin.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected in a vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> Also, I started using a harsh prescription acne cream retin a micro generic brand</li>
            <li> Expected help with lessening of wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I have heard that Vit C serum may cause dryness on our face, and need to use it with some heavy cream to get enough hydration.</li>
            <li> I am 32 and have never really been focused on wrinkles but thought about getting started in preventative care.</li>
            <li> I am currently in SW Florida, so I must slather on sun screen a few times a day.  </li>
            <li> My skin is softer and smoother  after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> After only a few days I can see the lines softening.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually impatient for  results, especially if others claim to see results faster....  </li>
            <li> No breakout, not much discomfort.</li>
            <li> This product  works as expected.</li>
            <li> Apply a moisturizer a few minutes later to prevent drying the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks</li>
            <li> so I was curious.</li>
            <li> I wanted a product that would help with uneven skin tone and some acne scars and this serum has definitely helped my skin.</li>
            <li> I will write back in a few months to give  update.</li>
            <li> After a few days/nights, I definitely noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have sun spot on my face during the summer time, so I&#x27;m curious to see if the vit. C will help with those</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using this serum, I noticed that my wrinkles were fainter and my skin looked healthier and younger.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin.</li>
            <li> After the product dries, which takes not much time at all, I applied my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have used several products for my uneven skin tone,  nothing worked</li>
            <li> After a few days of using this serum, I noticed my pores were smaller</li>
            <li> I have actually been using vitamin c serum for a few years now.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks use, I already see smaller pores and brighter skin tone.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the Vitamin C Serum for Face for a few weeks, but I have noticed a lightening of the melasma on my forehead.</li>
            <li> NO real difference noted after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> this serum sinks into skin, no oily face.</li>
            <li> However, for me it was too harsh for my skin and actually made the skin on my face sore after I had used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for a few weeks now and will definitely be ordering another one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using this product for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I bought a few items from InstaNatural within the last couple of months, one of which is the Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this serum for a few days and already feel and see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> As someone with oily/combination skin that is prone to acne, I have to be quite careful about what I put on it.</li>
            <li> no thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, yet I feel and see results.</li>
            <li> Also be careful with it around the eyes.</li>
            <li> When I received the Orange colored product I thought some mistake had been made though I had clicked on &amp;#34;order again&amp;#34; and expected the product to be identical.  </li>
            <li> But just a few days back I had about a handful of almonds and peanuts...and no breakouts!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I never really know how to view the effects</li>
            <li> Hyaluronic acid,witch hazel,plant stem cells,algae extract,Japanese green leaf extract,(camellia oleifera, organic rosehip seed oil,organic Argan oil,sea buckthorn oil, pink grapefruit essential oil,carbomer,(2s) -2-amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid,kosher vegetable glycerin, organic jojoba oil, vitamin e</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only been using the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum for a few days and can not speak to visible results yet, this serum sinks into my skin immediately and feels hydrating.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, however, I like the way it smells and that a little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using it, my skin already feels soft and my pores seem to be smaller than usual!</li>
            <li> Like the other comments have said, you only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin but due to use of anti acne products my skin was very dry.</li>
            <li> I have found after using this product for about a week that the dry dull look has started to come less frequently.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum from Instanatural, although not a pure Argan oil product, it does contain Argan Oil along with vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, feralic acid, sea buckthorn oil, rosehip oil, plan stem oil, and pomegranate.</li>
            <li> I THINK IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;BOUGHT OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THIS SAME BRAND, AND THIS SERUM DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO DO IT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> It led me to buy other products from InstaNaturals including their Vitamin C facial cleanser and toner and the Dead Sea Mud Musk.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using the Vitamin C Serum, I had trouble with breakouts due to the summer heat.  </li>
            <li> It woks be a five if I saw dramatic results, so far it&#x27;s a change but not that big to make it a five.</li>
            <li> Also, after only a few days, I did notice some small age spots I have had for years start to fade and my skin overall feels softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> The tone was starting to even out, and the dark spots fading a little.  </li>
            <li> my face is a little brighter and it has started to fade some of my dark (acne) spots which is a big bonus!  </li>
            <li> You only need a little bit, I use less than 10 drops.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> One little drop  goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A. little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of this, a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying the product is bad, the texture is light, its absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t make me break out or cause irritation and the scent is very pleasing, but my skin is not receiving the same effect as that other expensive brand&#x27;s serum had given me.  </li>
            <li> little does go a long way, like other reviewers have said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it but a few times but my skin looks &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and my skin tone has ever so slightly evened out.</li>
            <li> My face also doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry after I apply the Vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Some investigation led me to choose InstaNatural over a few competitors due to others&#x27; use of water to give &amp;#34;twice the serum for half the price&amp;#34; or some such claim.</li>
            <li> The consistency of the serum makes it easier than other brands to apply in an even layer to your face.</li>
            <li> I will continue to reorder InstaNatural&#x27;s serum and will look into their other products as well.</li>
            <li> how these 2 has some extreme chemical reaction somehow... feels burn...</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I had been looking specifically for a serum that would include rosehip oil, as I will not use rosehip alone due to the smell.</li>
            <li> the usual issues often associated with retinol, such as redness, flaking&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I have been using this product in conjunction with other InstaNatural products every day for over two months now</li>
            <li> I also use this product in combination with other instanatural products.&lt;br /&gt;I would defintely give this product five stars.</li>
            <li> Where deep wrinkles are seen in the skin, the collagen scaffold was damaged due to excessive stress over time.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said the serum has a milky color.</li>
            <li> My order was through Amazon as I bought some other products.  </li>
            <li> looking this past 6 months or so due to working outside with our livestock twice a day, rain or shine.  </li>
            <li> It cleared up a small but constant breakout on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I have started buying other items from their line and wholly support this company.</li>
            <li> Thicker than other C serums I&#x27;ve tried, so easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I use this every other day, morning and night, with Argan Oil.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C has a thicker feeling than other vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> have extremely problematic combination skin</li>
            <li> The only con I had with it is that the bottle is sooo small.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel younger, tighter, smoother and fresher than other serums I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The company did say this could be due to colder climate when the batch was made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an Aesthetician and extremely picky about the products I use.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t see any improvements comparing to other products that I have used before.</li>
            <li> Cant tell yet after a week of using, also, I am using it with other products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m undecided about whether or not to try any other serum.  </li>
            <li> The other is that it&#x27;s designed to be used with a moisturizer, so which product is doing what?</li>
            <li> the other hand, as I say, it&#x27;s a quality product and used with their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Extremely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m choosing other products from this manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to try other products.</li>
            <li> Do they offset each other?</li>
            <li> If the mix is beneficial, why don&#x27;t other companies use them?</li>
            <li> No breakouts or other side effects.</li>
            <li> I already have a lot of skincare product samples due to working in that industry</li>
            <li> I only used a small amount.  </li>
            <li> The reason I did not use the 2 together was due to an illness NOT RESULTING FROM PRODUCT USE, so I did not want to overwhelm my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely watery, yet dries sticky.</li>
            <li> If anything my skin became darker and coarser, but it was probably due to the sun.</li>
            <li> It was not as viscous as other types</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, at about 1/3 of the price of other vitamin C serums.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nervous now to try any other Vitamin C serum</li>
            <li> I tried two other products on Amazon and nothing worked.  </li>
            <li> I ordered some other products for my face and hair.</li>
            <li> I use it every other night, followed by one of my oils.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got the opportunity to try this product I was anxious to try I tried it out the same day I got it</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers remarked on color and fragrance.  </li>
            <li> My sister and daughters have become eager converts to this serum and other</li>
            <li> Other ingredients include: Hyaluronic Acid (moisturizes skin), Tea Tree Oil (a skin soother), and Retinol (a pore de-clogger).</li>
            <li> [Grab a bottle now to reverse the signs of aging and other skin troubles:</li>
            <li> and I use it in conjunction with a lot of other InstaNatural products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll include the references for other pubmed</li>
            <li> A sister who hadn&#x27;t seen her in a few years swears that she must&#x27;ve had a peel or some other minor procedure.  </li>
            <li> It works well with other products.  </li>
            <li> I actually use it on a small portion on my hand where my skin was irritated and did wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products before and none of them worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the one to put chemicals because they usually end up making my skin break-out, I recently tried another serum</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell metallic like some other products with ferulic acid.</li>
            <li> Its like it has a little bit of everything in it to address all your skin concerns in one little blue bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would definately purchase again and would try other products as well.</li>
            <li> I use frankincense and helichrysum  and other oils</li>
            <li> I want to use other vitamin C products along with this serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also been slacking on my skin care regimen due to exhaustion.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this because my doctor suggested I purchase a vitamin C serum to reduce scarring on a small facial surgery.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this too, but it seems to work for me and a bottle seems to last quite a long time (still have at least half bottle after a month).</li>
            <li> I have seen its results on especially dry areas of my body (shins).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have actively cared for my skin since age 14</li>
            <li> it does NOT contain the active form of vitamin C L ascorbic acid.  </li>
            <li> so this was super disappointing.</li>
            <li> , some people get shocked when I tell them my age, some others guessing my age few year younger,, my advice for this serum or any other serum is to use it with dermaroler, no pain no gain, right!</li>
            <li> I am sorry to have to leave this review after all of the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I am not barely 40, with a few wrinkles, but 67!</li>
            <li> or so I have a hard time with makeup and numerous other skincare products that no longer seem to work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my skin is very sensitive and reacted after a while of use with  little red discolorations on my cheek.</li>
            <li> dark spots should lift.. doubt if the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; is active</li>
            <li> They work together actively to improve the moisture levels of skin and helps reduce marks, brown spots and dark</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, but it seems to be slightly fading a few acne scars i have already.</li>
            <li> It has a slight sharp citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I’ve used other Vitamin C Serums that have less favorable odors.</li>
            <li> but he looked hard and finally said, &amp;</li>
            <li> I regularly get pimples and blackheads and buildup on my nose which is hard to get rid of.</li>
            <li> little more then this one, too bad its not available anymore.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I had very little success.</li>
            <li> It smoothes out easily and dries completely without leaving a nasty film like some other products I have tried.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in lightening my dark spots yet</li>
            <li> A small bit goes a long way so if I had paid, I would think I got my money’s worth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> A small amount of serum goes a long way</li>
            <li> A small amount of serum goes a long way</li>
            <li> A small amount of serum goes a long way</li>
            <li> I am blessed with a youthful apperance and just wanted to get rid of that dark spot.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple weeks but have felt like it at least made my skin feel smoother.</li>
            <li> It also gets rid of or lightens any dark spots.</li>
            <li> so I need something to address my dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I am anxious to see the long term results.</li>
            <li> and I do not hold back my opinions if they are negative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty shocked that something is actually helping my lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I use twice a day under my eyes to fade my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I received this 2 days ago and a dark spot on my cheek has lightened up quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> but I think it takes time for dark circle.&lt;br /&gt;Sinse</li>
            <li> /&gt;  diminishes dark spots and discoloration&lt;</li>
            <li> And the outer edges of those dark spots are not as dark.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with the age defying moisturizer and the eye cream for dark circles.</li>
            <li> My glow is returning and dark spots are clearing.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried at least 50 different types of serums)</li>
            <li> I had really dark pours on my nose</li>
            <li> After 1 bottle I saw results in my dark spots....</li>
            <li> I have some dark spots on my cheeks</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it is sold in a dark colored bottle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any dark spot reduction yet, but I&#x27;m using it twice a day and hope to see results soon.</li>
            <li> so I purchased this product to brighten the dark spots.  </li>
            <li> I have Some dark spots from age and sun they seem to be lightening</li>
            <li> I have noticed a fading of my dark spots</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had dark spots all around my cheek area..</li>
            <li> also.. trust me if u hav dark spots use this..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Diminishes dark spots, marks, and patches&lt;br /&gt;Reduces appearance of wrinkles</li>
            <li> vitamin C is used to hydrate the skin and hoping to lighten the dark patches on my face.</li>
            <li> I have genetic dark circles, and this has helped make them lighter.</li>
            <li> Nothing else has helped my dark circles.</li>
            <li> I do have a few small bumps from my skin detoxing since I started using it, but that only lets me work the product works!!!.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see the spots and wrinkles slowly disappeared.  </li>
            <li> Only the improvement is a bit slow.</li>
            <li> It is thick and I only have to use about 4 drops.  </li>
            <li> It has helped my dark marks from broken blemishes completely disappear...</li>
            <li> Her face has been dried and rough from acne creams.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it after a week as i felt it was irritating sensitive areas like my cheeks.</li>
            <li> And I think it was too harsh as it gave a rough texture to my skin, even broke me out.</li>
            <li> I have been using for a few weeks and although the results are minimal I can see a change on my skin.</li>
            <li> But strip everything away once a week at night w/ASDM&#x27;s 10% Glycolic pads on a day you haven&#x27;t used scrub and you&#x27;ll find out if there really are less wrinkles: Sadly the answer w/</li>
            <li> If this one is taken down I am not doing another one.</li>
            <li> It is 1 ounce and not watered down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all down hill</li>
            <li> but this summer there was an emergency (friend&#x27;s house burnt down)</li>
            <li> Instead of a watered down Serum, it is almost like a face cream.</li>
            <li> Its a little thicker than the other one I have</li>
            <li> I have no more dry patches.</li>
            <li> My face appears to have less dark spots than before.</li>
            <li> It was a little thicker than I expected and that took a little getting used to.  </li>
            <li> but in that time, my skin is re-hydrated, the pesky worry lines on my forehead are GONE, I can&#x27;t see the wrinkles near my eyes unless I smile (that&#x27;s not so bad!), and, the odd uneveness that was happening around the corners of my mouth are GONE.</li>
            <li> As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of products that are supposed to reduce dark circles, but none of them worked quite as fast and had ingredients that actually reacted bad with my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this and a few other products from InstaNatural about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have not had any skin peeling on my face as with other harsh skin renewal products.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see how it will look after a few weeks, as I ordered this mainly due to my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I also notice that my skin is brighter, assuming is due to the green tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other serums this one hasn&#x27;t dried out my face whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I was SO badly wanting a less expensive alternative and had such high hopes based on the reviews, but I am sad to say that it&#x27;s not a great alternative, but perhaps a great serum for someone.</li>
            <li> Smoother,even and less puffy around eyes.</li>
            <li> I have less touch ups throughout the day.</li>
            <li> It seems to plump my skin so that wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> on my last year of my &amp;#34;early thirties&amp;#34; so I thought I might as well get serious, somewhat, with my skin care</li>
            <li> My skin texture has improved and the lines are much less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and have experiened less breakouts.</li>

            <li> My acne scars are less visible too.  </li>
            <li> texture is a bit odd</li>
            <li> I received a response in less than 24 hours and was offered a refund.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this again because I think I have found a winner at much less cost than some brands.</li>
            <li> Noticed less clogged pores too.</li>
            <li> After cleansing and toning, but not moisturizing, I apply half a dropped to my palms and pat this all over my face and neck.</li>
            <li> and I experience less breaking out.  </li>
            <li> Less wrinkles!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I put it on while my skin is still slightly damp from the shower and about 6 drops is plenty to cover my face, neck and decolletee.  </li>
            <li> Well, because it means that no added colors were added, which means less chemicals in your serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Done with half of the bottle</li>
            <li> Its unlike any other of the vitamin C serums that I&#x27;ve purchased from other company&#x27;s in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a slightly citrusy scent</li>
            <li> I believe this serum improved my skin condition and made me break out much less.</li>
            <li> Smells a bit odd, and may overdry, but put on a moisturizer afterward</li>
            <li> Gives a slightly dewy look without looking sweaty or shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a less harsher peel than the TCA or Glycolic  peel.</li>
            <li> Mom appreciates the combination of ingredients in this product to make her routine simpler and less time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> continue to purchase.ts in this product to make her routine simpler and less time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Previously gave it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed clearer skin as in less blemishes - not that I had acne before</li>
            <li> The wrinkles between my eyebrows on my forehead have become less noticeable.</li>
            <li> IVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND CAN NOTICE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY FACE</li>
            <li> My skin is seriously lacking in hydrating and nutrients and this serum brought it back to life!</li>
            <li> My skin looks radiant, lighter and with less wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Convinient packed in a dropper</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5-stars since it does what it says, but there is a slight smell to it from the rosehip oil which some may not care for.</li>
            <li> My comments are based upon comparison to the previous version which was not &amp;#34;Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t like writing reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for less than a week</li>
            <li> There was a slight burnung sensation when I applied it</li>
            <li> My dark spots are slightly fading,and my skin feels a little tighter.i will keep using the c serum</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried high end, expensive serums</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, there&#x27;s a hint of citrus but the sea buckthorn can be a bit overpowering first thing in the morning, the smell fades away as soon as the serum is dry.</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s been a cold, dry winter my skin isn&#x27;t chapped like it normally is this time of year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a little over a week now, but it has seriously worked wonders for my beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It immediately brightens my face, I have horrible dark under-eye circles and this works better then concealer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s what it should smell like as I&#x27;d expected a citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I read one review that said this is not a full dose of Vitamin C...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a very expensive, prescribed Vitamin C Serum in the past; this looks and feels the same, and I really appreciate the affordable price.</li>
            <li> Dries/absorbs quickly, little to no fragrance, been using less than 2 weeks so too soon to tell if it&#x27;s making a difference or not</li>
            <li> My face feels tight and refreshed after I use it as well.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll feel the skin on your face feel tight,  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel refreshed and tight while closing my pores.  </li>
            <li> #34;Sam, your skin is so tight and firm,&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel tight</li>
            <li> I use one drop for each side of my face and after I massage it in, if I pat my face it feels slightly sticky-- not smooth as I would hope.</li>
            <li> All drying and a few lines are much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night, with the addition at night of a hydroquinone cream, and the few dark spots I had from sun exposure are perceptibly lighter after just a few weeks.</li>
            <li> However I read a couple of journal articles that convinced me to at least give Vitamin C a try; one that linked vitamin C to procollagen production and a small study that found reduction in wrinkles and increased collagen production with 12 weeks of topical use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 year old college student who didn&#x27;t take much care of my skin due to a lot of partying, alcohol, bad sleeping habits and poor diet decisions.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using an eye liner brush ever since I saw my eyelid skin start to get a little crinkly</li>
            <li> No matter how little I use, this serum always leaves my face feeling sticky.</li>
            <li> This one has also a little bit of orange aroma which I like.</li>
            <li> The serum is a little thicker than others I have tried</li>
            <li> After applying it makes it does feel like my skin is a little tighter.  </li>
            <li> but the smell was a little off, still smells like grapefruit but almost a spoiled hint.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey.</li>
            <li> you have used other Vitamin C&#x27;s in the past, then you should notice the difference between InstaNatural&#x27;s and the others that are on the market or have been in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> over-all complexion is a little</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vitamin C serum does make my skin feel softer and maybe even a little bit plumper.  </li>
            <li> up review after using the product a little longer.</li>
            <li> Then, there were also products that produced little to no results at all.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, and while it looks a little...</li>
            <li> And VIOLA, found this little gem.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could say it has even made me a little fairer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m having less breakouts and my skin is staying very hydrated in the harsh, cold climate i&#x27;m exposed to.</li>
            <li> This really stinks because I was looking forward to using this product so much</li>
            <li> It seems to firm  and tone the skin a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now</li>
            <li> even if I use one after another is dried.</li>
            <li> As for me, I could see brightening results within a few days of use.</li>
            <li> The bottle and dropper are a bit messy</li>
            <li> I just used it on my neck because I have uneven skin tone there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste the product</li>
            <li> So I do know that if I keep using it everyday I&#x27;ll have the youthful look I&#x27;m seeking.</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding a serum that did not contain any silicone - while the silicone helps skin feel &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; after application, I always break-out after a few applications.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> serum itself is thin, semi opaque and yellow in color.</li>
            <li> I use witch hazel and cotton round if I do.  </li>
            <li> the breakout on my forehead went away within a few days and has not returned.</li>
            <li> Saw results within a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Few people already complimented me.</li>
            <li> Just try it for few days and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
            <li> Although the bottle indication said it can be used everyday, I prefer not to have my skin get used to it.</li>
            <li> Of course I also changed my skincare routine by washing face with green tea powder, honey and yogurd .</li>
            <li> issue: It was just too harsh for my skin.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> i felt that i dried my skin out leaving it drier</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin c serum for a few weeks now, it seems to be working, I have noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few nights now</li>
            <li> some discoloration and sun spots I have had on my face for a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars after I&#x27;ve used it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I just started using it can&#x27;t wait for the results in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Wait a few minutes</li>
            <li> I washed my face and dried it.</li>
            <li> After a few hesitant days of applying it in the morning, after I wash my face, I can now say: I like</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly - it&#x27;s not a moisturizer, but that works for me.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s taking care of the dark spots  or hyper pigmentation.  </li>
            <li> Just received this serum a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> It took my skin a few days to adjust to the oils.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and nothing.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin look worse over the last two months since buying.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> A few drops would be sufficient to cover your face, neck, and hand with the product.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of use</li>
            <li> After watching Dr. OZ on TV, I was looking for a serum with vitamin C for my uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for 74 year old skin, there don&#x27;t seem to be any miracles.</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD FOR A FEW DAYS</li>
            <li> can be so messy.  </li>
            <li> I stopped using it for few days.</li>
            <li> update in a few months after I&#x27;ve used it everyday.</li>
            <li> I was even thinking of giving it as a gift to a few friends.  </li>
            <li> so I can afford to purchase and use them everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this serum for a few weeks, and I&#x27;ve used it every night before bed.</li>
            <li> Even with sunscreen and a gardening hat my skin tone had become uneven.</li>
            <li> Which you combine it with the Vitamin C it provides maximum hydration to make the skin plump and firm while moisturizing the skin.</li>
            <li> I have used a few oils in my time, but I have not seen one that had a combination of ingredients like this serum does.</li>
            <li> I continue to use and post another review in a few months..</li>
            <li> and it wasn’t too heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li> I apply this in the am after toning and before moisturizing, giving it a few minutes to sink in.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for few weeks now</li>
            <li> It fixes dark spots, acne spots, uneven skin, acne...anything!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> Even though, I&#x27;ve just used it for a few days,  my skin becomes softer and brighter.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working - my skin is clearer and brighter after a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> In addition, after a few weeks of using the product I received another email from InstaNatural asking me what I thought of the product and how I was liking it.</li>
            <li> and she used it for few days.</li>
            <li> and some age spots and a few sun spots</li>
            <li> I am using everyday</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I noticed these sunspots a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> can destroy my skin</li>
            <li> I suggest waiting a few minutes after you wash your face to use this product.</li>
            <li> But there is no tingling if you wait just a few minutes after you cleanse your face.</li>
            <li> No, thank goodness, because that would confuse the grandkids, but I could probably carve off a few years and nobody would accuse me of lying without a license check</li>
            <li> everyone of my friends were asking about my secret just few days of starting to use the product !</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks now, but it has taken away the brown spots, made my face feel softer, and decreased some of the wrinkles  </li>
            <li> Although I had hoped for it not to irritate my skin as bad as other serums, I certainly didn&#x27;t expect no tingling at all.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is typical.  </li>
            <li> It has helped with acne, dull spots and rough spots!</li>
            <li> After quite a few expensive disappointments with major cosmetic firm products, I found this InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum for Face.  </li>
            <li> Not strongly.</li>
            <li> and p.m. does not sting and no strong smell.  </li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this product, I investigated almost every brand, and this product was as comparable to the very expensive brands you hear about on the radio, and in magazines, and more bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will stick with the old items I have used for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this serum religiously on my face, scars, 8 year old stretch marks, and have never been disappointed.</li>
            <li> There is a very slight &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; type odor</li>
            <li> but I noticed that my forehead started getting little bumps on them (they weren&#x27;t pimples or anything; not really sure what it was).</li>
            <li> The solution is slightly thick but is not at all oily and just a few drops massaged into the skin immediately causes a slight tingly sensation because it is so concentrated.</li>
            <li> I have used other skin brighteners in the past to combat dull skin, and they were 5 times the price of this one.  </li>
            <li> That said, I think my only real complaint is going to be when I get to the bottom of the botle.  </li>
            <li> Again, I have a hard time with products like this because if there are effects I suspect they are subtle and require long term use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot the past few months...</li>
            <li> and I think dark spots are slowly lightening</li>
            <li> I used to use it just on my face,however lately I have been using it all down my neck and chest.</li>
            <li> The consistency is thick, so it doesn&#x27;t run down your face while trying to apply.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You use so little of this product each time you shouldn&#x27;t be wary of the size, it should last for months.</li>
            <li> and I do feel that it has helped even out my skin tone and my face looks less dull.</li>
            <li> It just feels (and acts) like a poorly made product  Vitamin C serums are tricky as its hard to find one that properly stabilizes the vitamin for long-term use, this one is not that serum</li>
            <li> Had dark spots and a small scar which are disappearing!</li>
            <li> Noticeable results within a week of using and a little bit goes along way!</li>
            <li> and you just need a little bit!</li>
            <li> my skin feel tight and icky does not seem to do anything for me no change in skin age spot</li>
            <li> Tris serie app lise smonth and dose vive a little life to dull skin.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way - and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Within a few days my brown spots started to fade and after two weeks they are hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this serum.</li>
            <li> Was really shocked to see how much it decreases the appearance of scars-</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the past month and have been faithfully using this product since.</li>
            <li> that only produce questionable or no negligible results.  </li>
            <li> The number of pimples I usually get has reduced.</li>
            <li> I use a BB cream with SPF now as well so no more sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> Usually wash with soap and water, then slap some lotion on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least a few months now</li>
            <li> and I usually massage it over my face and neck area in circular motions.</li>
            <li> and I usually massage it over my face and neck area in circular motions.</li>
            <li> and I usually massage it over my face and neck area in circular motions.</li>
            <li> I have used the vitamon C and the seabuckthorn separately in the past without this happening</li>
            <li> Not sure benefits yet.</li>
            <li> Small bottle though, 1 month for 2 people.</li>
            <li> I figured I would give this a shot, as it had to be just as efficient as the expensive product, containing the same ingredients and all</li>
            <li> It was also difficult getting the last bit out of the bottle with the suction bulb.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a glass jar with a dropper, so I&#x27;m not sure how you use all the product without wasting a portion at the bottom.</li>
            <li> No more flaky</li>
            <li> It is in a small container with an eye dropper to dispense the product.</li>
            <li> usually I always break out with a zit or 2 before I start my period, but ever since using this I haven&#x27;t had that</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Obgagi-C Clarifying Serum (contains hydroquinone) and it made my skin darker.  </li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> I know that it usually takes longer than two weeks to see improvements.  </li>
            <li> I also found it quite soothing on the small patches of eczema</li>
            <li> Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> but that is a small price to pay for the results I have seen in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with the results of this Serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past, and notice some changes.</li>
            <li> I was not sure what this product was going to do</li>
            <li> I also tried it on my rosacea, and I&#x27;m not sure it did anything for me there.  </li>
            <li> I will usually know after one application if something is going to give me bumps and acne.</li>
            <li> I usually break out with everything</li>
            <li> I have done so in the past and would do so again if I feel an item does not meet standards</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet, but will continue using.  </li>
            <li> I usually wait a minute or 2 before I do the rest of my nightly routine.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Vitamin C serum in the past but it was oily and caused an irritation in my skin.</li>
            <li> I can see small lines from my face disappear.</li>
            <li> I usually use your emu oil for that matter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my fifties, and this helps with small wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It was probably not able to improve without the nutrients it was lacking.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if I have a glow but the simpleness of the product is something to appreciate.</li>
            <li> I usually put in on at night before bed after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> Since I have started using this, no more small blemishes, no more monthly pimple.</li>
            <li> After Started using this product, I got many pimples and my skin looked horrible.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li> I follow it with my usual moisturizer</li>
            <li> I was devastated when I noticed I had two small sun spots on the side of my face</li>
            <li> And with a 100% guarantee or money back, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m not sure what all the hype is about this product.  </li>
            <li> I did have some small bumps on my skin, but that just let me know the product works.</li>
            <li> I have purchased vitamin c products in the past</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this purchase because while it may contain other helpful ingredients I purchased this for the Vit C</li>
            <li> see my dark sun spots slowly diminishing!</li>
            <li> I had problems with using a dropper rather than a pump, I think I knocked the vanity unit with the dropper too hard – as the end was broken slightly after a few days.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I can claim miracles, but that would be silly with any single product, I believe, although we&#x27;d all like to find a $20 miracle..........</li>
            <li> It is difficult to review a product like this without using it over a long period of time.  </li>
            <li> Ordering a single bottle is expensive, so I ordered 4 1-oz serum bottles, the shipping was over $25.  </li>
            <li> I had a brown spot under my eye that was hard to cover with concealer, and this got rid of it in about a month.  </li>
            <li> It is a hard decision to make on which anti aging products to use.</li>
            <li> but since I have problem skin its hard to tell.</li>
            <li> I called my husband and asked him to take a hard look at my face, asking, &amp;#34;Do</li>
            <li> I do not have hardly any wrinkles at all</li>
            <li> It made it hard to use the dropper.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of pollutants where I often get fairly dull skin but this formula is helping brighten me up.</li>
            <li> so it was hard to see additional improvements</li>
            <li> It makes zero sense to work hard on improving your skin without protecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a dull orange color -</li>
            <li> I can hardly believe it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum and the hylauronic acid serum--this can be a little irritating alone but works well with the acid serum.</li>
            <li> My skin is a little thin</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t call it watery - its a little thin which makes it easier to apply and as for the color...</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried because it is so thin (I&#x27;m used the thick stuff.)</li>
            <li> was wary about it at first because my skin usually reacts badly to oil</li>
            <li> At least this serum does for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very skeptical of skin care products&#x27; efficacy and am disappointed by many things</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who was looking for a serum as I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> You have to at least try it out for yourself</li>
            <li> Smells like aloe, feels like aloe just not a nice texture under moisturizer and make-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d update if I see at least some results.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m afraid (but still open to the possibility).  </li>
            <li> at least 30 days before I gave this review</li>
            <li> I have spent tons of money on expensive products, but there isn&#x27;t a need to any longer.</li>
            <li> (Step 2) and it blends in nicely, no sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> I also use a lot of glycolic acid products and none of them have interacted in a negative way.</li>
            <li> It is thick, which I like, so</li>
            <li> : This is a thick liquid the color of</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results after 2weeks but slowly u start to notice ur skin looking brighter and a glow.</li>
            <li> It is a thick serum</li>
            <li> The serum looks and smells like thick orange juice.  </li>
            <li> I discontinued the serum and the blotches are slowly fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for about 2 1/2 weeks now (after my toner, but before my moisturizer) and have noticed that my skin tone is slowly evening out.</li>
            <li> I borghi Rosehip bifore and it eas thick and sticky for application.</li>
            <li> It is orange in color and a thick gel consistency.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick serum, so</li>
            <li> Thick consistency</li>
            <li> It seemed to help my skin a little, though it wasn&#x27;t a dramatic change.  </li>
            <li> With the money back guarantee, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;expiration date&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean anything on a product like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other vitamin c creams and they always tend to tingle/burn and cause flaky skin for me, not to mention expensive.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a weird smell like other reviewers have said</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this was followed by pretty bad breakouts on my cheeks, chin, and forehead.</li>
            <li> I was so annoyed when I first saw the solution and knew in my gut that this was a crap product</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s difficult to find products that help hydrate my skin while fading dark spots.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the ingredients contained the same as a name-brand, but very expensive product that I use.  </li>
            <li> I craft and sell skincare products (on a very small scale...</li>
            <li> This was a bit less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Even after I stopped using the product the bumps were nearly impossible to remove, I ended up having to get a facial to have them extracted.</li>
            <li> I got this in the mail today and was even scared to use it since the highest percentage of vitamin C I have used has been 18% and it seriously irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously pissed.</li>
            <li> This was really orange like it had been sitting for a while or a bad batch!  </li>
            <li> I used other serums and this one was the worst as far as the residue was concerned.</li>
            <li> It works, this product has brought youth back to my badly dehydrated skin.</li>
            <li> I can say that I have not experienced any negative reactions to the ingredients.  </li>
            <li> Now add sun exposure, wind, extreme heat or cold and the skin aging process just enters warp speed.</li>
            <li> I have another extremely expensive natural anti aging serum and it dries my skin out so badly.</li>
            <li> So if you tried it in the past and it smelled awful, write them and they will send you the new and improved product to try.</li>
            <li> So now I can only choose to use one of them in the morning or at night :(</li>
            <li> I am very careful and do research on products I buy, because I have been so disappointed in products I&#x27;ve ordered in past.</li>
            <li> I have very dull and oily skin</li>
            <li> have ALWAYS always had dreadful dark circles and they while not have gone totally away</li>
            <li> It is very thick going on</li>
            <li> I am anxious to have my mom and sister try this product!!</li>
            <li> I am a disappointed that the Serum&#x27;s consistency is very watery which makes the serum difficult to get from dropper - hand - and on the face!</li>
            <li> I have had no issues with it irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> I put on a thin layer on my face and neck, pat</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately a month</li>
            <li> the serum delivers your tired complexion</li>
            <li> If you are not completely happy with your purchase, please contact InstaNatural for a refund – no questions</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not making my skin any worse, does not cause breakouts, but I have not yet seen a difference in my sun spots/hyperpigmentation.  </li>
            <li> In fact it made my already acne prone skin worse.</li>
            <li> I have been using both twice a day for approximately a week.</li>
            <li> but it still is non irritating and seems to be calming.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my daughter who is a surgical nurse and her face gets broken out from the surgical mask - and it took care of her breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for approximately two weeks.</li>
            <li> They seem to stand behind their products.</li>
            <li> Indian women know this beauty secret.</li>
            <li> A bit confused by everyones glowing reviews of this product.</li>
            <li> I respect companies that truly stand behind their products, and this company does just that.  </li>
            <li> This serum is on the thin side and</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m using this to fix my broken capillaries</li>
            <li> Below my chin I have a faint line that has been there since my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Below my chin I have a faint line that has been there since my late 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> , I will not make false claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new formula and packaging is horrible.</li>
            <li> Been using for abt a wk, 2 times a day, I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell anyone about any dramatic results.</li>
            <li> My age spots are  sadly still there, but they have not gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> My age spots are  sadly still there, but they have not gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> My age spots are  sadly still there, but they have not gotten any worse.</li>
            <li> This is by far the worst serum I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately,  I had a poor reaction to this and broke out.</li>
            <li> With ingredients like Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Rosehip Oil, Argan Oil, Jojoba oil, and Vitamin E, I knew I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> They can get quite expensive and then not work for your skin at all.</li>
            <li> It has all the ingredients in it that all the expensive brands have</li>
            <li> That is why they are sometimes three times as expensive as creams, but that&#x27;s also because they work faster and penetrate deeper.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I did not like the smell</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this broke me out.</li>
            <li> After using this for a week, I just randomly got a bunch of rashes and pimples and my face has NEVER done this.</li>
            <li> spending your money on expensive skincare lines.</li>
            <li> Weird smell, sorta like rotten oranges.</li>
            <li> I think I thought it smelled weird when I bought it, but I either got used to it or it went away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> If it smells rancid or weird, it should also be thrown away.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say it did not work for me.</li>
            <li> SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY IF IT SUITS ME OR NOT.  </li>
            <li> The products I used that delivered results were expensive and contained a lot of harmful ingredients.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m generally skeptical of skin serums and treatments, and while I like natural/herbal treatments I always take their claims with a grain of salt.</li>
            <li> When I began using it, I was skeptical about what difference I would notice, but within a week, my skin was getting clearer.</li>
            <li> and it does not deliver, I will not be repurchasing and if a refund wasn&#x27;t so complicated</li>
            <li> It has a faint orange fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I am no longer buying expensive moisturizers at the store.</li>
            <li> (sorry.)  </li>
            <li> It was unfortunate that the product formula was changed and no warning was given on their Amazon customers.   </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the fake reviews fool you.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> no scent--or a strange scent--not awful.  </li>
            <li> The one I had used previously worked but smelled awful.  </li>
            <li> I desperately wanted to find products that did not have a ton of garbage listed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Unlike some of the others that I have tried before that leave my face feeling sticky, dirty and oily</li>
            <li> What a waste of money, it smells horrible too.  </li>
            <li> It does not have any perfumes or artificial scented additives in it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to try their products.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve gotten yourself a useless serum my friends!</li>
            <li> ,I am addicted now,I even keep it in my purse!!</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a divine scent and it glides on my skin with no burning or stinging or any unpleasant after effects.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have even noticed that I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using which is very unlikely for me.</li>
            <li> I would compare it to any of the Very expensive brands out there.</li>
            <li> Some serums are very expensive and I cannot afford to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you notice, it is just about impossible to tell that I have the serum in the dropper.</li>
            <li> My bruising isn&#x27;t nearly as bad.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t keep the bottle though - BUT not because it&#x27;s a bad product, but because my mom ended up liking what it was doing for her skin as well</li>
            <li> To me, my skin is bad.</li>
            <li> then I started to break out so bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this broke me out SO bad.</li>
            <li> (I was really shocked by this one...</li>
            <li> Now I can go without makeup and people aren&#x27;t asking me if I am sick.</li>
            <li> I never knew this vitamin C serum can do miracles, give it a shot you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> disappointed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it made my face break out terribly!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed. :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used vitamin C for years and am extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have to stop using it :(</li>
            <li> I am seriously disappointed.</li>
            <li> but unfortunately my skin broke out terribly after 2 uses.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I hate plastic.  </li>
            <li> Hate the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed to see it contained witch hazel! :(</li>
            <li> Well, that was until I found this bad boy!</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed in any of their products!</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product</li>
            <li> The worst part about it is how oily it is.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have terrible skin to begin with.</li>
            <li> What a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> Do the research, you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!!!</li>
            <li> The price of this is also insane 14.95?</li>
            <li> This product made my skin brake out horribly.</li>
            <li> It has an awful sulphur smell that I have NEVER smelled in any serum before.</li>
            <li> This worsened my blackheads and smells horrible, it also does not even moisturize at all.  </li>
            <li> Gave me a really bad rash!!!!!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After using this serum, my skin appeared much brighter. The only reason I didn&#x27;t get it 5 stars is because it made me break out. If my skin wasn&#x27;t sensitive to it, it is a great serum and it definitely makes a big difference in your complexion!</li>
            <li> Satisfactory quality and price.</li>
            <li> Great product and great orange, citrus smell.  Eye dropper allows you to get the perfect amount.  The product dries quickly and it is recommended that you also use a moisturizer to get the maximum benefit of the product. I like this product so much I am on my second bottle.  I have VERY sensitive skin and nearly everything makes me break out but I have had no problems with this product.  Customer service was exceptional too.  I wrote to them and they immediately replied with the information that I needed.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-30s and have combination/dry skin that is extremely sensitive. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for three weeks and I&#x27;m so impressed with the change in my skin. Specifically, my forehead lines softened immediately, and my cheeks are so much smoother and even textured. This serum soothes my super-sensitive skin. I have never reviewed a product on Amazon before, but this serum warrants a glowing review. I will definitely purchase this again!</li>
            <li> I really love this serum!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Have only been using this item a little under three weeks , so far it goes on smooth and drys quickly with no oder.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great product for my very sensitive skin...it&#x27;s a keeper</li>
            <li> I ve been use it for 2 weeks only at night time and my skin  looks better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the bottle/batch I received, but this leaves an orange cast on my face! I&#x27;m not using a lot and am following the instructions exactly. Is this normal?</li>
            <li> Really nice consistency and pleasant smell. It&amp;#34;s too soon to tell if it is doing anything much, but at least it isn&#x27;t doing any harm!</li>
            <li> Great product.. so gentle on sensitive skin. Safe ingredients , great texture. Affordable price and working great</li>
            <li> InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum has a nice feel, slightly tingly, as it dries on my skin. It seems to firm  and tone the skin a bit. At my age, expectations weren&#x27;t high, but I think it does make my skin a little more supple--and that&#x27;s a good thing. I&#x27;ve been using it a few weeks now and I like it.</li>
            <li> I was happy to try out the Vitamin C Serum. I love this product! I LOVE the results I have experienced. I love feeling how silky my face feels and I love how much smaller my pores have been getting. The Vitamin C Serum is simple to apply and only takes about a minute. The consistency of the serum makes it easier than other brands to apply in an even layer to your face. Overall, my skin feels and looks better, brighter, and more youthful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Best product for the price. Excellent delivery .Will keep a supply for sure. Softens skin nicely.</li>
            <li> This serum has cleared my face so much since I started using it. I also use the Rosehip oil moisturizer from InstaNatural and that combo along with this serum are. Ow my holy grail face products! My scars from years of acne are now gone. Thank you Instanatural! You have a customer for life! Great miraculous face product ! Highly highly highly recommend this company?</li>
            <li> Mmm.Mmm. Smells yummy. Absorb quickly. I like it. Nice if kept in fridge. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I just love this stuff! I use it twice a day and an extra dab under my eyes.</li>
            <li> the vitamin c serm works ive been useing it for 2 weeks now and see the diffence on my fine lines under my eyes i use it in the morring and before bed i like it and will order it again</li>
            <li> In my opinion, InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum is as good, or better, than the expensive serums.&lt;br /&gt;It has a divine scent and it glides on my skin with no burning or stinging or any unpleasant after effects.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only been using it for a short time and I&#x27;ve already noticed some minor brown spots fading. It is so refreshing to finally find a Vitamin C serum which is a pleasure to use and smell and does not sting like some of the other brands. The addition of Sea Buckthorn Oil makes it unique. I&#x27;ve tried many brands over the years and this one, by far, is my favorite. I will continue to reorder InstaNatural&#x27;s serum and will look into their other products as well. Oh, and the customer service is second to none. The owner actually reached out to me via e-mail several times to follow up and answer any questions. Doesn&#x27;t get any better than that!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for several weeks and am so amazed at what wonderful results I have experienced.  The brown spots on my face have practically disappeared.  They are so light you can hardly see them.  It has also given my face softness and brought a youthful glow to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone’s skin is different and results may vary, but I have found this product to be one of the best treatments for your face. This serum is the basis for my daily regimen and wouldn’t go without it.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum is so lovely! It makes my skin feel like it did 10 years ago. I use it in the morning prior to using my moisturizer. The serum has a nice texture that&#x27;s not too heavy. I am so happy to have received it for review - I&#x27;m enjoying it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much , but have to admit that i absolutely LOVED the previous formula, (just Vitamin C 20%) little more then this one, too bad its not available anymore.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to review a product like this without using it over a long period of time.  I have been using it morning and night after washing, and follow it with moisturizer.  I was using about 8 drops per application, but noticed I was going through it quickly and now only use 4 drops.  Product has a pleasant citris smell, and applies easily.  I have had no issues with it irritating my skin.  It is light and absorbs quickly.  Benefits??? Again, I have a hard time with products like this because if there are effects I suspect they are subtle and require long term use.  Would I buy I buy it again- yes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t change anything - just another &amp;#34;serum&amp;#34; with ingredients that have no documented source or proven effectiveness. It was pleasant on my skin and everything about the product was good, but it just didn&#x27;t make a difference after diligent use.</li>
            <li> So far so good I haven&#x27;t noticed any thing drastic so far.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and I have seen a big difference in my skin.  It feels light on my face and doesn&#x27;t break me out!</li>
            <li> Love this Vit C serum!  It brightens my skin and makes my face feel great!</li>
            <li> I received this as part of an advertorial. I received this with the facial toner I previously reviewed. It had a love scent, and bright ,vibrant color, but like the toner, after application, it took a little long to dry, and left a stickiness behind, that made my face feel gross and weighted down. It will help with trapping moisture for the winter though, which is a bonus. If you have use something similar to this before you will enjoy this product. If it is your first time, it will be a new experience all around.</li>
            <li> I love it!  already ordering my second bottle, my skin is so much more balanced now with daily use of this serum.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Love. It.i have found something i feel i will use for a long time. It is not expensive.i have been using defferent products,fourteen days trial and at the end of the trial eighty nine dollars is being detucted. From my checking account,nevertheless i am seeing results. Alreadyfrom this product.thank. you amazon.</li>
            <li> I really love the results. Smoother,even and less puffy around eyes. Face seems tighter yet moisturized.</li>
            <li> By far the most reliable product I have ever used. I never knew this vitamin C serum can do miracles, give it a shot you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving all the the products in this line a try... So far I am extremely happy.... It&#x27;s the same quality product as $150 bottle items for a tenth of the price... I will continue too purchase</li>
            <li> I like this .. it smells like orange juice looks like it too :)</li>
            <li> Love the smell and feels and how fast it was being absorbed by my skin. However, I can&#x27;t use this thing along with the InstaNatural Eye Gel... some how these 2 has some extreme chemical reaction somehow... feels burn... even if I use one after another is dried. So now I can only choose to use one of them in the morning or at night :( It is almost perfect though. Love it so far, does pumped up my skin and keep it hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have product because it has improved my skin significantly! I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin and have used many products so far in my life. So, I was losing hope on finding a product that would work for me. Well, that was until I found this bad boy! I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Love this! My favorite skin care product!</li>
            <li> This product works really well. It quickly dries and leaves my skim moisturized. I found it to be most effective with a derma roller.</li>
            <li> I have used many vitamin c products, this has been my favorite. It really has seemed to speed healing of any blemishes.</li>
            <li> love love it&lt;br /&gt;highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> Vitamin &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; is a God send. My face was starting droop and not look as tight. It really concerned me. I have taken my time and thoroughly reviewed this product. Although it takes some time to see a difference...you will see one. It&#x27;s not a overnight process. I would recommend this to tighten you face and feel better about who you are. You deserve to lo</li>
            <li> my wife has used it. she like it.</li>
            <li> Great product ! I am so happy to find a great product at such a reasonable price, works beautifully.</li>
            <li> This product really works. Lines becomes less visible and skin has a natural glow.</li>
            <li> Love it, face feels amazing.</li>
            <li> At nearly $17 a bottle this bottle lasted me just under 3 weeks with daily and sometimes twice a day use.  It would have gotten five stars from me if they either provided a bigger bottle of product for the price or lower their price point to $12.  I do love the way it smells and feels.  The droplet it comes with doesn&#x27;t fill up much. I have to use it twice to cover my face.  It tightens up my skin immediately after use.  I haven&#x27;t seen any difference in lightening my dark spots yet but I&#x27;m hopeful as their instructions say it takes about 28 days for skin to turn over for you to see a difference and I have another week to go.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Have a good smell. I use this product along with derm roller and haven&#x27;t seen significant result yet. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it is a little sticky in my face and gets on my pillow easy.</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin, nice scent and nice addition to the retinol serum!</li>
            <li> I bought this serum for it&#x27;s antioxidants, and trust that it&#x27;s adding another of layer of protection from free radicals &amp; sun damage. I put it on with hyaluronic acid serum under my dog 30 moisturizer. Love the consistency and slight citrus smell. Feels sort of thick right out of the bottle, but absorbs quickly. I&#x27;ll definitely re order.</li>
            <li> Can I tell you how many different products I&#x27;ve tried over the years??? I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and have actively cared for my skin since age 14 (thanks Mom for getting me started). Just purchased my 2nd bottle of this serum. As someone who makes my own creams and cosmetics I was impressed by the ingredients in this serum. However, I was floored by the change in my skin almost immediately. I applied the serum to a moist face, neck and décolletage (after cleansing) in the morning and went on with my day. Almost immediately I felt my skin tightening up when I looked in the mirror my skin appeared smooth. After using product now for three months I can say that discolorations in my skin have improved, the skin tightening continues and I am completely hooked. As I said I make most of my products, but this one I won&#x27;t try to replicate. The ingredients such as Sea Buckthorn oil, Rose HIp Seed Oil, Ferulic Acid, Carrot Seed Oil, Apricot, Kernel Oil, etc . are all well known as providing anti-aging benefits, antioxidant benefits, and skin rejuvenation. Of all the THOUSANDS of dollars I&#x27;ve spent on dept store and drug store products, this ranks up there as one of the few products I&#x27;ve found that really works. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about a month now. As for me, I could see brightening results within a few days of use. Now with about a month&#x27;s use Ive notice fine lines are gradually diminishing. Most times, I use along with organic coconut oil and its also a great base coat to wear underneath makeup.</li>
            <li> Experienced breakouts from using this product, but excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> Feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! I love it!</li>
            <li> I was using a different c serum by ncn which cost more and I have also tried devita c and philosophy c powder. I like this one the best and have already bought more. My skin is very sensitive and many products cause severe dermatitis but not this. I also use the retinol cream and anti aging cream. I like them all and hope to try more of this line. I do not use products tested on animals and this company does not. Also made in the USA huge plus ****</li>
            <li> using this every day and night with my aloe moisturizer. I feel like my skin has gotten a lot more clear and tight - vitamin c is the way to go. hoping it would clean up some scaring but i don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s happening (some acne from yeeeaaarss ago)</li>
            <li> I really love this and feel it&#x27;s a great addition to my skincare routine! You can feel it tightening your skin but not too much!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle. This stuff really seems to help combat aging. My skin is clearer, brighter, and firmer. I also use it on my neck and chest and the backs of my hands. The bottle and dropper are a bit messy but overall I love this stuff. It is the best vitamin C serum I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is fantastic. This Company is awesome and stand behind their product 100%. Very quick and friendly responses to my questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Vitamin C Serum for about a month and have ordered my second bottle so I don&#x27;t run out. It absorbs quickly and smells great. I have noticed that the brown spots on my face and neck are fading. Skin tone seems to be a lot better. Being all natural, whats not to love?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this Serum and sure you will love it also.</li>
            <li> The serum first of all smells amazing. It&#x27;s light weight on the skin and not a greasy serum. It absorbs quickly into the skin and instantly hydrates skin. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to notice what long term effects will be. But so far I am very happy with the product and the customer service of this company.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and excellent customer service!  The serum is almost creamy; goes on well. For a high concentration, the chemical balance seems very good as there is no stinging or reddening and my skin feels smoother and a bit brighter/clearer. I&#x27;m a firm believer in the use of Vitamin C as a facial regime and I&#x27;ve used many more expensive Vit C brands, from Obagi to Ole&#x27; Henriksen: those products have nothing over InstaNatural - there are excellent skin nutrients included and I&#x27;d highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> I received a coupon for this product so I could review it. This is the second time I am leaving a review for this. If this one is taken down I am not doing another one. I did want to update my first review anyway, which is how I noticed it was removed. This serum looks and smells like orange juice from concentrate. It does brighten skin but it also can make acne-prone skin break out. I just used it on my neck because I have uneven skin tone there. It is working to even my tone out there. My neck does feel smoother from using it. My mother has used it as well and she loves it. She never had a pimple a day in her life (that&#x27;s what she tells me I never saw one on her) so she has never had problems with this product. So if you do not have acne-prone skin this is one you should consider. I&#x27;ve switched back to another Vitamin C serum for now.</li>
            <li> Been looking for a good natural vitamin C serum and I found it with instaNatural. It&#x27;s great and helps my skin in so many ways, hydrates, improves my dark spots helps with fine lines, it has a nice light smell to it and my skin drinks it up and feels really soft and moisturized after. I have tried a lot of Vitamin serums and this one is the best, it&#x27;s just perfect in every way and has wonderful ingredients in it. This is one of the best things you could put on your skin. So happy I was given this to try for a small fee, will defineatly buy it again.</li>
            <li> I started to use Vit C serum together with my regular moisturizer. Leaves my skin soft.. I&#x27;m hoping that it will help even out my complexion...didn&#x27;t see any improvement  yet but maybe I haven&#x27;t been using it for long enough.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I purchased this in the past month and have been faithfully using this product since. It is fabulous. It has an intereting balance of tightening, smoothing and hydrating. There are oils in the formula, so your face feels supple. I just love it. I use it in the morning and at night. My skin has a new glow. My husband noticed without being told.</li>
            <li> This vitamin nourishes my skin and really moisturizes. A little goes a long way! My skin looks more supple after a week of use!</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it as a moisturizer as my face produces so much oil! As of now, I&#x27;ve seen a significant difference in my face. I have less touch ups throughout the day. I also love how this serum soaks into my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used other Vitamin C Serums, but this one works wonderfully! Visible difference within one week!</li>
            <li> Ok, so let me start off by saying I am very meticulous in researching a product and it&#x27;s company. After some research on InstaNatural and their Vitamin C Serum, I concluded that it was in the clear, and let me tell you, I am so glad I did that. The product is wonderful and so are it&#x27;s ingredients. Their customer service is also fantastic. I have thoroughly enjoyed the product for almost two months and I will list my experiences with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, I looked at the ingredients of the product and made sure that they were there for the correct reasons. With ingredients like Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Rosehip Oil, Argan Oil, Jojoba oil, and Vitamin E, I knew I couldn&#x27;t go wrong. Each of those ingredients are hard to find in a product by themselves, much less all combined, so you know you are getting top quality. The texture is in between thick and watery, so in order words, just right. The smell is great and citrus like. It&#x27;s also convenient to use because of the dropper. The effects are the best part and basically your skin will become extremely soft and plump. This is not a one time thing, as I noticed that over continued use, my skin has become much more soft than before. It works for really oily skin too, which I have. Overall, the product has proved it&#x27;s worth and I am very satisfied. I&#x27;m in the process of ordering more and am considering purchasing their other products too.</li>
            <li> Great product!!! Skin is noticeably brighter, I shared it with my daughter and she too loved it!</li>
            <li> Love it only after 3 days! Very lightweight, skin feels tighter and more radiant. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> Liked it, but purchased another brand when it was done, just to try something else.  It felt good on the skin, and is odorless. I have not seen any particular improvement in my skin&#x27;s discoloration or texture, but this may require extended use.</li>
            <li> I am 47 and it worked great to make my skin look and feel  younger and I feel great!</li>
            <li> I had been looking specifically for a serum that would include rosehip oil, as I will not use rosehip alone due to the smell. My skin is often red, and prone to breakouts, while also being dry. I am 25 and have tried various preventative aging products, but because my skin is so sensitive they tend to not pan out. I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month now, and as of about a week ago I can say I see consistent change. Of course when I first used it there were immediate results, but those tend to go away. But for the past week I have not seen a blemish, and my skin is very smooth to the touch. I have also been told by my coworkers that I look glow-y. The serum is an orange color, and smells citrus-y, which should not be unexpected. It&#x27;s very pleasant. The instruction say to use twice per day, but I prefer to use it just at night, and use  an H2O hydrator during the day. There is really nothing negative to say about this product; it is well priced and effective, at least for my needs. I will definitely continue purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Vitamin C serum for a couple months twice a day and liked the skin brightening results. Vitamin C helps to boost collagen production which in turn helps diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and even sun or age spots. It even helps to diminish the appearance of pores. InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C serum smells amazing and absorbs really quickly on skin. My favorite part is that it also contains Hyaluronic Acid to help moisturize the skin, very useful in the winter! Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I liked this serum a great deal. It was really hydrating from the first time of use and continued to be with continue use. My skin looked more vibrant with the use of the Vitamin C Serum. It is a product I would recommend for all individuals.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Makes my skin feel and look great. Have been using hyaluronic acid for quite some time but it&#x27;s even better in this formulation. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more of this. I&#x27;m almost 65 and it&#x27;s difficult to find products that help hydrate my skin while fading dark spots.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is one of the best anti-aging, natural things you can use. I use it in addition to anti-aging moisturizers on my face daily. Recently I experienced below freezing temperatures and the skin on my hands cracked. I used a couple of drops of the VC serum before applying lotion and my skin is less irritated and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product for about a week so I am not in a position to report its effectiveness.  I can say that I have not experienced any negative reactions to the ingredients.  I have used numerous vitamin c serum products and this is the first with the strong fruity scent and unappealing yellow/orange color. I intend to finish the bottle and will update this posting at that time.</li>
            <li> Im really liking this serum.  After the second day, I started noticing small changes and 2 weeks later. The one thing I&#x27;d like to add would be some kind of Retinol, but this serum doesn&#x27;t seem to need any. I still am still very pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> This is a really nice serum with a great citrus scent. I think my skin looks smoother and clearer since I&#x27;ve been using it. It seems to plump my skin so that wrinkles are less noticeable. The dropper makes it easy to apply and it absorbs quickly. I will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Feels nice not greasy. I often have problems with moisturizer on my face making me break out and this did not. Works well under make up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews, but this product is amazing. I have sensitive skin, so I am only using every three (3) days to increase my tolerance. However, since starting, my skin, which is acne-prone, has never looked so great! Not only has this cleared up all of my blemishes, but I have a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; that I am loving! The texture and smell are really nice too...nothing too offensive. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> great product!  I love vitamin C but all the other products in this one has really made a difference.  My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the retinol serum thus far.  I don&#x27;t have any&lt;br /&gt;of the usual issues often associated with retinol, such as redness, flaking&lt;br /&gt;and irritated skin.  I am also using the vitamin c serum with ferrulic acid&lt;br /&gt;as well, and am pleased with it too.  I am noticing an improvement in the&lt;br /&gt;eveness of my complexion as well as the overall tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use these products in the future since they are the&lt;br /&gt;first product I have used where I have actually been able to notice a&lt;br /&gt;change.  And I LOVE the pricepoint!  I won&#x27;t be wasting my money on other&lt;br /&gt;products that only produce questionable or no negligible results.  Thank&lt;br /&gt;you!!</li>
            <li> Fell in love with my first application:  My skin feels luxurious, soft, supple. I even used it on my hands.  I love the smell and the way my skin looks.  I will update later to advise on my experience and if it is has made a difference in my dryness, fine lines, age spots, and pore size.</li>
            <li> Best cleanser ever!!!</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!  I have tried every brand out there, La Prarie to Perricone, to Philosophy, etc....this gets rid of any brown spots on your face, and the top of your hands.  It is moisturizing and sinks right in.  I had a brown spot under my eye that was hard to cover with concealer, and this got rid of it in about a month.  I have been using this product that long, and am buying two more as we speak.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it really works for brown spots in my face</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;This is amazing stuff, I read about it on a YOU Tube video on aging skin care, and what a find. this was a great price and it came quickly.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice daily and I am seeing wonderful results.  I didn&#x27;t expect to see a major change because I had been using a vitamin C product for many years just a different brand, but this brand and mixture has made my face glow and reduced wrinkle appearance dramatically.  It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> I made sure to follow the directions closely, one of them being to use a moisturizer afterwards. I used the Vitamin C Moisturizer after the serum twice a day for about  5 days when I noticed I was getting a lot of white heads. My skin is very oily and I think it was just an overload of products on my face. But have no fear! I love using it at night after washing off my face. I put on a thin layer on my face and neck, pat it dry and I am good to go. No need to moisturize afterwards because the serum does the job. If you have unruly skin make sure to test patch. Results that I have noticed over several weeks: my skin feels and looks much healthier. It is also less acne prone, which I love. I am very happy with this product :)    Product provided for free for testing purposes (thank you Instanatural!)</li>
            <li> this feels like im using frozen concentrated oj from the can on my face.goes on very sticky or atleast this bottle did.tried using it everyday with another product over it.made my skin feel tight and icky does not seem to do anything for me no change in skin age spot</li>
            <li> No difference in my skin. It didn&#x27;t feel smoother or look clearer and it didn&#x27;t cause any break outs or problems. Either way, I&#x27;m not sure how effective vitamins are sitting on the skin as opposed to ingesting them and circulating through your system. Since I don&#x27;t see any real signs of anything, I would have no reason to purchase another bottle. I&#x27;m sure it works well on others, just not me.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to notice a difference around my eyes, but nothing. I have been using for almost a month now. Also, it&#x27;s very sticky feeling and leaves my face feeling tight after applied. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> This serum smells great and feels good on my skin. I like the ingredients list also. Since I&#x27;m older, I&#x27;m just trying to prevent the decay from accelerating!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the serum!  Thank you for the great service!</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s pretty good but only been using it. a little over couple of weeks, will know more down the road</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product, and it arrived very quickly in nice packaging. The serum is a good consistency, not too runny, and has a light citrus smell, which I liked. I could feel a very slight tingling when I first started using it, which told me it was working.. I like that it has hyaluronic acid in it to help keep moisture in my skin. Using this serum, along with the Insta-Natural Vitamin C Cream, has made my skin look more vibrant &amp; healthy looking, and with long-term use should only get better. I would purchase again. (Product provided for free for testing purposes)</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised to see this serum is tinted orange and smells like an orange.  Although it has a pleasing scent, I won&#x27;t be able to tell if it has gone bad.  I have tried 3 other company&#x27;s serums so far.  All were clear or clear/cloudy in color--no scent--or a strange scent--not awful.  Because of the clear color, I could see if the serum was turning even the slightest shade of yellow, and I would know to throw it out and start over.  I have fell in love with Instanaturals oils, but I doubt I will buy their vitamin C serum due to the above.  I was hoping that this would be my last stop in my quest for the best vitamin c serum.  I will be back for their other products-just not this one.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say if it is any different from the other 3 I have tried-the color and scent are enough to throw me off even if I did get better results.  I&#x27;m just the type of person who needs to know if something has expired in it&#x27;s usefulness.</li>
            <li> I really like the glow of my face since I&#x27;ve been using this product. Also my pores seem to vanish. As a 40+ year old woman, this is important to me. Thanks for this product.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Love the product!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. My skin appears to be much smoother. It is easy to apply and it works as expected. Great poduct!</li>
            <li> This stuff is insanely awesome! It is changing my skin and my life!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I was paying much more for a small vial of the same percentage of vitamin c before I discovered this on Amazon.  And it&#x27;s also loaded with other good stuff like hyaluronic acid that are recommended for great skin.  What really sets this apart from other serums is that it is not thin and runny, nor does it feel sticky after applied.  This is thicker, smells great, and dries quickly so I don&#x27;t have to wait long to moisturize and put on my makeup.  I have been using this product twice daily for about 3 months now and I honestly do believe that my face feels firmer and has better tone.  I just ordered another bottle and I will continue to buy this for as long as they keep making it!</li>
            <li> I like this product, it helps with hydration, texture, and brightening skin pigmentation. Yet I don&#x27;t see a great difference in using this in place of the Vitamin C moisturizer or with it (at least not yet). Been using this for 3 wk ~ I will have to update this review in a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m on the fence, don&#x27;t know if I will (re)purchase. I didn&#x27;t find it to do anything super noticeable on my skin, the smell is not my favourite (citrus) -yet it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. The packaging is not my favourite, wish all serum came in pump bottles. (Last time I accidentally spilled some when it tipped over). If this were available in liquid form (toner/spray bottle, etc) with the same ingredients, I would be more likely (re)purchase this.    *Product provided for free for testing purposes*</li>
            <li> This smells heavenly, goes on smoothly, and immediately starts soaking in. I have very sensitive skin (as in VERY), and it hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin in the slightest. I enjoy using it morning and night under a second moisturizer by InstaNatural. Great brand!</li>
            <li> I finally jumped the bandwagon of Vitamin C serum users and I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on my last year of my &amp;#34;early thirties&amp;#34; so I thought I might as well get serious, somewhat, with my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;I did a bit of research and discovered this serum.&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt smoother after the first three days of using it. However the biggest surprise for me was how the skin on my eyelids visibly tightened up. I started using an eye liner brush ever since I saw my eyelid skin start to get a little crinkly at.&lt;br /&gt;So when I received my bottle I put a tiny dot on and around each eyelid as well.&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold, my eyelids weren&#x27;t crinkling!&lt;br /&gt;Totally totally recommend this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately a month I don&#x27;t really see a change in my complexion..  I&#x27;ll continue to use until product is completely used to allow time to see if it will make a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of vitamin c products, and this one is just as good as the very high priced ones. It softened my winter skin instantly, and the moistureade it feel firmer. One advantage is that for a serum it isn&#x27;t drippy. I rush through beauty routines and I&#x27;ve dripped liquids on clothes. Not this product. I might just break free from &amp;#34;glamour&amp;#34; packaging.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great I noticed a difference in just 3 days.</li>
            <li> I have been used this serum for two months and have seen noticeable results on my skin texture. My skin feels softer. I have not seen the disappearance of fine lines, but I am very pleased with this serum. I used three kinds of serum and so far this is the best. After I wash my face clean, pat dry and apply a warm towel on my skin for 10 seconds or so, then I apply the serum. To me, it seems to work better when skin pores open just a little bit to absorb the serum. I strongly suggest use a moisturizer when the serum has dried.</li>
            <li> This serum is definitely worth the money. I cannot post any claims that this product helps to diminish fine lines or wrinkles because I have not used it long enough, but it has many other positive qualities. First, a little goes a long way. I have used this for three nights straight and I usually only apply 2-3 drops on my face overall. I have used this in lieu of my HG moisturizer and, I have to say, this serum is very hydrating and refreshing. It is a bit sticky upon initial application but it does dries to a &amp;#34;matte&amp;#34; finish. After waking up each morning, my skin feels smooth and a bit tight, but not the tightness that usually accompanies a dry face. It has a citrus scent which may not appeal to some people but I cannot detect the smell after applying it to my face. So far, this product did not irritate my skin and did not cause blemishes. I will continue using it. Disclaimer: I have received this product for review.</li>
            <li> UPDATE April 2015:  Phil from InstaNatural gave me refund for this product. I&#x27;m very impressed with their customer service. I didn&#x27;t want to waste the product so I continued to use it and finished bottle. I have grown to like this serum despite the sticky feeling on my skin. I think it has helped lighten my hyper-pigmentation from acne. I&#x27;ve upped my rating from 2 stars to 4!  -------------------------  No matter how little I use, this serum always leaves my face feeling sticky. That&#x27;s with and without a toner beforehand as well as with and without a lotion after. I wait for the serum to get absorbed into my skin (sometimes hours), but my skin always feel sticky!  The bottle I have is the one containing yellowish liquid and a citrus smell. I bought this brand because it was slightly cheaper than the OZ Natural Vitamin C and I should have stuck with OZ (it&#x27;s a clear liquid with no smell and no stickiness!!!).  A plus about this serum is that it does seem to work! The number of pimples I usually get has reduced.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this Vitamin C serum. It&#x27;s very light , it smells fruity and it leaves my face looking refreshed.  After  you apply it make sure you use a moisturizer because your face will feel a little dry,  which is fine because we should be moisturizing our face all the time anyway.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!!</li>
            <li> This product contain so many healthy ingredients which is a major plus for me especially the vitamin E. I have baggy eyes so I decided to use the Insta  Natural vitamin c serum to help tighten them up and get my young girl glow back. I must say I can really tell a difference. My eyes are still puffy but it&#x27;s more toned than baggy and my dark acne scars from like three or four years ago even lightened up so im so happy with my results. So I do know that if I keep using it everyday I&#x27;ll have the youthful look I&#x27;m seeking. This was a free product used for reviewing1 \\&quot;[[ASIN:B00IDWP4IA ANTI AGING VITAMIN C SERUM]]\\&quot;</li>
            <li> love, love it! i think it really helps with wrinkles.  i use their anti-aging facial moisturizer cream on top.  my skin is dry so this combination is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  In fact I need to order more plus a couple more of your products !!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for checking back with me. Lynda&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I re-ordered.  Still love products !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lynda 07/05/15 !!!!</li>
            <li> It may offer benefits (it is definitely helping with a couple of dark spots) but it leaves a residue that is visible after a couple of hrs. So I am just using on top of a couple of dark spots but cannot use it in my entire face. I used other serums and this one was the worst as far as the residue was concerned.</li>
            <li> so far good. I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and i think it is working.</li>
            <li> I had no noticeable improvement after using this product for several months. The worst part about it is how oily it is. If you have oily or combination skin - skip this.</li>
            <li> Love products by Insta Natural - definitely will continue to purchase these products THANK YOU</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel really soft, absorbs very quickly and isn&#x27;t sticky or greasy. I have skin that is prone to breaking out, but haven&#x27;t noticed any flare-ups while using this serum. The best part is that it is cheaper than several other similar products that I have tried or researched.</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthy now and the lines above my lips are not so visible. I have just started using it on my eyes along with the eye gel and am pleased with the combined effect, my eyes even seem to be more open. I went for a pre-facial consultation and was told that Vitamin C serums are one of the best products to clear skin and combat aging..</li>
            <li> I used the InstaNatural advanced Vitamin C Serum and saw an improvement in my skin right away. I used it as directed, once in the morning and once at night. I have to admit that I have really enjoyed this serum.&lt;br /&gt;  You know how facial products can be touch or go. It is a hard decision to make on which anti aging products to use. They can get quite expensive and then not work for your skin at all. I am not sure if this would would work for all skin types, but I do have some good insight. My teenage daughter also used it since we heard Vitamin C is good for acne and she has a pretty moderate to severe case that has been very stubborn.&lt;br /&gt;  My skin is pretty clear to begin with. But gets very dry and I am getting a lot of fine lines and crows feet. My skin also can appear a bit lack luster. I noticed that after my first use, the oils absorbed nicely into my skin. Some of the ingredients are argon oil, rose hip oil, and plant stem cells in addition to the vitamin C, so, it is packed full of good stuff for your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I  have only used it a few days, and I have noticed a difference in the tone of my skin. It is not greasy or oily at all. It is quite soft to the touch. And even my husband noticed the difference in my crows feet! That is amazing since I have only been using it a short time.&lt;br /&gt;  As for my daughter&#x27;s acne, she said for the first time in a very long time, she feels beautiful! By the very next morning after her first use, we noticed she looked clearer and less oily, but, not dried out like some products. It has been about 3 days she has used it and has cleared up about 85 %!!!!&lt;br /&gt;  So, for me, InstaNatural advanced Vitamin C Serum has multiple uses for my family&#x27;s needs and I love it! I will be a returning customer.</li>
            <li> Not as good as two other brands I have used-they were able to fade a dark patch on cheek this one has not-it&#x27;s coming back since using this oroduct</li>
            <li> I just received this, 3 days ago, so I do not yet have a long term review, however,  I can say that this makes my face so very,very soft!  I wash face, then put warm cloth over face for 1 minute, then, while pores warm and open, I applied the serum, and face was super soft and silky.  I then applied moisturizer, and face felt sweet all day.  I hope the long term effects are as positive as the first 3 days have been!</li>
            <li> I actually use this with another hydraulic acid product.  I put this on first.  I used to use a long line of Sonya Dakar products.  I love her products but they are very expensive and a big to do honestly.  So I took a shot and ordered this and the other product at the same time.  My skin looks AMAZING. I dropped most of my routine.  I use one moisturizer and a Sonya Dakar mattifier and that&#x27;s it aside from under eye serum.  I also use it on my neck and the back of my hands now.  I use a BB cream with SPF now as well so no more sunscreen.  I take 10 minutes to put on a face and out the door I go.  Yay.</li>
            <li> After two weeks of used I see the difference on my face and neck....it looks more fresh, moisture, and radiant.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’m not one to put stuff on my face. Usually wash with soap and water, then slap some lotion on.  Since I was given this free, I thought I’d give it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been using it morning and night as suggested and I can really see a difference. My skin is looking healthier and fresher. Not much difference in the smile lines (nice way to say wrinkles) yet but I’ve only been using it a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I smells like orange but not for long and dries very quickly. A small bit goes a long way so if I had paid, I would think I got my money’s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it’s so easy to use, I definitely will consider purchasing this when my bottle runs out (which will be a while with how much you get in a bottle)</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Love everything about it!</li>
            <li> Everything I expected in a vitamin c serum. The smell is great smells to me like grapefruit. Sinks in very fast. No sticky or tacky feel to it. Love it. Face is very soft and smooth .</li>
            <li> I received my order quite quickly I can&#x27;t wait to try it!</li>
            <li> This product is very excellent, I see result within a week of use. I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very good product!&lt;br /&gt;Makes my skin feel fresh and soft :)</li>
            <li> About me: I&#x27;m 30, pretty good skin although prone to hormonal breakouts once a month, only oily on my nose, I don&#x27;t go tanning - only general sun exposure, only starting to get some fine lines around my eyes (I notice it, no one else does). My skin routine is pretty simple, I either use regular soap, baby wash (cheap, gentle makeup remover), or L&#x27;Oreal &amp;#34;Go 360 Clean, Ideal Clean&amp;#34; to wash and follow up with a bit of moisturizer in my T zone. I do get a bit of skin caking in the crease of my nostrils and in the corners of my mouth and under my lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start, it smells good to me, like freshly peeled oranges. It feels quite refreshing to put on after a shower. It&#x27;s not sticky and goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this several times. I can&#x27;t really attest to its anti aging properties, but it definitely hydrates. My skin feels great, it felt softer even after the first use, and the feeling lasts at least two days for me. I have another extremely expensive natural anti aging serum and it dries my skin out so badly. This does the opposite - I actually use it in place of a moisturizer. I have noticed an improvement in healing my rogue pimples. I&#x27;ve had an old pimple bump (or whatever you call them) on my chin for weeks that has finally begun to go away. It also helps in healing any redness from my picking. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any hormonal breakouts this month, could be a coincidence, but I&#x27;ve noticed a general improvement with my complexion overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I apply it under my makeup, I noticed it helps in giving it an airbrushed finish (I do use a brush to apply foundation and a primer). It&#x27;s even helped keep it looking nicer for longer. Before, I noticed my foundation would settle into the creases under my eyes (I&#x27;ve always had these creases, even as a teen) and just generally look gross to me after several hours, but this has seemed to help that issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t really noticed a reduction in the size of my pores. A couple of them seem smaller, but honestly, your pores serve a purpose. You need them, so I don&#x27;t expect that to change, nor do I want it to really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? Yes. Not for $50 though...them seem smaller, but honestly, your pores serve a purpose. You need them, so I don&#x27;t expect that to change, nor do I want it to really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this again? Yes. Not for $50 though...</li>
            <li> good value product，will buy again</li>
            <li> Very pleasant citrus scent.  Absorbs into skin quickly.  Have only used this product for several weeks but am satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product a couple of weeks ago to address redness left from acne and I love it! The scent is pleasant, not strong like some other reviewers shared. I apply it after my toner and under my moisturizer.  It&#x27;s amazing! My skin is softer and clear. My red spots are improving. Today for the first time in a long time (I&#x27;m 39) I actually feel as if my skin looks pretty. Can&#x27;t wait to see what it can do over time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles, but at 31 I have a forehead line and a laugh line beginning to show. I also still have acne so I chose this serum over others because of the rosehip oil. I use this serum after cleaning with a clarisonic and I mild exfoliating cleanser with salicylic acid. I follow with a moisturizer with spf or night cream. My skin texture has improved and the lines are much less noticeable. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this serum and the hylauronic acid serum--this can be a little irritating alone but works well with the acid serum. I have to say that my mature sensitive skin is responding well to this and it is also a terrific value!</li>
            <li> So far, I am very pleased with this product.  I&#x27;ve been using a drugstore product for over a year, but decided to try something new.  It&#x27;s improved my skin tone.  I bought this product because it mentioned it would aid with lessoning appearance of skin discoloration/brown spots.  I am almost through first bottle, and have ordered 2nd.  I will update my review after 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift to my girl friend. she likes it a lot saying it is better than the one she used before. I will buy this again for her again.</li>
            <li> Compared with the Timeless Vitamin C + E Ferulic acid serum, it&#x27;s not that great.</li>
            <li> I really love this Vitamin C Serum! My face feels cleaner with out stripping away my natural oils in my face. I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and have experiened less breakouts. I only use eyeshadow, mascara, and Eyeliner. My routine is I apply Insta Natural Facial Cleanser to my face with a cotton pad using small upward circles.  Using a hot wet clean washcloth I wipe away the cleanser. Then I appy Insta Natural Toning Rose Water with a clean cotton pad using small upward circles again. Immediately followed with this Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum and just one squirt of Insta Natural Rosehip Oil. This Vitamin C Serum smells just like Oranges, its just lovely. The company has emailed me to check to see how I liked their products and give me proper instructions on how to apply their products. I have been looking for products that would actually work on my face because most don&#x27;t.  I am sure I have finally found what I was looking for.  All in all it has been a great experience :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this for only a couple of weeks and can already see great results. My skin looks and feels healthier and I absolutely love the smell. I recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly, and makes my skin look amazing!!!  My skin is clearer, brighter, and younger looking.  A++++++!!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT IT.&lt;br /&gt;USED IT.&lt;br /&gt;DONT SEE ANY CHANGES OR INSTANT MIRACLES LIKE IT &amp;#34;CLAIMS&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;SMELLS GOOD, OTHER THAN THAT I THINK IT WAS A WASTE OF MY MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;BOUGHT OTHER PRODUCTS FROM THIS SAME BRAND, AND THIS SERUM DOESN&#x27;T SEEM TO DO IT FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a couple of weeks, so at this point I dont feel Im able to give it a completely fair review. However, I really do like it so far. It goes on smoothly, and looks great under makeup. The ingredients are impressive, so Im sure it&#x27;ll work well! AWESOME SERVICE!</li>
            <li> Great product and price. Excellent customer service and follow up. Will recommend to friends and buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great ,It is the texture of  water, non greasy, goes on nicely and soaks right in, I&#x27;m 52 and can&#x27;t really say whether it will help my wrinkles, I will have to see over a long period of time. I have bags which I know that can only really be taken care of by surgery , bags run in the family , so I don&#x27;t expect it to help that . It has all the ingredients in it that all the expensive brands have and it is inexpensive! I will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> This is by far one of my favorite vitamin c serums! I love the scent and I love how smoothly it goes on my skin! It has helped with acne, dull spots and rough spots! I put this on after I wash my face at night and in the morning my face feels super soft and healthy! I was given this product for testing purposes, but these are my honest opinions!</li>
            <li> THIS IS GREAT FOR  DAYTIME</li>
            <li> It is best product. very effective.</li>
            <li> Excellent for my oily skin</li>
            <li> The serum works well.</li>
            <li> Love!! My dermatologist even recommended I use this product for all the great ingredients included. Definitely a must for all skin types to keep the healthiness of the skin.</li>
            <li> I am always a skeptic of products thinking they are all the same, but not this one!! Especially for the price.  I had this dry red patch on my cheek.  I started using this product with the vitamin C moisturizer and the dry patch is gone.  Also, I started using a harsh prescription acne cream retin a micro generic brand and I do not have any flaking or dry skin because of this product. It does not leave your face feeling greasy.  The price is great and so is the product.  I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I’m battling dry skin every night after I take a shower, so I’m always happy to try something that provides quick and lasting moisture. Thankfully the InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum I received for review does just that. It the serum itself looks a little goopy but it smells and feels amazing as soon as you put it on. There are lots of reasons to like this serum including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Smells amazing with a wonderful hint of citrus&lt;br /&gt;-Gets absorbed instantly into your skin without any greasiness&lt;br /&gt;-Perfect for rehydrating skin, leaving it soft and healthy&lt;br /&gt;-Just a couple of drops is all you need to get your entire face and it includes a convenient little dropper</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Terrific serum. It is very lightweight, smells delicious and gives the skin a glow.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 bottles. Used only at night. I really didn&#x27;t see a difference in my face at all. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for at least a few months now and I love it.  I had been looking for a while for skin care products that were chemical free, organic, AND effective.  This certainly is all of those things.  It led me to buy other products from InstaNaturals including their Vitamin C facial cleanser and toner and the Dead Sea Mud Musk.  All of them are excellent.  The company is excellent, too.  They stand behind all of their products and if you are dissatisfied in anyway they will make it right.</li>
            <li> Exellent serum ! My skin loves it . I will buy again .</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my skin look great.  Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Same review I just posted for the hyaluronic acid.  Expected help with lessening of wrinkles.  This did not happen.  No Help.</li>
            <li> So far I love it! I have only been using it for a few weeks so I can&#x27;t honestly say if I&#x27;ve seen a major difference but it smells great and pairs so well with they&#x27;re Eye Gel! I finish up with pure rosehip seed oil and my face feels flipping amaze like all day! Also - and this is a major plus for a city girl like me whose makeup can get wiley in the summer months - it really does lay smoothly underneath makeup and it doesn&#x27;t make it run or wear off like other serums and facial products often do. I&#x27;ve bought many different items from InstaNaturals and all I can say is between the very attentive customer service to the products themselves - they live up to the raving reviews they receive. I am very happy with these products and will continue to be a customer!</li>
            <li> I love the orange smell of this! I apply this every morning after washing my face and the smell is a great way to make me feel extra awake. I do find that this isn&#x27;t as moisturizing as I&#x27;d like it to be but when I apply it with my moisturizer and SPF, it does the job. On it&#x27;s own or combined with other products, I do find that it leaves my skin looking and feeling plump and also leaves a nice glow on my face. I have been using this product in conjunction with other InstaNatural products every day for over two months now and I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed a different in the fading of dark spots or discoloration.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love InstaNatural products and I will continue to purchase them because some of these products are my Holy Grail items, however I most likely will not repurchase this because they make other items that are much better for hydrating my very dry skin and diminishing dark marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I like this product. The packaging is very solid and cute and the dropper is very handy for distributing and keeping things sanitary.</li>
            <li> Awesome serum. I have heard that Vit C serum may cause dryness on our face, and need to use it with some heavy cream to get enough hydration. Well, it doesn&#x27;t give me this problem. A little bit goes a long way. I have used it for a couple weeks now. I love the feeling, my face feels very smooth and soft. I like the ingredient. It has Organic Rosehip Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, Organic Argan Oil, Carrot Seed Oil, etc these great oil, yet I don&#x27;t get to feel the oil on my face. Love it! Though I got it at discount, I want to buy it again once it is out and I already told my friends about this product and have them to try too, they all like it.</li>
            <li> Brightens skin, can see a difference right away. Awesome serum with many bebefits</li>
            <li> This product has reduced the signs of aging dramatically. I have less deep pockets in my skin.  I have only used this product for a month but feel that over time I will continue to achieve significant results. I also use this product in combination with other instanatural products.&lt;br /&gt;I would defintely give this product five stars.</li>
            <li> Please do your research on this product.  it does NOT contain the active form of vitamin C L ascorbic acid.  I am not happy with this purchase because while it may contain other helpful ingredients I purchased this for the Vit C and I feel that its representation is misleading.</li>
            <li> I like this product and would recommend it to others.  It tightens my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> excellent serum! My bought me a tube of vitamin C cream from the dermatologist for 89 dollars (with a discount no less!) and it didn&#x27;t work as well as this serum did. My face felt smooth and soft - I saw results within 24 hrs of applying this. Will be ordering more when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> Well sometimes it happens, stress and illness have played havoc and your skin looks as worn out as you feel. The good news is that your skin can feel better and firmer if you treat yourself to a Vitamin C serum.  Drop by drop the serum delivers your tired complexion an energy boost, refreshing and tightening, while giving it much needed nutrients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Serums contain up to three times as many nutrients as creams and in the highest possible concentration,&amp;#34; says Eric Gooris, director of Clairns Laboratories in Paris.  That is why they are sometimes three times as expensive as creams, but that&#x27;s also because they work faster and penetrate deeper.  &amp;#34;The reason is that serums have very small molecules and lipophilic - fat friendly - therefore they are able to penetrate the lipid layout of the skin and penetrate better into the depths, &amp;#34; explains the dermatologist Dr. Martina Troebinger from Dermatologikum Berlin. The recommended duration depends on the nature of the serum form, of it&#x27;s consistency compatibility and of course the individual skin condition. Results can be seen from 2 to 4 weeks after gently massaging the serum into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HYDRATE SKIN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After age 30, the skin&#x27;s own moisture is depleted. The water content of the skin becomes out of balance and skin becomes dry and wrinkles multiply. Now add sun exposure, wind, extreme heat or cold and the skin aging process just enters warp speed. Moisture binding products are needed that supply the skin with hydration. Often this is done with the addition of Hyaluronic Acid and beneficial oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LESS PIGMENT SPOTS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aging, UV radiation or hormonal changes often show up as brown skin discoloration (sun spots or age spots), an indication that too much melamine pigment is produced by the skin. Fruit acids such as vitamin C  help to regulate Melanin production and leave the complexion looking more even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRINKLE PREVENTION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To prevent wrinkles or smooth out existing ones, products with firming polypeptides and vitamin A, E and C have shown great results.  InstaNatural’s Vitamin C Serum formula is packed with nutrients that you will not find elsewhere. It contains 20% Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid and Vitamin E. Rosehip Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, Plant Stem Cells, Argan Oil and more work together to nourish your skin while restoring its health and beauty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural’s Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum is produced in small batches to ensure quality and freshness.

Vitamin C is essential for producing a stable collagen scaffold. Where deep wrinkles are seen in the skin, the collagen scaffold was damaged due to excessive stress over time. Nourishing the skin with vitamin C helps to minimize and reduce the damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you have been reading my blog, you know how much I love Vitamin C serums. Since I have started using them my skin has never looked better. Insta Natural Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum comes in a 1 Fl oz , blue bottle and is applied after you cleanse your face with a dropper. A small amount of serum goes a long way and I usually massage it over my face and neck area in circular motions. The serum has a very faint smell, perhaps from the Rosehip Oil, which is very pleasant. There is a slight sensation of skin pores tightening. and afterwards my skin feels nicely hydrated. My fine lines around the eyes are almost gone and there are no blemishes. My age spots are  sadly still there, but they have not gotten any worse.

            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t need more Vitamin C in their life?  It smells great and it&#x27;s been great for face and neck!</li>
            <li> Good good goooooooooood:-)</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. It has a deep orange color and a pleasant orange fragrance with a perfect consistency to apply over face and neck. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Vitamin c lightens brightens and tightens!</li>
            <li> This product seems to do what it says.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers said the serum has a milky color. Mine, however, was rather yellow when I opened the bottle. I think it has somehow oxidized, as experts say that oxidised vitamin C turns yellow. Because of that, I&#x27;m giving it just two stars, as it probably won&#x27;t be able to fight free radicals.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and leaves skin feeling refreshed</li>
            <li> I really like this serum as the consistency is thicker and easier to apply than other Vitamin C Serums I have tried. I would highly recommend this product, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product.  I have seen its results on especially dry areas of my body (shins).  I have one with Retinol and obviously this one without it.  I alternate using both and it is helping very much with the feel of my skin.  I actually had someone tell me what nice &#x27;makeup&#x27; I use!!!  Considering I don&#x27;t wear any foundation just moisturizer, it gave me a good laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend InstaNatural  should make a moisturizer with sunscreen for those of us using their Retinol containing products.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  I use it on my face and neck daily.  I believe it has made my face look softer and has added a glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about two weeks now. I love how creamy the product is. I would say it absorbs very quickly  and make my lines appear more blurred . I use it twice a day for maximum results. I would recommend this product to any one who wants a high quality product with visible results  “Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month now and I love it! It is so easy to apply and makes my skin glow. I had tried the Paula&#x27;s choice vitamin c and didn&#x27;t like it at all (even though I love all her other products). This stuff works great and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> This is a legit product! I really like it, the texture is great, glides on skin easily and absorbs quickly. I have tried more expensive brands in the past and I must say I was surprised at the quality, packaging and the results that I have gotten so far with this product. I have been using it regularly for 3 weeks and I am pretty much set to invest in another bottle when this one finishes. Hope this review helps those of you who are looking to add a Vitamin C serum in their skin care regime! Keep smiling :)</li>
            <li> This makes my skin so soft.  Just put  a full dropper on your fingers and apply to face.  I use this at night after cleansing and toning.  You can also apply your favorite moisturizer over it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great serum, it smells good, not thick or too liquidy either. My face feels tight and refreshed after I use it as well. I gave it four stars ONLY because I tried another serum before it and that serum literally made my face glow. I expected to experience the same glow with this serum but i never did. I&#x27;m sure other people have, but personally speaking i did not. It did however maintain the bright complexion i&#x27;ve maintained since using the first serum so i&#x27;m happy about that. It is a great serum, i would definitely purchase it again if I could not get hold of the other serum i used.</li>
            <li> product didn&#x27;t work for my skin as I had hope - BUT EXCELLENT SERVICE...I really appreciate the refund...VERY unexpected as I didn&#x27;t ask for it - THANK YOU for standing by your products - all of our genetics is just made up different and it happened to not work for me ;0)  BUT THANK YOU for letting me try your product &#x3D;0)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!! Great product!!</li>
            <li> Helps maintain moisture and gives a nice glow.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tighter and looks healthier as a result of using the serum. I recommend it to anyone interested improving the look of her skin!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it is fantastic. I am 32 and have never really been focused on wrinkles but thought about getting started in preventative care. This is fantastic coupled with the derma roller. I will be buying more of this product. I love the way it smells and makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> smells great and works well. Skin feels clean</li>
            <li> Content!&lt;br /&gt;Great feel!&lt;br /&gt;Great smell!</li>
            <li> Goes a long way and feels wonderful!</li>
            <li> This is a great product, does not cause irritation or redness but does help clear my blemishes and soften fine lines.</li>
            <li> Wife likes. Wants you to use it again.</li>
            <li> I will order it again even before I run out! 63 year old skin and I&#x27;m getting compliments about how healthy and young I look! Easy aplication, great skin feel, value for money and proper packaging for minimizing ozidation.</li>
            <li> nice, skin feels great</li>
            <li> i love this product works great... My acne scars and wrinkles went away.... Will definately buy again</li>
            <li> Amazing product. A small amount goes a long way, makes my skin feel firm without being drying at all. I use this before applying my moisturizer and after a week my complexion is definitely improved.</li>
            <li> I had dark skin on my forehead on both the sides and so many creams applied nothing really working&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Vitamin C and in the last 2 weeks I see a significant change in the coloration, I believe it might take couple of more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product and it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Well, I guess it&#x27;s working okay.  I have not seen any visible difference yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for one month.  I do believe it is helping my skin even if I&#x27;m not seeing any changes.  I will continue to use it twice a day as suggested along with a good moisturizer.  I will order it again.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum is great. My favorite part about it is it has vitamin C scent. This to me tells me it is true to its name and great. Every day for about a week now I have been using this and it has helped in my face. I feel like my face is brighter and looks healthier. This is a product I recommend and will continue to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This is a great price for Vitamin C serum, though not sure what percentage it is compared to the highly expensive serums.  But it does feel good on the skin, seems to tighten and hydrate well.</li>
            <li> Skin feels better and difference in pores after a few days of use!  Can&#x27;t wait for long term!</li>
            <li> I have had trouble finding a serum that did not contain any silicone - while the silicone helps skin feel &amp;#34;silky&amp;#34; after application, I always break-out after a few applications. I&#x27;m going on week 2 of the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum, and so far I am loving it! I&#x27;m not sure that I have seen any significant results relative to fine lines or pore size, but only time will tell. That being said, the consistency of this serum is fantastic - a light texture, no silicone, not oily at all (as you may expect given the various oils listed in the ingredients), and it dries almost instantly after application with no tacky or sticky feeling/residue. In fact, even without the silicone, I have noticed a very silky finish to my skin after application. I have also definitely noticed an improvement in my skin&#x27;s moisture level since I started using this. And an added bonus - no silicone break-outs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing this serum once my current bottle runs out, and I recommend giving this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note - I was provided a bottle of this serum by the manufacturer for use and review. I was not reimbursed in any way for my opinion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 27 yrs old with brown patchy skin with some large pores and acne scars.  And oily in T zone. I have used Timeless Vitamin C serum previously and it was great on my pores and scars. But then I thought of using InstaNatural because it&#x27;s half the price and has high customer satisfaction. So, I brought this one 2 weeks ago from Amazon. After 2 weeks of daily night usage, I haven&#x27;t seen any IMPROVEMENT on my skin..NONE. not even brighter! however, the changes are there : skin has become from oily to dry in just 2 weeks and white patches show up in morning near under eye area. So basically the pH balance of my skin is damaged and now I&#x27;m using baby oil to get it normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I don&#x27;t know if this serum has higher concentration for my skin but for a sensitive skin be cautious while using this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is doing a great job at exfoliating my skin very gently.  My skin is so soft and smooth and is becoming more even-toned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> this product came in a Timely Manner, I ordered it for My Sister who lives in Chicago, and She Has Responded She is Very Pleased with it So Far! I Do Know as An Esthetician, I was Impressed by All That was in this Vitamin C Serum!  Some of the Best Ingredients!</li>
            <li> my face is so much softer since using this serum! I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night. It smells like oranges and absorbs into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum in combination with the Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer for about two weeks now, and I&#x27;m happy with the results so far. I love the citrus-y scent, and the serum absorbs very quickly — sometimes so quickly, in fact, that I have to use a few more drops to make sure my entire face has been treated. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with my face breaking out, and I have sensitive skin in that regard. I have to be careful with the products I use, so I&#x27;m always a little hesitant to try anything new. I&#x27;ve had good luck with the various InstaNatural products I&#x27;ve tried so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this serum four stars because I can&#x27;t honestly say that it&#x27;s making a noticeable difference in my skin yet, but then it has only been a couple of weeks. And, it&#x27;s hard to say how much difference any serums or moisturizers make when it comes to preventing or reversing the signs of aging, particularly in such a short amount of time. But, I do at least feel like using the serum is better than doing nothing, since my skin does not seem to be having any adverse reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of note, I can already tell that I&#x27;m going to run out of serum long before I run out of moisturizer, so if you&#x27;re like me and you plan to use the two in combination, you&#x27;ll be ordering the serum more frequently. Also, it seems to me that I remember some people having issues with the color of the serum, back when I was reading the product reviews before I placed my order. I have not had any problems in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have anything new to report as I continue using this product, I&#x27;ll update this review accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I feel younger already...</li>
            <li> Awesome and fantastic product!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product,it was delivered in time</li>
            <li> It help fade age spots and feels great on your face and smells just like an orange - I use after Glycolic gel peel</li>
            <li> I want to give this a better review because I really like the ingredient list.  Unfortunately, I did not like the smell and I find that I don&#x27;t want to use it because of the smell.  If it was odor free, I&#x27;d rate it higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Love this product - absorbs quickly into skin, not sticky - I use it every day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to put good Vitamin C on your skin, especially you feel your skin like {drying}. This serum is great, and the smell is good.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any difference in my skin. disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love  it smells  nice my new favorite</li>
            <li> didnt really see a difference on my skin did not brighten it</li>
            <li> Only started using this serum about two weeks.  I use it morning and evening my face looks slightly brighter.. Will continue using it to the end and make another review.</li>
            <li> Love it! Fast shipping! Smells great! Makes your skin feel so refreshed. Seems to relax my eyes in the morning when they are puffy. I&#x27;m definitely going to buy another bottle and see what results i continue to get!</li>
            <li> This is a amazing serum. This serum has a light texture a wonderful citrus  scent. This serum has the best anti-aging ingredients on the market today. My complection is brighter and I have a radiance to my skin. I would highly recommend this product to everyone. This product was provided free for testing. Thank you</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use this serum enough to tell if it&#x27;s made any improvements but I don&#x27;t have terrible skin to begin with. I use it all over my face in the morning even around my eyes. It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel which is important to me since I want a smooth finish to apply makeup. This smells like orange though not overpowering. Overall I like it but as previously stated haven&#x27;t used it long enough to comment on changes. However, it is a bit thicker than most serums I&#x27;m used to but since it absorbs well I don&#x27;t mind.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I have used Vitamin C serum before so I am familiar with its use and texture. It spreads nicely and absorbs quickly. This one has also a little bit of orange aroma which I like. I have been using it for a few weeks and I can see some improvement in my skin appearance. Skin feel tighter after use and I think dark spots are slowly lightening but since I have problem skin its hard to tell. I have used 2 other top seller brands of vitamin C and I like this one the best.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this product.  I use it in conjunction with a derma roller for maximum penetration and have seen some real changes in the appearance of my skin.  My face is brighter and  all my brown spots have disappeared .  My acne scars are less visible too.  Can&#x27;t say enough about Instanatural products.  I love them all!</li>
            <li> Really made my skin feel soft and cut down on my redness. Awesome natural ingrediants that are healthy for the skin. Smells nice and feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this serum. I use it after my toner and it glides on the skin pretty well. I have been using twice daily for about 3 weeks now and I have noticed an improvement in my skin. Over all my skin is smother and more even toned and it looks really healthy. I LOVE the way this toner smells, like orange juice. I cant find any complaints and i do see it lasting me for a while. In all i do recommend if you want a healthy complexion and plump skin. “Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
            <li> Very nice Vitamin C serum, more moisturize!  My face has cleared up since starting to use it a month ago!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I also have the eye serum and switch between the two for my face and it&#x27;s incredible how much of a difference it&#x27;s made even in a week. I&#x27;m 49 and have sagging skin and it&#x27;s definitely been tightening up. I&#x27;d recommend this definitely.</li>
            <li> I tried this under my daytime moisturizer. My skin was flaking when I applied my makeup. I have tried another vitamin C serum with the same results. I guess my skin does not react well with it for daytime use. “Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
            <li> I have been using this Vitamin C serum for about a month now and I have to say I LOVE it.  It is non greasy, and makes my skin feel firmer.  Definitely going to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE vitamin C! I enjoy drinking it in OJ, I take the gummy vitamin C, and I love applying it to my face at night as it&#x27;s one of the few skin products that makes a noticeable difference in my skin. This serum is light and doesn&#x27;t make me break out; plus, the bottle it big and it smells great (like a tangy orange in my opinion). Really makes my face glow and has helped face some old acne scars. The best part is that it is affordable! I have purchased vitamin C serum that cost nearly $100 from my aesthetician and this stuff works just as well.</li>
            <li> One week in and I already can tell the serum is plumping my face up. I use this in the morning(would be better before bed, however I am currently only washing my face once a day) and notice some light redness, uneven skin tone. Later that day beautiful skin, less wrinkles, deep lines are fainter, and my face held moisture longer. I will start using in conjunction with an aloe vera based face mist during day for better effectiveness. I do use OIL CLEANSING METHOD to wash my face with coconut and castor oil. Best face wash EVER. Then put on this serum, and finally some carrot seed, rose hip, jojoba face oil.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a vitamin c serum and this has been great so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is a bit odd but most serums have that slightly sticky feel. I would warn anyone who doesn&#x27;t like a strong grapefruit/orange juice mixture smell to stay away. It applies evenly and very smoothly to the face. It&#x27;s easily incorporated into my routine as well. Just make sure you are applying it at night and moisturizing after.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a short while and so far I am satisfied with using it with the hyarluronic acid and my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, and can usually only use a few skincare items that have 1-3 ingredients in them.  This product&#x27;s current price is about what I pay for a similar item from Vitacost.  This serum has more ingredients, works drastically better, and does not irritate my skin or cause any reactions.  I would occasionally get burning from my other product, and oddly, not with this one.  Very pleased.  Don&#x27;t see much like this at this price point.</li>
            <li> Smells really good! Seems to do a good job!</li>
            <li> This serum is great! I love products from InstaNatural, and this is one of my favorites. I use this every day and my skin feels so soft and refreshed. I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Really rejuvenates your skin. It&#x27;s clearer, smoother and younger looking.  I&#x27;ll definitely be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  Easy to apply and does not leave a sticky feeling like some other products I used to use.  It&#x27;s light weight and smell really nice.  Can be used under make-up with no problem at all.  I&#x27;m starting to see the spots and wrinkles slowly disappeared.  My skin is softer now.  It feels tighter and brighter.  I use this with Instanatural Moisturizer but it&#x27;s not necessary.  I would purchase this product again.  InstaNatural has great customer service.  I cannot believe how accommodating they are.</li>
            <li> I really like how this product works. It&#x27;s a part of my daily routine now.</li>
            <li> I received my shipment in a timely manner and so far am happy with this product. It has a nice pleasant citrus scent and I can tell my skin on face and tops of hands feels firmer after 2 wks use. It also seems to be lightening a sun spot on my cheek that has been there for years.</li>
            <li> I love this serum for multiple reasons. It is organic and its formula is quite effective.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and consistent, smells like citrus and it feels very natural to me. The apparent stickiness only lasts until serum is fully absorbed, it only takes a few drops. Lips are fully healed from breaking out and pores are shrinking to disappearance, much finer wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;I use it along with an organic active moisturizer to get better results, indeed, this serum compliments the active moisturizer Organity.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a little over a month, now, and I already saw noticeable improvements, especially if I chase this treatment down with the proper supplements beneficial to the skin. Due to some  allergie and intolerance I stay clear from all synthetics and chemicals as well as caffeine. I hope Instanatural will keep this original formula (caffeine free) and its affordable price, so I can keep buying it. So far so good! I can definitely recommend this product and I will eventually buy it again, as needed.</li>
            <li> this is a quality product....the customer service is outstanding</li>
            <li> Recently I went to a spa to have a professional facial  they used a serum which felt wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;To purchase their product was out of my price range.  I started to do some personal &amp;#34;research&amp;#34; of my own with products and found&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum.  When comparing the ingredients it was very similar to what they used at the spa.  However the cost of the product through InstaNatrual was was more affordable.&lt;br /&gt;  I am currently in SW Florida, so I must slather on sun screen a few times a day.  I have&lt;br /&gt;very sensitive skin and sun screen seems to make my skin flake off  (hey, exfoliation right?!).  My skin really drinks this Serum up!  And it does not take more than a drop or two.  I really like that I can smooth out my irritated skin from the day and be able to apply make up on a more&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;smooth canvas&amp;#34;.  I am really happy I found this!  I have told my family and friends about it.  Plus I believe if you do not like the product this company will talk with you, they even send an email about how to use it when it is ordered on Amazon.  My order was through Amazon as I bought some other products.  InstaNatural was kind enough to let me try a couple of their other items so this &amp;#34;product was provided for free for testing&amp;#34;.  I had nothing to loose, I was very happily surprised to find some great items and they are not all full of chemicals that I cannot pronounce.  I will be purchasing more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> This vitamin c serum is the best that I ever have used. This has goooooood scent.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It smells delicious and I can see a difference already.  I might switch to this serum permanently!  I am 50 years old and refuse to look it! This company has been a pleasure.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> One of the ingredients caused my face to break out in hives.  I have used the vitamon C and the seabuckthorn separately in the past without this happening so I do not know what additive caused the reaction.  Needless to say, I will stick with the old items I have used for the past 5 years.</li>
            <li> This serum is one of the best things that has happened to me i am 31 years old and i just started taking care of my face by using serums, using moisterizers the whole ruitine i am currently using this one in the mornings and my face is just glowing i really see the difference and i am obssesed</li>
            <li> I was so excited to be able to receive and review this item for perspective as someone that has never had the chance to experience trying it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This vitamin C smells sooo good!! Like straight up yummy yummy citrus! It does not contain any alcohol or best of all NO parabens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients include: deionized water,organic aloe,vitamin c,(sodium ascorbyl phosphate). Hyaluronic acid,witch hazel,plant stem cells,algae extract,Japanese green leaf extract,(camellia oleifera, organic rosehip seed oil,organic Argan oil,sea buckthorn oil, pink grapefruit essential oil,carbomer,(2s) -2-amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid,kosher vegetable glycerin, organic jojoba oil, vitamin e (tocopheryl acetate),pomegranate, organic carrot seed oil,apricot kernel oil,organic gotu kota,wildcrafted horsetail,wildcrafted dandelion, wilcrafted wild geranium, phenoxyethanaol,ethyl hexyl gylcerin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love how Vitamin C is very very high up on the ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum itself is thin, semi opaque and yellow in color. It dries clear. If you use too much you will get a tacky film so be careful. A little goes a very long way so this bottle will last you a long time. I am using this to fade a scar on my face.. I can&#x27;t wait to see if this works!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this serum.  My skin looks absolutely amazing after using it for about 3 weeks now.  Will definitely purchase again.  This is my third purchase ... fabulous product!!</li>
            <li> I am using it in a combination with Vitamin E Oil to lighten dark skin in bikini area resulting from friction and old pimples (I Live in a desert like weather, tooo hot 40+ C ) also I use the combination on my face (acne discoloration and very mild scarring), this is my third day so I am yet to see results, I use it once a day, I like the smell, the texture, and absorption,&lt;br /&gt;will come back later in a week or 2 to update my review ! hopefully I will see some results</li>
            <li> Seriously...you must buy this! This product is wonderful.  I use it as part of my nightly routine.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and I&#x27;ve noticed significant results with my complexion and the fine lines on my face. I have hope that in the next three months I will notice better results with my skin.  I love how the bottle comes with a dropper, making it easier to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like putting an orange on your face. It feels great and love the smell. Not sure benefits yet.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s light and smells so nice. It absorbs quickly , then  I follow with my bb cream. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I love it and it does what it is supposed to.  Without a doubt I will recommend this product to anybody who wants soft, even toned, beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> this product is good. it makes your face appear to look bright and healthy. I have oily skin and it did not make my skin oily. My face felt very soft and oil free.</li>
            <li> This is my third bottle and its got a different consistency and color than the other 2 I&#x27;ve ordered in the past. I wish they&#x27;d settle on a formula or they&#x27;d clean out their inventory and restock from scratch. I can&#x27;t return it as its older than a month but its a new bottle so the Vitamin C should be new and stable as if it just came from the factory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the differing colors and odors, this hasn&#x27;t done anything for me. I&#x27;ve given it a real try for 2 bottles which equals 2 months. I used it under a moisturizer as you&#x27;re supposed to do w/Vitamin C serums. Can&#x27;t just leave them hanging in the wind on your skin without help from a moisturizer! But strip everything away once a week at night w/ASDM&#x27;s 10% Glycolic pads on a day you haven&#x27;t used scrub and you&#x27;ll find out if there really are less wrinkles: Sadly the answer w/this product is no. I&#x27;ve since switch to another C product that has 22% + 5% Hyaluronic Acid Serum (available on Amazon) and am using their moisturizer product they have as a combo after using Clinique #1 and #2 prep lotions (not moisturizers) that ready the skin to receive serum then moisturizer on a daily basis. Make sure you let everything dry. As always good luck and remember: Not every product is good for every one. This review is for skin that is: sensitive to dry, mature, thin, light laugh wrinkles around eyes.</li>
            <li> I used to use this over my entire face but I noticed that my forehead started getting little bumps on them (they weren&#x27;t pimples or anything; not really sure what it was). So I stopped using it on my forehead (but I&#x27;m still using it on the rest of my face-- and the rest of my face has been fine) and the bumps went away. This could have happened because my forehead gets a bit oily over the course of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I&#x27;m not actually sure if this does anything for the rest of my face as I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles or fine lines. I use one drop for each side of my face and after I massage it in, if I pat my face it feels slightly sticky-- not smooth as I would hope. Although the stickiness is taken care of when I apply my moisturizer so it isn&#x27;t too big of a deal.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this broke me out. Had to stop using it. Just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> So I am 46.  Most days have never washed my face with much of anything.  I use witch hazel and cotton round if I do.  I don&#x27;t use creams, moisturizers, etc as my skin still breaks out in the T zone at my age!  So, I get this to try on the brown aging/sunspot on the &amp;#34;drivers side&amp;#34; of my face that developed on my cheek.  My skin had become kind of ruddy looking this past 6 months or so due to working outside with our livestock twice a day, rain or shine.  Approx 4 hours each day.  This product applied once per day after cleansing with the witch hazel has left the skin smoother and more even looking.  Tighter comes to mind.  The brown spot on my cheek is fading.  I have started applying a vitamin c moisturizer on my face, very light and small amount, after I use the serum.  This all takes me about 5 minutes total.  I am blessed with a youthful apperance and just wanted to get rid of that dark spot.  This has helped and I believe will continue to help that fade.  Overall, super product to even complexion and smooth skin.  I do recommend for those who like natural products as well.  I bought it with a gift card my sister gave me for Christmas so as not to be dissapointed if it didn&#x27;t work!  But, it works as described.  Hope you all enjoy and have excellent results as well  (:</li>
            <li> So far my skin likes it. No bad reaction from it. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky. It makes my skin soft and looks hydrated.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Makes me glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using another vitamin C product for a while but decided to switch to this brand because of the great reviews and ingredients in this product-it seemed to contain more vitamins and other great, natural ingredients that my current one didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a week now and it&#x27;s causing me to break out. My face feels very &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and oily with it on and although it says that it can be worn under makeup, it causes my makeup to cake and smear, my makeup also doesn&#x27;t seem to go on as well (I use a mineral powder and yes, I did let the serum soak in before applying a moisturizer and makeup). Even without my makeup on it doesn&#x27;t feel right on me and my face also feels itchy. I&#x27;ve only been using it during the day. I know everyone reacts differently to a product and maybe I could be allergic to something in it. There&#x27;s a Iot of different natural oils listed in the ingredients which the other brand of serum I was using didn&#x27;t contain and maybe that was the &amp;#34;heaviness&amp;#34; I felt and why I looked greasy after an hour or so of use.&lt;br /&gt;There is a satisfaction guarantee and a couple days before receiving the product I had gotten an email from the company with directions and tips for using it. I replied to the email and basically told them the same thing that I had written above. I received a response in less than 24 hours and was offered a refund.</li>
            <li> Tia works really wel. I love this entire product line.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer and smoother  after only a few uses. It goes on very smooth with no redness and is great under moisturizer and make up!  I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Skin looks younger. 2 months using. Small bottle though, 1 month for 2 people.</li>
            <li> This works! After only a few days I can see the lines softening.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It keep my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Shoes are cheaply made and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I was having a bit of a hyper-pigmentation problem under the corners of my lips and this really helped. It helped return the dark spots back to its original skin color. I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My skin certainly looks younger.  I&#x27;m not a very old woman (30 years) but friend my age tend to comment that my skin looks even younger than I am.  Strangers generally guess that I&#x27;m 24.  I changed a few products around the same time, so it&#x27;s hard to say what makes the biggest difference, but as a skin care professional I can confirm that the product is enhancing my appearance, and at a GREAT price point!</li>
            <li> I realy love this.  It is nice on the skin and doesn&#x27;t bother me with strong smells (i can&#x27;t have smells because I get bad Migraines).  Makes skin feel great and a nice size bottle.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! everyone of my friends were asking about my secret just few days of starting to use the product ! I have oily skin but due to use of anti acne products my skin was very dry. This product help me get rid of my dry skin,my complexion is brighter!Loveeee it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review before but I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product so I want to warn others. My combo skin was looking great (no blemishes) until I used this. I wanted to add Vitamin C to my routine but this product gave me irritation/breakouts all over my face after using it for only two days. My face became itchy, splotchy, and now I have breakouts in places I don&#x27;t normally break out. AND it made the left side of my lower lip involuntarily spasm for about 15 minutes on the second day, which has never happened to me before! I&#x27;ve discontinued use for 5 days now and my skin is still recovering. What a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this vitamin C serum! I&#x27;d been using a high-end department store serum and could no longer justify the high price. I started looking for a more affordable replacement and came across InstaNaturals. I&#x27;ve only tried this product and their Hyaluronic Acid so far, and love the results to date. This Vitamin C serum smells really good (some people may not love the smell, but I enjoy it!). It instantly makes my skin feel a little more firm, which I like. My skin is also somewhat sensitive to some products, but this caused no breakouts or redness. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to determine whether it will eventually lighten some of the age spots I&#x27;m starting to see, but I have high hopes and will provide a future update on my results. I would highly recommend giving this serum a shot!</li>
            <li> Love the Vitamin C serum, goes on smoothly and has nice scent. Too early to tell if it has really improved skin or helped lines and wrinkles, but if I see improvement will definitely re-order from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for only two days and I already love it! It does not dry out skin but also keeps it from being too oily. It immediately brightens my face, I have horrible dark under-eye circles and this works better then concealer! The smell is wonderful, a soft orangey smell.</li>
            <li> i like it it just makes my skin dry</li>
            <li> My skin tone is nice and my skin loves this. I use pure argon oil after applying this following all showers I take. It really if affective.</li>
            <li> Instanatural is one of my favorite companies. I use their rice-based Phytoceramides as well. This serum absorbs well and a little goes a long way. It has a nice, mild citrus smell to it. I use it after home microdermabrasion. It will sting a bit if you&#x27;ve exposed underlying layers of your skin, but that is short-lived. Initially, expect your skin to look a bit worse, especially if you have lines around your eyes, which I don&#x27;t, or on your forehead, which I do, because this serum helps your skin shed its older layers and brings up fresh, healthy skin. In doing so, it also exposes everything under your skin, including the lines or spots or acne. But again, that is short-lived. I would recommend this as part of someone&#x27;s daily facial routine, as I use it every day. I was getting a tiny line by my mouth (whaa??? NO!) and it&#x27;s gone now. If you don&#x27;t want to use it every day, then it is great for applying for a healing serum after microdermabrasion or other treatments. I would recommend allowing one&#x27;s face to heal for several days and following instructions if one has a peel, though. Do the peel instructions first, then after you&#x27;ve healed from the peel, use this to keep your skin glowing.</li>
            <li> I do not give immediate feedback on some items because it take time to see how the product actually works. I have now used this whole bottle and I give it 5 stars. From the first use it made my skin feel like silk. A little goes a long way. It has a nice but slight citrus scent. Most importantly almost immediately my skin had a healthy glow and looked and felt more taut. It cleared up a small but constant breakout on my forehead. I would definitely recommend Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum. The only down side was when I reordered I actually received another similar product that I did not like as well, so if you order this Vitamin C Serum make sure before you open it that you received the correct order. I will update review as I use this product more, I really was not expecting any kind of results right away, but I cannot deny my skin has a clean even tone, not drastic but enough that I can tell and have gotten a couple of comments. I am 58yrs old and live in the desert southwest which is tuff on skin and I have had basil cell carcinoma twice so I try to take really good care of my skin. I was using a prescription medication for my face which cost $75 a tube and it did not seem to do anything and with this serum the breakout on my forehead went away within a few days and has not returned. Right now I am happy but will update if it maintains and I see more improvements.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Vitamin C Serum along with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and I love them. I&#x27;m going on a week of using the products every day and my skin feels hydrated, firmer and overall better looking. I really enjoy the smell of this serum and the way it feels going on. A little does go a long way which is a nice feature for the price point.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Saw results within a few days. Love this line. All natural products that really work as they claim. My skin looks radiant. Absolutely wonderful and a total bargain for the results I have seen!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so good</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a few weeks. I feel I should note after reading many reviews on any product I purchase, I did not buy samples in return for a review. That being said, this is a nice product. It only takes such a small amount of VC and you must use a pressing motion when applying for best results. The consistency, the feeling on your skin, all great. I will purchase this again because I think I have found a winner at much less cost than some brands. It&#x27;s Vitamin C, packaged according to the best standards and really does do a nice job. After a couple of months I should know more. It seems to fit the bill of my prior use of this type of product to the highest standards. Pleased!</li>
            <li> I use this vitamin C serum at night after shower and before bed time. Vitamin C is great for nourishing and strengthening the skin, especially for sun damaged skins. I use it often, mostly every night. Love the product!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product long enough to give it another star, but so far I am pleased. I am not sure if the product offers any &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; improvement, but it certainly smoothes and tightens the skin when applied. I see a big improvement when I apply it under makeup in the mornings. I will continue to use it faithfully and report back after I have given it a longer trial period. I recently added the hyaluronic acid serum to my regime, using the Vitamin C serum in the morning and the hyaluronic acid at night.&lt;br /&gt;I also continue my 10+ years&#x27; use of three Roc products, which have proven to be very effective.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Fine lines are diminishing!</li>
            <li> 100% Recommended ! My skin feels healthier and clearer than it usually is, Smells very nices and it is absorbs quicky in my skin,  Shipping was so fast, and the bottle  were bubble wrapped very well and in perfect condition. I will buy again when it finish</li>
            <li> As always with InstaNatural they have done it again. Their vitamin C serum is amazing. My skin feels tighter and I notice a nice glow. It has a slight citrus scent to it but nothing too strong. I love how nicely and fast it absorbs into my skin. I have even noticed that I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using which is very unlikely for me. I am extremely happy with this product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Amazing, makes my skin feel and look so much better!</li>
            <li> A nice serum that brightens your face. Make sure you follow the directions and use a moisturizer. Great product. Using daily.</li>
            <li> Great Serum!!  My face looks more even toned and clear. Noticed less clogged pores too.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I also make my own but also like to keep this brand around to use a couple times a week due to the added ingredients&lt;br /&gt;it contains that is so beneficial to aging skin.  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Some improvement in deep forehead wrinkles.  It is sticky, but makes your skin appear more youthful.  I use this product at night before bed.  It smells and feels like OJ.</li>
            <li> It smells, looks and feels just like orange juice.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. After cleansing and toning, but not moisturizing, I apply half a dropped to my palms and pat this all over my face and neck. I&#x27;ve only used it but a few times but my skin looks &amp;#34;brighter&amp;#34; and my skin tone has ever so slightly evened out. I would definitely repurchase this product! The consistency of the product is a little more watery than I particularly care for, but it&#x27;s easy to overlook that as long as the product works!</li>
            <li> I have used a couple different serums and this one is the best yet.  It does not have a smell. After you apply you must used additional moisture.  At night in the warm weather I do not use anything else. Seems to make my pores smaller and is actually fading the sunspots.</li>
            <li> Omg I knoticed a difference in two days, this product has changed my life ! Best thing ever out there!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any real difference, but in skin, but didn&#x27;t have any issues really, just using for preventive care.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t notice much change in the appearance in my skin.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin feel moist and smooth.  Pleasant orange fragrance.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND EVERYONE USE THIS!</li>
            <li> So far, so good! I bought this Vitamin C serum a couple weeks ago as a boost to my normal skincare regimen. I am turning 40 this summer, I have been eating &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; for 3 years, and I care about easy, affordable, and effective skin care. I don&#x27;t have a lot of money to be throwing around on trial-and-error skin care, nor a lot of time either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been noticing a significant reduction in my skin hydration recently, especially coming out of a Minnesota winter, but by April, my skin usually snaps back well enough. This year, Mother Nature reminded me of her presence, so I decided to add to my skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used Vitamin C serum by Avon in my twenties. Now, granted, I used that formula 15 years ago, but I remember hating its stickiness, gloppiness, and hint of orange color. It honestly was the color, consistency, and stickiness of honey. Maybe that&#x27;s why I avoided C serums afterward, even though I really like most other Avon products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The InstaNatural Vitamin C serum is NOT sticky, not gloppy, and not medicinal smelling. Its smell is lightly citrus, and the serum absorbs quickly. It does not just &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; on the face; it soaks in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum is also not watery. Some investigation led me to choose InstaNatural over a few competitors due to others&#x27; use of water to give &amp;#34;twice the serum for half the price&amp;#34; or some such claim. It is 1 ounce and not watered down. A drop from the stopper sits on my finger until I decide to apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little does go a long way, like other reviewers have said. I use it everywhere on my face except the lashlines (no need for accidental contact with my eye), my neck, decollete, and left hand (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that the ingredients are organic and that I do not need a separate serum for the hyaluronic acid. The percentages for each key ingredient are standard for proper skin care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The test: I have used the back-of-the-hand test to see if my $20 and my time were worth this serum. Every night and morning, I apply this serum to the left hand and none on the right. I then apply Intensive Care moisture repair lotion on both hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Week One tests indicate, yes, this serum is working. The back of my left hand (tester) is already softer than the other with noticeable recovery when tugged. The back of my right hand (control) still looks like a Minnesotan&#x27;s hand in late spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will check back with updates on occasion. I am encouraged by what I see so far.</li>
            <li> Loving this serum will repurchase definately.</li>
            <li> Am 80 years old..see a marked difference for the better for better</li>
            <li> it does work but it&#x27;s sticky.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because the ingredients contained the same as a name-brand, but very expensive product that I use.  I figured I would give this a shot, as it had to be just as efficient as the expensive product, containing the same ingredients and all, right?  Well, unfortunately no.  My skin is losing that vibrant look, its not as smooth and its not just a slight difference, it&#x27;s quite noticeable.  I&#x27;m not saying the product is bad, the texture is light, its absorbs well, doesn&#x27;t make me break out or cause irritation and the scent is very pleasing, but my skin is not receiving the same effect as that other expensive brand&#x27;s serum had given me.  I was SO badly wanting a less expensive alternative and had such high hopes based on the reviews, but I am sad to say that it&#x27;s not a great alternative, but perhaps a great serum for someone.</li>
            <li> I am huge believer of natural products. Somehow this one to start with smell turns me off. Smells woody...&lt;br /&gt;Havent seen any change in skin</li>
            <li> This was like watered down orange juice, smelled great and I would buy again...</li>
            <li> Very nice product! I really can see a difference of my skin tone and clarity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few weeks now. It has a pleasant citrus smell &amp; I have already noticed a difference in my skin. I will continue to use &amp; will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> So far VERY staisfied with this product.. My oily combination skin has large pores and I&#x27;ve literally had coworkers asking what I&#x27;ve done to my make up.. Which is NOTHING, my powder blends better, my moisturizer is almost never used now.. I&#x27;m going to be picking up a few things from this line, ingredients are better than ANY Caudalie, Clinique, Body Shop, or other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; product.. Do the research, you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves no residue on your skin. This serum is lightweight so it feels great on your face. I&#x27;ve been using it on a scar and I can see some improvement!</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels going on my face and love the way my face feels after using.  My complexion is brighter and skin firmer.  I have stage 2 rosacea and I am cautious about what I use on my skin, but this hasn&#x27;t bothered me at all. I also have very oily skin and was worried about the serum making my skin feel weighted down, but that is not the case.  It is very light and feels great.  I use it morning and night without any issues.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife.  This is her review... &amp;#34;Smells good, texture is good.  I was debating whether I should give 4 stars or 5 stars.  It&#x27;s a good product since it smells like citric, very fresh, very smooth, very convenient to use since it contains both Vitamin C and Rosehip oil.  So instead of 2 products, I now use need 1.  I love it.  However, I have been using Vitamin C and Rosehip oil for a long time, this is my third bottle.  So I guess my skin is very toned and so I don&#x27;t have very significant improvement.  However, I know as you aged, if you don&#x27;t look older, that already means you have been working hard to look good, and young.  People generally think I am in my 30&#x27;s but in fact I am 44 this year.  I wish I could look young, but I am fine with how I look now.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Makes my skin brighter and clearer.</li>
            <li> Love This Vitamin CE Ferulic Serum by InstaNatural.  I have been using several InstaNatural products, and the love affair continues.  I have tried several different Vitamin C, HC with botanicals, anti-aging, anti-hypermigmentation products, and this is my favorite, daily go to serum.  It glides on silky smooth, and has a light citrusy scent.  It is thick, which I like, so give it a minute to absorb then apply your favorite moisturizer.  I personally use and love InstaNatural Vitamin C Moisturizer.  For me, this is the logical perfect compliment cream to use after the Vitamin C Serum.  This Serum comes with a dropper.  That is my preference for easy control of use.  It only take a couple drops for my face, and a couple more for my neck and décolletage.  I don&#x27;t waste a bit, and rub what little is left on my hands on my arms and back of my hands until all is absorbed.</li>
            <li> Age spots are lightening a lot. And my skin looks and feels great.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum; it smells nice and leaves my skin feeling great. I can tell a difference in a short time. I wish the bottle were a little larger, but it&#x27;s definitely a good product.</li>
            <li> Great Item! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Nice smell..non sticky...visibly firming</li>
            <li> This serum is thick enough that is easy to spread on your skin, but light enough that it absorbs quickly and easily.  In hot weather I wear it alone, but in dryer times, I pair it with the Instanatural Vit C moisturizer.  My skin is smooth and my pores are barely noticeable.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Havent used long enough to see long term results but i do love the way it makes my skin feel! and it has a great scent</li>
            <li> The product smells nice and came as ordered.  I haven&#x27;t really seen any changes yet (a couple of months), but I understand that may take time.  I&#x27;m usually impatient for  results, especially if others claim to see results faster....  I would consider ordering again and would have no problem ordering from this company.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service and a wonderful product. I will be a lifetime buyer. :)</li>
            <li> Not any better than products I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> Really like it. Use on face and neck.</li>
            <li> Working better than other vitamin C series I have used.  It has not exacerbated  my eczema.</li>
            <li> Was looking for Vitamin C serum and saw this product from Amazon. A bit skeptical but because of good reviews, I gave it a try, even bought 2 items with the Vit C from this brand&#x27;s line of products. Started trying it when I received the item, but I noticed of having breakouts after using. I just gave the 2 items that I bought to someone else though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards.</li>
            <li> Love this product.it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I use everyday and has helped my skin look tighter and has a nice glow to it! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this serum. My face breaks out so easily but this along with the Rosehip oil has done wonders for my skin. My skin really does have a glow now. I don&#x27;t know if I had that as child even. The smell is wonderful as well. Hope to try the Retina A serum soon as well. This company is great.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice vitamin c serum. It is a nice sized bottle. The dropper makes it easy to get the right amount out and in the right places. It leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. It doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky after feeling like some do. I received a sample to review.</li>
            <li> This has been a tremendous boost for my skin.  My skin tone is becoming more even and I experience less breaking out.  I use this in conjuction with the Instanatural Retinol Moisturizer. The company is great, they take the time to email you for questions on their products.  I have started buying other items from their line and wholly support this company.</li>
            <li> good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff love how it glides on. Makes my skin feel great. Has started evening my complexion. Can&#x27;t say enough about this little bottle. Use it under your make up for all day benefits!</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE!!!! Broke me out like never before. After using this for a week, I just randomly got a bunch of rashes and pimples and my face has NEVER done this. PLEASE AVOID!!!!</li>
            <li> For the price this vitamin c is the bomb</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now and don&#x27;t see any results. It&#x27;s not making any difference on my skin. Not sure how it has so many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I don&#x27;t find it drying.  But my friends are have noticed and are asking what I am using.  this is one of this terrific line that I just love. it.  One of my friends told me just this morning that she is using it now and loves it too.</li>
            <li> Texture is light, but moisturizing (almost creamy). Thicker than other C serums I&#x27;ve tried, so easier to apply. Smell is wonderfully citrus-y.</li>
            <li> good stuff, skin looks younger and healthy</li>
            <li> As a former esthetician, i do not  see any results after using it.  Skin should be brighter. dark spots should lift.. doubt if the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34; is active</li>
            <li> Feels great on my face.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C Serum gives my face a beautiful glow. Few people already complimented me. It&#x27;s the best Vit. C product I ever bought. Just try it for few days and you&#x27;ll see the difference.</li>
            <li> I am almost done with this serum and its time to get a new one.  I loved how this serum made my skin feel.  It has a citrus-y scent and I use it both for morning and night and i have noticed a difference in the way my skin feels and looks. My skin feels refreshed,  and hydrated and not dull.  I have a lot of sun spots and this serum is helping with brightening up my skin.  Thank you,</li>
            <li> A great product that I have reordered and the customer service is the best!</li>
            <li> i just start to try this think will see!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and dries quickly so no wait time. Just started last week so am looking forward to it doing its work.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I love the way it made my skin feel and was not greasy and also adsorbed well. I noticed a difference after about a week or so. I will definitely be purchasing this product again. I have also recommended it to my friends and family!! Thank uou!</li>
            <li> I have only used this for a couple weeks but have felt like it at least made my skin feel smoother. I think its too soon to see any major improvements. The ingredients are ones known to be beneficial to the skin and it smells great. Definitely worth checking out.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing product. Works perfectly with organic coconut oil. My favorite!</li>
            <li> My skin has been a lot more glowing and has cleared up and evened out significantly since I&#x27;ve started using this product.  I also use the VItamin C moisturizer from Instanatural.  I use the Vitamin C products in the morning and the Instanatural Retinol products at night.</li>
            <li> I did research vitamin C serums and I found that yellow serums mean two things: 1) the vitamin c has decayed, or 2) the company made the serum yellow to hide potential decay.  This serum is yellow and that is concerning to me.  It has kind of a funky smell.  Other than that, it goes on smoothly and didn&#x27;t seem to cause any problems with my skin.</li>
            <li> I combined these drops with my face mask as part of my facial cleansing cycle. My skin is sensitive, so these drops help restore the vitamins and moisture. It goes well with my face mask and did not break out my skin. Thanks for helping enhance my skin.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum from Instanatural, although not a pure Argan oil product, it does contain Argan Oil along with vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, feralic acid, sea buckthorn oil, rosehip oil, plan stem oil, and pomegranate. I use this every other day, morning and night, with Argan Oil. Although the bottle indication said it can be used everyday, I prefer not to have my skin get used to it. When used with the Argan Oil above, it gives your skin a nice glow. It makes your skin look well-hydrated. You will probably see its anti-aging effects in the long run. If you&#x27;re young, it&#x27;s good to take care of your skin early with Vitamin C serum and Argan Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key to a young-looking skin is keeping it always hydrated and moisturized. I highly recommend Instanatural now that I&#x27;ve tried their products and have been using it for a couple of months now. Like I said above, they offer a lifetime money-back guarantee and that really says a lot.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel great!</li>
            <li> I just started to use the product. it is too early for me to rate.</li>
            <li> Great Serum! Love the smell and it really helps my super dry skin stay hydrated. It also helps smoothe out the fine lines. Use it twice daily,under make-up and before moisturizer and at night.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C has a thicker feeling than other vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve tried. InstaNatural also has a very pleasant faint scent that disappears within minutes of application. This serum glides on my skin and absorbed quickly. This Vitamin C doesn&#x27;t feel greasy. My face also doesn&#x27;t feel tight and dry after I apply the Vitamin C. I use it morning and night. I love it under my makeup because Vitamin C also is a great sunscreen! Look at me being all smart and responsible with my skin!!  I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum on my face, neck and the back of one hand!! Just so I can show you the difference after just 2 weeks of use!! Not only is InstaNatural helping my complexion, but the Vitamin C serum can help reduce inflammation! Even scars!!  Check my full review at [...] I was supplied a bottle of InstaNatural Vitamin C for the purpose of this review. All opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this serum.  I purchased because of the 20% Vitamin C and the Hyaluronic Acid.  More time will tell if this product makes a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this product. Has agreat smell and work well.I like to use it after shaving, keeps my face soft.</li>
            <li> Great. Love how soft my skin is. So happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is really great for residual acne scars and issues with skin tone. I apply this twice a day after using toner (i used thayers rose flavored witch hazel) and before using moisturizer  (should wait for the serum to sry before adding moisturizer!). It has really helped even out my skin tone and get rid of acne scars and is helping prevent new acne along with the witch hazel. I would definitely recommend this and will be ordering it again soon!!</li>
            <li> i actually did not expect much from the product. I did have some breakout during first two weeks of use so I stopped as I saw somebody also wrote review about breakout experience.  After some times I tried again out of curiosity.  No breakout, not much discomfort. I continued to use and now I already used up 2/3 of the bottle. I think my skin condition is good, brighter with even tone. Of course I also changed my skincare routine by washing face with green tea powder, honey and yogurd . But I think the credit goes to Instanatural a Vitamin C Serum.  Only the improvement is a bit slow. Will buy again serum from InstaNatural but I am considering Age-defying Skin clearing or Skin Brightening serum, may be it will deliver better, faster result ????</li>
            <li> I really like the vitamin c and all the other components of this serum .At first i saw clearness and a more bright complexion of my face.Then after like one week it made me break out. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> It seems like a good product and a lot of people have noticed improvements, I just do not think it is necessarily right for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only 24 so I can&#x27;t testify the results it has on the effects of aging. However, my skin seemed much brighter when I used the product. This product also contains Vitamin E, which is important to actually rejuvenating the texture of skin and not just the appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My issue: It was just too harsh for my skin. I have combination skin and I tend to have some dry areas around my nose and mouth. I was fine the first two weeks I was using the product [Used product once a day as part of my PM routine], but I noticed that once I applied the product later on that the dry areas of my face would burn. I do not use the product on my face anymore, but I still use it on my neck and chest without any problems.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest product! I love it ! Just perfect for me and I recommend it highly - Fast Shipping too !</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I have changed to this serum in the morning and used it for just over a month(followed by my regular day moisturiser) and to the Instanatural 2.5% Retinol serum in the morning.  I had been using a more expensive product with a high hyaluronic acid percentage, in a pump bottle.  The Vitamin C serum  is a ‘milky yellow’ colour, presumably due to the sea buckthorn.  I use 4 drops on my face – if more the subsequent moisturiser ‘balls’.  I like the expiry data printed clearly on the bottle.  I had problems with using a dropper rather than a pump, I think I knocked the vanity unit with the dropper too hard – as the end was broken slightly after a few days.  I live in New Zealand, and Instanatural doesn’t send directly to NZ – so order via Amazon.  Ordering a single bottle is expensive, so I ordered 4 1-oz serum bottles, the shipping was over $25.  So, each bottle costs over $6 more than for US customers.  Bottom line – I didn’t notice any difference changing to Instanatural serums except that I now seem to have fine ‘smokers lines’. I still want to economise on serums.  i-herb shipping is $8 for a large order, so if getting supplements anyway,  other products basically have free shipping – so will investigate what products are on offer.</li>
            <li> I never write online reviews unless the product is more than worthwhile erring on spectacular. This Vitamin C serum is excellent and delivers exactly what the product intends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have extremely problematic combination skin and it seems like every 10 years or so I have a hard time with makeup and numerous other skincare products that no longer seem to work. When a woman enters her mid-30s things really start to change - from the entire face structure, to its shape and texture. Let me just say, it hasn&#x27;t been a very pleasant experience for me and I&#x27;ve been diligent in giving my skin an overhaul.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum, in a matter of a few days, has dramatically evened out my complexion and has shrunk my pores to near invisible. I have a dewy glow and my skin looks plumper and more fresh. The sun spots and other brown spots are lightening and are being replaced with beautiful, new, healthy, glowing skin. I am floored with how well this serum has worked so far and am very pleased with the results. I look forward to purchasing this product in the future for some time to come as it has helped me dramatically change my problematic skin for the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, InstaNatural! This serum is truly amazing. :)</li>
            <li> Great results so far - 2 weeks in and brighter complexion with smoother skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for one week and so far I like what I see. I use this along with the botanical kinetics™ skin care starter set oily/normal skin from Aveda. This seems to add a little extra glow to my skin.</li>
            <li> Feels very nice on my skin. Been using for a week. Will see how it works long term.</li>
            <li> I purchased this looking for a more affordable Vitamin C serum.  I was excited because this also has Seabuckthorn and Rose Hip Seed, which are great for maturing skin.  Shipping was unbelievably fast!  The serum is...watery/runny going on, which I don&#x27;t like and a lot of vitamin C serums are like; however, it completely absorbed into skin and did NOT leave a tacky/greasy residue, which is a pet peeve of mine.  There is a fragrance, I guess I would call it herbal, which takes me a back a little when I apply it, but again, the scent does not linger.  It&#x27;s not making my skin any worse, does not cause breakouts, but I have not yet seen a difference in my sun spots/hyperpigmentation.  I do not know if I will be repurchasing this as I tend to try a lot of serums, but I am not dissatisfied whatsoever with trying this product or its performance.  Quality product for the price!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. The price is great and it works very well. I started using it about 3 months ago. After 3 days, when I was getting ready in the morning, I realized the fine lines through my cheeks had almost disappeared! I called my husband and asked him to take a hard look at my face, asking, &amp;#34;Do you notice anything&amp;#34;  He looked nervous (haha) but he looked hard and finally said, &amp;#34;you know, your face looks younger! Less wrinkles!&amp;#34; It&#x27;s true. You have to keep it up though. It also helps to do it morning and night. It also gets rid of or lightens any dark spots. I love it, I&#x27;m worried the price will creep up. I follow it up with St Ives Collagen Elastin Face Moisturizer, I haven&#x27;t tried the moisturizer made by InstaNatural YET!   I will soon.</li>
            <li> I like the product ..it is pleasant and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does not happen overnight (I&#x27;ve been using for 4 months or so) - but using vitamin c serum alternatively with hyaluronic serum has made a noticeable difference.  All drying and a few lines are much less noticeable.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. I used this all summer long and it didn&#x27;t do a thing.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product 2 stars simply because of the brand and customer service. This particular product did not work for me. In fact it made my already acne prone skin worse. I discontinued usage after 2 weeks buttttt the folks over at Insta Natural are awesome! The customer service is impeccable in my opinion. They addressed my concerns and offered me a full refund or an exchange. I chose the exchange since I do love the brand and what they stand for. So far the skin clearing serum has been working out! Yay!</li>
            <li> After two days my skin is already clearer and smoother!</li>
            <li> I can see the healing and rejuvenating effects from this product - I LOVE it. I would purchase it again!</li>
            <li> Love my vitamin C, for whole face &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> I was given this product for free and in exchanged I’m providing my honest opinion. Vitamin C- Serum has helped my skin stay youthful and have great, radiant skin. It has great components that help the heathy cell naturally generate and to have the healthy glow in my face. I like the product because I can fell a change in my skin. I can feel the product is helping because my skin looks healthier even with the fact that in my hectic life style I sometimes forget to keep up with my beauty routine. But Vitamin C has given my face back the youthful look.</li>
            <li> I am 62 years young and I say that honestly. I don&#x27;t have one wrinkle around my eyes, my neck is in great shape, my skin is clear and no one EVER believes I am 62.I date men in their forties, but I am honest about my age. I started out late taking care of my skin, mid-forties, but was lucky, good genes or something. Every am, I clean my face and neck. I use this Vit C Serum, which I add Philosophy Vit C powder to it about every 3 days, I use a Vit C cream I purchased here, an eye serum and neck cream. At night, I use LaRochePosay Redermic, retinol serum, a caffeine infused eye cream and a Vit A cream mixed with Vit A oil. And of course, a neck cream. I love this serum, Vit C literally brightens your face when you apply it. At least this serum does for me. It has a ton of antioxidants and builds collagen back up in your skin. I see a difference from when I first began applying it. I am not paid to say this, nor did I get a sample to try. What people do not understand, is you use Vit C in the daytime and Retinol at night. If you are in your twenties and thirties, you can go with Roc, at night. But by all means, use this serum every morning, no matter what your age.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it makes my skin feel. A must try.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  I like the way it goes on, and the way it feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum is a nice serum for the skin. It definitely brightens and refines the pores and leaves your skin feeling soft and supple.  I have been trying some different InstaNatural brand all natural facial products on a promotion and overall these are becoming my go to brand for serums.  I used to rely on moisturizers and cleansers as my regime but find adding serums have drastically improved my overall skin health and look.</li>
            <li> A few drops with other serums is wonderful for dry skin.</li>
            <li> excellent serum, may use on whole body</li>
            <li> This product  works as expected. Thanks a lot  because it&#x27;samazing and would like to purchase a second bottle!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge improvement but I have noticed some. Fine lines aren&#x27;t as noticeable and it does make my skin feel soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a month so I definitely intend to give it more time.</li>
            <li> This serum is lightweight and has a very nice citrusy smell.  It goes on a bit tacky/sticky but is quickly absorbed into the skin.  I&#x27;ve been using for about a month now and I have noticed an overall appearance to my skin.  My skin appears more radiant, brighter and more hydrated.  I&#x27;ve also noticed fewer of the fine lines I used to have.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a month it works fine --- hoping for more clearness and youthful look.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It was great for my skin. It would soften it, brighten it, and it was amazing for my pimples.  I loved how my face seemed to clear and brighten up. The only con I had with it is that the bottle is sooo small. It was also difficult getting the last bit out of the bottle with the suction bulb.</li>
            <li> The serum arrived on time, well-packed and so far I am enjoying using it.  It is too soon to tell if it is of any real benefit to my 80-year old face but it feels good.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Just received mines today. Face is very soft! Keeps my face from being oily. Doesn&#x27;t try out skin. Gives face a natural glow</li>
            <li> I like 20% Vitamin C serum because it provides my skin the right source of moisturizing and bright up my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I feel this product has really help with the slight sun damage I have on my chest.  I would totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Realy iTS very good this prodac</li>
            <li> Really enjoyed this product. Only fault would be that I would have preferred a pump dispenser, so product would&#x27;ve remained more potent.</li>
            <li> I feel that their other serums (skin brightening &amp; age defying/skin clearing) work much better.</li>
            <li> It was Very nice for my skin and face :) I would like to purchase this again in the future.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum is almost clear and has a sweet smell with a hint of citrus and just the slightest whiff of spice. The new, improved formula has a slightly more viscous consistency, which makes it easier to apply to the skin. It comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a dropper cap for easy dispensing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the bottle is blend of helpful ingredients such as aloe, vitamin C (L-ascorbic acid) 20%, vitamin E (tocopherol), MSM, hyaluronic acid, sodium PCA, and jojoba oil, in an herbal infusion. The formula improves the appearance of the skin by increasing hydration, reducing the effect of fine wrinkles, and removing dead skin cells. It has an immediate soothing effect on dry, flakey skin. I have also found that regular application seems to minimize the appearance of facial pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are also many well-designed scientific studies that demonstrate that topical vitamin C significantly reverses the damage done to the skin by the sun when used for several months. Of course, regular application over a period of many weeks or months is necessary to see the promised benefits--it is not an instant cure for damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is best applied after a bath or shower. The solution is slightly thick but is not at all oily and just a few drops massaged into the skin immediately causes a slight tingly sensation because it is so concentrated. Apply a moisturizer a few minutes later to prevent drying the skin. Storing it in the refrigerator makes it feel even more refreshing and also keeps it safe from light and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural provided vitamin C serum for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Love love this serum! I&#x27;m on my second bottle! You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> So far so good, too soon for more results...an old scar on my cheek is healing and not red and sore looking any more.  I have not had the product or been using for very long and have used other products the scar has never looked so good. So I am impressed and happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Love it! Makes my face feel fresh and my moisturizer go on so smooth. Nice scent as well.</li>
            <li> Different than other stuff I&#x27;ve used but seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> evens out skin tone and moisture. smells great!</li>
            <li> Great vitamin C serum. I use it after my dermarolling session twice a week, and it takes away the redness in an instant.</li>
            <li> i dont really like this product but i think it would help with antiaging if i used it more. i felt that i dried my skin out leaving it drier and i already have dry skin im trying to hydrate so i stopped using this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It works well.</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin c serum for a few weeks now, it seems to be working, I have noticed a difference. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have used many vitamin C serums and this one is a favorite.  At first the color threw me (very orange) but the results came fast.  I spend a lot of time outside gardening and walking so I need something to address my dark spots.  I use this every day and can say that my skin tone has remained stable.  No new spots appearing, no darkening of spots already there (some have lightened) and my skin looks pretty smooth for my age.  The serum is a little thicker than others I have tried and I have to allow time for it to be absorbed (maybe 8 minutes) into my skin before adding moisturizer in the evening.  Very happy with this and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Has definitely brighten up my skin and clear acne and spots.  I have the scar gel (which I just ran out of and will b purchasing more) the stretch mark cream, skin clearing serum, vitamin c moisturizer.  I can not stress enough how well instanatural products have improved my skin. Great skincare line. I have leftover scars from folliculitis on my legs and these products have helped my legs as well.&lt;br /&gt;Products: A++++</li>
            <li> About to turn 32 so I thought I should try this as an anti-aging serum. So far so good! Leaves my skin soft and smells great</li>
            <li> This Serum is amazing and feels so good on my skin. I am very particular about the stuff I put on my skin but I love this Vitamin C Serum and would recommend it everyone.</li>
            <li> I love all the natural Beauty products made by Insta natural because everything is really good quality. I like the bottle design with the dropper so no germs get into the bottle. One little drop  goes a long way. This Vitamin C serum is very thick and a little drop is good for the entire face. I focus on the fine lines around my eyes and on my forehead. Love the result the second morning. Five stars as always.</li>
            <li> Great buy for the price! Great texture. Great scent. Great customer service follow up.</li>
            <li> The serum was oxidized when I received it. It was not pale white but dark orange.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my face feeling smooth and it smells great. I like the dropper design which makes it really easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is rich, goes on smoothly and you can tell its pure. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few nights now and you can already see a difference in my skin. I wasn&#x27;t aware my skin needed vitamin C till a friend said so. I&#x27;m glad i picked this brand&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> It is similar to a product I was using but for about half the price.  Seems to be a quality product and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Heard about this in a men&#x27;s health magazine,  and decided to give it a try. I would suggest you mix it with the hyaluronic acid, as well as a good non-greasy moisturizer , and you are all set.</li>
            <li> As a product tester I compare dozens of skin care products, and I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations from fragrance to long-term results. I hope these are helpful to you!&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance: Citrusy. No added/artificial fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;~ Color and texture: This is a thick liquid the color of orange juice.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Smooth and slippery, feels somewhat like a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption: Moisturized and soft. No film or barely perceptible film.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: It works well on my oily, sensitive skin, and should be fine for others.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No.&lt;br /&gt;~ Packaging: 1oz blue glass bottle with squeeze dropper top.&lt;br /&gt;~ Immediate cosmetic effects:* Lighter and smoother looking, with a reduction in very fine lines.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential long-term effectiveness:* Excellent. Packed full of active ingredients for healing, improving skin elasticity, reducing inflammation, and fighting signs of aging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.</li>
            <li> My skin drinks this in and it really diminishes the fine lines and wrinkles.  Not greasy, soaks in beautifully and smells yummy.  I put it on while my skin is still slightly damp from the shower and about 6 drops is plenty to cover my face, neck and decolletee.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. First time using it and I fell in love with it. I love the smell of aroma every time I apply it to my face. No side effects like blemishes or redness. I will definetly purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This is awesome!  I quickly noticed a better texture with my skin and a more even tone. I am 43 and am constantly in the sun so I have some skin spots and wrinkles. This serum has me hooked in its results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few weeks but I like the product. It smells great and is thick dose not  burn when you put it on. cant tell if theirs been much progress though</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of expensive vitamin c&#x27;s and this is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for about one month now.  I use it mainly for the drak spots removal.  So far I have not seen any positive results but I believe it is too early to tell.  Three stars for good customer service.  I will probably update my review after I finish my first bottle.</li>
            <li> I was able to try 2 products before I purchased. One being the Vitamin C Serum For Face. Was shipped on the 22nd and received on the 24th. Been using for a week. I have no more dry patches. Like the smell and consistency of product. Dries fast. Does not sting or irritate face. I would definitely buy the next time.</li>
            <li> My favorite skin serum with a nice pleasant citrus smell. Immediately your face responds to a different feel&lt;br /&gt;of smoothness &amp; tightening. I am on my 2nd bottle. A keeper for me. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> Really great stuff. Family members noticed the improvement without me even asking. Highly recommended.  Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> This product was provided for free for testing purposes. I used it in conjunction with InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer, so I can&#x27;t speak to how effective the product would be alone, but combined with the moisturizer, it was outstanding. I have been using both twice a day for approximately a week. The biggest difference I have noticed is with my malasma. I am prone to malasma and during pregnancy developed an area of darkening underneath one of my eyes and spots across my cheekbones. After only a week, I am noticing that these are actually lighter. I&#x27;m hopeful that these will continue to lighten.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum is an orange color and smells like oranges, which I happened to like.  For those who don&#x27;t love citrus, the scent goes away almost immediately after application/absorption.  It leaves your skin tacky for a minute but absorbs fairly quickly without leaving any residue.  I felt like it stayed where you applied it, but when i dotted it around my face a bit and then smoothed it out, that seemed to work better for me.  The directions were to use a few drops, but  I initially found it a bit difficult to know how much to use to get proper coverage.  That said, I think my only real complaint is going to be when I get to the bottom of the botle.  It&#x27;s a glass jar with a dropper, so I&#x27;m not sure how you use all the product without wasting a portion at the bottom.</li>
            <li> I use this product before the Vitamin C moisturizer. Not sure which one is doing the job, or both, but my dry winter skin is much softer. No more flaky skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I liked this serum from the very first application - it gives my skin toned and tightened feel and appearance. It has nice texture and works beautifully under my moisturizer and makeup. The ingredient list is fantastic - all powerful antioxidants and nourishing oils, and I really appreciate the absence of fragrance, as well as other chemicals, typically found in skincare.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  After reading that topical Vitamin C was recommended by &amp;#34;Dr Oz&amp;#34; as highly beneficial for the skin, and after my dermatologist confirmed this to me, I decided to purchase a bottle of Vitamin C serum.  Not only does this product have the recommended percentage of Vitamin C content (20%), it includes other beneficial products like hyaluronic acid and different plant oils.  I love how quickly it smooths into my skin, and the slightly citrus smell is yummy!  Does it work?  My 50+ year old skin is definitely clearer, smoother, &amp; brighter!!  It is also nice &amp; soft, without the &amp;#34;rough&amp;#34; patches I have experienced in the past.  I highly recommend this product!  In fact, I recommended it to one of my friends and SHE bought it; she has thanked me almost every day since!</li>
            <li> I use this serum every night before applying my moisturizer. In just  few, short weeks this product has completely transformed my skin. I&#x27;m having less breakouts and my skin is staying very hydrated in the harsh, cold climate i&#x27;m exposed to. My skin tone has eened out significantly and even super old acne scars, and one chemical burn on my face have faded significantly. The results from a few short weeks of using this product have gone beyond my initial expectations. I cannot wait to continue to see results. Also, this product works particularly well after dermarolling and using a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for free testing purposes. However, these are my unbiased and honest opinions.</li>
            <li> The vitamin C serum is orange like carrots or an orange. It is in a small container with an eye dropper to dispense the product. A. little goes a long way. It glides on smoothly and and is very concentrated. I like the natural ingredience in the instanatural products and have been happy with everything I have received from them. It is a very good company to deal with. This review was given after receiving a complimentary bottle of the serum for an open and honest opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> Yet another great product from InstaNaturals. I would have to say this is my favorite along with the hyalouronic acid serum. I have combination skin (running more dry these days) and I break out.  My skin is a little thin and I find the hyalournic plumps and hydrates it the most but if I could only choose one product I would choose this one because it contains both the hyalournic acid and vitamin c (in higher concentration). No matter what you try from this line you won&#x27;t loose.  I just prefer some of their products over others but all of them are high quality.</li>
            <li> For about 2 weeks I have been using this serum along with InstaNatural Vitamin C Moisturizer. WOW! The combination of these two products exceeded my expectations on every level. I have combination skin that tends to \\&quot;shine\\&quot; pretty easily, so I have kind of avoided serums, since I am pretty nervous about using anything with oil in it. However, since recently falling madly in love with high quality argon oil, I am becoming a little more open minded. Because I have sensitive skin, I generally read reviews like crazy before trying anything new, and I am very cautious about what I put on my skin (I no longer even use toner, only pure rose water or nothing at all before moisturizing). Due to other high reviews, I gave this a chance and I am so glad I did. These two products have actually transformed my skin, and I don&#x27;t think I have said that about anything before (again, except argon oil). My skin looks healthier than ever, more stable in terms of not getting too dry or oily than ever before, and even some redness I have dealt with for MANY YEARS has lessened considerably. Seriously amazing. As for this serum, it is fantastic. You can use it under anything, it is soothing and will not sting or burn even if you just exfoliated. It is a bright yellow color, but it soaks in nicely. I enjoy the citrus scent. Be aware it may almost feel \\&quot;sticky\\&quot; &#x27;the first 15-20 seconds after you put it on, but just pat it and soaks in beautifully, you won&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s there after that. I do need to note that this product was reviewed free for testing purposes, but I can assure you this product is the real deal and I am 100% without a doubt going to be buying it regularly from now on. I am also very impressed with the company&#x27;s eye serum and gel, and will review that next, but this product and the Vitamin C Skin Moisturizer are simply off the charts amazing. Can&#x27;t recommend them enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it!  I&#x27;ve used it for 3 days and my face is way brighter and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I like the Vitamin C Serum very much.  My skin feels and looks healthy.  So far, I think all of your products are excellent.</li>
            <li> So far really like this product.  It makes your skin incredibly soft.  And I think it&#x27;s lightening my sun spots.  I plan to purchase again</li>
            <li> I love the vitamin C serum. It brightens and tightens my skin. It makes my face smooth and radiant. I love how it makes me look and feel.</li>
            <li> I used for one month. It makes my face feeling more smooth.  I already bought the second one.  Keep using it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am using my second bottle now. My face appears to have less dark spots than before. Friends are commenting how good my skin looks.  It appears tighter and brighter than ever! I plan to continue to use this product asy daily skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is a natural way to produce collagen and great natural moisturizer for the skin. I used it on my clean skin and it makes my skin very soft. It is the one I was looking for. It smells a little bit strange but absorbs very fast.I just &amp;lt;3 it and I can&#x27;t wait to see its long term results :)</li>
            <li> Great product. I notice my skin feels smoother and softer. My skin tone seems more balanced as well.</li>
            <li> So far this product does exactly what it says it will do for your skin! I am using it twice a day and I do see a noticeably firmer, more clear complexion. I am anxious to see the long term results. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a week now and I can tell that my skin is lighter and brighter. Absorbs really fast to the skin. The smell is ok, sort of like old oranges but you don&#x27;t smell it after it absorbs.</li>
            <li> I am 28 years old and have been using vitamin c serums for about a year now to even my skin tone and keep my skin looking young. This one is my favorite so far, it does not dry my skin out like others. I use a cotton ball for easier application, and store in the refrigerator. This serum leaves my skin glowing and refreshed, and also helps even out/fade old acne scars. Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I just turned 60 and have been noticing my wrinkles a lot more. I read that Hyaluronic Acid helped produce collagen and would help with wrinkles.  I have been using this product about 2 weeks.  It is thick and I only have to use about 4 drops.  After applying it makes it does feel like my skin is a little tighter.  Per the instructions, you are supposed to put moisturizer on after.  I have been doing that.  I haven&#x27;t seen drastic changes yet, but my skin does feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Have been using for about 3 weeks, have seen a significant improvement on skin texture. Had dark spots and a small scar which are disappearing! Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural exceeds my expectations yet again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C serum had been an excellent addition to my skincare routine, and, has noticeably made a difference since adding this serum.  I have noticed a brightening effect, and an overall smoother, healthier complexion to my combination skin (oily/dry) which is also acne prone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This instanatural routine has been working great. I have received a number of comments on my skin:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the AM: vitamin c cleanser, skin brightening serum, skin brightening lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the PM: vitamin c cleanser, vitamin c serum, PM lotion (full of peptides)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop spending your money on expensive skincare lines. After trying many, instanatural tops them all at 1/5 of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with acne proned skin.. I understand, you&#x27;re hesitant to change skincare lines. Don&#x27;t be hesitant, if anything the (entire) line of products will keep your acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased feedback, however, this does not change how much I love the InstaNatural skin care line.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and have seen a noticeable improvement in the texture of my skin.  I am 63 years old and it has softened the wrinkles and fine lines.  Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 year old college student who didn&#x27;t take much care of my skin due to a lot of partying, alcohol, bad sleeping habits and poor diet decisions.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try this serum. Smelled like oranges! And it soaked into my skin pretty quickly so I was still able to wear makeup over it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d apply this serum on my face twice a day, morning and night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 2 weeks my skin has improved ALOT. Not even lying guys!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;And usually I always break out with a zit or 2 before I start my period, but ever since using this I haven&#x27;t had that happen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this now! And stock up on it! That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m doing !&lt;br /&gt;I plan on buying every product instaNatural offers!</li>
            <li> Weird smell, sorta like rotten oranges. I stopped using it after 1 week so I can&#x27;t really comment on the effectiveness</li>
            <li> And this is now my new favorite skin serum. I&#x27;ve tried a lot the past few months...anything natural with all the key ingredients. I have to say this one may take the cake with awesome smell of fresh oranges, a thick consistency that absorbs quickly and has been slowly but surely tightening up my pores and possibly evening out some discoloration and sun spots I have had on my face for a few years. I&#x27;m really impressed and haven&#x27;t seen any negative effects yet and my skin is usually very sensitive. I also like that unlike some other serums, this one doesn&#x27;t make my skin more sensitive to the sun, so I don&#x27;t need to layer sunscreen over it.</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love the benefits of vitamin c serum. Leaves skin ultra smooth.</li>
            <li> This vitamin C Serum makes my skin feel firmer and is nice under moisturizer or sunscreen. I live in the mountains and do not wear makeup everyday but skincare is a must in this climate. I can feel my skin soaking up the vitamins and I love that this product has a combo of all of the best ingredients so that I do not have to have a million little bottles around or spend ridiculous amounts of time applying them all separately. Thanks for making such a high quality product!!!!</li>
            <li> Wife&#x27; review -- everything this company makes is great.</li>
            <li> I adore this product. The scent is light and the serum absorbs quickly. Since I do not like products that are heavy or oily, I really love that it is neither.  Prior to using the Vitamin C Serum, I had trouble with breakouts due to the summer heat.  I have been using the serum for a little over a week and the breakouts are almost completely cleared up!  My pores appear smaller and my face has a radiant glow. Great product!</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing! I love the entire InstaNatural product line, but this serum is my favorite so far. It makes my skin feel younger, tighter, smoother and fresher than other serums I&#x27;ve tried in the past. The smell isn&#x27;t too bad, there&#x27;s a hint of citrus but the sea buckthorn can be a bit overpowering first thing in the morning, the smell fades away as soon as the serum is dry. Some days I don&#x27;t even bother with a moisturizer afterwards because I feel like the oils in the serum is enough.</li>
            <li> I recently heard that Vitamin C serum is great for aging skin because it fights &amp;#34;free radicals&amp;#34; which cause cancer. Considering I have a history of skin cancer I jumped on the chance to try out this serum. I have been using it for two weeks and I really like it, it has a light fresh citrus-like scent, a quick drying thin serum texture, and works well under makeup. I cannot attest to what it does long term, but it feels refreshing, goes on light, and gives a light moisturizing feel. I would suggest using a regular moisturizer on top of this at night, and some sort of a sunscreen moisturizer during the day.&lt;br /&gt;I ALWAYS give HONEST opinions of everything no matter if I received it for free, a discounted price, or regular price. I did receive this product at a reduced price however not all Insta-Natural products are a hit for me and I do not hold back my opinions if they are negative. This serum and the skin-clearing serum are the only two that I really like for my skin type out off all the products from this line I have tried so far and I highly recommend them! :)</li>
            <li> vitamin c serum is awesome. my face become brighter and more radiant. Freckles get lighter too.&lt;br /&gt;Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my second brand I&#x27;m trying.I found a lot of positive review so I was curious. People&#x27;s description was that the color is  milky white.The one I received was orange juice color. I tried it anyway being Vitamin C,maybe it is suppose to be that color. The result was gummy and sticky. Too much citrus smell.&lt;br /&gt;Not liking it ordered another brand.</li>
            <li> I love this product it&#x27;s just the price for me is a little bit high to buy frequently but I will put again love it.</li>
            <li> It smells great and it sinks quickly into the skin. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft! Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> Fast drying, citrus scented, non sticky formula. I use it full strength on my face and mix a few drops with body lotion and apply all over. Nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle says follow up with a moisturizer, so I&#x27;m thinking a water based one so it can continue sucking water from the air for all day hydration. I like it.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with the InstaNatural brand and their amazing products.  I&#x27;ve ordered quite a few of them, and I&#x27;m impressed with every single one. The packaging is awesome (glass bottle with dropper lid), and the product inside is superior to most products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.&lt;br /&gt;This Vitamin C Serum is full of wonderful ingredients (vitamin c, argan oil, rosehip oil, plan stem cells, and pomegranate, just to name a few).&lt;br /&gt;The serum goes on smoothly, smells amazing, has a slight cooling effect, and over the past couple of weeks, I&#x27;m actually seeing results!&lt;br /&gt;I usually have circles and bags under my tired mom-eyes, and after a couple weeks of this, my eyes haven&#x27;t looked this bright since pre-kids!</li>
            <li> Made my face breakout thought it would be a great product to use everyone skin is different I guess</li>
            <li> I had a break out last month due to stress and I have been using all kinds of vitamin C serums to try to deal with the scars left on my skin and so far I have to see I do see a good result.&lt;br /&gt;The discoloration on my skin has been improving significantly, it is still there but now I can easily cover it with light foundation or concealer. I will continue to try using it and hopefully I can see a bigger improvement</li>
            <li> i love it, received 3 compliments, 2 from strangers and one whom i had not seen in a very long time!! skin glows!!</li>
            <li> Trust you need this in your life, Organic Aloe and Antioxidants in one? You just can&#x27;t beat that! Having Acne-Prone/oily skin sometimes your skin is striped and very sensitive due to chemical treatments and cleansers. With that amazing organic aloe, it helps sooth and calms irritated skin. Patchy skin miraculously heals and sloughs off over night! You also get those great antioxidant benefits to fight against free radicals. Layers perfectly underneath moisturizer and sunscreen for maximum protection against the sun. Smells strongly of Aloe but I love that! If a Vitamin C serum ever smells like citrus...you&#x27;ve gotten yourself a useless serum my friends! Love this stuff, worth the try!</li>
            <li> Pros - it absorbs quickly, non greasy, no breakouts&lt;br /&gt;Cons - smells funny sort like over ripe/spoilt citrus fruit smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night time for a month now and I have to say that this is probably the most effective serum I have ever tried. I wanted a product that would help with uneven skin tone and some acne scars and this serum has definitely helped my skin. My acne marks are a lot lighter and it really did the job of brightening my skin. Love it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this little magic potion for approx. 1 month and am very pleased to say that I&#x27;ve actually noticed a difference. I&#x27;m very skeptical of skin care products&#x27; efficacy and am disappointed by many things I try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall the improvements I&#x27;ve noticed after using this product 2x a day is that my overall complexion looks brighter and more translucent. I&#x27;ve also noticed that I don&#x27;t need as much foundation to cover my discoloration so it must be fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third notable thing about this product I&#x27;ve noticed, and perhaps the most exciting, is that the wrinkles around my eyes seem to be smoothing out. I&#x27;m pretty shocked that something is actually helping my lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;m hooked and don&#x27;t want to be without this product now. You really should try it because the price is also quite reasonable.</li>
            <li> I use it a.m. &amp; p.m. It keeps my skin soft and moist!</li>
            <li> Mine was milky white and thick when I received my bottle.. was expecting a clear serum.  The company did say this could be due to colder climate when the batch was made. .it supposedly should not affect the efficacy of the product. ...I will update when I&#x27;ve finished my bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. I have tried several vitC serums (some of them way more expensive than this one), and this is the only one that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin. It doesn&#x27;t sting and the skin feels softer after use. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have harmful chemicals in it, the company doesn&#x27;t pop up in the ewg&#x27;s skin deep website, but I checked all the ingredients and I think is all good stuff. For me is a keeper :)</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff.  I have seen my pores become more refined and the texture of my skin is firmer and more toned.  Use from forehead to decollete....highly recommend</li>
            <li> Product smells great and doesn&#x27;t take a lot to cover your whole face.  I will say though, don&#x27;t put too much on, or you&#x27;ll be left with some orange colored residue - LOL.  I will resport back in a few months to let you know how it&#x27;s worked on all my 57 year old facial issues.</li>
            <li> The product looks and smells like what I would expect for Vitamin C serum in that it is yellow and has the smell that I associate with Vitamin C products. It is absorbed easily by the skin and does not leave skin feeling sticky. I use it after toner and before moisturizer. Since I use this as preventative care product, I cannot comment on its performance on wrinkles, age spots and such. However, my skin does look healthy.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am doing something good for my skin when I use this serum . My face is noticeably clearer and more radiant. I use this in combination with InstaNatura l s Hyaluranic Serum. My face feels supple, not tight or dried out. Haven&#x27;t had any breakouts or redness. Both serum seem to have regulated my otherwise sensitive skin..You have a loyal customer in me!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product 2 times, the first time it was the end of winter so it had that clear blue tint and smelled like grapefruit and the second time it was the beginning of spring and had that orange tint but the smell was a little off, still smells like grapefruit but almost a spoiled hint. Doesn&#x27;t keep me from using it because the smell dissipates after a while, but I love this product! I can tell a difference in my face and love what it does, when I run out I plan to try the retinal serum! Great product and I love the vitamin c moisturizer too</li>
            <li> I really like this product &amp; I can see a difference in the texture &amp; brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Easy distribution on the skin, non-greasy, use it twice a day, I feel the radiance of the face. I love it.</li>
            <li> Smells like orange juice but skin feels very soft in morning.</li>
            <li> I love this ! Every time i put this product on my face i notice a  Instant noticeable difference in my facial tone. Leaves my skin moisturised,  firmer and a more clear complexion.  Funny thing is this c serum worked better than a more expensive c cream i bought that was 4 times the price by a well known skin line.  The price of this is also insane 14.95? i can&#x27;t really give this anything less than 5 stars. Try it out and see for yourself.</li>
            <li> I had a pretty negative impression of Vitamin C serum before I tried Instanatural&#x27;s Vitamin C &amp; Ferulic Acid.  In the past I have used Obgagi-C Clarifying Serum (contains hydroquinone) and it made my skin darker.  I stopped using it after several months and began using Tretinoin Cream 0.025% to get rid of the dark patches created by the C serum.  It stripped my face of its natural barrier in the process. My skin has lost its ability to maintain moisture in my sinus area. I have very fine lines when I smile.  During the five months I searched the internet (blogs, articles, Youtube videos) nightly and for hours on the weekend looking for something to repair my skin.  I came across the Instanatural line when I discovered the benefits of rosehip seed oil (did not order). I did order Instanatural&#x27;s Niacinamide Vitamin B3 Cream and the rose water toner to try and after reading glowing reviews of the C Serum I decided to give it a try. At first I was apprehensive due to my delicate skin.  I took the chance and a week later I have not had any problems.  The serum goes on quickly and keep my skin moisturized for hours. My complexion is brighter, even and clear. I use it at night with Instanatural&#x27;s emu oil. I use Instanatural&#x27;s Hyaluronic Acid during the day.  I hope with continue use these products will remove the deep and darker spots.  I will definitely purchase again at this price.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks.  I use this every morning after washing my face.  It dries fast, and leaves your skin feeling tight; however, once I put the Insta Natural Rose Hip Seed Oil on over it, my skin glows.  My pores appear smaller and my skin tone is smoother.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I like this product, I follow the directions that are recommended. It works well on my skin with no problems. I have only been using it for about a month and I believe it has helped keep my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty amazing. A very small few drops rubbed over the problem areas on the face and your skin is silky smooth and hydrated for 16hrs or more. Extremely impressed the very first time I used them.</li>
            <li> My skin is softer.  I do like the serum.  I have not noticed any reduction in my wrinkles since using it. Maybe that is not what it is for but I do like the softness of my face.</li>
            <li> Been using Vitamin C Serum for several months.I like that it absorbs fast,it&#x27;s not greasy,and it does not irritate my skin.I really does get rid of fine lines and skin discolorations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks. So far I&#x27;m very impressed. I&#x27;m an Aesthetician and extremely picky about the products I use.  It says you can use am and pm but my preference is am and retinol 1% by skin ceuticals. You can&#x27;t beat the price on this serum. I&#x27;ve paid $100 for the Emu at sephora. I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars after I&#x27;ve used it for a few months. I&#x27;ll buy it again and already told my sisters to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this serum- not thin and watery- smells great and leaves my skin so soft. I will order more of this when I run out.</li>
            <li> This product is new to me, but i may say it does wonders. I have tested different areas of my face to see spots go lighter. I do a-lot of shoots and media work and wanted a product that would make my face blemish&#x27;s disappear. You must put face cream over it so you don&#x27;t have dry-ness. I will write back in a few months to give  update.</li>
            <li> Good, but not as good as OZ naturals</li>
            <li> Great product! Bought this for my wife, because she wanted to compare it to another similar brand we recently purchased, and it&#x27;s honestly just as good! The ONLY discernable difference, is the other one needs to be refrigerated to keep it from oxidizing, but this one claims the way they make theirs, it won&#x27;t oxidize for up to 24 months!</li>
            <li> My skin just drinks in the Vit C serum.  Then within a minute my skin lifts and tightens.  I am 60 yrs old and have very sensitive skin that can&#x27;t decide if it&#x27;s dry, oily, breakout prone or normal.  It acts differently in different areas of my skin.  But I&#x27;ve had no allergic reaction to this serum, and my skin is clearing, leaving a glowing complection I&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;I am using the Vit C serum in the mornings after a quick wash, following with Instanatural&#x27;s Vit C moisturizer.  Then an spf makeup or sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE the Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid and oil combination! Much better than Vitamin C alone! Excited to have found this product.</li>
            <li> AMAZING! from first use my skin started improving .. smoother texture blowy smaller pores age/sun spots fading. i use this during day under makeup and the skin clearing anti aging serum at night. AMAZING great price and natural ingredients!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin.  I decided to try this under my daily moisturizer.  I end up using more than the 2-3 drops (more like a dropper full) and let it dry before applying the moisturizer.  This feels great!  It tightens the skin and leaves it feeling nice and smooth.  Definitely a great addition to my morning routine.</li>
            <li> This is amazing! The formula soaks right in, it&#x27;s not sticky and does not have any strong odors. After a few days/nights, I definitely noticed a difference in my skin. It brightened and evened out my skin tone! Not to mention my face feels incredibly soft! I definitely recommend to everyone!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the results of this product after only using it for about 3 weeks.  My skin appears more youthful and I&#x27;m noticing that some of my fine lines are getting somewhat less noticeable.  Nice citrus sent to the product.</li>
            <li> I use the serum it is good till now</li>
            <li> Smells really nice ang goes on light. Customer service is awesome and was very much appreciated. Have only used it for 2wks and has left my skin very soft😊</li>
            <li> This serum improved my skin texture within one week . I use it under foundation and my make up actually stayed fresh longer  I love the price too&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a GREAT product  within my budget&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t ever take this product away .</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to notice any results, but it doesn&#x27;t break me out and it sinks in decently enough without leaving much of a film.  I really do like the ingredients list a lot and hope that it works out for me as well as it has worked out for others that are raving about this product.  Only time will tell, but so far, I think the product is okay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it to be honest! I didn&#x27;t like the color and the fact that many oils added to it which caused me breakouts and above all of that didn&#x27;t see any improvements comparing to other products that I have used before. Sorry, would like to write a good review, but this is the fact</li>
            <li> I really DO love this stuff!  I have been researching what goes into the lotions and potions we put on our faces, and this has all the simple and best ingredients that I was contemplating buying alone and mixing up on my own.  This product saves me the time and effort.  I like to add an extra drop or two of organic rose hip oil (that I bought separately) if my skin is particularly dry.  But in general, 2 - 4 drops of this after washing is enough.  And I love knowing that it&#x27;s feeding my skin as is lightly moisturizes.  What a great product!</li>
            <li> i am using this product along with.a  light chemical peel. the serum firms the  face and shortens the peel time. this product is  great for that use.</li>
            <li> Lessens fine lines. Seems to be working</li>
            <li> Its ok....I didn&#x27;t see much a difference.</li>
            <li> love everything about it, smell, thickness, quick absorption, integrity and it appears to smooth out my skin.</li>
            <li> The best natural vitamin C serum on the market. Switched over from Jan Marini C-Esta serum and my skin is glowing!</li>
            <li> Love this serum and love the citrus smell too bad it goes quickly</li>
            <li> This serum is WONDERFUL!  I love the high percentage of vitamin C as well as the other active ingredients.  My skin is so much brighter and the brown spots and scars are diminishing drastically.  Would highly recommend this serum!</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It absorbs really quick and can be used with oils because it is so light.</li>
            <li> I have had a good experience with this vitamin C serum.  Overall, I feel it is a valid, very good product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and am noticing a brighter more radiant complexion overall.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing more, now, because after using this for well over a month, I&#x27;ve discovered it contains&lt;br /&gt;witch hazel... not advisable to use on your face... I was really disappointed to see it contained witch hazel! :(</li>
            <li> My wife ordered this serum and it has been working very well on her face and skin so far. She had tried many anti aging products in the past but most haven&#x27;t done anything. She thought that her skin just wasn&#x27;t meant for things such as these anti aging serums. But this vitamin c serum is not only more cost effective than many other products she&#x27;s tried in the past, but it actually works for a change. Her face feels radiant and more beautiful than ever before. In particular, we noticed that it has reduced some of the fine lines and discoloration that she had. She now plan to make this a part of her daily regimen.</li>
            <li> has helped lighten my surgical scars (easier to see improvement on those than on my face). Light weight. I think I thought it smelled weird when I bought it, but I either got used to it or it went away. Lasts about 2 months</li>
            <li> In the past I had tried a facial lotion that had vitamin C in it and found it helped my face look clearer and more healthy but have not used it in over a year.  I tried this Vitamin C serum on my face for the last 2 days and it seems to give me a glow, and I know it will help fade some of my dark spots.  I wash my face, then put on this serum and let it dry for a couple of minutes before using my regular moisturizer.  I have only been doing this once a day, in the mornings - though it may work better at night.  I like it and will continue to use it.  I am over 40 and think this helps tremendously.</li>
            <li> Fyi, I&#x27;m not a paid spokesman, just an average 34 year old woman and I have never had a routine in the morning or night using face creams. I first started using the Insta natural eye gel and absolutely loved it, so I decided to try more products. I&#x27;m really satisfied with this Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month now and my pores are visibly smaller, my skin looks healthy too. I really enjoy the orange scent and I like that I can wear the serum on its own or under my eye cream and moisturizer. This serum is a keeper and I&#x27;m also very satisfied with the eye gel and retinol moisturizer from insta natural.</li>
            <li> Received promptly. No results but still using every day.</li>
            <li> This product is a little sticky at first but absorbs quickly. I saw a noticeable improvement in the look of my skin after a week of using this.</li>
            <li> Love the serum and how it feels on my face</li>
            <li> This stuff smells wonderful, goes on smooth - a few drops go a long way!  I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m in love with the price though, which is why I didn&#x27;t give it that last star.  It is a lot to spend for only 1 oz, but check out the label and you get Vitamin C, Hyaluronic acid and lots of other natural oils and ingredients.  At my age I can&#x27;t expect any formula to work a miracle but it makes my skin feel really smooth and creates a healthy glow... and it is cheaper than many other ones!</li>
            <li> Good product will buy again</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum, it is truly helping my completion, it is making my face so much smoother looking with out leaving a oily residue like most serums I have used in the past. I am in the sun a lot of I almost have red spots on my face, this also helps with that and with with being wind burnt, I am guessing its from the Alo in it idk what it is but it works!!</li>
            <li> It absorbes nicely and My skin feel nice and smooth but i dont see a difference with the wrinkles yet, need more time.</li>
            <li> By using this product, my skin was moist. I will be satisfied and I buy again.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I Love this vitamin C serum! Everything was as described. Item was neatly &amp; protectively packaged. Arrived ahead of schedule. Been using for abt a wk, 2 times a day, I have seen a dramatic difference in my skin. My scars are fading, pores are nearly history, my skin is much brighter and healthier. Yes, i highly recommended, i will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural makes great products, and this Vitamin C Serum was no exception.  I have used other skin brighteners in the past to combat dull skin, and they were 5 times the price of this one.  This product was just as effective and much cheaper.  My skin was left with a natural, radiant glow and it was not harsh on my sensitive skin. I would recommend this product again and again.</li>
            <li> I usually have an issue with oily serums because they clog my pores and make my skin feel heavy and gross, but this was nice! It soaked in nicely and didn&#x27;t feel oily. It was nice and light and smelled nice too. Most serums smell like chemicals, but this was was much fresher. Insta Naturals knows what&#x27;s up with skincare!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C serum for a frw weeks now and I can definitely tell around my nose and.mouth that the fines.lines from just weight loss, age, amd stress have almost diminished!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. I got the face lotion as well and I think they work well for my skin, it&#x27;s nice and soft. I think I&#x27;ll switch to those for a while, until I find something better at a lower price. I have sun spot on my face during the summer time, so I&#x27;m curious to see if the vit. C will help with those so I don&#x27;t have to spend $30 for &amp;#34;Image&amp;#34; brand. It smells nice too, like citrus. **update** I ended up using again my Image Skincare serum, works much better for my sun spots.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin super soft and it smells great!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of this company. They&#x27;re products really work. I&#x27;ve use this serum religiously on my face, scars, 8 year old stretch marks, and have never been disappointed. This has definitely become a staple in my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> I do like this serum.  It was a little thicker than I expected and that took a little getting used to.  I really like the ingredients and I am considering repurchasing, though I&#x27;m not totally sold on it because I can&#x27;t really say it did anything.  I will say the company has excellent customer service.  I had an issue with one of their other products and they rectified the situation and made me happy.</li>
            <li> The serum has a slightly sticky consistency and it does smell of oranges, I purchased it to help decrease the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month in combination with moisturizers. My skin does feel soft and smooth, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a decrease in either lines or wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been able to try this product through a promotion from tomoson. I have used it 3 times so far. One of the times I mixed it with a homemade face mask, and got a great, bright, and firm face from it. I would definitely recommend this for ages 25+ male or female. This is a great product from insta natural as well as all the other great oils they have.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I must say this product is a really good one. Of you&#x27;re not patient you wil not see the results this has to deliver. I had gotten a sunburn around both eyes so I decided to purchase this product to see how it works. I did also use a prescribed medicated cream to aid in getting rid of the sunburn but using both products really helped. I didn&#x27;t see any results after 2weeks but slowly u start to notice ur skin looking brighter and a glow. I stopped using the medicated cream I got but continue to use the serum and it&#x27;s working very well. I do recommend this to anybody who&#x27;s thinking about buying it because it absolutely delivers.</li>
            <li> I will be able to tell you if it works in a few months. For now I have a great orange scent...</li>
            <li> Great product at a fabulous price! You must try this. Loved it have tried more expensive items which didn&#x27;t deliver, this does.</li>
            <li> This serum definitely helped repair my sun damage skin whitin a weeks use. Didn&#x27;t really notice a glow but did leave skin feeling supple and hydrated due to the vitamin c and hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for several weeks. It&#x27;s non greasy, absorbs easily and I see an improvement in my skin already. It&#x27;s a little pricey. HOWEVER, you only need a few drops and it goes a long way. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Vitamin C Serum&#x27;s and have always tried to keep a bottle at home if at all possible. I firmly believe that using Vitamin C Serum can aid in Anti-Aging by helping the skin to stay plump and soft. You will love how soft and silky your skin will feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the way it evens out the skin, so if you have some brown spots, this is a good serum to have for those or any other kinds of discolorations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural&#x27;s Serum has 20% Vitamin C and it also has Vitamin E, Ferulic Acid and Hyaluronic Acid along with Organic Aloe, which makes it the best Vitamin C Serum on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have used other Vitamin C&#x27;s in the past, then you should notice the difference between InstaNatural&#x27;s and the others that are on the market or have been in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any fragrance because I can get massive headaches with products that feel they need to add some type of fragrance. I also was impressed with the color and the texture of the serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you notice, it is just about impossible to tell that I have the serum in the dropper. That is because this Vitamin C Serum has no noticeable color! Why is that important? Well, because it means that no added colors were added, which means less chemicals in your serum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think when a company gives a great guarantee, it says a lot about them, because they believe in their product and think that we will too!</li>
            <li> It is also great for all skin type. Quite similar to the Mystelic Serum. I love it and currently using it. It&#x27;s 72% organic which is great too and it&#x27;s also affordable.&lt;br /&gt;Got this free to review</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum is great for anti-aging, it stimulates collagen formation, and protects against sun damage. Insta Natural vitamin C serum is great because it has the good stuff in it, like vitamin E, Ferulic and Hyaluronic acid. When you first apply this serum to your face it feels a bit sticky, but that is due to Hyaluronic acid and the feeling disappears within seconds leaving your face smooth. I apply a few drops of this (4-5) in the morning after cleansing my face and then follow with moisturizer with SPF (some days I use Insta Natural Rosehip organic Oil). I have been using vitamin C for 6 months now, and my skin is much brighter and has an even tone. I had 2 sun spots under my eye area and after using vitamin C serum, they have considerably faded (still there but not as dark). You have to use vitamin C serum for at least 2 months to see the results, but once you continue to use you will see that your skin is brighter and more has more even tone. I will always use Vitamin C serum in the morning and rosehip seed oil at night!</li>
            <li> I used it 2x daily, wait til it dries, then apply eye cream and  moisturizer.  I only skip it the 2 nights a week I use my retin-A.  It leaves my skin dewy and plumped, works wonders on fine lines.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this product, it&#x27;s thick and sticky,The fragrance is very nice though, a clean orange smell. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything wrong with it. It just didn&#x27;t feel good on my skin.</li>
            <li> Love it! I will order again. Wrinkles are not as noticeable.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product for long I don&#x27;t see any change yet I guess I have to give it some more time</li>
            <li> I just started using it can&#x27;t wait for the results in a few weeks.Customer servise is excellent! Yes I would recomend it.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of the serum, penetrates well  and hydrates my skins. It does not irritate nor make my skin itch. My skin looks great. I will continue to use. Happy customer.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product. I did research serums before purchasing this one. I cannot give a 5-star rating, because I have not used it long enough&lt;br /&gt;to see results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Paula Thompson</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and I would recommend this product for any skin type! It is fabulous! I would compare it to any of the Very expensive brands out there. GREAT customer service! Actually the BEST customer service I have ever experienced!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Good smell and isn&#x27;t greasy. Seems to be helping with some scarring I had on my chin and neck area. Will defiantly purchase again</li>
            <li> Wow! This is an excellent serum. I seen a difference in just 2 days. My skin soaks it right up and feels so good. My eyes feel different and look so much better. I asked many questions to the company about their products, and got quick/polite responses. Top notch....</li>
            <li> I bought this product without any intentions of having better looking skin, I don&#x27;t believe in products that reverse aging. However after 3 weeks of using 2 times a day I see radical changes!  My pore sizes are smaller. And my skin looks smoother, almost radiant or glowing. I&#x27;m very very excited I stepped out of my comfort zone for this one. Not to mention the seller has answered personal questions through email which was a huge surprise.  Not only do I love the product but I really appreciate the email conversation. I was using a RX retin A for acne and have not needed it since I started the Vit C. Impressed</li>
            <li> so happy with this purchase. I feel so beautiful using it. It makes my face so soft and smooth. I can never ever live without it anymore!</li>
            <li> I have nothing but praises for this product. I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin. I&#x27;ve also been getting complements that I&#x27;ve been glowing, so maybe it does work! But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I use twice a day under my eyes to fade my dark circles. Works fantastically.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lovely to apply to my face. It smells divine. I have now moved to my second bottle and I have definitely noticed a difference. My skin feels more softer and looks brighter.  I will continue to use it! Thanks Instanatural!</li>
            <li> It makes skin feel soft and smells not bad!!</li>
            <li> Amazing product so very pleased with it and my results</li>
            <li> Very sticky on the skin but it still is non irritating and seems to be calming.</li>
            <li> Both my daughter are very pleased with your product.</li>
            <li> This made my face really glow!!!  There was actually a difference after the first time I used it. I noticed my face was much brighter. The first night I used this under my rose hip seed oil mixed into some moisturizer. I went to my Mom and Dads house to visit, and she looked at me and said, &amp;#34;Your skin is beautiful!!!, what have you been doing ?&amp;#34; She said this only after the second time I used this!! I noticed her skin looked pretty too, and it turns out she had been using a vitamin c cream. So Vitamin C does work! Try it, but exfoliate well first  so you get the most out of this product, and then moisturize.  Night time is when your body renews your skin the most so use it before you go to sleep. I&#x27;m using this product in the morning too under my sunscreen because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Works really well, I&#x27;ve noticed my complexion has gotten a lot more even after use!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who was looking for a serum as I&#x27;m in my late 30&#x27;s. I wasn&#x27;t willing to spend $70 on other products for men so I gave this a try. Ummm... After more than a month of use I see no dramatic improvement. It smells nice and is orange in color, absorbs instantly and you can&#x27;t tell you&#x27;re wearing anything. The reason for 4 stars is that even though I see no long term effects I see an instant effect after applying this: my skin feels tighter with a glow to it. Fine lines disappear instantly. This effect goes away as the day goes on and my skin gets oily. I might purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I&#x27;ve just started my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Started using this product at night after my bath. Absolutely loved the refreshing smell. My face felt tighter and as if it were breathing. The Vitamin C Serum would definitely be a product worth reordering when I finish my bottle. Would recommend it to anyone wanting a clearer complexion.</li>
            <li> Good serum for rejuvenating skin</li>
            <li> I can see a difference in my skin texture already. No negative side effects as  of right now but I will update again if needed.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel moisturized and soft</li>
            <li> Goes  on like a gel so I feel like I am not wasting anything like most Vitamin C serums. I really like this product!</li>
            <li> Made my skin soft and vibrant. The smell is a bit off putting in my personal opinion but that wouldn&#x27;t stop me from purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far, my face is clearer ❤️</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Insta natural Vit. C Serum to anyone who is looking for a brighter complection. I had heard about a vit. C -Hyaluronic combination for ages and finally found one thats affordable. My skin feels tighter  &amp; brighter and I feel more attractive and I&#x27;m over 70 so go for it. It can help you too.  When you feel attractive you actually are attractive and have more confidence.</li>
            <li> Working well.  I don&#x27;t expect instant results.  Good feel to serum and a little goes a long way easily.  Very nice scent.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C serum  is just what I have been looking for and after 2 weeks I am hooked-----------there is no smell to this and it absorbs quickly.  I put in on in the morning and at night------no greasy feeling.  I have been looking for a quick easy NO STINGING MOISTURIZER-with VITAMIN C - and this fits my search!!!  Great Product. I will continue using it---------product arrived quick and packed well-------and insta natural has a great Guarantee-----------great product</li>
            <li> “This is the perfect serum to use under your moisturizer. I tried almost all the vitamin C serums including the pricey ones. This is better than all of them in my opinion. I ordered it for my daughter who is a surgical nurse and her face gets broken out from the surgical mask - and it took care of her breakouts. It&#x27;s a great serum and I will continue to use it.”</li>
            <li> I notice a big difference after two weeks!  Dark spots are fading and I had skin cancer surgery and the scar was still red. But now it&#x27;s almost all gone !  Love this !</li>
            <li> To my horror, I recently notice that I had fine &amp;#34;ruffles&amp;#34; on my cheek bones on the left side of my face.  These are apparently sleep lines caused by burying my face in the pillow every night for years.  In addition to changing my sleep habit to back only, I have been using this serum every other night with the Derma Roller by Diva d&#x27;or.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Qualification: I&#x27;m no dermatologist and my results are anecdotal and not statistically verifiable.  I do not want anyone being harmed by my formula. I alternate the Vitamin C Serum with a prescription ointment that I will not reveal for that reason.  However, I will say that I have used the prescribed medication for years.  With the recent addition of the serum, my &amp;#34;ruffles&amp;#34; seem to be &amp;#34;ironing&amp;#34; away.</li>
            <li> A really good, affordable serum. I have used other serums that cost a lot more money and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything for me. Honestly, I wasn&#x27;t sure that this one would do anything for me, especially since it was relatively cheap. But I feel like it has made my face brighter and helped even my skin tone. I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night, with the addition at night of a hydroquinone cream, and the few dark spots I had from sun exposure are perceptibly lighter after just a few weeks. I&#x27;m impressed. I do like the scent, which I didn&#x27;t think was overpowering at all, and it dissipates quickly anyway. I see myself reordering this when I run out.</li>
            <li> I was a tad sceptical about the numerous reviews of those that had been given complimentary products but after a week of using this serum I am seeing a noticeable difference in the texture of my skin. I am really pleased so far &amp; I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to repurchase.</li>
            <li> This is a great product...</li>
            <li> Its very nice.. Not sticky. I will definitely order more</li>
            <li> I have been using this and a few other products from InstaNatural about 2 weeks and so far I love them. I have had normal/combination skin most of my life but once I hit 40 I started having a problem with my skin becoming dry and flaky. Immediately my skin looks brighter and feels more moisturized, no more flaking. I also love that they do not add any artificial fragrance, my skin is very sensitive, I can not use perfumes or products that contain them, it causes me to break out in eczema on my face and neck! Im a licensed esthetician and have used many well known, expensive product lines over the years but I would recommend these products to anyone.I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I am using the Vitamin C Serum in conjunction with the Hyaluronic Acid Serum and my husband says my skin looks nice.  I am 67 and my skin looks pretty good!;)  I am on my second bottles of both serums.</li>
            <li> It is early days I am having some breakouts I hope it is temporary</li>
            <li> I received this today and only just applied it once so far. My face smells like I just applied a can of beer on it. I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s what it should smell like as I&#x27;d expected a citrus smell. I can literally feel my pores closing up though not to the extent of irritation. Will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I have been sampling different brands of serum for my face.  I&#x27;m still using the first that I bought and will use this next.  It has the same ratio of Vit.C and Hyaluronic Acid as what I am currently using.  The difference was the price.  This was a bit less expensive.  And I&#x27;m always looking for the bargain.  In general, I love this serum.  Another &amp;#34;dr.Oz&amp;#34; tip.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I have been using it for two weeks consistently. I love that it is absorbed so quickly and has a very pleasant citrus scent. My skin has been feeling nourished. I will be using it again.</li>
            <li> This serum is great! I have come to love Insta Natural and all of it&#x27;s products. This serum has helped diminish blemishes and scars I&#x27;ve had and has greatly evened my skin tone. I absolutely LOVE this serum! It works great and comes from a brand I trust.</li>
            <li> I like to be proactive about my skin because when my skin feels great, I feel great. Because I am a busy mom with little kiddos, I feel like my skin has taken a beating. I end up getting more sun exposure than I should and &amp;#34;beauty sleep&amp;#34; gets interrupted by my precious little baby. So I worry about wrinkles a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wonderful thing about this serum is that it is so easy to use and doesn&#x27;t have a strong odor. I like things that don&#x27;t stink. After a few weeks of using this serum, I noticed that my wrinkles were fainter and my skin looked healthier and younger.This is a great product to help revitalize your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using Tomoson.com. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! Totally keeping this on hand. Broken caps on cheeks reduced significantly. Skin is so smooth and healthy! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other products similar to this one.  This one is not bad as I&#x27;ve only used it for a week.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky after application.  I normally put a cream on top of it.  I&#x27;ve tried using Vitamin C Moisturizer Cream but the skin feel sticky with that product.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend that cream with this.</li>
            <li> Smells ok. You would use this product after you take a shower or after you wash your face. Make sure you have some type of moisturizer to apply afterwards. I recommend applying this before you sleep. Like the other comments have said, you only need a little bit. Wish the bottle was bigger but other than that this product is great.</li>
            <li> I received this 2 days ago and a dark spot on my cheek has lightened up quite a bit.  It does make my face smoother and more even.  I am impressed!</li>
            <li> I just started using this as I was finishing up another brand.  I love the smell and how smoothing it is on my face.  so far so good and I will be a repeat customer</li>
            <li> This was my first c serum, but I liked it a lot. It smelled nice and gave my skin a nice tingle.  It seemed to help my skin a little, though it wasn&#x27;t a dramatic change.  I would keep buying if not for the price, but this was a competitive price for this type of product.</li>
            <li> My face and neck LOVE this product! I saw results within 3-4 days. My face is clearer, smoother, pores are tighter,&lt;br /&gt;make-up goes on so smoothly. I mix it with peptides  and it feels GOOD. my friends comment on how good my face looks&lt;br /&gt;and others just look at my skin when I tell them my age. the service was prompt , the price is a bit pricey , but worth it !&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product. Now I&#x27;m looking for a product with peptides and ceramides  mixed together.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles, and I have only used part if the bottle but I do see and feel improvement in my dry skin. I will be fair and try another bottle so I can fairly rate it after a couple months. It will probably be 5 stars then. There is a very slight &amp;#34;food&amp;#34; type odor but it only lasts a very short time.</li>
            <li> Nice citrus smell.  Absorbs quickly leaving my face soft, smooth and brighter looking.  Haven&#x27;t noticed much change in skin discolorations yet, but I&#x27;m still hopeful.  I will purchase the product again.</li>
            <li> In Luv with this company!! I recently ordered  their VC Serum, VC Toner &amp; their Awesome Moisturizer as well. The toner leaked during transit and CS instantly and graciously shipped a replacement bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely a Fave company now!!&lt;br /&gt;Great natural ingredients, good pricing with Outstanding communication, what more can we ask for Ladies??!!&lt;br /&gt;Take Care &amp; Cheers,  Zoe</li>
            <li> i am a first time user of this product, i am the type of girl who doesnt know much about beauty products cause im more of a tomboy type of girl so having saying that i didnt notice much changes in my skin with using this product but i do enjoy the smoothness and moisterizing that it left of my skin that i do continue to use it</li>
            <li> This seems to be a high quality serum for a great price! I love all the attributes and pay way less than the serum from my dermatologist and this has more vitamin C %. ! I am definitely reordering this serum! and my hairdresser is now ordering too.</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 4 because it did give my skin a natural glow and also helped my skin with a recent breakout.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and most facial products make my face turn red. This doesn&#x27;t have that effect. It makes my face feel supple and smooth. Also the Vitamin C protects against skin damage.</li>
            <li> If you are looking at this, you are trying to get rid of wrinkles, spots or rough aged skin. My wife tried this product and she noticed softer skin after the first use. You only use a little, it goes a long way and makes your skin look and feel younger. If you have the chance to looker younger and have healthier skin, take the chance, you will be glad you did. The product is reasonable and is guaranteed to work for you. The stuff goes on easy, is not greasy and does not cause you to break out.</li>
            <li> There was an amazing difference in my skin texture within a week of using this product.  My skin is so much smoother and with no visible fine lines around my eyes.  My pores appear so much smaller and my skin looks fresh and new.  I have not had any skin peeling on my face as with other harsh skin renewal products. I squeeze a couple of drops on my fingertips and lightly spread it under my eyes, all over my face and neck.  I don&#x27;t even wear make-up anymore.  This is by far the best beauty product I have ever used.  I can actually see the improvements in my skin.  I use it every morning and every evening after a cleansed and toned face.  I cannot believe the results.  After years of trying every product out there to maintain youth, I didn&#x27;t have much faith, but thought I would give it a try.  I am happy that I did.  Yes, I would recommend this to anyone that is concerned with fine lines and would like a smoother texture to their skin.  I also pair it with the oral insta natural capsule.  Works great for me.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful - my skin looks brighter than ever before. It goes on easily and absorbs quickly.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Works great with a derma roller leaves my skin radiant</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty early to tell if this product has made a difference, that&#x27;s why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars.  It has a fresh orange smell and doesn&#x27;t leave the skin sticky.  Probably will have a better idea in a month or so of it&#x27;s effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Done with half of the bottle but it didn&#x27;t really work on me</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve bought to reduce dark spots. I&#x27;ve tried so many products (expensive ones too) and this one works the best!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle... I previously used a more expensive brand for about 10 yrs but had to cut back on costs and found this.  Its almost as good as the expensive one.. just a little thicker.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week. I love the results so far. It makes my skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and it is great!  My skin looks and feels awesome.</li>
            <li> Had filler put under my eyes on Wednesday and needed a good serum to make my skin glow.  THIS IS IT!!!  After the first day, I could use it under my eyes and couldn&#x27;t have been more pleased.  I can tell I am retaining more water on my face.  My bruising isn&#x27;t nearly as bad.  All because of this product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of facial cremes.  This one did exactly what it says it will do.  I love the way my face feels after each use.</li>
            <li> Great buy with noticeable results.  Keep away from eye area because it stings.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply and seems to be improving my skin tone and even making my pores appear smaller.</li>
            <li> I like the way this product feels on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great C serum. I transfer a small amount to a little vial to keep on my bathroom counter and refrigerate the rest to keep the product fresh. A little goes a long way. Great company with lots of info for their clients.</li>
            <li> It has made a big difference with the scaring. We just purchased some more!</li>
            <li> At first use,  you may think that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything. That&#x27;s just the initial impression. Wait a few minutes and you&#x27;ll feel the skin on your face feel tight,  look brighter and smoother. That&#x27;s just the first application. I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly two weeks now,  and I&#x27;m so satisfied with Instanatural, I placed their Rose Hips and B3 serum in my shopping cart and will be purchasing extra bottles to bring home to my country. Wish Instanatural were sold there too. Don&#x27;t hesitate on their products, safe and effective.</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi C serum for many years which is much on expensive side, this one work as well as Obagi if not better,I will continue to use .</li>
            <li> Using after 1.0 mm derma roller on face and post pregnancy stretch marks. Very soothing feeling and smells like oranges lol.</li>
            <li> Works nicely. Absorbs quickly. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I love this serum, I apply after washing and toning and before my moisturizer. It absorbs pretty nice, it has a pleasant smell, a little bit of product covers my whole face, it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and it works well even under make up!&lt;br /&gt;The company has a great customer service so I&#x27;m looking forward to trying more of their products, I bought this one with the argan oil and I&#x27;m very satisfied with both. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> My face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> Disclosure: I have received this product for my review purposes, all opinions are 100% my own unbiased thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Customer service from Insta Natural is like no other first off, they have some of the best I have yet to deal with! I have not tried any prodcut from them that I did not LOVE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great and leaves your skin tighter with a glow of healthiness. I have noticed the fine lines were no longer as noticeable and my skin felt much smoother and softer. I love the citrus smell. The ingredients are organic and natural. It dries quickly and leaves no greasy feeling! Absorbs quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for your use!</li>
            <li> I like to use this in the morning, feels like I&#x27;m giving my face its daily dose of orange juice. Absorbs well and has a citrus grapefruit smell. Not over powering but I can see it not being to everyone&#x27;s taste. Will repurchase.</li>
            <li> The product was okay. Overall good</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It feels wonderful going on and absorbs quickly. My complexion all ways looks brighter after application. This vitamin C serum causes no irritation to my skin and along with my lotion helps my face stay moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> Great product, it has worked very well on my skin, it evened out my skin acne scars. It has helped me with my crows feet around the eye area and with the deep wrinkles near the nose and cheek area.</li>
            <li> The product has a pleasant smell like an&lt;br /&gt;orange or aloe vera.Ingredients include&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C, E, Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic&lt;br /&gt;Acid, MSM, Kosher Vegetable Glycerin,&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil and Organic Aloe.For more&lt;br /&gt;details on the ingredient mix-contact&lt;br /&gt;the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The preparation is 98% naturally derived&lt;br /&gt;and 72% organically derived.The product is&lt;br /&gt;a professional hydration serum intended to&lt;br /&gt;deliver care in places like the face or neck.&lt;br /&gt;The product is intended for external use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Users should check with their health care&lt;br /&gt;providers in connection with a planned regimen&lt;br /&gt;for this product. The reviewer received a&lt;br /&gt;sample for purposes of writing a review.</li>
            <li> I have used LaRosche Posay for years. This stuff seems to be working well too. It&#x27;s tough to conclude for sure because I used a myriad of products, but for the price and my perception so far, I am a fan!</li>
            <li> Cant tell yet after a week of using, also, I am using it with other products so I cant tell if it works or not.</li>
            <li> The serum feels clean and refreshing... especially at the end of a long day here in dry California. I love the combination of ingredients. I have only used it for a short time, but I am hoping for good results. The customer service and care from InstaNatural is exemplary. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it would help with my acne scars, but it ended up breaking me out. I guess I had an allergic reaction to one of the ingredients? The company was very sweet and gave me a full refund, no return needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars for customer service&lt;br /&gt;1 star for product</li>
            <li> Very good quality. My skin is smoother and brighter, I will definitely using it again.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product a short time but I know the ingredients in it is very healthy for my skin and in time will decrease my lines and wrinkles . I love the serum when it&#x27;s on my face and the smooth feel .  I know it&#x27;s a good product and will greatly help my skin . I also use it on my neck .  Better results are yet to come !!!!</li>
            <li> This product made my skin brake out horribly. This really stinks because I was looking forward to using this product so much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this Vitamin C Serum on my face and neck every day as part of my routine.  Not only has it improved the appearance of my skin, it also smells great!</li>
            <li> Dries/absorbs quickly, little to no fragrance, been using less than 2 weeks so too soon to tell if it&#x27;s making a difference or not but feels great on skin especially when I follow up with my daily moisturizer as it recommends.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have ever purchased on Amazon! Within the first couple of days after using it, my face felt smoother, tighter, and more refreshed. Excellent buy for all that you receive, and top notch customer service from the manufacturer! I have yet to ever receive an email from a manufacturer to make sure I am pleased with their product and make sure I didn&#x27;t have any questions or concerns, I was very impressed with their outreach. I have already ordered my second bottle and I will continue using it!</li>
            <li> Love it. Stopped my cystic acne in it&#x27;s tracks! I didn&#x27;t even expect it to do that! My face looks and feels firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, so I have to bear that in mind whenever trying a new product. I washed my face and dried it. I sprayed some rosewater on my face and patted that dry. Then I put about 2/3 of a dropper full of the serum on my face. It slides easily onto the skin and doesn&#x27;t itch or cause discomfort, or I wouldn&#x27;t continue to use it. After the product dries, which takes not much time at all, I applied my moisturizer. Hyaluronic acid is supposed to suck in moisture so your face stays hydrated longer, which is why you use it in the first place. This particular brand also contains aloe and vitamin e, and also vitamin c, msm (which is supposed to reduce inflammation, a major cause of aging), witch hazel (great for your skin), and jojoba. All of Insta-Natural&#x27;s products feel great on the skin, you can see them working quickly, and contain a lot of natural ingredients, hence the name. They really are interested in the customer&#x27;s beauty desires. You will discover that they e-mail you to be sure you are satisfied with the product. I have happily discovered their product line (moisturizer, rose hip oil, also their delightful rosewater, which I wrote a review for). I could buy their rosewater by the gallon, I love using it so much. I also am aware that this form of vitamin c is not prone to oxidation, so that is an improvement over some other products. Since I have started using Insta-natural faithfully, the fine lines on my forehead, which I have had since I was in my early 20&#x27;s, are not so deep. I hope to see them completely disappear with regular use.&lt;br /&gt;You have nothing to lose by trying this brand. Go for it.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;Organic Herbal Infusion, Organic Aloe, Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate (Vitamin C), Methylsulphonylmethane (MSM), Botanical Hyaluronic Acid, Hamamelis Virginiana (Witch Hazel) d-Alpha-tocopherol acetate (Vitamin E), Carbomer, (2s)- 2 - Amino - 5 - guanidinopentanoic Acid, Ferulic acid, Kosher vegetable glycerin, Organic jojoba oil, Phenoxyethanol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;98% Naturally-derived, 72% Organic. Made in the USA. Use within 12 months of opening. Not tested on animals. Comes in a cobalt blue glass dropper bottle. 1 fl. oz. 20% vitamin c.nol, Ethyl Hexyl Glycerin.&lt;br /&gt;98% Naturally-derived, 72% Organic. Made in the USA. Use within 12 months of opening.

            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> not happening.maybe it suits certain skin tones. cant say</li>
            <li> Love the consistency of this serum.  I have used several brands and this is one of my favorites.  Will definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> super i like,I bought it through a discount</li>
            <li> I decided to try this because I&#x27;ve been looking for a new serum to wear under my moisturizer in the evening. After about a week of use, my dark circles under my eyes began to look lighter, which was awesome. Unfortunately, this was followed by pretty bad breakouts on my cheeks, chin, and forehead. I tend to get blemishes very easily from my breakouts so this was super disappointing. I really, really wanted to like this product but it just isn&#x27;t for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;With continued use of the serum for about 2-3 weeks, my skin has gotten drier than it has ever been and I am starting to break out all over my forehead and chin. I am discontinuing my use of the serum.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C SERUM must have has done miricals for me it just turns back time and my skin is much more even and a lot of dark spots have said .... Good bye</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. DEF SAW A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN WITHOUT MAKEUP ON. JUST BOUGHT ANOTHER BOTTLE IN 2 OZ. THE 1 OZ GOES SO FAST!</li>
            <li> This goes on nicely, and I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Unlike other skin serums, Vitamin C serum is a natural way to produce collagen because of it&#x27;s ascorbic acid. Collagen will increase your skins elasticity making it tighter, firmer and more plump - which means less of that sagging feeling. It is rich in anti-oxidants that repairs and revives the cells and give the skin a healthier younger appearance. It makes my skin have brighter glow and feel velvety soft. Did I mention you can see results after using the serum one week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum has a very watery texture but glides on like silk. It has a citrus aroma and absorbs very quickly into your skin. I use it all over my face and throat in the AM and PM. It can be used alone or underneath a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides helping give your face a younger healthier new look, Vitamin C serum also helps your skin repair itself from damage such as scars, age or dark spots, sun damage and even expedite the healing of wounds and reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, be advised that it does have a shelf life. Vitamin C serum should be clear and not yellowish. If it smells rancid or weird, it should also be thrown away. This means it has oxidized and has lost its effectiveness. A good Vitamin C Serum is sold in an amber bottle just like this one to extend its shelf life. Make sure to store it away from heat and sunlight and that the cap is tightly closed. If you like you can even store it in the refrigerator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I have not tried any Vitamin C serum but heard great reviews about it.  I decided to give this a shot because of the reviews.  Unfortunately it made my face break out terribly!  My face didn&#x27;t feel smoother.  I&#x27;m disappointed. :(  I was hoping it would work great especially for the price!  I&#x27;m undecided about whether or not to try any other serum.  I really wished this serum had worked!  The item did arrive on time and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> I love the vitamin c serum it plumps my skin up almost instantly, and it stays that way all day.</li>
            <li> I really like using the [[ASIN:B00IDWP4IA Vitamin C Serum by instanatural]] because it goes on smooth and best of all, it does not leave any oily spots or film residue. I find the product easy to apply because it has a little dropper in the lid. After removing the lid, I place a drop or two on my index finger and gently massage the product onto my face. I find the product works best if used just prior to going to sleep; this helps take advantage of the natural healing ability of my skin during the night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently had a burn mark on my hand from spilling a hot beverage. In addition to Neosporin, I also used instanaturals Vitamin C serum on the mark area. The results today are remarkable; it&#x27;s like nothing even happened. I was sure I was going to have a scar but now it&#x27;s completely gone. I&#x27;ve been using the vitamin C serum on some acne spots on my face, and it has worked well in helping to reduce those too.  Nothing overnight mind you, but seriously impressive for so little time in use.  I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a little over a week now, but it has seriously worked wonders for my beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Review Sample Provided for Review and Evaluation]</li>
            <li> Very much liked this serum . Next time I will purchase a different brand so I will have something to compare it too .&lt;br /&gt;I saw a difference in the texture , lines and wrinkles in my skin .&lt;br /&gt;So overall I was happy with my purchase .</li>
            <li> This serum is awesome! It is a cheaper version of a SkinCeuticals serum &amp; works just as well. I use it in the morning before moisturizer &amp; it&#x27;s sublime</li>
            <li> Seems to work fine, but is very watery.  Would prefer something with a little more emollient.  Need to use with moisturizer.  Smell isn&#x27;t for everyone but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. Price is right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different Vitamin C serums over the years. This one has a good formula, it arrived promptly, looks fresh, and is excellent value.  I&#x27;m very satisfied.  Also very nice contact with the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited: I have ordered this multiple times now.  I am very satisfied with the product and the service.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this serum and have been using it for about two weeks.  I notice that my skin is tighter and my pores seem to be getting smaller, but no help on the deep wrinkles on my forehead.  I am being very patient bc I know that it usually takes longer than two weeks to see improvements.  I am hoping and praying that it does wonders on my skin like all of the reviews I have read!!  I read one review that said this is not a full dose of Vitamin C...I am wondering what the differences are between the two vitamin Cs???  Anyone have any info on this???  Anyhow over all I would say it is a good product for the price!</li>
            <li> First, let me be upfront about the fact that the good people at Insta Natural sent me this product to try out and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, let me tell you that this is a quality product that I have no hesitation recommending, if you want to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a problem reviewing this product though, the biggest being that it may take months to see real results and so what am I qualified to say after just 10 days? The other is that it&#x27;s designed to be used with a moisturizer, so which product is doing what? I&#x27;m just being honest here, I will not make false claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, as I say, it&#x27;s a quality product and used with their [[ASIN:B00KCTER3U Anti-Aging Moisturizer]] I&#x27;m seeing temporary results and maybe that&#x27;s good enough for now and it&#x27;s enough to allow me to recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You use so little of this product each time you shouldn&#x27;t be wary of the size, it should last for months. I also found it quite soothing on the small patches of eczema I&#x27;ll sometimes get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to the point, try it with their moisturizer and see for yourself after a month or two. With a money back guarantee, you&#x27;ve got little to lose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps, but I&#x27;m not here to sell this to you by saying that I look 20 years younger after just 5 days and short of surgery, I don&#x27;t anything will, although, after seeing some actors I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good option either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m just being honest.</li>
            <li> I noticed a shine and smoothness to my face after my very first use.  I received multiple positive complements after using products for just a few days.  I would recommend this Serum</li>
            <li> The first couple of uses made me think this serum would be too drying, but I stuck with it.  After maybe 5 days, I was HOOKED!  This serum makes my skin look smoother, reduces pores tremendously, and increases hydration.  I love love love this product . . . and I have tried several different serums! And the company is awesome to do business with!!</li>
            <li> Definitely brightens up my skin! Extremely moisturizing. My skin feels and looks more supple. Will repurchase once I run out!</li>
            <li> I loved it.  It work just as well as  the more expensive kind I will be reordering!</li>
            <li> Great product and nice smell</li>
            <li> Feels great. I use with derma roller prior and then serum and I can actually feel it tightening within minutes while it drys!! I&#x27;m 37 so lines are starting to show 😕</li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes feels soft again.  Nice and smooth.  I love the citrus smell too.</li>
            <li> I use this product after I use my derma roller. It helps my skin heal faster and more smoothly. I don&#x27;t use it on my face, but I suffer from stretch marks and hyperpigmentation scars all over my body from bug bits. I&#x27;m of East/South-East Asian descent.</li>
            <li> *I can not review the effectiveness of this product on its own as I use it with some other products in my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for about 5 weeks now and have seen good results. After a few traumatic microdermabrasion treatments, my normally clear skin started breaking out badly- not just pimples, but with zits and infected bumps all over my face. I desperately wanted to find products that did not have a ton of garbage listed in the ingredients. I stumbled across this serum and began using it on freshly cleansed skin as the first step of my skin care routine. I use 3-4 drops and apply mainly on my cheeks where I have the most amount of breakouts. It&#x27;s important to let this serum completely dry on your skin before applying anything else as that allows the product to really penetrate your skin. After that I apply coconut oil as a moisturizer all over my face. This combination has DRASTICALLY reduced my acne (it&#x27;s mostly all gone), gotten rid of any infections and lightened dark spots on my face. This is a great product for a great price and I really appreciated the &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; emails sent from the company/founder after my purchase.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have only been using a week and I am already seeing brighter skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sold this product at a reduced rate for my unbiased opinion.  I will say that in no way influenced my review as I am very happy with this and all the other Instanatural products I have.</li>
            <li> This serum is responsible for his words. It works. I use it 2 weeks, I have had little spots and I was waiting for this great serum to test it on the spot. And the stain is gone !! This is an excellent result. In addition, I see that my complexion has become more relaxed, refreshed and better cope with fatigue. I commend this product. He is responsible for its price. I&#x27;m choosing other products from this manufacturer. Thank U!</li>
            <li> I have read about the good benefits of using Vit C serum. I have tried a different company but the serum was too liquidy I wanted to use something thicker so I can use it more as a cream. I love it the only thing is the smell...kinda fishy not a big fan of that smell</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. My skin is looking better and my age spots are less noticeable. Can&#x27;t wait to try other products. Will buy again</li>
            <li> We all know how amazing vitamin C is for keeping a healthy balance in the body, fighting infections and stabilizing your immune system. Honestly I had no idea how good it was for the skin as well. What I have found with the Vitamin C serum is its incredible ability to shrink pores and maintain a healthy balance of moisture. I have been doing a lot of reading recently about the skins &amp;#34;acid mantle&amp;#34; - that delicate balance of oil on the skin that maintains the pH balance of 5.5 - what I feel with the Vitamin C serum is that the moisture retention that it provides is really helping my skin maintain its balance. And that just makes me feel good!</li>
            <li> This smells so amazing. My face feels wonderful after using it and I make sure not to neglect my neck, decolletage and hands. i am pushing 40 and look very early 30s :)</li>
            <li> Wonderful skin serum!  Tightens, moisturizes, and smells good too, like oranges!  Absorbs completely with no oily feel at all.  I highly recommend this natural anti-oxidant for your skin&#x27;s sake!</li>
            <li> This is the first time buying this particular Vit C serum for me. I&#x27;m a big fan of Vit C serum and this one seems to be doing the job quite nicely.</li>
            <li> I regularly get sun spots and have some old acne scars, and while using this serum, I do feel like my skin has lightened up a bit, especially the scars and sun spots, and my skin looks brighter! The formula is completely gentle and super moisturizing as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way too, so you will definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this product. You only need 1-2 drops, and that will be plenty to cover your face and neck and provide your skin with the added benefits and moisture. I used mine day and night for maximum benefits. Just be sure to let it soak on your skin for a few minutes before applying your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> “I love this serum. Instant noticeable difference in my skin tone and really helps to smooth out the wrinkles  This is my second time ordering it. Noticeable results within a week of using and a little bit goes along way!</li>
            <li> This product smells so good, it has a light citrus smell that just makes me feel happy.  It feels lightweight but works great at moisturizing my face</li>
            <li> This is my first time using InstaNatural vitamin C, and I am surprised how it changed my face since the first session, I am 31 years old, I have normal skin type, uneven skin tone and dark circles under my eyes, I use 1.5 dermaroler on my face first then I apply few amount of the serum all over my face one a week and the glowing last for a week, not alot of change under my eyes but I think it takes time for dark circle.&lt;br /&gt;Sinse I start using this product, I receive alot of complements on my face and skin, some people get shocked when I tell them my age, some others guessing my age few year younger,, my advice for this serum or any other serum is to use it with dermaroler, no pain no gain, right! and you will be pleased with the result soon enough.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! As I&#x27;ve gotten older, I am struggling with rosacea on my cheeks and chin. This has helped soooooo much!, I looked at a picture that was taken the first week of March, and my face was red all over. I don&#x27;t even use this everyday but it has made an awesome difference. Really, really great!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product!! My skin feels smooth. Its not greasy and drys fast and my face is glowing, my skin feels great!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t put a lot of stuff on my face, it all breaks me out. All of it.  I honestly only bought this because I got it cheaper for a review. After a few hesitant days of applying it in the morning, after I wash my face, I can now say: I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good. It goes on smoothly - it&#x27;s not a moisturizer, but that works for me. I don&#x27;t moisturize with my oily, acne-prone skin (yeah, I know, oil needs oil). I apply a light amount and I&#x27;m done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I haven&#x27;t noticed any miracles. Why? Well, science. You can&#x27;t erase wrinkles. It&#x27;s a nice serum, it hasn&#x27;t broken me out, and I will use it til it&#x27;s gone. I do feel like my cheeks/over-all complexion is a little...more even. I hesitate to say brighter, but I am pleased. We&#x27;ll see how it is in another two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will I buy more? I doubt it - I just don&#x27;t see that it justifies the cost. As with all InstaNaturals products, they throw everything in there. I would try to identify what&#x27;s really working for me, in the long list of ingredients, and go for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, like me, you just need a light moisturizer for the morning time, give it a try!</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum contains 20% vitamin C, ferulic acid, hyaluronic acid and organic aloe.  The combination of these ingredients provide benefits beyond just your skin.&lt;br /&gt;  antioxidant benefits&lt;br /&gt;  diminishes dark spots and discoloration&lt;br /&gt;  nourishes skin&lt;br /&gt;  lightens skin for an even complexion&lt;br /&gt;  made in FDA certified facility&lt;br /&gt;The vitamin C serum does make my skin feel softer and maybe even a little bit plumper.  Also easy to apply. Just put a couple of drops on your fingertip and rub it on your skin and let it asbsorb.  The serum absorbs into your skin quickly and leaves it feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product and very easy to use</li>
            <li> I was looking for a Vitamin C cream, and browsing found t his in Amazon. Based on excellent reviews decided to give it a try. I don&#x27;t regret it. After 4 days using it, my face feels smoother and clearer. Waiting to see how it will look after a few weeks, as I ordered this mainly due to my acne scars.</li>
            <li> I been using this for about 3 weeks and I&#x27;ve noticed my skin looks brighter and my brown spots are lightening a bit already.  Good product and excellent customer service!</li>
            <li> I will leave final judgment until I have used the entire btl.  I am a disappointed that the Serum&#x27;s consistency is very watery which makes the serum difficult to get from dropper - hand - and on the face!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. The addition of the rose hip oil is such a bonus. Staple product in my bathroom!</li>
            <li> Waited to write a review after using the product for at least a month consistently. Applying twice a day seems to have made a definite impact on the softness and suppleness of the skin. I have not noticed any lightning of freckles or age spots, however, but maybe this takes more time. I don&#x27;t have anything to compare this too, but it seems to work for me and a bottle seems to last quite a long time (still have at least half bottle after a month).</li>
            <li> I did not experience any adverse reaction.  Also there was no obvious improvement.  Product was somewhat sticky on application.  Not sure if that is typical.  Hesitant to recommend to others.</li>
            <li> My skin, usually perfect, started suffering from blackheads and acne (no pus, just painless raised bumps) as of May 2015. Since nothing else in my lifestyle had really changed, I decided to turn to products. The rave reviews for this one convinced me to buy. It smells nice (kind of like oranges, albeit a little chemical-y), absorbs easily, is lightweight and leaves no residue. I&#x27;ve used it religiously for 2.5 months but it has done nothing for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sheer abundance of active ingredients, especially for a &amp;#34;reasonable&amp;#34; price, strikes me as odd -- you don&#x27;t see these combinations very often. Are these ingredients of sufficiently high concentrations and quality? Do they offset each other? If the mix is beneficial, why don&#x27;t other companies use them?</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product,  I ordered another two bottles for me and my sister. I have used several products for my uneven skin tone,  nothing worked but since I started using this product,  I have noticed a huge improvement ! Now my skin is clearing and a better texture too. Thanks to this amazing serum by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> Powerful serum made with top quality ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ferulic acid is known for its antibacterial properties. It&#x27;s very effective in treating acne and occasional breakouts. I have noticed that applying a drop of the serum on the problematic spot (say, a pimple), helps get rid of the problem in almost no time. I don&#x27;t get breakouts very often, but I do tend to get a few around &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34;, and applying this serum seemed to have helped significantly. They were under control and gone within a day, as opposed to taking a week or so if left untreated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin E is a powerful antioxidant that protects and repairs your skin. It helps improve the look of your skin - evens out the tone, gets rid of red and brown spots, hydrates. In other words, it helps it look younger and firmer.  It can also reduce sunburns from exposure to UVB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is a relatively new derivative of Vitamin C, it is considered a powerful antioxidant that is gentle on your skin and shouldn&#x27;t cause any irritation. It can treat acne and stimulate collagen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this serum on daily basis for about a month now and my skin seems firmer, more hydrated and healthier-looking. I have been getting compliments about it on no-makup days, which happen more often now that I&#x27;m more confident and happy with the way my skin looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of the serum is quite strong and may be off-putting to some, but with so many wonderful ingredients it&#x27;s really not a big price to pay. It&#x27;s herbal and quite sharp, but not to the point to irritate or really bother you. I eventually got used to it, even though I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of herbal fragrances.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  I use it on my face and neck. Lines have disappeared. I will order again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product twice a day for approximately two weeks. I have noticed an improvement in the texture/smoothness of my skin.  I have not noticed a huge improvement in my sunspots, which is my main area of concern. I will however continue to use this product for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use this affordable, skin tightening product. We love it.</li>
            <li> This serum has been excellent so far... It has helped my dark marks from broken blemishes completely disappear... As with most products it&#x27;s important to use it consistently and as directed... I love this product and it will be a part of my beauty routine... I hope this helps</li>
            <li> I can not see any difference as yet, will keep up with the application and see how it goes</li>
            <li> Love this serum! After a few days of using this serum, I noticed my pores were smaller (I was really shocked by this one... as I definitely wasn&#x27;t expecting that sort of effect), my skin was brighter, and my acne scars faded dramatically. If you research vitamin c and ferulic acid, you will understand why this product works so well. Vitamin C is a great skincare ingredient on its own, but its very unstable. Adding ferulic acid to the serum helps to stablabize the vitamin c as well and enhance its efficacy. For the price and quality, you simply cannot find anything better!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> First time using this product but liking it so far.  Nice absorption and overall hydration</li>
            <li> So far I am very impressed by this vitamin C serum.  I spent some time looking for a serum that contained both vitamin C and hyaluronic acid and this one also contains vitamin E which has many added benefits.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see my sun spots disappear but here&#x27;s hoping!!  I have noticed a tightening and can&#x27;t wait to see the long term benefits.  I would love it even more if it came in a pump.  I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and goes on smooth, having only used it a couple of weeks and not every day but I can notice an improvement in my smile lines.</li>
            <li> I love how clear and bright this makes my face look.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this twice a day faithfully and can honestly state that it does no more or less than any other Vitamin C serums on the market. I definitely don&#x27;t see any fading of the brown discoloration on my face but it does smell good and feels nice on. It is very thick going on and you do have to wait some time before putting on moisturizer. Make sure it&#x27;s fully dry before you put anything else on your face.</li>
            <li> Smells great and makes my face look healthy and moisturized! I was hoping to reduce to appearance of some forehead wrinkles and I feel like it actually is helping, giving the skin a nice healthy glow as well!</li>
            <li> I see no difference as of now!! Is this the product that Dr Oz was talking about?</li>
            <li> This has a rich feel to it. I wash the apply this lotion. Once dry top of with your favorite moisturizer. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> my niece loves it and it has helped to clear her acne</li>
            <li> I use this every day, along with the spray on toner, they keep my face moisturized, feeling and looking refreshed and supple.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and makes my skin glow!</li>
            <li> I love this serum because it&#x27;s so lightweight and my skin glows after putting it on! I haven&#x27;t seen any extreme differences yet, but I&#x27;ve only been using it a couple weeks and these things take time! However, I have noticed that my skin is starting to look softer. And the outer edges of those dark spots are not as dark. I think as time goes on I may just be able to fade this melasma without harsh ingredients!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It appears that spots are lightening on my cheeks and my skin looks clearer.</li>
            <li> I purchased my bottle of InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum For Face for three very good reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) I&#x27;ve spent time researching what active, beneficial and effective ingredients are recommended by experts (like Paula Begoun, who cites her sources) and this serum is a winner.  2.) It&#x27;s a terrific value.  And, 3.)The Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back Promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this serum, nightly, for about two weeks.  Kudos to the company for packaging the serum in cobalt blue, glass bottles.  Repeated or extended exposure to light and/or air can have a negative effect on efficacy.  That, and I hate plastic.  Dispensing it from the dropper, it has a liquid feel.  Pleasant, very faint herbal scent.  After applying it to the face, it feels more dense.  This serum is absorbed into the skin quickly and has a nice feel.  I choose to follow it with a layer of another moisturizer, but that is not necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, It&#x27;s only been two weeks, but my skin already appears to be reaping the benefits.  It&#x27;s smoother, feels more firm.  My pores are clear and I&#x27;ve noticed a more even tone where it was previously uneven.  I am thrilled with this serum and will purchase it again.  I&#x27;ll definitely be recommending it to friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve given Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum four stars - at the moment.  But, at this rate, in two more weeks... I may be updating that to five stars.</li>
            <li> You can see the  difference in your skin in as quick as a few days. I don&#x27;t have many problems with my skin , just mainly acne- and oddly enough I started noticing about a year ago that things with vitamin c helped my skin. I don&#x27;t know exactly why it is that way, but nonetheless this vitamin c worked wonderfully. My acne cleared up and my skin started becoming brighter. I didn&#x27;t keep the bottle though - BUT not because it&#x27;s a bad product, but because my mom ended up liking what it was doing for her skin as well and so I gave it to her. I&#x27;m already on the verge of buying another bottle for me. This line in general is great. I&#x27;ve tried three different products from them already and I&#x27;m in love!</li>
            <li> The new formula and packaging is horrible. They have skimped on the ingredients, and this product does not work. I&#x27;ve used vitamin C for years and am extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 4 wks. It leaves my face soft. However I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s taking care of the dark spots  or hyper pigmentation.  I will continue to use this product as it is recommended to use with Phytoceramides.&lt;br /&gt;Over all product is good. No breakouts or other side effects. Smell is ok, and it goes on smoothly on the skin and gets absorbed rather quickly. No greasy feeling and I can use my sun block on top of it, followed by makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Company followed-up with me to see how product was working for me. I took the opportunity to asked them for a product to target dark spots; they recommended Rosehip oil (they sent me this huge bottle of it to try out for free! - they rock).&lt;br /&gt;Love their customer service! They seem to stand behind their products. This is a company worth dealing with.</li>
            <li> I found this vitamin C a wonderful skin serum,,,I love how a tiny bit goes along way and my face&lt;br /&gt;got incredibly soft and helped with the sagging under my eyes.I will continue to use for along time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into writing reviews, but decided that this product is SO good, that I needed to let everyone know about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  I&#x27;m Chinese, 45, no wrinkles, but DO have sun damage and hyper-pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;2)  I&#x27;ve always had good skin, but decided it was time to really start taking care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled onto this product and have been using it for a week.  I am AMAZED.  My skin is even softer than before, and the sun spots are starting to fade a little.  It is a bit tacky when it&#x27;s first applied, but if you follow it up with moisturizer, it just adds to the healing qualities of this serum.  For $20, it&#x27;s definitely worth trying.</li>
            <li> excellent product - gives skin a nice glow. Smell is light, natural, and uplifting.</li>
            <li> InstaNatural sent me their Vitamin C Serum to review for my blog, GlamRiver.  I am a huge fan of InstaNatural, I have tried just about all their products and I am always impressed with the results!  This Vitamin C Serum is no different, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and has even helped diminish the look of some of my Melasma spots!  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have noticed clearer skin in the short time I have been using this product. Looking forward to seeing how it can help my skin with continued use.</li>
            <li> It smells and looks like orange juice except thicker.  It&#x27;s cooling and refreshing and gives my face a glow that it hasn&#x27;t had in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received the below products for free for review on \\&quot;Pickles and Peppers\\&quot;. I only recommend products/services I use personally &amp; believe my readers will enjoy and/or benefit from. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s 16 CFR, Part 255: \\&quot;Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising</li>
            <li> This product was for my wife and she is enjoying it. She is always looking some products containing Hyaluronic Acid and this bottle has another ingredients in its formula. She has only 3 days using it but she is really happy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also feel great because you sent another bottle since first shipment does not arrive as expected. I congratulate your business for having this costumer satisfaction goal. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing what it claims to. Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after using it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> Smells great and leaves my skin feeling smooth and nourished. I use it in the morning after washing my face and before applying lotion and my makeup. Works great!</li>
            <li> My skin looks amazing after using this for a week.  My pores look a lot smaller and it makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and a great value&lt;br /&gt;Very lightweight formula, I use it every night</li>
            <li> It is good but did not last long. Not enough really to tell weather it works or not on my skin. My skin became drier and made wrinkles more prominent under my eyes. Not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I Recomend it very much</li>
            <li> Been using for 2 weeks.  Can&#x27;t see much difference yet.  I&#x27;ll keep using.</li>
            <li> LOVE, love, love it!! This vitamin C serum is wonderful. I put it on after I cleanse my skin, follow by my moisturizer &amp; eye cream. It also doesn&#x27;t make my sensitive skin flair up. LOVE IT!! Will order again for sure.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vitamin C Serum for about 3 weeks...it has removed some brown spots and helped on my pores...can&#x27;t say it has done much for fine lines or wrinkles.  My skin is softer, though.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Easy to use, absorbs quickly, is a great first step in combination with my 10% Glycolic Acid Cream (by Reviva) for my 55 year old skin. I&#x27;ve noticed brighter skin, smaller pores, and a quicker healing of the occasional pimples and stressed skin with hormonal changes.</li>
            <li> My face feels soft after several usage of this serum. Don&#x27;t see drastic changes, but i&#x27;m sure with anything, it takes time to see great results. So far, it just feels good and i&#x27;m sure Vitamin C is good in general if applied consistently.</li>
            <li> It made me break out. I have a history of breaking out, so I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;m surprised by this.  However, I was hoping it would help clear up some some damage and scarring.  I didn&#x27;t notice any difference, but it did make me beak out.</li>
            <li> Great quality and reasonably priced. I like using good ingredients on my skin but not breaking the bank. You have to at least try it out for yourself</li>
            <li> Great product, goes on smoothly but isn&#x27;t greasy. Fabulous list of ingredients, you can&#x27;t beat this, especially for the price. My skin has a healthy glow in the morning. Still waiting to see if it will fade my sunspots, but so far I am loving this!</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C serum works very well along with the Vitamin C moisturizer. Great prices on these products.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell it is very orange , but i am not sure it is doing something to my face, i dont feel much after I put it on, so I am not sure of the benefits, it says to wake up the skin I just dont feel awaken after I used it. I dont use this daily as I have other products to test, so I may need to give it more love</li>
            <li> The smell was kinda orangeeee.  But I liked it.  my face was very soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> my skin is definitely improved.  I have large pores and this product seems to make them disappear.  Love it and will continue to use everyday.Thank you!</li>
            <li> Just wanted a basic Vit C serum, but really dont like it. Leaves an unpleasant texture on the skin, if i try to put my light moisturizer on top product will ball up and roll off my skin. I think this is because of the aloe, which i have notices tends to do that. Smells like aloe, feels like aloe just not a nice texture under moisturizer and make-up. Will buy from another brand next time.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  I haven&#x27;t been using it for a long time but I do think that it is leaving my skin brighter and smoother.  I also enjoy the sharp scent of orange that I get when I apply it.  It sort of wakes me up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a week so far so I&#x27;ve not been able to notice any major skin improvements regarding any fine lines or age spots but I will say that my skin has never been so soft and smooth! I also had a little break out that was on the verge of being a big breakout and it seems that this product helped to erase it before it became a problem. I&#x27;ll be happy even if having soft and clear skin are the only two benefits that I experience as a result using this product long term.</li>
            <li> Have not used this for any length of time but ..... am pleased with results.  Had a recent facial and was told there is improvement in the eye area and in the area around my mouth.</li>
            <li> This is a good produce</li>
            <li> Love Love Love Great Product I will use this as long as that keep making it!</li>
            <li> This product caused more breakouts in the area where it was applied. So it basically did more harm than help because I now have more dark spots as a result of the new breakouts.</li>
            <li> Delivery on time.  Product works as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it...but am at a loss to what exactly it *might* be helping me with skin-wise.  Seems I must use a LOT of product to feel like I&#x27;m getting adequate coverage.  I won&#x27;t be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product with the age defying moisturizer and the eye cream for dark circles. The results have been amazing! I am not sure if it is the mixture or one product in particular but I can&#x27;t believe how fast this stuff works. Since I started law school my eye bags have been so dark it looks like I got hit in the face and the increased stress has caused some fine lines to appear on my face. I started using this stuff leading up to finals so my sleep levels were much lower than normal and my stress levels were way up but this magic made the dark circles disappear and the fine lines to go away too. Now I can go without makeup and people aren&#x27;t asking me if I am sick. I have tried a lot of different products but none of them have worked quite like these! It does smell like orange juice which is kind of weird and gets sticky if you put too much on but that is a small price to pay for the results I have seen in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> OMG - I bought this product awhile back when it first came out and this is a new and improved version that I LOVE! The additional of rosehip seed oil, sea buckthorn oil and grapefruit essential oil makes it perfect. The original was too &amp;#34;gel-y&amp;#34; and I didn&#x27;t care for the scent. This product hits the mark though. It leaves my face moist and is visibly reducing the appearance of fine lines around my eyes and elsewhere on my face. I am a rancher so I spend a LOT of time outdoors in the sun and the elements and this product is helping to return my face to a more youthful look! Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> It is my position that products purchased on amazon have two-fold ways of being evaluated. Vendors sell products and are reviewed for the quality of the product/item on sale and the manner in which they come across/engage (through shipping, customer service, and returns) to/with the buyer. Every vendor has the option to sell their product through amazon prime and choose either to stock their products with amazon (making amazon the seller) or ship it themselves, but with a fulfillment guarantee from amazon. So long as vendors will opt for the cheap way out, no matter how great their product or service, I will rate them at a tad bit more than 2.5 (50%) stars on the this rating scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is very good product &amp;#34;for me&amp;#34;. I researched and understood (as best I could), through Dr. Google, about my skin type, condition, and concerns. After which, I looked on amazon and read several reviews on more than one such product before using this one.  I am not about to vouch that you drop years or that you loose wrinkles. However, I will confirm that if this product is used based on the vendors instructions with fidelity (twice a day), preceded and followed by other skin care practices, then the pores start getting a little tighter, and overall facial skin health is rejuvenated (looks hydrated, supple and fresh).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will add that I support this regimen with the manufacturer&#x27;s phytoceramides (capsules) and, thus, cannot guarantee that either product alone produces the above results. I am satisfied with the combined treatment/regimen.</li>
            <li> I love the Vitamin C serum.  I had no reaction.  It was so hydrating to my skin.</li>
            <li> Have used for a month,  twice a day,  and no noticeable affect. I have also been using the eye serum and moisturizer by same company. The ingredients seem to be very good though,  just don&#x27;t see any affects.  Will follow up with another review if any noticeable affects occur.</li>
            <li> Love this serum.  This serum does exactly what I needed.  It absorbs quickly and it helps reduce fine lines.  My skin stays hydrated all day.  I use this under my SPF.  Love the smell of it.  Smells like oranges.  You have nothing to lose to try this serum as the manufacturer has a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product.  First of all, I liked the citrus smell it had and the dropper it came with made it easy to control the amount of serum you use.  I liked that it absorbed well into the skin and didn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling.  My skin felt smooth.  I have only been using this product for a week and tried it on an old cut on my hand and it seems to be fading quickly.  I have a sun spot on my face and can&#x27;t wait to try it on my face to see how well it will work.  I will report back after my sun spot experiment.</li>
            <li> Been using this for week and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells very nice. Consistency is smooth, easy to apply. Maybe it&#x27;s too early to tell, but definitely does nothing for discoloration, circles under eyes etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See pictures. First picture was taken third day after using. Second picture was taken another three days later. Iknow the pictures aren&#x27;t that good, but I looked and looked in the mirror. I didn&#x27;t see any noticeable difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not expecting miracles, and like I said, may be too early to tell. I&#x27;d give this another week or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller service is excellent; followed up with emails etc., and I do appreciate the generous return policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d update if I see at least some results. By the way, I apply Era Organics creamer after using this serum, and addressed the compatibility of using this serum (being Vitamin C based) with Era Organics which contains Geogard Ultra. Would appreciate if anyone has opinion about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I don&#x27;t know why pictures did not publish although they showed in the confirmation email from Amazon.)</li>
            <li> I use it on my post surgery scar, it sooth the itch.</li>
            <li> I have actually been using vitamin c serum for a few years now. I used to use it just on my face,however lately I have been using it all down my neck and chest. My skin seems sooooooo much better!!! I was seeing the normal signs of aging in my40&#x27;s,and I need all the help I can get! My dark spots are slightly fading,and my skin feels a little tighter.i will keep using the c serum,I am addicted now,I even keep it in my purse!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum !!!! Its unlike any other of the vitamin C serums that I&#x27;ve purchased from other company&#x27;s in the past. Unlike some of the others that I have tried before that leave my face feeling sticky, dirty and oily this serum leaves my face so soft, its absorbs beautifully, its citrus smell is amazing and it has balanced out my skin tone. Friends and family have been asking how my skin looks as good as it does and I tell them all about this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 4 or 5 weeks and I just purchased my second bottle. I would (and do) definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different Vitamin C serums and I like yours even better than OZ Naturals (a close 2nd) for a few reasons, one being the orange fragrance, absorption is better and cost is less, seems to last a little longer. Works as well as the more expensive ones.Plan to purchase again, cause it has been working. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Smells nice but left my face feeling greasy.  It did make it feel softer but i don&#x27;t like the greasy feeling</li>
            <li> Was originally going to be for my mom, but apparently this isn&#x27;t sensitive-skin-friendly. But screw it. I&#x27;ll just use it instead.</li>
            <li> I have never really tried any serums before so I was happy to review this product. It has a very clean-citrus smell which I like. The serum is very light on the skin and it&#x27;s great if you want a light moisturizer. It absorbs in the skin quickly but leaves the skin feeling hydrated and looking rejuvenated. I love this Vitamin C Serum and I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product. I have been using it for almost 3 weeks now and I can already tell a difference in my skin. The serum is thicker than most and goes on so smoothly. The smell is really pleasant, as it is citrus so it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical smell that will make you sick. I have been using this serum with the InstaNatural Retinol Moisturizer as a part of my nightly routine! This is a great addition to my skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check out my blog review for more details on this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://pintofpretty.com/2014/12/27/instanatural-retinol-moisturizer-and-vitamin-c-review/</li>
            <li> I am 52 years old. Female.  For my age, I have minimal (but enough) wrinkles around my eyes, I do have forehead lines and large pores on my nose. I have always had a more youthful-than-my-age appearance. Recently however, I have been noticing my face starting to droop; sag; fall; whatever you choose to call it and a dull appearance. I have been using this product for about a month now. I noticed immediately that the skin on my face felt more resilient and continues to be as I use the product. Also as the days go by, i am noticing the wrinkles around my eyes are less noticeable, skin tone is even and bright; and the forehead lines have decreased dramatically. I am thrilled to have found this product and do not see myself going without it. I wish I could order enough to take a bath in. LOL...I use it upon awakening and before bed. I wash with my own special face wash before application of serum and my moisturizer after the serum dries (which is seconds). I am ordering my second bottle and one for a friend (who noticed) as well.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh. Clean.  I&#x27;ve been using it for three months now.  Skin seems to be more firm. Smoother.  Wrinkles less prominent.  It woks be a five if I saw dramatic results, so far it&#x27;s a change but not that big to make it a five. I will continue to buy it from this supplier.  The price is right and it seems to be a consistent, solid product.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this for my boyfriend and he really likes it and his skin is looking pretty good.  I already have a lot of skincare product samples due to working in that industry but when I run out I will buy this product for myself!</li>
            <li> Love this serum it smells great and you wake up the next day with a glow.</li>
            <li> Just received this serum a few days ago.  Serum looks and smells very fresh.  Beautiful golden color.  My daughter used it on her skin last night and followed with Insta Natural Rosehip oil.  Her face has been dried and rough from acne creams.  She told me this morning her face felt great, and it did look great and moisturized!  As a side note, great company to buy from.  We had a small problem with my order and they fixed it with no hesitations.  Needless to say i am a happy customer.</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C Serum.  I have tried many, and this one is by far the best.  High in Vit C, but it does not burn.  The consistency is thick, so it doesn&#x27;t run down your face while trying to apply.  It has a wonderful citrus scent.  the scent does not linger, but sure smells nice going on.  The only thing that would make it better is to be in a pump instead of a dropper.  Great Stuff!</li>
            <li> Nice product . Second time ordering.</li>
            <li> very good its like a potion that makes your skin bright and tight</li>
            <li> This vitamin C Serum is an excellent product and purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I have used high priced Vitamin C/Ferulic products purchased through my dermatologist, while they are excellent also, this one from Instanatural is as good for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;I have recommended to my friends and I will continue to order through this seller.</li>
            <li> great product/.service,  absorbs into skin well and has a pleasant aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a short time, but I think it&#x27;s pretty solid and a nice price point.  I have very sensitive skin...it took me years to find my fav moisturized (I use dermalogica skin smoothing cream).  It took my skin a few days to adjust to the oils.  I used it only before bed.  It has a nice, bright grapefruit scent.  I will be sticking with it.</li>
            <li> I love this serum!  I wasn&#x27;t sure when I purchased it if I would but I can truly say it is awesome.  I purposely waited a few weeks to leave feedback to be sure my opinion didn&#x27;t change after the initial uses.  I only became more impressed over time.  I have always had skin issues ranging from sensitivity and Rosaceae to adult acne and many products irritate or cause flare ups but this has improved my skin dramatically!  I have had one particularly troublesome spot on my forehead for about 10 or so years now that has all but disappeared since I began using this vitamin CC serum.  No5hing else has ever really helped it much so I am very excited about this unexpected result.  Thanks to InstaNatural for such a great item that allows me to no longer feel embarrassed by my complexion.</li>
            <li> I am sad to say it did not work for me. I had an allergic reaction to this product. I have a rash on my cheekbones on each side of my face. My eyes have deep wrinkles. I do not have hardly any wrinkles at all but now I look twice my age. I do not like the thickness of this serum. It made it hard to use the dropper. I only used a small amount.  I was using Oz Naturals and my sun spots had faded greatly. My sun spots came back and I live in rainy Oregon. I prefer using Oz Naturals Vitamin C. I am sorry to have to leave this review after all of the positive reviews. It just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> It is as lightweight and silky as other higher end serums. It spreads easily and is absorbed fairly quickly . The smell is very pleasant and in the short amount of time I&#x27;ve been using it, I can see it&#x27;s brightening properties at work already. Very good product for the price point.</li>
            <li> I found it drying...my face felt taught after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always enjoyed using vitamin c serums and this is no exception. While there is a bit of tackiness, it is overall very light and smells pleasant. I like to use it in the morning in conjunction with my sunscreen and I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing results.</li>
            <li> I’ve used a different Vitamin C Serum in the past and fell in love with it. Same goes for this one from InstaNatural! I was a bit surprised to see that this serum is a bit on the thick side and is a bright orange color. However, this serum feels amazing and I can definitely feel the difference in my skin after just one week of use. My skin is more hydrated, even, and clear, and it just looks better as well. I’ve even gone a few days without my normal makeup routine because I just feel more confident. This Vitamin C Serum is a keeper for sure!</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Do not like orange color and feels sticky going on</li>
            <li> Noticed no difference.</li>
            <li> It works, this product has brought youth back to my badly dehydrated skin. The sun completely drained my youthful glow and this vitamin C serum along with the instanatural rose hip oil has brought my confidence back. My glow is returning and dark spots are clearing.  Love Love Love. I will reorder for sure.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT, LOVE IT.  I need to re-order.</li>
            <li> It is hard to judge effects when I use more than one product regularly.  But my very sensitive skin never has a problem with this formulation, and my skin feels soft and smooth.  I&#x27;ve used a very expensive, prescribed Vitamin C Serum in the past; this looks and feels the same, and I really appreciate the affordable price.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t particularly like it .I have very sensitive skin, so give it a try, it may be alright for you.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is great for your skin and this products is too! It come in a nice glass bottle with a droper!</li>
            <li> This is a great product at a reasonable price. The texture is nice and product absorbs very quickly into skin. I apply this antioxidant serum every morning and follow with a sunscreen. After a few weeks use, I already see smaller pores and brighter skin tone. Helps with brown spots too.</li>
            <li> This company has excellent customer service. My order arrived on time, and I&#x27;ve received several follow up emails asking how my experience with the product is going. I have only been using the Vitamin C Serum for Face for a few weeks, but I have noticed a lightening of the melasma on my forehead. I&#x27;ve heard many customers reported great results after using it for two months, so I am hoping I experience the same. I definitely recommend this product, as it works well and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and I can put my sunscreen and makeup over it. Have not noticed any color toning, but my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> Will keep using as it does a decent job.  Good price and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Use morning and night under your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My favorite vitamin c serum- easy to apply, great consistency, helps get rid of fine lines</li>
            <li> I love this stuff so much I bought the face moisturizer as well.  They work great together.  My skin is soft and acne free.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much.  Goes on smoothly and soothes my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much better n helps with wrinkles!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the great reviews, but I&#x27;ve seen no difference, what so ever. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and nothing.</li>
            <li> Great product! Face is brighter and smoother!</li>
            <li> I started using this about 2 weeks ago and while I can&#x27;t see any dramatic changes just yet, I&#x27;m enjoying the refreshing scent and easy application.  Using this together with the Retinol cream is keeping my skin fairly happy and although I&#x27;ve had some breakouts, they heal pretty quickly.  Hope to be even more impressed with this in time to come.</li>
            <li> I am using this every night and then applying my regular moisturizer.  I do see some improvement in some of my &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; lines....but nothing spactatular...I will probably buy it again if the price stays the same.</li>
            <li> NO real difference noted after 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I heard a lot about vitamin c and benefits of it. I see no benefit to this serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for four months and see no effects. Maybe it&#x27;s me?</li>
            <li> I am still using this product and I am quite satisfied with it</li>
            <li> This is a great product! It works as well as retin A for me.</li>
            <li> I really love it!!! Must to have for your facial skin care. It makes my skin really fresh, it doesn&#x27;t make it greasy and very nice to use in the summer.</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful product! saw difference within 3 days! I am very careful and do research on products I buy, because I have been so disappointed in products I&#x27;ve ordered in past. this serum sinks into skin, no oily face. it smells a little funny, but that goes away fast. best serum I have tried. the prices are vey good at this company, large size also!! try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. very fast delivery also.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin look worse over the last two months since buying. This is the only new product that I have been using that would be making me break out, and I now have patches on my cheeks of what looks like eczema- red, flaky, blistery. I was MUCH happier with the CE+Ferulic combination I bought on amazon previously. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Guys don&#x27;t generally put a ton of effort into face cleansing until the wrinkles start. When that happened, I picked up a Clairsonic Mia (cheapest model), a good cream cleanser, and instanaturals vitamin c serum for use after washing. Easy to apply, great citrus smell, and dries quickly. Within 10-15 minutes I moisturize and look refreshed with a not-so-subtle glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way - and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I totally love this!! Great product!! Very pleased and plan to buy more...</li>
            <li> Wish I knew about this product sooner. I love it. I took before pictures and after 11/2 weeks of using it along wit h your hyaluronic acid serum (professional forula) and youth express eye gel, (utimate eye and face treatment) I see a big difference. A friend of mine said, “Your skin looks amazing! What are you doing?”  Love this product will continue to use it! I recommended this to alot of my friends.</li>
            <li> I use this InstaNatural Vitamin C serum and I found that my skin is looking very smooth and radiant, plus I also receive compliments on my pretty skin. I love that the InstaNatural products are all natural. I use it on my face and neck and I would recommend the Vitamin C moisturizer to use after this serum to anyone wants a natural moisturizer that hydrates your face all day and improves your skin texture and radiance while helping diminish fine lines and wrinkles. They are a wonderful match for beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on well. Absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> Having purchased several products from this line, I must say this ties the Youth Express Eye Gel as my favorite.  In addition to brightening my complexion, I am thrilled on how much firmer my skin feels.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin C serum!  I immediately feel my face tighten and smooth and have noticed a significant difference around my eyes in particular.  The small fine lines at the corners are less noticeable and appear more smooth.  Also the skin under my eyes both feels and appears more firm and smooth.  My face also feels moisturized although I do follow up with InstaNatural Rosehip seed oil also.  Both products are superior for my skin and I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> only been using for a couple of weeks, but skin does feel smoother so far</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with the serum. A little goes a long way and it absorbs quickly. I bought it for my acne and hyperpigmentation, I&#x27;ve had a couple of stubborn breakouts and they are already shrinking. The serum isn&#x27;t greasy and doesn&#x27;t sting my skin, it&#x27;s early yet, but I&#x27;m very optimistic about it. Oh and the seller has been wonderful. I received an email from them immediately after my order thanking me for my purchase and with instructions on how to best use the product. I emailed them with a few questions and the response was quick and helpful! I&#x27;ll post a follow- up review after using the product a little longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied with the results of this Serum. I&#x27;ve used many vitamin C serums in the past and have always been very impressed with the power of vitamin C. It hasn&#x27;t produced any results which they are claiming. I want my money back</li>
            <li> I use this serum over my toner and under my moisturizer every morning. I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s light, smells great and you get fast results. I would definitely recommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> So far so good, may be to early to tell.</li>
            <li> 2nd purchase. Love It and I have very picky skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product but I have not seen a reduction in wrinkles but no more no less I think it may take more time and another bottle other wise I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 41 and am showing signs of age. I love this serum because it&#x27;s natural, cruelty free and has high concentrations of vitamin C to clear my pores and keep my skin smooth and glowing;)</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! It really works I have noticed a huge difference in my skin tone and texture. I use it on my hands as well. Definitely a must have!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!!!  It goes on great &amp; absorbs well.  Since I&#x27;ve started using it, my skin has never looked better!  My brown spots are fading &amp; wrinkles seem to be diminishing!  I use their Vitamin C Toner first &amp; let dry, then apply this Vitamin C Serum (a little goes a long way!), then follow with their Vitamin C Moisturizer in the morning &amp; their Retinol Moisturizer at night to really zap those wrinkles &amp; prevent new ones!  So far it&#x27;s really helping &amp; will only use these products on my skin!  I&#x27;ve tried many other products from this company &amp; absolutely love all of them (from their hair products to face products).  No other product compares &amp; their prices are really great too compared to similar products out there.  I highly recommend their entire product line &amp; love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all natural.  Your face will love it &amp; you&#x27;ll definitely see a difference within a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for free for testing purposes, and would definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> too soon to see results</li>
            <li> I recently got the vitamin c serum and so far I really like it. When I put it on at night I could feel it working, when I woke in the morning my skin felt soft and smooth. It also has a citrus smell that I really liked as well. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Product provided for free for testing purposes. So far this is the only Vitamin C serum that doesn&#x27;t produce little red dots all over my face (trust me, I&#x27;ve tried ALL OF THEM). I use it morning and evening under a moisturizer.  I have a light case of Melasma on my face from my last two pregnancies and sun over exposure so we shall see if it helps that in any way.  I will update this review in 30 days with my final findings.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: February 2, 2015 - My 16 year old son is also using this serum and it has almost completely cleared up his blackheads, whiteheads and oily skin.  My skin is looking better by the day, so far so good. :)&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: March 18, 2015 - The red dots finally appeared on my face and disappeared after I stopped using the Vitamin C.  Obviously since this happens with all vitamin C products, I am unable to use it for obvious reasons but alas, my 16 year old son LOVES it so I&#x27;ll keep purchasing. :)</li>
            <li> I use a few of the Instanatural products and I love all of them and just absolutely cannot say enough of the quality of their products and ingredients.I wish I could honestly own every product they make. I just ran out of this serum it lasted me about two months but I think I actually used more than I needed to so it probably would have lasted longer. I got this product because I wanted to even my skin tone and I have sensitive skin so it tends to get red easily. I felt like this product definitely lightened my skin. I also really enjoyed the smell as well, it smells citrusy. I felt like this product also made my skin look energized, radiant, glowing.</li>
            <li> I used this serum along with the Vitamin C moisturizer for about a month now, and it worked really well. I noticed the difference on my chest first with the sun spots and freckles becoming less noticeable. It took longer to make a difference on my face. But now I notice the spots are fading and my skin is not so splotchy. I have very sensitive and VERY dry skin. This did not irritate my sensitive skin at all and I LOVE the smell.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of this, a little goes a long way.  Oh and it smoothed out my rough, dry skin too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> Felt sticky. Like putting OJ concentrate on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product in the past, and notice some changes. The consistency is a bit heavier , and the color when putting on your face is very orange but fades within minutes. I use this product everyday, and have notice a improvement in my crows feet, and it helps with old scars from acne. The ingredients are natural, and there is a slight odor of caffeine, again this vanishes quickly. Customer service is excellent and the product was delivered quickly. I would order this product again</li>
            <li> This is a superrrr concentrated product! It&#x27;s a crock full of vitamin and oil goodness; I like to use it on those days my skin needs a little TLC and I think it has done wonders for my complexion (honestly!). It&#x27;s got a slightly citrusy scent and I really like the dropper applicator. A couple drops goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good way to use this is to add it onto your normal moisturizer or even your sunscreen for some extra skin benefits.</li>
            <li> I use this serum along with my vitamin C moisturizer at night. I apply it generously on my face, neck, and hands. My skin absorbs the product immediately and my pillow does not stain at all. The product comes in a dark bottle as vitamin C should not be exposed to light to remain potent. The bottle also includes a pump so you don&#x27;t contaminate the product with your fingers. A few drops would be sufficient to cover your face, neck, and hand with the product. The good thing that, you don&#x27;t have to use a moisturizer after this serum unless you want to. You can also wear it under your make up. Note: This product is provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I received this moisturizer as a sample to provide my honest feedback on. Nevertheless, this does not affect my opinion on the efficacy. Here are my thoughts on InstaNatural&#x27;s vitamin c serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying out InstaNatural&#x27;s 20 % vitamin c moisturizer, I tested out this serum. The reason I did not use the 2 together was due to an illness NOT RESULTING FROM PRODUCT USE, so I did not want to overwhelm my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I had great results with the moisturizer, I expected to see results with this serum. With ingredients like hyaluronic acid, ferulic acid, vitamin e, organic rosehip oil, sea buckthorn oil, organic argan oil, this serum seems amazing. And it was! I&#x27;ve had a chance to try out a lot of vitamin c serums for a particular skin condition I have and InstaNatural&#x27;s was the first that had such a vast mix of ingredients that all worked together. Not only does it contain active ingredients to help your skin renew itself like vitamin c and ferulic acid but it also contains ingredients to help soothe and moisturizer your skin for a longer period of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you apply this serum on cleansed skin, it will absorb within a few minutes and leave your skin silky smooth without being greasy. You can then apply your moisturizer but I prefer to wait for a while. Since I have a lot of scars, I have to use this on every area on my face every night. 1 ounce has lasted me for almost 3 months which is ideal because any skincare product with vitamin c oxidizes so you will not be able to keep an open bottle for years. At most, you should use up an opened bottle within 6 months. If you have less areas to worry about, this will probably last for that amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve used this for a few months, I&#x27;ve had a slight change, mainly in the early stages of using it. My skin is really stubborn so I think it got used to the serum and it wasn&#x27;t as effectiveness. I still think this is a good serum if you would like to help even your skin texture and complexion, InstaNatural&#x27;s vitamin c serum will be useful.amin c serum will be useful.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have sensitive skin so I cannot wear makeup or any moisturizer and this product is perfect no rashes no allergies  nothing. I use it everyday and it makes my skin feel good.</li>
            <li> Great product. Helps with my Melasma and age spots on my hands.</li>
            <li> Having tried many anti aging products, and some were very expensive, I found this Vitamin C Serum better than anything I&#x27;ve used so far.  It is so light, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and my skin immediately feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, our face is not the only part that has lines and wrinkles so I put a drop on my hands could not believe the difference.  So now I&#x27;m using it on my arms and knees and am seeing a wonderful improvement.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C has been working for me, I’ll continue using this product. The only odd, in my opinion is the smell of the product, I was probably expecting the smell of fruits such as oranges but no. When I&#x27;m out in the sun i get red dots on my skin from the heat but when i apply this product that same night the spots go away. I recommend this product also for people who have dry skin, it makes you skin a lot less dry and more healthy. I recommend using the product before going to bed.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C always causes wonders to my skin, as it has great skin healing properties. I believe this serum improved my skin condition and made me break out much less. I&#x27;m so pleased!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C Serum for 3 weeks now and WOW what a difference. Had some areas of discoloration from sun and acne and it has significantly improved those areas. My skin appears brighter and smoother, will definitely purchase again</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I especially love the way it smells...like oranges and so clean. Didn&#x27;t notice a real big difference but I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Really moisturizing and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin sticky</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a month now, my skin looks clearer and more radiant! easy to apply &amp; nice light citrus scent too</li>
            <li> Smells a bit odd, and may overdry, but put on a moisturizer afterward and this is a great product. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is an amazing serum, smells great, makes my skin softer, and brighter, rejuvinates and nourishes skin. Leaves yellow marks on your towel if you don&#x27;t let it absorb in your skin prior. A little pricy as I am so in love with it and use it every day on my skin. I would call it fountain of youth. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> In general, I felt that this serum was pretty average. It definitely made my skin feel softer and more elastic. However, while my skin felt better I did not really notice a difference in how it looked. I used this product because it was provided free for me to test out and give my honest feedback, but I doubt that I would repurchase it simply because I did not notice any difference in the way my skin looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> It might be magical thinking, but I do feel like this has had a brightening, evening effect on my skin after about one month of use. I combine it with retinol and occasional IPL treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is lovely, bright and citrusy which goes away after it&#x27;s absorbed. It is a thick serum but it absorbs quickly and does not have any sort of sticky/residue feel. There is no sting from the acidity.</li>
            <li> The color of this product once open is totally orange!!! That means the whole bottle is heavily oxidized!!! I can&#x27;t find manufacture date or expiration date on the bottle, no any batch code etc.&lt;br /&gt;I checked the ingredients and find carrot oil, I don&#x27;t understand why the company ad this, maybe to mask the oxidized color? Anyway, I still tried it on my face and wanted to see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;Big mistake! The next day my face looked patchy, yellow and felt extremely dry.&lt;br /&gt;This is a scam! I regret to try such an un-safe, un-tested, probably home made stuff without any quality control on my face.</li>
            <li> This is the fifth product I&#x27;ve tried from Insta Natural, and once again, I love everything about it. Perfect texture, wonderful, subtle citrus scent, and my skin in general seems more &amp;#34;dewey&amp;#34; and has a glow, to the point where I rarely wear foundation anymore. Still hoping to find a product to lighten a sun spot on my face. A customer rep for Insta Natural did make a suggestion so I&#x27;ll resort break pin that leader. BTW, the customer service in general is very responsive and personal, and they seem to really care about your experience of their products, encouraging honest feedback. I am switching over to the Insta Natural line exclusively. Great value for the price, and I like that their products are organic / holistic. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I use InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum along with InstaNatural Vitamin C Toner as part of my daily facial routine.  I can honestly say that my face feels refreshed along with a great citric smell but not overpowering.  It also feels a bit tightened but not uncomfortable just noticeable and brightened if that makes sense.  Can&#x27;t wait to order the Emu Oil as a moisturizer.  I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the way this serum makes my skin look and feel. It gives me a nice glow. I can see the fine lines diminishing.  My skin feels so soft. It smooths and firms the wrinkles. I am happy to recieve this product to review. I really like using it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Vitamin C serum from InstaNatural for three months and I have to say my skin is softer and younger looking. It spreads on very nicely and a little goes a long way. I apply it over my face and neck. The ingredients are all natural and does not clog your pores. I have used several products from InstaNatural company and I very impressed. I would recommend to try their products.&amp;#34;  Updated review 3-20-2015 -  I have finished my first bottle of the Vitamin C Serum and I have place order for three more, so this will tell you how great InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum is working for me.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth this product goes on. When it dries it leaves no oily spots or residue. My skin feels so moisturized and soft after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried high end, expensive serums but none can beat this. The citrus smell is so refreshing and my skin feels smoother and silkier since I began using it. This will definitely become my go to serum.</li>
            <li> This serum smells fantastic, and leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few vitamin C serums, and find this one to be excellent.  It feels fresh and clean going on, and my face feels nourished and protected.  I&#x27;m not sure I can claim miracles, but that would be silly with any single product, I believe, although we&#x27;d all like to find a $20 miracle..........that&#x27;s just not how it works, I&#x27;m afraid (but still open to the possibility).  This serum smells delicious, and is thin and relatively watery as they all are in my experience, but stays juicy long enough for me to spread two big drops all over my face, including around my eyes, then absorbs and dries in a matter of seconds.  Sometimes it&#x27;s all I need if I want to go light, but I usually follow it with the InstaNatural eye gel, which is also a fantastic light moisturizer.  I will continue to purchase this product, and other Instanatural products, as I really feel they are made of pure and fresh ingredients, and they keep my face feeling fresh and clean and well fed.  My daughter is impressed with how smooth and silky my 50 year old male face feels, and from a 15 year old that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li> I have used many Vitamin C Serums, but this one is bad. It has an awful sulphur smell that I have NEVER smelled in any serum before.It lingers for a long time after putting it on. I won&#x27;t put this on and go out into public. Even my son remarked on the smell! It&#x27;s extremely watery, yet dries sticky. Will not be buying this again.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does.  I bought this for my husband and it works really well for age spots.</li>
            <li> Feels smooth not sticky.</li>
            <li> This worsened my blackheads and smells horrible, it also does not even moisturize at all.  What a waste of money, it smells horrible too.  This is by far the worst serum I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  (I&#x27;ve tried at least 50 different types of serums)</li>
            <li> My beauty routine is pretty simple, but I think I&#x27;ll add this product to my daily schedule.  It has a wonderful smell, and feels very nice on my face.  I purchased this product at a reduced price, but the comments and rating are 100% my opinions.</li>
            <li> I naturally have good black skin but I have neglected skin care for quite some time. I was not sure what this product was going to do but I needed to repair my face from the damage of the Caribbean sun, to regain moisture and to clean clogged pores. Together with taking to time to wash and tone my face and neck two times per day, a small amount of serum rubbed into my face and neck has really evened out my complexion, repair my pores and I have only used it for about 2 weeks. This is great!!!</li>
            <li> I must say this serum is nice as I can use it on my eyes even and neck without any reaction.  Important to me.  The great ingredients should be helpful with my dry skin.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for almost two weeks and I really like it. It has a clean, citrus aroma. It feels silky on your skin and I have been using it twice a day. My pores do seem smaller and my skin seems to be more even in color.  I would defiantly buy again!</li>
            <li> Really good stuff so far.  I decided to try it on my scalp where I have lost hair and been told by the dermatologist that it will not grow back.  I have already experienced some regrowth anyway, thanks to vitamins, but tried this serum.  My scalp itched just like it did with the vitamins, and lo and behold, I saw some hair regrowth after a couple of days!  The serum looks and smells like thick orange juice.  I also tried it on my rosacea, and I&#x27;m not sure it did anything for me there.  Seems like a good product and worth the price, though.</li>
            <li> I am a retired woman with very fair skin who has lived her entire life in beach states that advertise themselves as being sunny all the time, and a woman whose career kept her outside in the sun a majority of her work hours.  Due to my age, moisturizer was the only product available for the first 25 years or so of my life, and sunscreen with SPF only became available when I was close to 30.  After I became eligible for Medicare, I noticed for the first time that nasolabial folds and some slight, fine wrinkles and lines were beginning to appear on my face and neck.  I started searching for products to help because tools like botox and surgical intervention don&#x27;t interest me.  After quite a few expensive disappointments with major cosmetic firm products, I found this InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum for Face.  I am quite happy with the results; the nasolabial folds are noticeably lighter and the fine surface lines are nearly unnoticeable.  I am impressed by the ingredient list, but even more, I am impressed by the company.  I emailed a question or two to them and got a very detailed answer as well as an offer for a sample of another product, and a repeated offer to assist with information any time I need it to reach all of my skincare goals.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Makes my face so soft.  I have had tons of compliments that my face looks younger.  Not sure if it exactly this product but I do believe it helps.</li>
            <li> I received this serum on January 27, 2015. I&#x27;ve been using it every day since I got it and I really love it! I have hyperpigmentation or left over acne marks and I apply this every morning after I cleanse my skin, and before moisturizing. I also apply it every night after I derma roll my skin. This serum definitely speeds up the process of fading my marks. I also love the smell and texture of it, and how fast it sinks into my skin when I pat it in. Overall, it&#x27;s a great serum that doesn&#x27;t clog my pores! I recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product every evening and really don&#x27;t see any differences . The product has a nice smell to it , but so far it is not what I expected . I will continue to use it for another week and update my review.</li>
            <li> I tried this with my hot/cold infuser machine, this vitamin c serum work really well, I notice the fine lines on my forehead is lighter, also the laugh lines. I also notice that my skin is brighter, assuming is due to the green tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> I like the smooth texture it leaves on the skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about a week, but i like the way it makes my skin feel.  If i notice a difference in my skin, i will definitely buy it again, but right now it&#x27;s a bit too early to tell.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t started using yet. I know it will make a difference</li>
            <li> This is OUTSTANDING. I have used other hyaluronic serums from this same company which I felt didn&#x27;t give me enough moisture but this one does not share the same problem. It is moisturizing but not greasy at all, and it has a delightful orange scent. I love putting it on in the morning, the citrus smell and the little jolt of moisture and energy my skin gets just makes me feel better. Gives a slightly dewy look without looking sweaty or shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t anything I would do to change this product; I think it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Just finished a bottle in 5 weeks or so- had no visible effect on my skin. If anything my skin became darker and coarser, but it was probably due to the sun. Will not buy this product again- good price but I&#x27;d prefer something that works.</li>
            <li> Love it, works great .. good under skin cream or makeup</li>
            <li> Anti-Aging oils and creams the fountain of youth. Has Insta Natural found that fountain of youth? Well, I don&#x27;t think so, but they do have an oil that is super nice that makes my skin feel really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hyaluronic acid, one of the many active ingredients in this serum, has been shown to tighten skin and reduce the appearance of wrinkles. The other vitamins in this product are all wonderful for your skin. Instead of buying the outrageously expensive serums from the mainstream cosmetic companies, this is an excellent alternative for much less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this serum a lot. It has a slight sharp citrus smell. The odor does not linger. It feels wonderful when I apply it to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have successfully tried moisturizers from Lancôme, Estee Lauder, or Borghese, this might be worth a try. The ingredients in this serum have been shown to help with reducing wrinkles. Insta Natural has done a wonderful thing and listed the ingredients in the product description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a review sample.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to give an accurate review, but I&#x27;m seeing a slight improvement after 2 weeks. I haven&#x27;t had any negative reactions and look forward to seeing more results after 2-4 more weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a little over a week but I can tell that I&#x27;m going to like it. It&#x27;s a lightweight, non-greasy serum that doesn&#x27;t break my face out. My skin feels very soft after applying it and my fine lines seem less noticeable. Time will tell if my skin will improve with constant use. I&#x27;ll update after a month or two.</li>
            <li> I like this item.&lt;br /&gt;Its a very useful item.&lt;br /&gt;thank you ))</li>
            <li> Smell pretty good and I use it once per week.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s working well. Too soon to say, but I think it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be truly objective, but I think I am looking younger.  I use this every morning before my moisturizer. love it!</li>
            <li> The product is working well, no side effects and my skin is gradually coming back to life, thanks</li>
            <li> Feels light and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin.  It has a strong orange fragrance at first but quickly disapates.  I put it on, let it dry, then apply moisturizer.  Seems to work really well, so far.</li>
            <li> Product was packed very well in bubblewrap.  Arrived very quickly.  I love this product!  My skin looks brighter, younger, and softer than ever before!  This is definitely a product I will continue to use!</li>
            <li> First, I have to say, this stuff is the most beautiful shade of orange! lol&lt;br /&gt;It almost looks like you&#x27;re rubbing orange juice on your face! but let me tell you...&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s MIRACLE JUICE!  It makes your skin so silky, soft, smooth, and bright. I have very dull and oily skin and this has changed that! 100% changed that! I put it on at bedtime before my moisturizer and wake up with bright brand new skin! I also enjoy the very light scent that it has.</li>
            <li> This serum smells and looks like orange juice!  This is a glass bottle with a glass dropper and is wrapped well for shipping and arrived in perfect condition.  It&#x27;s easy to use the dropper and apply the serum to your skin.  I like that it smells good and has healing properties to help tighten and moisturize my skin.  It feels good going on and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li> My face is so soft. It smells just like oranges and works great. I had really dark pours on my nose and they are lighting up and almost gone.</li>
            <li> I love this! I was surprised when I opened it and the serum was orange, but it doesn&#x27;t tint your skin in any way. I love the orange scent, too!</li>
            <li> I very happy  but I think I need time to use so I can see is work</li>
            <li> I am using this in conjunction with the hyaluronic acid serum by InstaNatural. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or make me break out. I will usually know after one application if something is going to give me bumps and acne. It has brightened my complexion and minimized my pores.</li>
            <li> Within a few days my brown spots started to fade and after two weeks they are hardly noticeable. Although topical are not going to achieve the same results as fillers and surgery, I have noticed that the fine lines look much softer. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have used other (more expensive) brands of vitamin C serum in the past so I wasn&#x27;t sure how the InstaNatural brand would compare.  The 5 stars were earned because I love this product!  I have a few fine lines and dark spots that looked much better after the first week of use.  It leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated.  With the money back guarantee, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Have not yet seen any results because I&#x27;ve only been using it for 3 weeks, but all in all I like the product and it&#x27;s very soothing on my sensitive skin, smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> This serum is great and more concentrated than my previous serum. It works, but I also use a cleanser and moisturizer and I typically wear the serum doing the day because it is so light weight and does not make my face shiny or oily.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this! She said it has a good smell and is thicker than others!  Customer service is GREAT with this company too! Will reorder from them again.</li>
            <li> It works amazingly well on my face!!! Totally love it</li>
            <li> I made sure to wait a few weeks after using this product to write a review, and I&#x27;m glad that I did. I bought this serum after I ran out of my previous vitamin c serum of a different company. I noticed its very low price and thought that I would try it out. I regret the decision and should have paid the extra money for the other serum. After a few weeks of use I didn&#x27;t notice any changes to my complexion. Then I noticed blotches on my skin after using the product. I discontinued the serum and the blotches are slowly fading. Would not recommend this and am disappointed in myself for not buying the best for my skin.</li>
            <li> Been using for about 2 weeks now.  Noticeably better feeling skin and fewer breakouts. I think its a keeper!</li>
            <li> Great product. I would recommend this product to anyone. Their price is very affordable and I think works just as good as a higher priced product. Customer service is also number one</li>
            <li> After 1 bottle I saw results in my dark spots.... I love this serum!  😘</li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m loving the smell and feel of this when I rub it into my face. Looks and smells like fresh squeezed oranges. It&#x27;s very refreshing to put on and I follow with my Clinique lotion (yellow bottle).</li>
            <li> It was delivered quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and glides on my face and neck without feeling sticky or greasy. Gives my skin a nice glow - Will definitely keep using it!</li>
            <li> I just love it. I read a Shakira&#x27;s interview that this is the only thing she uses (not this brand, though) so I decided to try it. You really don&#x27;t need anything else when using Vitamin C. When I put it at night I wake up with a baby face (no puffy eyes or anything). Hmmm, maybe I just happened to sleep better those nights :-) but....</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Does its job.</li>
            <li> This product seeps into the skin and brightens my face. I like how I can wear it under my moisturizer. I usually break out with everything and this does not make me do that so its good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m still on my first bottle and not sure when I&#x27;m going to see the effects of this serum. I can tell you it smells really good and I don&#x27;t have any problems with it looking orange on my face. It does not irritate my face at all. I have been using it every morning and evening. I&#x27;m really hoping that it will fade a few dark spots on my face in time.</li>
            <li> It smells like oranges but it&#x27;s actually yellow in colour. The formula is very nourishing to the skin. I love the fact that it isn&#x27;t heavy when applied (though it depends on how much you massage into the skin). I use a small amount over the entire face but usually need a tad bit more than dime size when I take it onto my neck and chest. It doesn&#x27;t seem to carry an immediate impact but if used consistently you will see result and the results are undeniable. It softens and even out the skin causing scars and hyper-pigmentation to diminish at a substancial degree. Your skin will take on a healthy appearance and glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I did receive this product to try out and review. I have since then written a detailed review on my blog thebeautyanalytic.blogspot.com</li>
            <li> It was not as viscous as other types</li>
            <li> Have really good skin but this definitely made a difference and all my friends using this now! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for over two weeks along with the cleaner, toner, and moisturizer. Unfortunately, I have not notice any difference in fine lines, or other noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels so soft from using this product. I have people complementing my complexion saying I look younger.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful C product . I can see results with in days . Thank you ! I keep using this forever .</li>
            <li> I love this. It only takes a few drops to cover my whole face, it dries within seconds and have a very pleasant citric smell. Leaves my face very soft.</li>
            <li> Great product.Dries soft and smells like citrus. love this.</li>
            <li> The serum is beautiful. It is natural and has a delicious smell..I have been using it everyday and feel confident that i am not putting chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well, at about 1/3 of the price of other vitamin C serums.  Wish I could compare it to something more expensive, but I just can&#x27;t bring myself to spend $60 on vitamin C.  They sent a nice email explaining how to take care of the bottle and how long you can expect the serum to remain useful before it expires.</li>
            <li> Its 2weeks since i am using and i am sooo happy with it! Ive seen how my skin getting soft, nice and no much wrinkles!&lt;br /&gt; For sure i will became addicted!:)</li>
            <li> I like this serum. It&#x27;s light and one half squeeze is all you need so the bottle lasts forever. As to whether it is helping with lines, age spots, and the like, the jury is still out, as I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to determine that.</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes a huge difference when I use it 2x a day .Use morning and night after washing face. Put sunscreen on afterward in the morning. I use Skinceutical with zinc. Once a day is not enough to keep the fine lines/ wrinkles at bay.Have tried lots of products but this formula is the best.  Am in my 70 &#x27; s . Most people think I am in my 50&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this Vitamin C Serum. I use it twice a day before make-up application and after make-up removal.</li>
            <li> Completely happy  us working... Great</li>
            <li> Love the way this makes my skin look so bright</li>
            <li> I am very familiar with skin care products and have tried many, MANY products to get to the great routine that I have presently, so I&#x27;m no amateur when it comes to serums and that like. I have used a good number of serums, and a couple of vitamin C serums, and this is the first time I&#x27;ve seen a Vitamin C serum that wasn&#x27;t clear with a slight yellow tint. This is literally the first time I&#x27;ve seen one that is milky in consistency, the color of yellow (Yes, I&#x27;m aware that they said the color could change depending on weather/season/blahblah. Still does not explain the overall nonsense solution), and smells like oranges. For all I know it was nothing but orange juice. It did absolutely NOTHING for my skin. I was so annoyed when I first saw the solution and knew in my gut that this was a crap product and I was right. Do NOT waste your money. If you want a quality Vitamin C serum look into OST Original Pure Vitamin C20 Serum, this product actually works in the most amazing ways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t imagine how this product has so many good reviews. Either the users aren&#x27;t familiar with skin care and can&#x27;t tell whether a product is actually good or not, or they&#x27;re falling for the hype with all the great reviews that people are probably being paid to write and the placebo effect kicked in. For the life of me I honestly can&#x27;t understand the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this serum for a little over a week, but so far I love it. My skin feels wonderful after using it. It glides on smoothly and has a fresh aroma. With the dropper, you can use as little or as much as you want. I can instantly feel my skin tightening as it absorbs in, which is rather quickly. I&#x27;ll be honest, I&#x27;m not very consistent with using most products on my face because I usually just feel like I&#x27;m slathering something on that is not doing anything except clogging my pores which leads to a break out in a few days. I&#x27;ve not had that problem with this product, and I was back on here looking to see what more I can find that is made by InstaNatural. Last but not least, I love the price!</li>
            <li> In addition to feeling sticky, this product gave me strange bumps on my temples after about 2-3 weeks of use. Even after I stopped using the product the bumps were nearly impossible to remove, I ended up having to get a facial to have them extracted. My skin isn&#x27;t the most sensitive and I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any other product. I&#x27;m nervous now to try any other Vitamin C serum but if I ever do it&#x27;ll be one from a more trusted brand- don&#x27;t use products on your skin just because they&#x27;re cheaper than the competitors!</li>
            <li> First of all, I have never written a review of any product,  this is my first because I really like this great product. After watching Dr. OZ on TV, I was looking for a serum with vitamin C for my uneven skin tone. I tried two other products on Amazon and nothing worked.  I tried the InstaNatural vitamin C serum and saw results in two weeks.  This product really works and I am so happy, my skin tone has improved and my face looks brighter! I ordered two more bottles of this serum,  one for me and one for my sister, also I was so impressed I ordered some other products for my face and hair. I love this product and I am so happy I tried this serum.</li>
            <li> Great product. I noticed an almost immediate improvement in the clarity of my skin. I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. !!  Wish it came in larger  sizes. . But other than that I am starting to see real results..</li>
            <li> I have used many vitamin C serums and was not impressed with this one and had to return it. Smelled nice but no glow as I usually experience with better brands.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my sister in law and she loves it!! Her skin looks smoother , she did peel some from it, but wow now she looks great!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Really noticing a difference on my teenage sons acne prone areas of his face. Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 2 weeks. My skin is very sensitive, so I don&#x27;t use as often as recommended but still see an improvement in dark spots, which is the reason for purchase.  I use it on face, chest, and backs of my hands.  I have had no allergic reaction.  The odor is pleasant and leaves my skin with a very light feeling of tightening.  I am very pleased with the results and have nothing negative to report.</li>
            <li> I love this soooo much and was weary because the price is so good. My skin drinks this up and it has a light yummy citus scent. It leaves me with glowing firmer skin. Really impressed!!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product with anticipation that it would help with my facial imperfections. I have blemishes and acne scars on my face and they seem to reappear in the same spots. When ordered this product, I debated on getting the Rose Oil or the Vitamin C Serum, so I chose the get the this because I saw rose oil was one the ingredients. I wanted to wait at least 30 days before I gave this review so I could give my honest opinion. This is product did its job. My blemishes started to fade and my prone acne spots began to dry up. My face feels smoother and supple. My skin definitely looks healthier. The only thing that I wish it came in a bigger bottle like the Rose Oil 4 oz. It would last a lot longer. I am curious to see if the Rose Oil will works as well as this serum did, I will have to wait until it goes on sale. In conclusion this is a great product I hope it works for you as it did for me. Try it, especially when it&#x27;s on sale. Thank you InstaNatural, I have already recommended you to several of my co-workers, and now they are using it, and hopefully they love it as much as I did.</li>
            <li> I feel and look younger after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Feels and smells pleasant.  Unfortunately, for 74 year old skin, there don&#x27;t seem to be any miracles.</li>
            <li> I purchased several products from InstaNaturals and I very much like them all. This is my favorite, along with the Rosehip and Emu oils. I use it every other night, followed by one of my oils. My face feels much brighter and smoother after applying this Vitamin C serum. I&#x27;m still on my first bottle but I think this serum will become a staple in my skin care collection, I like it that much. I will purchase from this company again, as they have a nice collection of products in their line and those that I&#x27;ve tried so far, work well for me. Thank you!</li>
            <li> My favorite part about this is that it smells like oranges!  That means it&#x27;s definitely natural!  It&#x27;s also a great all-in-one skincare essential that everyone should have in their beauty tool box.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!!! My skin felt better the very first time I put it on my face. Its been only two weeks and my skin is clearer, brighter, more even, even some in spots are already starting to fade! My skin feels so soft and smooth and moisturized without feeling oily at all..I really don&#x27;t even need a moisturizer after using this! I am extremely satisfied with this product and will definitely be buying again when I run out! ... Oh, and the smell is a refreshing citrus that smells so wonderful! This is a MUST HAVE for a good affordable price!!!</li>
            <li> bulk size, enough to everywhere. smell is good</li>
            <li> I received this vitamin C serum for testing purposes. The serum is clear yet creamy and absorbs into the skin and has a citrus scent to it but quickly fades away. It does leave your skin very soft and moisturized without an oily feeling. I can say I like this serum because it contains vitamin C , tea tree oil, AND salicylic acid which WORKS WELL for acne and the powerful anti aging retinol. This serum has it all and the results will be known after prolonged use. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this regularly on my face and neck after using toner. It has a yummy orange smell and feels nice on my skin. My skin feels much softer since starting to use it. It has a nice dropper applicator that helps you to not get too much on your hand. I have some dark spots on my cheeks and I feel they have faded since using this product.</li>
            <li> All natural Vitamin C serum. These new wave serums are great for improving dry skin and smoothing fine lines and wrinkles, after a couple of weeks you can start to see the effects work their magic. Easy to dispense the few drops you need, rub it in your palms and smooth it on your skin! InstaNatural products are excellent!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! Yet another instanatural product that I love. I have not been disappointed in any of their products! I will continue to purchase these! Thanks</li>
            <li> Like the refreshing clean smell and the good results when combined with the hyaluronic acid. Skin is soft and brown spots are fading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a week now and can already see a healthier glow....and surprise, so can my kids!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product, and will Co.tinkering to buy it. It has a rich, silky feel to it,which makes it a pleasure to aply.  I usually mix my own face oils which i use along with some hyaluronic acid.  From now on I plan on using this serum in place of the hyaluronic acid, since the ingredients in it are all excellent for aging skin.  I couldn&#x27;t be more impressed with the products from this company.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s. Vitamin C serum helps keep my skin looking youthful so I thought I&#x27;d try this product. My face loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love instanaturals products, I use the spray toner and the serum then moisturize with their argon oil and I think my skin loves this routine and I feel very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and I think my skin tone is starting to even out, not completely but I can see the difference, it won&#x27;t hurt to try this product. I will definitely keep purchasing this product. Also I&#x27;m only 20 so idk if it will help wrinkles fade.</li>
            <li> I purchase a number of InstaNatural facial products. They are amazing, Although I have a typical oily &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone somethat typical of black skin, I was suffering from dry pockets pockets as skin ages. I have been using this line for 3 months now and my skin feels softer and more dewey. I attribute this to a comprehensive approach of phytoceramides, vitamin c serum, eye serum, vitamin c toner or rose water toner and rosehip seed oil or emu oil, although, I may not use the rosehip seed oil of emu oil daily. Since vitamin c supports collagen production which declines as we age, I also take a teaspoon of indian gooseberry powder daily, which bioavailablity is very potent. Indian women know this beauty secret. I realize that the secret to beautiful skin is the nutrients taken internally and good facial care products applied externally.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! I put it on at night when I want to wake up with brighter skin. There are a lot of pollutants where I often get fairly dull skin but this formula is helping brighten me up. The rosehip ingredient is also helping me with my rosacea.</li>
            <li> HAVE HAD FOR A FEW DAYS BUT SOO FAR LOVE IT!!!!!!  &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Excelent product- easy to use, your face feels refreshed - love all the natural components to it</li>
            <li> I’ve been using the serum twice a day and already notice my complexion becoming more even. I’ve been using it along with my acne regimen and it’s been working great under my moisturizer. The serum doesn’t have a scent, but the Vitamin C give it an orange hue. Overall, a great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was provided a complimentary sample. All opinions are my own</li>
            <li> No better feeling then knowing what goes onto your skin is rich and effective with out harsh chemical</li>
            <li> This product may be fine for some people as I truly believe it works.  However, for me it was too harsh for my skin and actually made the skin on my face sore after I had used it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> A bit confused by everyones glowing reviews of this product. I stopped using it after a week as i felt it was irritating sensitive areas like my cheeks. After a rest i am trying again once a day but honestly see no difference. I am in my 50s</li>
            <li> This is the best line of skin care. This is my first time trying this skin care line and i love it. My skin looks healthier after the first week. I will continue to buy this line of skin care without a doubt.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works great and I see an improvement in my skin,  Company is great to work with and will go to great lengths to make customer happy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!! Been using this for a month. Wish I have discovered this sooner. I have very very large pores. Dry skin. Since using this product my skin feels smoother, calmer, cleaner, brighter, tighter,and my pores look much smaller. Finally a product that does what it is supposed to. As far as winkles. I have them only around the eye area.(have not noticed any difference there) but its only been a month. I am 100% pleased as the results so far and can&#x27;t wait to continue using this Great Product!!</li>
            <li> Does not irritate my very sensitive skin.  Did notice sun spots fading within the first month of using it.  Can use on face, even eyelids.</li>
            <li> To me, my skin is bad. I regularly get pimples and blackheads and buildup on my nose which is hard to get rid of. I have dark spots/acne scars all along my cheeks, chin, between my nose and upper lip and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;I was wary about it at first because my skin usually reacts badly to oil but I just tried it anyway. I used it on a little spot at first but then I decided to just go all out and use it all over my face.&lt;br /&gt;And that was the best thing I have ever done in my life. This product turned my skin from dull, dry, flakey and lifeless to soft, dewy, glowy and moisturized. I&#x27;ve had it for seven days and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference. I know it&#x27;s going to take a while for the scarring to start to disappear but I feel so much more confident without make up now. I use it morning and night - as a moisturizer - and it&#x27;s like magic.&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different but I recommend this product, even just to try. It&#x27;s affordable and easy to use. I am in love with this product. Definitely will buy again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;i received a sample of this product in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!  Lovely scent and high performance!  Highly Recommend!  A company with high quality personal service!</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks and I can feel a difference in my skin. My skin feels smoother and softer. I also love the citrus smell. I&#x27;m big on how things smell (especially on my face) and this smells great and isn&#x27;t overpowering. I&#x27;m going to continue using this serum and would definitely suggest adding it to any cleansing routine.</li>
            <li> Had my reservations  about this product, but so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is clear, vibrant, and acne doesnt appear like it has been. In conjuction with this I am using the planet eden intense repair. This is a less harsher peel than the TCA or Glycolic  peel. Very mild, doesn&#x27;t sting or burn but you know it&#x27;s working. Definitely a good investment if you want clearer skin.</li>
            <li> This Vitamin C is very good, That helps skin feel very fresh, anti aging, dark spots, and more. I have used it and have recommended to many customers in my Beauty Salon. All my customers love it. I highly recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> Nice fresh citrus scent, fast absorbing and fast fast shipping! I have been using this for several days and my skin is brighter and feels great!</li>
            <li> Great going on the skin...smooth and absorbs well...I like the tangy smell of this but if you don&#x27;t like a fragrance you would still like this because the smell doesn&#x27;t last that long ...like the serum absorbs into the skin the smell fades away as well. I feel like I&#x27;m doing good for my skin!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin on my face, so I&#x27;m not able to use any and everything. I&#x27;ve heard Vitamin C is good for many purposes when it comes to the human body.  I&#x27;ve tried Vitamin C capsule before, quickly gave up use can be so messy.  Time consuming to use.  So when I had a chance to try again in liquid form, I was excited.  I happy with the result thus far.  My skin feel and looks fresher. I use in the morning before makeup.  Will recommend product to most.</li>
            <li> I love this company.  They sent me the&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C Serum to use with the eye gel.  It took about 3 months to see a difference in the puffiness under my eyes.  But it really does work.  I am very pleased.  Plus I am using it on an age spot and it has faded considerably.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this serum for a few weeks now and will definitely be ordering another one! I used this after washing my face and toning with rosewater, and love how it absorbs immediately and smells amazing. I&#x27;ve noticed that it has evened out patches on my combination skin and helped some acne scarring to heal faster. I feel like my skin tone is more even and hydrated, and it both layers well under other serums or works by itself. I can also use it under makeup in the morning, in fact I prefer to, because it smooths out dryer areas and shrinks pore size in my oilier areas. I&#x27;ve been using this in conjunction with the Niacinamide serum and the two work really well together.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product twice now.  I use it on my clean face daily, at night.  My face looks great.</li>
            <li> i have some hyper-pigmentation around my face that i&#x27;ve developed in the last year or so, and i&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of it for a bit. i&#x27;ve tried a couple of other vitamin c serums, but didn&#x27;t see that much of a difference. using this, it&#x27;s lightened up a bit. but it could be because i&#x27;m using clarisonic with it. gonna continue this routine until the improvement plateaus, then i&#x27;ll try something else.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this serum!  I have purchased other Vitamin C serums, and though they were ok, this one  is really fantastic.  It has made such an amazing difference in my complexion.  We recently went on vacation and took a whole lot of photos.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how good my skin looked in all of them (and we didn&#x27;t even use photoshop!  ).  I love how it goes onto my skin and just makes it feel really good. Also, the sagginess that I started getting in my neck area is beginning to disappear. I&#x27;m sold!  I will definitely by this again and again!</li>
            <li> I am very picky about the products I put on or in my body. This face serum has lots of great ingredients in it (as I&#x27;m sure you read in the description) so I felt confident giving it a try. My skin feels very nice &amp; smooth after using it &amp; I use it daily.  It is not tested on animals, which is very important to me, &amp; its made in the USA, which is a great bonus.</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of use I can see a difference in my skin. I had excellent results with a combination of b3 and hyaluronic acid so it was hard to see additional improvements but I began to notice better skin tone, fading of brown spots and better texture. I now use the Vitamin C with the hyaluronic acid in the morning followed with B3. At night I use the B3 with the Hyaluronic acid. I was using the C twice a day but I found it to irritate my skin when used twice a day.  This is an excellent product, it is not greasy and has a good soft smell. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how well it will work.. New skin products typically take 4-6 weeks.  But what I can say is that it feels really nice and it also smells very nice.</li>
            <li> It works for my acne scar. It helps to fade away the redness. I love the citrus smell.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on others&#x27; reviews, and I do love the way it makes my skin feel. Also, after only a few days, I did notice some small age spots I have had for years start to fade and my skin overall feels softer and smoother. A wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This is a product that will help restore your face. All the ingredients are all natural. It works really good with other Insta Natural products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a professional blogger that was asked to review this product. I give my honest opinion</li>
            <li> I believe this product along with the toner, and eye gel have given my skin a youthful glow. I really enjoyed using all three products together and that they are fusing nature with science to give our skin all it deserves! I did get my items for free for a review but have no issue saying when I do not care for a product! I have done so in the past and would do so again if I feel an item does not meet standards but this product and its accompanying products do that and more. I really have enjoyed the process of getting to know about InstaNatural and I will use them again in the future once these run out.</li>
            <li> I was given the opportunity to try this Vitamin C Serum for free! Who&#x27;s a lucky lady? ME! ME!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells a bit like orange juice…kind of looks like it, too. I LOVE that! I would much rather smell slightly citrus-y than like medicine or something strange. I like that fact that it comes in an easy-to-use dropper. After I use my toner, I put a little of this onto my clean fingertips, then rub it onto my face. Easy! It makes my skin feel so healthy and amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum absorbs very quickly into the skin. It’s a thick serum that’s very easy to spread with your fingers, and the Hyaluronic Acid in the serum enhances hydration further by boosting the skin’s ability to retain moisture throughout the day to help combat dry and/or damaged skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also an anti-aging serum!  It delivers potent results by boosting collagen production to help diminish the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, and even age spots! Even if you aren’t looking to get rid of pesky wrinkles or fine lines, this will provide your skin with a better and smoother complexion by shrinking pores and evening out your skin tone to impart a youthful glowing radiance.</li>
            <li> This serum, like all InstaNatural products, is awesome: quality ingredients, no parabens or other chemicals. It provides excellent nourishment for your skin without any irritation.  I use it under moisturizers, night cream and makeup.</li>
            <li> Good product, the only downside is that it leaves the skin shinny.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this serum. It was the very first product I used in their facial care line. I was so happy with it, I bought the cleanser, toner, more serum, eye gel, and moisturizer! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results I&#x27;ve seen in two short weeks! You&#x27;ll love all the products and the great customer service, too!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to try Vitamin C serum as I have small acne bumps on my forehead and some pigmentation .  For the first week, I used it before going to sleep. And I think it was too harsh as it gave a rough texture to my skin, even broke me out. I stopped using it for few days. Then I started applying it on alternate days, and hey my skin does look smooth.  It seems okay serum but I don&#x27;t see myself using it regularly.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works yet, but will continue using.  Does make my skin look more supple and even-toned when using alongside the B3 serum by InstaNatural.</li>
            <li> The product is presented in a 30mL blue glass bottle format with an associated dropper pipette. It contains several different types of beneficial ingredients (Rosehip Oil, Hyaluronic Acid, Plant Stem Cells) that are believed to rejuvenate skin to fight against the signs of ageing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sent for review the product is light orange in colour with a opaque (cloudy) appearance. It has a pleasant orange-y aroma and is fast absorbing when placed on the skin without leaving any greasiness and very little sticky-ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the most out of the product its best to wash and gently dry the skin and then add a small amount to your face, neck and surrounding areas with your hands. You then leave it absorb naturally into your skin followed by the addition of a suitable moisturiser. It can be used twice a day (morning and night) and directly underneath makeup (if required).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for several days twice a day no doubt it was relatively easy to apply although it did require patience at times due to the amount of time it took, especially in the morning before going to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noticing a positive difference to the appearance of the skin was obvious as it looked slightly healthier and softer (there were a few wrinkles to begin with and they disappeared somewhat). The results were good enough to continue using the product until the bottle finished and overall it worked very well indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: Skin Looked Healthier And Softer.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product! I will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> I have applied to my face after washing up before going to bed for 2 weeks. It absorbs very quickly, leaving no sticky feelings. It seems working well, as texture of my face feels a bit smoother.</li>
            <li> This serum smells good and goes on my skin really nice. It&#x27;s not sticky and does not leave my skin greasy. It dries fairly quickly. My skin feels smooth and hydrated when I put this on. Giving it more time to see what is does with pigments on my face.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  Make sure you spend as little time as possible with the top off as vitamin C loses it&#x27;s strength when not preserved.  That&#x27;s why it is sold in a dark colored bottle.  I squeeze out the dropper in one hand and immediately place the top back on, securely, even before I apply the product.  Smells like Florida!</li>
            <li> This was a nice serum, smells like oranges and what not, but doesn&#x27;t do much more than brighten and make my skin look &amp;#34;cleaner.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;As for acne, it did nothing. It didn&#x27;t do anything to my wrinkles either, and I am under 20 years old, so I have small ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this, and will actually purchase this again for the sole fact that it made my skin look bright, clean and have an even complexion(of course under my acne and wrinkles)</li>
            <li> I enjoy using InstaNatural products. This is my first purchase of the Vitamin C Serum however, the Retinol Serum and Youth Express Eye Serum I&#x27;ve purchased and seen results. Pores appear smaller and skin looks and feels healthier.</li>
            <li> good fuction good smell !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, although I have just started to use it, I have noted  it is providing good benefits to my skin.  I&#x27;m planning to buy some more of this Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for very long, however, I like the way it smells and that a little bit goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product, but so far there are no cons to report.&lt;br /&gt;Will update in a few months after I&#x27;ve used it everyday.</li>
            <li> My skin looks healthier and feels softer.</li>
            <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the produt. It has help some of my skin. I would get more when I am done with my first bottle.</li>
            <li> i was so shocked when i got this product and used it after i washed my face usually most vitamin C serums leave this sticky film on my face or break me out this one however didn&#x27;t do either and it made my face glow like i have never seen my skin feels almost like it used to and it is so light not extremely heavy or harsh, another great product from InstaNatural! sample provided for review</li>
            <li> As soon as I got the opportunity to try this product I was anxious to try I tried it out the same day I got it and OMG my skin I saw a difference when I woke up I applied it at night and yes I woke up and skin was softer and felt my rejuvenated.  Right away ya skin soaks it up so a little goes a long way and I felt my skin feeling my plumped:) thanks insta naturals the world would definitely benefit from this product. Great ingredients gentle on the skin yes WINNING!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not been on for Vitamin C serums. However, since I&#x27;ve tried this one, it&#x27;s definitely changing my mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters I&#x27;ve tried others and just couldn&#x27;t get over the smell or the texture. I didn&#x27;t experience that with this product. It has a nice citrus scent to it!  I can see some improvements since beginning the InstaNatural SKINCARE to my routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have ALWAYS always had dreadful dark circles and they while not have gone totally away, they are NOTHING like what they used to be!  My skin truly glows now!!  I feel so much better about my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Pls Note:  I received this for review purposes. However, the thoughts and opinions expressed here are my own!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this so far and plan to purchase again. It&#x27;s only been a month, so I don&#x27;t see any dark spot reduction yet, but I&#x27;m using it twice a day and hope to see results soon. I use it on my face, neck, chest, and hands. I love the ingredients it contains, and it dries fairly quickly. Remember to use sunscreen over it if you apply during the day.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try InstaNatural Vitamin C serum to review.  I absolutely love InstaNatural&#x27;s products. This serum is no exception. It goes on smooth. It makes my skin bright, tight, and soft. I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> My skin looks better to me after using this product. It feels more hydrated, healthier tighter and I enjoy the Orange juice smell when I put it on.  It works different then a moisturizer more like an oil but not oily. I was even thinking of giving it as a gift to a few friends.  I plan to continue using it and will buy more.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a month ago and have really grown to love it. The serum is light yet very moisturizing, but not greasy. The rosehip oil has a very soothing affect as it goes on. My first bottle was problematic in that the cap wouldn&#x27;t screw on properly.  I contacted the company in regards to the faulty lid  and they sent me a free bottle within two days- and cap on this one worked just fine. I am very pleased with this product and the company behind it. They didn&#x27;t make a fuss over my issue, they simply apologized for the mishap and sent me a new bottle. I respect companies that truly stand behind their products, and this company does just that.  This is a superior product with superior customer support-  I will definitely be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> good product satified</li>
            <li> Product seems to be oxidized already. I had bought this product before and I see that the texture and smell are not the same anymore. The &amp;#34;expiration date&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t mean anything on a product like this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 35 year old female and just recently started noticing that my skin tone was starting to get uneven, almost blotchy, which is why I purchased this Vitamin C product. I&#x27;ve been using it morning and night for about 2 1/2 weeks now (after my toner, but before my moisturizer) and have noticed that my skin tone is slowly evening out. My skin is also softer and has a glow to it. No negative effects. I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> SURPRISINGLY THE PRODUCT ARRIVED MAY10TH AS PROMISED, THOUGH IT WAS A SUNDAY!  I&#x27;VE USED IT FOR TWO DAY SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY IF IT SUITS ME OR NOT.  IT SEEMS TO BE A GOOD PRODUCT, BUT I WILL KNOW MORE IN A FEW WEEKS.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only started using this product for a few weeks.  I bought it because of the ingredient list, e.g., no parabens.  It goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed.  I like the smell.  It smells very lightly of citrus.  Not strongly. I only gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see changes, but there may be some brightening.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this serum. I follow it with my moisturizer, as instructed.  My skin is no longer dry; it is smooth - no more flakiness. My age spots are not gone, but are faded. In short, there is a big improvement in my skin on face &amp; neck.  I am 58 years old.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin glow , awesome product!!</li>
            <li> I like the product and the way it makes my face feel. The scent isn&#x27;t the greatest but it&#x27;s not horrible and it goes away when it dries. Overall I do like the serum.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I have melasma so I purchased this product to brighten the dark spots.  I&#x27;ve been using it about a month and I feel like I can see results already.  It&#x27;s light and smells great too.</li>
            <li> Vit. C serum by Insta natural full of good ingredients that our skin needs . You can fell . Your skin firmer , hydrated . I hope in the future days to see much better results.</li>
            <li> I love this product by InstaNatural! I recently changed my entire skin care product collection to a more natural, organic-based alternative. Like most women, I tried so many anti-aging products over the years. Unfortunately, I had very little success. The products I used that delivered results were expensive and contained a lot of harmful ingredients. Then, there were also products that produced little to no results at all. So, I began my research on what truly works. In my quest for a healthier, more promising solution around anti-aging, I realized that organic-based products are the way to go. I bought a few items from InstaNatural within the last couple of months, one of which is the Vitamin C Serum. I love the smell and the way it feels on my skin. While I haven&#x27;t really seen any dramatic results since I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a month, I&#x27;m convinced that I will see positive, long-lasting results in the near future. Cheers! :)</li>
            <li> The serum looks dense and yellow, smells a bit strange like fruit, absorb fast. Honestly only used it times, did not have enough time to see how the result. But the skin feels good.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much !!!!!..... last week a order two more because I don&#x27;t want to stop using it, I got everyday complements on my skin been using mornings and at night</li>
            <li> I like the citrus smell it goes on easy and I do feel that it has helped even out my skin tone and my face looks less dull. This is my first purchase of this product but I intend to buy again. Nice priced and arrived on time. I would recommend</li>
            <li> This serum is fairly light and has an orange scent. I have used this product for over a week, my skin has more&amp;#34;elastic&amp;#34;.  I use the serum twice a day and before I apply make up. Two thumbs up on this product. The price is fantastic, real affordabale for those of us on a budget. I will be adding this serum to my regular regiment.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C works wonders on wrinkled skin!  Great serum.</li>
            <li> I am amazed by this stuff!  It really has made my face brighten up!  I am impressed for once with a face product!</li>
            <li> The smell of this product it to die for and so refreshing when I use it - love love love love love it - my skin looks great and the little lines around my eyes are looking better and less there - love this stuff and I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> May not meant for me, but for starts, it&#x27;s a bit of drops to pat over your face. It&#x27;s too concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;Then, in my case, I used this in combination with the Anti-Aging Facial Moisturizer Cream and in one week I got 3 pimples -- the last time I got pimples was 10+ years ago. I had high expectations in view of the reviews because my skin is very dry.&lt;br /&gt;I would wake up in the morning with dry skin, making no difference, not hydrating at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Makes my face feel great but I would not use it without a moisturizer</li>
            <li> It feels good on my face.  Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know if makes a difference, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any difference yet but I do feel that my skin is supple in the morning.  I also like that it has natural ingredients and it smells good.</li>
            <li> I have been using the vitamin c serum and been very pleased.  I love the citrus smell, goes on nicely and the price is just great. This one is a keeper and will keep ordering!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great - my skin drinks it in and after only a week my skin looks and feels much smoother and firmer - this is a definite keeper!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this serum.I have Some dark spots from age and sun they seem to be lightening I can even use it under make up it is not heavy or greasy. I&#x27;ll definitely keep us in the it.</li>
            <li> Surprised me, very good product.  After one 7 days use I notices it was exfoliating my skin, my skin felt smoother in the morning after cleansing.  After 14 days use my skin appeared brighter and more evenly pigmented.  Some other reviewers remarked on color and fragrance.  It is a bright sherbet orange color which comes naturally from an ingredient not artificially colored.  It doesn&#x27;t stain the skin.  The fragrance is also naturally occurring and not at all offensive by comparison to the perfumes added to most cosmetics sold.  I have chronic migraine and the odor doesn&#x27;t bother me.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist  told me the best things I can do for my face is using a VITAMIN C SERUM and Retinal A.  I use and love this brand by InstaNatural.  Some serums are very expensive and I cannot afford to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;I love the creaminess and the orange scent.  It works and my face shows it.  I also use and love GREEN CREAM retinal cream that can also be bought here on Amazon.  These two products have taken away the brown spots, evened out my skin tone and smoothed my skin remarkably well.  And the cost of both are very reasonable so I can afford to purchase and use them everyday.</li>
            <li> First of all, I did not receive a free bottle or any sort of promotion for this item.  But even if a reviewer did, in this particular case, the products are worth every rave revue they receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instanatural products are an amazing value for the price, smell yummy and do what they say they are going to do.  The company is extremely customer friendly. When something did not work for me, they not only suggested a replacement but gave it to me free of charge.  My sister and daughters have become eager converts to this serum and other Instanatural goodies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bear in mind, nothing is a miracle in a bottle.  I don&#x27;t care how much you pay.  I&#x27;ve seen results but it takes patience and remembering to apply the products. :)  I&#x27;ve been using this serum for four months and my skin is brighter, clearer and discolorations have faded significantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Vitamin C toner and this serum twice daily morning and night and follow with the eye serum and Argan Oil for a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I am also a freak about using sunblock.  It makes zero sense to work hard on improving your skin without protecting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t figured it out by now...I am a fan for life!!!</li>
            <li> I could tell as soon as I put this on my face it&#x27;s a quality product. It feels and smells great. My face looks bright and fresh after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! Now that I am getting older, it&#x27;s really nice to have a product that turns the clock back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item combined with Hyaluronic acid serum for a month and see amazing results. My skin is tighter and complexion is much clearer, even my skin tone is improved. I started noticing results after a week. I use this twice a day, after I was my face in the am and before bed in the PM. I also moisturize after using this then put my make up on in the morning, in the PM I do the same, minus the make up Loving it</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd C-serum I have used and I think I have found &amp;#34;the one&amp;#34;.  First off the smell is wonderful.  The one I had used previously worked but smelled awful.  This one smells like fresh oranges.  It is thicker than others I have used but I like it.  I use with a derma roller first at night, then let the serum soak in.  I usually wait a minute or 2 before I do the rest of my nightly routine.  I have noticed a fading of my dark spots and I had a red spot on my face that is almost completely gone.  I just ordered my 2nd bottle.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a while now. I love to pair this with their cream. If it is day time I pair this with the day cream. I have found that it gives my skin a healthy glow. I have noticed with this product my skin looking healthier and tighter. My fine lines are going away. I do have some age spots and those have diminished on myself drastically not all gone but close. It is smooth going on and you push syringe and sometimes takes a full one or half of one. Depends on if your skin is dry or oily. That is how I am based mine. The smell of this is nice not anything over powering. I would suggest to use their moisturizer on top of this serum. As an active blogger i received this item for little or no cost. all opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I put this on after I wash my face and let it soak in before I put lotion on. I like the smell, and while it looks a little... different... the company emailed me before I received my bottle, letting me know to expect the color/consistency that the product is. Overall I think that this has helped improve the tone and texture of my skin, and I plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I received the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum for free for use and review. It came in a pretty blue glass bottle with an orange-reddish label. The liquid was a cloudy light orange color, thickish as opposed to watery. What was so tantalizing about it was the fragrant scent of oranges. I do not mean artificial candy orange, but pure orange like juice from a fresh squeezed orange. Tasting it was tempting, not obviously not an option! It was a pleasant surprise and made application more pleasing to the senses. The scent did not longer, so you did not smell like a vitamin C tablet all day. The liquid came out in a dropper format and it came out slowly enough so you could control the amount. It went on very smoothly and spread across the skin very nicely. It left a softness and did not have a sticky feeling. The nice part of this serum is that it is made of natural ingredients. including 20% Vitamin C which may account for the pleasant scent. Vitamin C is an antioxidant used to help repair the skin and to help avoid future damage. Other ingredients include: Hyaluronic Acid (moisturizes skin), Tea Tree Oil (a skin soother), and Retinol (a pore de-clogger). It does not matter what type of skin you have (dry, oily, or combo) as this products is &amp;#34;one size fits all.&amp;#34; There was a noticeable difference in the diminishing of fine lines especially around my mouth and eyes. I felt as if my skin was more youthful. Everything you would want in a skin serum can be found in one bottle. I would highly recommend this product. #Instanatural</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this serum for a few days and already feel and see a difference in my skin. I purchased this product based on ingredient&#x27;s and reviews. I&#x27;ve used a Vitamin C serum in the past but it was oily and caused an irritation in my skin. This InstaNatural product is superb.    The vitamin C content in this product is very good for the skin and I believe some customers are unaware of that. I found this tidbit to back up this products effectiveness. Sodium Ascorbyl Phosphate is a newer, more stable form of Vitamin C. It reduces the damage caused by free radicals, stimulates the formation of collagen, and reduces dryness and the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Research has shown that sodium ascorbyl phosphate also reverses DNA damage and may reduce sunburn and skin damage resulting from excess exposure to ultraviolet B radiation.    I&#x27;m 51 and most people think I&#x27;m much younger. I use Tretinoin .025 at night and a Niacinamide serum 5% in the morning and now recently added this Vitamin C serum in the morning. I&#x27;d really like to try InstaNatural Niacinamide 5% Serum as it has better ingredient&#x27;s then the one I currently use.    I&#x27;ll post back in about a month.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally give reviews. However, at 67 and seeking great products, natural and organic, I give this serum top billing. It does brighten my skin and make both face and neck feel invigorated. Yes, I will buy again. This is my year to seek out products for their ingredients not their packaging or hype. The 20% vitamin C was another ingredient that helped me to pick this product.</li>
            <li> I just finished a bottle of this serum. I am 32 and I only have some fine lines on my forehead and some small sun spots and discoloration on my face. It did Not reverse the signs of aging and ... that they claimed. This is actually part of their add: [Grab a bottle now to reverse the signs of aging and other skin troubles: -Wrinkles, smile lines and other fine lines - Age spots, sun spots, and discoloration]  I will NOT buy this again.</li>
            <li> Delighted with this!  Great to mix with organic rose hip oil (two or three drops of this serum, one drop of rose hip oil).  Recommend!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff - It seems to help my skin and I use it in conjunction with a lot of other InstaNatural products - I can&#x27;t really tell if it has done anything amazing for my skin or not specifically, but I do like it and it lasts a long a long time. It goes on thin and leave a very slight tacky feeling to the skin - but it makes your skin look nice and hydrated. I may use it with lotion during the winter but I have oily skin so I don&#x27;t use lotion very often. Sometimes I just put this on my face and nothing else.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Vitamin C on my face. I have spent tons of money on expensive products, but there isn&#x27;t a need to any longer. This product has brightened up my face significantly. I just wish it did a little more with the wrinkles/dark circles under my eye, but that may not be it&#x27;s purpose. Regardless, I am sold on this product. A little bit goes a long way. I am anxious to have my mom and sister try this product!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the serum. This was  my second bottle. I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> The bottle was well sealed to prevent any spillage when it arrived in the package. The serum immediately leaves my skin feeling refreshed. The liquid is actually orange and has a pleasant citrus note to it.  I’ve used other Vitamin C Serums that have less favorable odors. I also notice that this serum is thicker or should I say feel richer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product, however, it has to be noted that my skin reacted negatively the first few days that I’ve tried it. I believe it is because my skin have always been quite sensitive. I did stop using the product altogether for a week but have recently started using the product daily again and I have no further complications or complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more of this, in the future.  Thanks again!</li>
            <li> I use this morning and evening to even out my skin tone and it works very well.  They recently improved on the smell of the product and that made all the difference.  It smells like oranges now.  So if you tried it in the past and it smelled awful, write them and they will send you the new and improved product to try.</li>
            <li> It works really well.  It does not dry my skin out like other serums.  My age spots are fading.</li>
            <li> I could not be happier with this serum!  I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 months now and my skin looks and feels fantastic.  I&#x27;m still on my first bottle (use it twice a day - so it lasts a long time) but I&#x27;ve already ordered another so I don&#x27;t have to go without.  I&#x27;ve tried other vitamin c creams and they always tend to tingle/burn and cause flaky skin for me, not to mention expensive.  Not this one - it feels great going on and leaves skin really soft.  It did take a couple of weeks to notice a change - but what a difference!  I&#x27;m almost 50, and my skin now looks rosy, fresh and healthy all the time.  And its so affordable - I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this serum for a few weeks, and I&#x27;ve used it every night before bed. So far I like it. I imagine that over the long-term, benefits will be easier to see but I think my fine lines have been reduced around my eyes and my skin looks a little brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m generally skeptical of skin serums and treatments, and while I like natural/herbal treatments I always take their claims with a grain of salt. However I read a couple of journal articles that convinced me to at least give Vitamin C a try; one that linked vitamin C to procollagen production and a small study that found reduction in wrinkles and increased collagen production with 12 weeks of topical use. I&#x27;ll include the references for other pubmed nerds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the orange-juicy scent and color... not sure if that is naturally occurring or added in but it&#x27;s pleasant. It seems like a good value for the money, and arrived very quickly. I will probably buy this again when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geesin J.C., Darr D., Kauffman R., et al: Ascorbic acid specifically increases type I and type III procollagen production messenger RNA levels in human dermal fibroblasts.

            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF! The product works exactly as the description states. My skin feels ultra soft and my deep wrinkles seems to have smoothed out!</li>
            <li> It helps keep wrinkles at bay and overall skin looks younger, healthier.  I love the smell, it&#x27;s like oranges!</li>
            <li> Loving InstaNatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum. This product is natural &amp; certified organic. This serum has a great citrus scent, and using it feels like aroma therapy also. Since using this serum my skin has a fresher appearance. It also brightens, and gives your skin a real glow. Before using this toner had some patches of dry looking skin on my forehead, but that is no longer an issue. About two drops can cover your entire face &amp; neck. It&#x27;s rich &amp; has a nice texture to it. Another aspect that I love is that it does not feel heavy on your skin as it absorbs deep into the skin. It will also plump up your skin. That is what I have experienced.  If you have any issues with break outs this may be the best serum for you.    I was sent this serum to try for free &amp; share my honest thoughts.</li>
            <li> great scent.  you can feet it working and the healing and regeneration of the skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and hoped to treat the sun spots on my cheeks and nose.  I used it for 3 weeks, 2 drops every night after toner and before facial cream, it&#x27;s very light and absorbed very quickly.  I didn&#x27;t see any change on the sun spots, but I noticed that the blackheads on my nose and chin are gone, dramatically.  I have blackhead/acne problem for more than 20 years, after tried almost everything (that I could afford) but nothing worked.  I didn&#x27;t think and didn&#x27;t even know that this serum would get rid of the blackheads.  Now my nose and chin are clear and smooth, I am very happy.</li>
            <li> I use this oil for my hair and body. I add this to my body lotion at nights. It&#x27;s great for the hair and skin.</li>
            <li> I really like vitamin C. Immediately after application to the face visible lifting.</li>
            <li> Nice product with excellent ingredients and no fillers. I like that it comes in a tinted glass bottle to prevent the vitamins from degrading. Wearable under makeup and non-irritating.  Definitely recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother.  She is 56, has aging skin, and picking at her acne when she was a teen has left her with pock-marks and pits.  She also had quite a bit of unevenness and sun damage.&lt;br /&gt;After about a month of use, I noticed a visible difference in her skin.  The tone was starting to even out, and the dark spots fading a little.  After three months of use, her skin looks more... glowy and youthful.  Hard to describe, but she actually looks younger.  Her acne pits are so deep that she will never be rid of them, but the edges of the pits seem much less defined- as if her skin has been buffed or airbrushed somehow.&lt;br /&gt;Her praises: &amp;#34;Makes my makeup go on so smoothly, softens my forehead lines, and plumps out my mouth lines.&amp;#34;  She uses 4 drops, twice a day after washing, but started at just once a day for several weeks to allow time for her skin to adjust to the vitamin C.  Burned just a little right after application during weeks one and two, but the pinkness and mild burning sensation subsided after a few minutes. After a few weeks, once her skin adjusted, a mild tingle at most is all she feels when applying.&lt;br /&gt;Even my DAD noticed a difference!  A sister who hadn&#x27;t seen her in a few years swears that she must&#x27;ve had a peel or some other minor procedure.  That&#x27;s not to say this stuff transformed her skin overnight... it didn&#x27;t- but with consistent use, her skintone, fine lines, forehead and smile lines are noticeably diminished.  She glows.  Shes 56, and she GLOWS.&lt;br /&gt;She says that one bottle lasts her a little over two months, which we both consider to be a very good value considering what noticeable results she&#x27;s gotten already.  She wishes she&#x27;d had this stuff when she was 30, and has turned a number of her friends onto the product.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s got a fairly uncomplicated skincare routine, but wanted to incorporate hyaluronic acid for its plumping properties (and this DOES plump!) and vitamin C.  Mom appreciates the combination of ingredients in this product to make her routine simpler and less time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase.ts in this product to make her routine simpler and less time consuming.&lt;br /&gt;Will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I really love this product!  Face just feels and looks better since I started using the serum.  It really has become an essential part of my daily face regimen.  I am hooked.</li>
            <li> best serum out there.. i&#x27;ve had dark spots all around my cheek area.. within 1 week of use i was able to c visible results, my recommended this to my frnd also.. trust me if u hav dark spots use this.. i wud purchase this again..</li>
            <li> I bought this vitamin c serum after really wanting to just try a healthier, more natural formula for my face.  I work long hours, most of which is indoors at a computer, and I didn&#x27;t like how tired and dried out I was beginning to look.  This stuff is great since absorbs in a few minutes, doesn’t leave a sticky residue and I can easily apply my moisturizer after it dries. After a few weeks of using it, my skin already feels soft and my pores seem to be smaller than usual! Dark spots under my eyes are also slowly fading away and my skintone has GREATLY improved.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with it and so is my skin!  I even ordered another one since it’s on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for a great product!!</li>
            <li> I use this product for anti-aging benefits and have been very happy with the results.  Fine lines have lessened as well as minimized other facial imperfections.  I use this twice daily along with an appropriate morning/evening moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product and is even helping to heal a pre cancer wound.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I just love this Serum.  I use it at night and my skin just soaks it in.  In the morning my skin a very soft.</li>
            <li> I just love it! I can see a good difference, my skin looks healthier and beautiful! I really recommend  vitamin C serum . You will love it!</li>
            <li> The Vitamin C Serum is fantastic! My face is so much softer. Not greasy at all and my skin just soaks it up. My skin tone is more even and less blotchy. The smell is nice too - refreshing. Highly recommend.  UPDATE 10/23/16: I have been using this product for some time and loved it. Previously gave it 5 stars. It used to come in a dark blue bottle, left my skin feeling soft, and was a thick serum and rich in color. This new product is a watered down, version of the old one. It goes on like water, doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re applying anything. No longer smells like sunshine in a bottle either. Does not leave skin soft and no longer helps my rosacea. Will not be buying again unless Instanatural goes back to the original formula. Disappointed they changed what used to be a great product.</li>
            <li> This is amazing stuff!! Only wish they sold it in the gallons as i would dip my whole body in it!!! LOL!!...for those of you who are in doubt, trust me you wont be sorry it does all it say&#x27;s and more and in record time...into my 5th day and yay!! my face is now glowing!!! ;-)</li>
            <li> I really like the consistency and the price!  The ingredients are what I was looking for.  Came on time, It is a bit early to see skin results but I am sure it is what my skin needs to keep it healthy.  I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It made my skin feel refreshed.  I can see small lines from my face disappear.</li>
            <li> This review is mostly for the seller, who delivered the product quickly and well packaged.  As for the efficacy of the actual product, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to make a fair assessment. I will say that a small amount covers face and neck quite well and the feel is soft and not abrasive.  I&#x27;ll try to deliver an update later about how well it works for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately,  I had a poor reaction to this and broke out. My skin is sensitive,  so I must be allegric to one of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;However,  I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about this company,  they gave me a full refund, with no trouble.&lt;br /&gt;I am currently using the eye gel. With Great results, Diminishing The Look Dark circles. Future leading me to believe it was ca certain ingredient in the serum to cause the reaction.</li>
            <li> This definitely helps smooth fine lines and keeps the skin quite soft.  So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I have since purchase another bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this Vitamin C Serum!  My skin texture is noticeably brighter and smoother. I love to spend a lot of time outdoors gardening and playing with my dogs, and have some hyperpigmentation from the sun. Even with sunscreen and a gardening hat my skin tone had become uneven. I say had, because after adding Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum to my skin care regimen on the recommendedation of a friend, my skin visablely looks healthier with a fresh glow. I also love that this is a serum and penetrates deep into my skin, I will definitley reorder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 weeks. I use it morning and night along with the Retinol moisturizer. I&#x27;ve noticed clearer skin as in less blemishes - not that I had acne before but I did get some clogged pores. I&#x27;m also noticing some evening out of skin tone and anticipate more of it the longer I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I love natural products, what we put on our skin we have to be careful with , out skin is our biggest organ. I love that this has so many great ingredients that are beneficial to the skin for many different concerns but is a natural product not filled with garbage and fillers. It&#x27;s antioxidants properties I find detoxifying in many ways. Soaks nicely into the skin, no bad smell, no greasy or oily feelings, great to use after a toner and before a moisturizer as an extra measure to prevent aging :) I love serums and am kinda hooked to these</li>
            <li> Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum is unlike any other Vitamin C Serum that you see in the market today. Because of its advance ingredients it is able to provide many fantastic combinations to maximize the benefits to your skin. Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum  uses the natural power of Ferulic Acid, Vitamin C and Vitamin E to keep the skin soft and supple. It also contains Hyaluronic Acid, which is known to absorb moisture. Which you combine it with the Vitamin C it provides maximum hydration to make the skin plump and firm while moisturizing the skin. Vitamin C (20%) when stabilized by Ferulic acid helps to bring out a fair complexion by lightning the surface of skin. Vitamin C and Vitamin E are two excellent antioxidants. They work together actively to improve the moisture levels of skin and helps reduce marks, brown spots and dark spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was love at first use with me. I have used a few oils in my time, but I have not seen one that had a combination of ingredients like this serum does. Each ingredient has a purpose to maximize the benefits to your skin.  I was able to replaced a lot of my daily products with the Insta Natural Vitamin C Serum. The first thing I notice was the dark spots under my eyes started fading after a few uses, and my skin looking a lot healthier. I have used a lot of products that are supposed to reduce dark circles, but none of them worked quite as fast and had ingredients that actually reacted bad with my skin. I had no harsh reactions, because the ingredients are natural. I also replace using lotion with using the serum and I found that my skin was not only hydrating a lot better, but also found myself not needing to hydrate as often. I even used it to hydrate my lips, and it worked wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is made in the United States in their FDA registered facility. Also, Insta Natural has 100-day hassle-free money back guarantee, no matter where the product was purchased. You just contact them, and they will give you a full refund, no questions asked. They will even allow for you to keep the bottle! How awesome is that? There is no risk for trying them out! It is 98% natural and 72% Organic. There is no parabens and no alcohol in this product. I am in love with the company and product, so that will definitely have me coming back for more when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sample was provided by Insta Natural to conduct my review. #sponsoredhem, and they will give you a full refund, no questions asked.

            <li> This vitamin C serum is great as a moisturizer and is known for its antiaging effects. Soft lines have disappeared and my skin is much softer.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to try this Vitamin C Serum with Hyaluronic and Ferulic Acid from Insta Natural. One thing that I can say sets this serum apart from other similar serum is its scent. It does not have any perfumes or artificial scented additives in it but it has a faint sweet and natural herbal scent to it that smells wonderful. Since I began using this serum, my face has felt softer than it has in many years. I have received compliments from friends and acquaintances about how great my skin looks and how young I look at my age. I have to give the credit to this wonderful serum which I am so happy to have found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so impressed with this product that I also began adding a few drops to my lotion so that I can use it on the rest of my body. I would definitely recommend this product to others. Customer service was very professional and answered my questions promptly… My package was delivered very quickly. What more could I ask for?!</li>
            <li> I am a vitamin C serum addict. I love natural beauty products that work and I&#x27;ve tried several Vitamin C serums. InstaNaturals was the first to introduce me to Ferulic Acid. I had to look it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;If added to a topical preparation of ascorbic acid and vitamin E, ferulic acid may reduce oxidative stress and formation of thymine dimers in skin.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What all that means is that ferulic acid shows great promise in warding off the free radicals that cause DNA damage, cancer, and accelerated cell aging. Wow! What a great addition!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After more research on Vitamin C serums I&#x27;ve found that this InstaNatural formula contains all of the ingredients necessary for optimum results with Vitamin C. No fillers, nothing extra. Only what my skin needs and what the product needs to keep it stable and fresh. Love, love, love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product for review. This is my honest opinion of InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. I definitely can tell a difference and will continue to use it. I also have to mention again the insta natural phytoceramides !!! Awesome!!</li>
            <li> Vitamin C Serum has tons of benefits:&lt;br /&gt;Skin-firming&lt;br /&gt;Anti-aging&lt;br /&gt;Brightens complexion&lt;br /&gt;Hydrates skin&lt;br /&gt;Evens skin tone&lt;br /&gt;Diminishes dark spots, marks, and patches&lt;br /&gt;Reduces appearance of wrinkles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll always have a bottle on hand because it has improved the appearance of my skin. I love using Instanatural&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the Organi Rosehip Oil and I use the 2 together at nite after I wash my face and I love the way it makes my skin feel so soft.  It works well with other products.  I keep it in the refrigerator so it will last longer.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive these oils to try, I use the  rosehip seed oil in a rose petal salve and used it on my elbows and they have stayed soft for along time!  vitamin C is used to hydrate the skin and hoping to lighten the dark patches on my face. And using the argan oil for shinier hair!!</li>
            <li> Not long for words, I have been using this serum for 2 months.  I have just added the face lotion. Love how it makes my skin feel and look best of all the fine lines are gone!</li>
            <li> Feels great, absorbs fast and I&#x27;ve already seen as improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I believe in the &amp;#34;C&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m almost 60...love this. The skin is looking great.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! my face has changed in appearance and attitude (yes, I said attitude) since I started using this product.  I think all products from this company should be inducted to the best beauty product ever!!! Whomever came up with this product should get a noble prize</li>
            <li> Received the product in a timely manner. The serum has a virus smell which is pleasant and didn&#x27;t last long. It dries quickly but doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling moisturized therefore I use an additional moisturizer. I have very sensitive skin and I have found no irritation when using this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks and good to see more of a change in my skin. Granted I use it mostly in my morning make up routine. I&#x27;ve noticed some find lines starting to fade but I feel like there should be more. I will continue to use this product i until finished.</li>
            <li> Very nice Vitamin C Serum.  I have used other serums from other companies and for the price this stuff is amazing.  Smells very nice and doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate the skin.  I use this twice a day and put it over Retin A at night.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it! its working!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I gave this product a try. It comes in a convenient bottle. Smells lightly like orange, which i love. Absorbed quickly into the skin after face washed. There are no sticky feeling afterwards. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels. I use it at night with a night moisturizer and my skin feels very soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I love it, does wonders for my skin, I will definitely continue to us it.</li>
            <li> It is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to use a vitamin c serum for a while and this definitely fits the bill. All if the other oils and extracts are amazing and it really packs a punch without the burn of other serums.</li>
            <li> Love the product and I can see the difference!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt; I had the opportunity to try the eye serum and that lead me to purchase the vitamin c serum. I knew that if the eye serum works so good on my eyes the vitamin c serum will work as great. I see an improvements in my skin tone, my pores are diminished and my skin feels great. I like that absorbs fast and notice that helps with skin irritation. I actually use it on a small portion on my hand where my skin was irritated and did wonders. I usually use your emu oil for that matter but I thought of giving it a try on my hand and liked the results.great products, I&#x27;m very glad that I got my hands on them! :)</li>
            <li> Great Serum, truly a quality product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least 2 other vitamin c serums and I really love these products.  InstaNatural is one of my favorite brands and their products are amazing.  I love how this serum is not just vitamin c, but also has rosehip...which is one of my favorite ingredients in clearing up acne scars and preventing acne breakouts.  This product not only brightens and keeps my skin supple and radiant it keeps the zits away.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work fine for me for a first few days then I started to break out so bad. I have to stop using it :(</li>
            <li> This is a perfect serum that&#x27;s work.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> I use this vitamin c serum morning and night. I love the smell and feel and how it makes my skin feel and look. I have genetic dark circles, and this has helped make them lighter. Nothing else has helped my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Love this serum!  I use every morning under lotion and makeup.  Does not leave skin feeling greasy!</li>
            <li> Very good product.  You feel like you are making yourself a lifting!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this and it smells amazing! It smells like oranges and its color is orange but it goes on so smooth and I love my results! I will be buying again and some for Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> No difference but nice smell</li>
            <li> Within  2 weeks of use of this product. I could see the difference in my face.</li>
            <li> I really love this serum straight away my skin feels plumper and brighter! The scent is a nice tangy orange smell and it absorbed quickly in to my skin so I could put moisturiser on straight after! I&#x27;m so happy I bought this serum and don&#x27;t have to keep spending a fortune trying out new products that don&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Luv this product line</li>
            <li> I used about 10 days  but did not find any effect!And It is incompatible with my moisturizer，I have tried  many kinds of Moisturizers！The results are the same！Then i read Customer Reviews to find out that someone said it is a transparent color!why it was orange color when i received it? has oxidized already?It should not be sold to customers！！</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this product.  My skin is much brighter, more even and I have noticed the fine lines on my forehead are less noticeable. When applied under make up, the serum adds a healthy glow!</li>
            <li> Nice serum!  Goes on nicely and smells great.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month.  I purchased as a replacement for another product I was using.  My skin looks and feels great!  A rarely have to use foundation anymore and I&#x27;m 52!!</li>
            <li> I simply LOVE this serum.  It&#x27;s loaded with anti-oxidants and cutting-edge ingredients yet it&#x27;s also light and absorbs completely.  The Sea Buckthorn and Algae extracts are the key factors that make this serum extraordinary.  I have most definitely noticed a difference in skin tone and also seen a diminished of fine lines around the mouth and eyes.  This serum also has a wonderful citrus scent.  Good stuff!</li>
            <li> Hi I am a 41 year old female and I am always looking for what works great with my skin. I really like the vitamin C smell and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out so I give it a ten. I think it&#x27;s too soon to tell anyone about any dramatic results. I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have found InstaNaturals&#x27; organic products. This vitamin C Serum is easy to use, and a little goes a long way. It has a pleasant scent, and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. I love my restored, glowing complexion. I use this with the Vitamin C moisturizer and it works great. Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> i do not use every day so i really don&#x27;t see it working like an instant cure.It smells great and fresh.So in the final review I can&#x27;t say it dosen&#x27;t work. but I am surprised at your inquiry,love it that you care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;jane buran</li>
            <li> Great product.  Great service.  Great price.</li>
            <li> The serum is the perfect natural toner to set the palette for moisturizer and/or makeup. When I began using it, I was skeptical about what difference I would notice, but within a week, my skin was getting clearer. Rest of the review at: http://www.environosh.com/2015/01/30/product-review-instanatural-argan-oil-products-and-vitamin-c-serum/</li>
            <li> goes on smoothly, spreads nicely, smells yummy. haven&#x27;t used enough to see if changes in my skin but hope so !! great customer service!</li>
            <li> Great product.. Since it doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol. I have been using for a few weeks and although the results are minimal I can see a change on my skin. I continue to use and post another review in a few months..</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if the product does what it is supposed to do, only been using it for a month</li>
            <li> Talk about making a positive difference! I use this in the following regimen:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;2. Toner&lt;br /&gt;3. Vitamin C Serum&lt;br /&gt;4. Moisturizer w/ SPF</li>
            <li> This serum is GREAT!!!  It goes on smoothly and has a light grapefruit smell - if you don&#x27;t like smells don&#x27;t worry, it quickly fades.  Also, It does not dry my face out which I was worried about because of the strength.  In the short time I&#x27;ve been using it my face is a little brighter and it has started to fade some of my dark (acne) spots which is a big bonus!  This is a very high quality product and I will definitely get more when it runs out!  I highly recommend this product. **\\&quot;Product provided for free for testing purposes.**</li>
            <li> This is a great compliment to use with the Vitamin C Cream Moisturizer. You don&#x27;t need a lot when applying. It goes on smooth and makes my face feel smooth. It leaves a mild matte feeling on the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Product provided for free for testing purposes.”</li>
            <li> Great product. I have some freckles in my face and they are fading! And I&#x27;ve been using this product for just two weeks! I&#x27;ve tried other products before and none of them worked. So, I&#x27;m really satisfied. By the way: Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute favourite! I love the product so much. Also, it smells very clear and comfort, I will recommend my friends to use it.</li>
            <li> Noticeable difference in my lines&lt;br /&gt;On my face I use it every day and so gentle does not irritate my skin like most products.</li>
            <li> The only serum I&#x27;ve used that actually makes a difference. I&#x27;m in my fifties, and this helps with small wrinkles. My skin feels thicker and looks brighter. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Why did it take me so long to find this company?  InstaNatural has the best products.  My Vitamin C serum is all that I imagined and even more.  It makes my face feel refreshed and tight while closing my pores.  I have spent so much money on products that did not deliver 10% of the results that InstaNatural provide not to mention there customers service is through the roof.  I never patronized a company that overly exceeds all my expectations.  I love there products and will always look to their company before I go and invest anything anywhere else!  Give this company a try and you will thank God you did!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and the price is great but I have had better results with a Vitamin C Serum not containing any other oils or ingredients.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, love the Orange smell. Makes my skin feel great and I can see a smoothness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> The product shipped fast, arrived fast, and leaves my skin glowing! Great buy!</li>
            <li> I like how well it glides over my skin. I think it is really helping my fine lines and pores.</li>
            <li> Smells good and my face looks and feels so much softer!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it smells amazing. My skin feels tighter, And smoother. Huge fan will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Have bought 3 or 4 bottles by now. Don&#x27;t know that it will turn back the clock or anything but I love how it makes my skin feel.  I do think it has helped with over all appearance, softness, and evenness of tone in my skin. My 11 year old daughter uses it and loves it too.</li>
            <li> Pleasant feeling, mild scent.</li>
            <li> Smells great (like orange juice) and has a much better consistency than some others I have tried. Not so runny like some others are. Can&#x27;t say it has taken away age spots but does seem great at hydrating skin. Have only used a few weeks so far though. Will continue to enjoy and may buy again.</li>
            <li> It is my first time to try vitamin C serum. The quality is very great and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency of this serum  and how quickly it gets absorbed but I have used vitamin c serums before this one which start to show results much faster but then again they are twice it&#x27;s price. It does even out the complexion but for some reason , also causing me to breakout on my chin area.</li>
            <li> I love this! It&#x27;s quick and easy to use! I apply it after washing my face. You only need a little bit, I use less than 10 drops. I first dab some under my eyes then on the rest of my face. It dries quickly so I can put my facial oil right away. After almost 2 weeks, I&#x27;ve already noticed my dark spots from old acne lightening up. I don&#x27;t have deep wrinkles yet but the fine lines under my eyes and forehead are also starting to smooth out! Hopefully with continued use, I will prevent wrinkles in the future. Great customer service too! Although I don&#x27;t think I will be asking for a refund since I&#x27;m pretty satisfied, knowing that you can get your money back if unsatisfied is pretty great.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and feels nice on my skin, but the older formulation of this product was much better. It gave glow to my face, this does not unfortunately...</li>
            <li> I love this serum,I use it with the Emu oil and see good results.Also,they have fabulous customer service!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks after I wash my hair Nd my skin looks so good I don&#x27;t even wear foundation anymore. I out organic argan oil on top after it has soaked in. It has truly done wonders, softened scars and  makes my skin look tight and fresh.  Love&lt;br /&gt;(Age 24)</li>
            <li> I received a 1 ounce bottle of InstaNatural Vitamin C (20%) + E + Ferulic + Hyaluronic Acid Serum for review and have no complaints about the product.  The bottle is perfectly sealed, glass is blue to protect the ingredients, the dropper is perfectly functional, and the actual product seems to be as good as most serums, Vitamin C or others.  I&#x27;ve tried more serums than I can recall and this one for me has no discernible scent, absorbs more quickly than most, and seems to be competitively priced (not the suggested or list price, but the cost of under twenty dollars).  All indications are that the product is fresh and my only complaint is that because it is absorbed almost immediately upon application to the skin, it&#x27;s necessary to drop the serum directly onto a section of the face and rub it in before applying to another section.  I&#x27;ve been using it for just under a month and have enjoyed the taught feel I experience after application, just prior to adding my sunscreen and moisturizer.  I have not observed anything extraordinary, but then my sensitive skin has had no adverse reaction whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Vitamin C is great for your skin and this product is awesome.  I will be purchasing it again.  I highly recommend this product.  Try it and you will see what I&#x27;m talking about.  GREAT product and GREAT price.</li>
            <li> I arranged for this product to be tried by a professional model, who is very well-acquainated with these types of products.  Her appearance as a professional is of paramount importance; thus, she has an incentive to accurately review this product.  Here is her summary:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;I have used now for 9 days. I think it&#x27;s a great product. The vitamin C and E together with the Hyaluronic is a fabulous mix which can&#x27;t help but improve anyone&#x27;s skin. Mine does feel smoother and more supple. The design of the product using the eye dropper is a real plus for keeping the serum minimally exposed to air which depletes the potency over time. I would buy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;√ So, this product has passed with flying colors!</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Noticed a difference in skin health and firmness within days! Would recommend this product to anyone! No bs.. Real results!</li>
            <li> I think it brightens my skin.</li>
            <li> With all the abuse my skin takes on a daily basis, it really appreciated this serum!!  It&#x27;s easily dispensed in an eyedropper and spreads on quickly on your face.  My skin soaked it up and it&#x27;s easy to tell when your skin has enough because it plumps up and smooths out.  I use the Hyaluronic Acid Serum sold by same company afterwards for even more effect.  This serum is on the thin side and the Hyaluronic Acid Serum is thicker.  This serum can be used day and night and does not interfere with makeup at all since your skin soaks it all up.  It has made a big difference in lightening my dark spots, evening skin tone, plumping and smoothing out skin in general.  It&#x27;s truly super food for my skin, I feel like my skin soaks it up eagerly and it replenishes vital nutrients.  It&#x27;s a very gentle serum that can be used on sensitive skin and it has kept my acne away too.  I have oily skin and this is a great moisturizer without adding any oiliness.  I would definitely recommend this product.  The smell is slight and pleasant and you get a lot that will last a while.  It&#x27;s definitely a great value and very easily incorporated into any skin care regime.  I use the Proactive + and this product complements it nicely.  I had gotten to a point with the Proactive + where my skin tone was not improving any more and with the addition of using this serum, my skin has started improving again.  It was probably not able to improve without the nutrients it was lacking.  This is a great product and highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Instanatural makes amazing affordable products. This vitamin C serum is no different. My skin felt younger and smoother after one weeks use. It has a pleasant smell as well. No adverse effects to my skin.</li>
            <li> I was reserved about buying this serum however I am so glad I did.  It is easy to apply and did not dry out my skin.  The Vitamin C Serum has improved my skin tone and texture,  giving me smooth clean and fresh looking skin. I highly recommend giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I love this serumI use it twice a day on my face neck and hands. I have only been using it gif about two weeks but I&#x27;m already noticing changes. My skin tone is more even, age spots seem to be lighter , and my laugh lines seem less noticeable. I have also had no breakouts. I use this oil after cleansing and then apply the Insta natural rose hip oil as a moisturizer. I love them both.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It has reduced fine lines on my face.  I love the orange scent.  I will definitely purchase as needed. Remember to moisturize after applying as it is absolutely necessary.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. At first I broke out but with continued use my face became smooth. My mum and husband say my skin glows so I am sure it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Every woman should look and feel radiant, but unfortunately like many other women, I tend to get a bit dry and dull looking at times. This Vitamin C Serum is a cure all! I apply it after washing my face in the morning and I have such a lovely glow all day. After my evening shower I reapply to keep moisturized through the night. I have found after using this product for about a week that the dry dull look has started to come less frequently. I also did not use any moisturizer on top of it to truly test it out and I can honestly say it passed with flying colors! Great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Vitamin C serum [which is clear and unscented- exactly as it should be] morning and night on my face. It definitely works the magic that only these serums can do, and my skin is clear, moisturized, and radiant. I love what this does for my skin, and I don&#x27;t wear half the makeup I used to. It also helps protect your skin from UV damage during the day [however not to replace sunscreen products].</li>
            <li> I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this serum. As someone with oily/combination skin that is prone to acne, I have to be quite careful about what I put on it. This product made my skin look really refreshed without causing breakouts or aggravating any existing acne, and after multiple weeks of using it on a regular basis, you could see a difference. The consistency is light, but not too light, and the fragrance is not overwhelming. Overall, I think it is a really good vitamin c serum.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not the one to put chemicals because they usually end up making my skin break-out, I recently tried another serum but it stung me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one feels cool on my face and stings just a tiny bit that you forgot about it, you wont have to use a lot of drops, a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m using this to fix my broken capillaries and it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I have been taking the pills and using the serum. I must admit sometimes I forget to use the serum but always take the pills. The main issue for me is an aging spot on my upper left cheak. It may be wishful thinking that it has faded some but it is still definately there. I dont know if I should be having better results yet.</li>
            <li> The smell was pleasant and not off-putting, as it was a light citrus scent. I noticed it was just a little bit thinner than another vitamin c serum I’d recently tried, so I had to act fast after I applied it to my face so it wouldn&#x27;t run. I never encountered a problem though. Just like the other serums I’ve tried, it was easy to apply and dried fairly quickly. With this serum, there was no greasy reside and it wasn’t too heavy for my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles yet but since I&#x27;m almost 26 I feel like I need to start taking care of my skin. I like that this Vitamin C Serum leaves the skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 weeks now and I feel the remarkable changes in face. My pores getting finer and smooth. I will surely buy the next bottle of this serum when I finish my first bottle.</li>
            <li> There are so many products out there that do not live up to their claims, and believe me, I previously wasted a lot of money on some of those, but this one actually surpasses them. I said I&#x27;d see results with continued use, but I saw results the very next day.  My skin seemed brighter, toned, firmer and had an overall healthy glow.  I have now used it for a couple of weeks, and I noticed that the darker spot of sun damage I had has lightened considerably, and my complexion is more even.  With all these benefits, the price is unbelievably low.  I will definitely be reordering this one!</li>
            <li> So far I really love this serum.  It does not cause my face to break out, which is a definite plus.  I have been using this product for about three weeks now. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> so far I see a slight difference</li>
            <li> This serum was very disappointing, after reading so many positive reviews I was expecting a high quality serum but this failed in so many ways, after coming from Ole&#x27;s truth serum I was hoping I could use this as a replacement and it just doesn&#x27;t stack up. The consistency is like a thick orange juice between your finger tips and although it absorbs quickly after cleansing and toning I have seen no results or any of the advertised added benefits after quite a bit of time of use. It just feels (and acts) like a poorly made product  Vitamin C serums are tricky as its hard to find one that properly stabilizes the vitamin for long-term use, this one is not that serum and it does not deliver, I will not be repurchasing and if a refund wasn&#x27;t so complicated I&#x27;d be asking for that too</li>
            <li> This product is great, I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months and i love it.</li>
            <li> Soaks right into the skin. Can&#x27;t ask for more than that!</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It absorbs into the skin quickly rather than just filling in the wrinkles and then flaking off.  I am not sure if I have a glow but the simpleness of the product is something to appreciate.</li>
            <li> I use rosewater as my toner before applying the C serum. The serum is silky and light and dries in less than a minute. It smells wonderfully of tangerines! It does make my skin more taut and toned. I have sort of grapefruit-like tiny dimpled &amp;#34;wrinkles&amp;#34; over my cheekbones and it lessens the appearance of them, although it doesn&#x27;t actually take them away.  I feel that it smoothes the appearance of my skin, so I give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Made my skin feel nourished :)Product provided for free for my testing purposes. It was a great freebie!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a great product.Easy to apply and it absorbs very quickly on my skin.It even lighter my tone face little bit and my face skin look smoother and younger.I will definitely order it again.Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product. I was looking for something that would help with my acne/scarring. Although my breakouts have slowed my scars are still there but I know with time and using this product daily the effects will be significant. Being a whole-health nerd, I’m always researching different oils and their benefits. When I came across a product that had A LOT of ingredients that targeted skin repair I was sold. The oil is light, has a pleasant citrusy smell, and dries quickly. You only need a drop or two to cover your face.&lt;br /&gt;Ps- the customer service is awesome. Without doubt a company I would come back to.</li>
            <li> I have used Vitamin C Serum for a month now and like the tightening effect I feel when I apply it.  I use it on my neck, also.  I will order more at Amazon.com, since it is affordable and gives as good results as more expensive products I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love it!  I&#x27;m planning to buy more of this product. It works great!</li>
            <li> Great product goes on smoothly and haven&#x27;t had any adverse reactions to using the product. Glad I was able to use a discount code to purchase this. I will definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Really like this serum. Been using vitamin C for a while, but this s my favorite so far. Love the fruity scent, and the little cream texture. Absorb into skin in about 15 second, my face feels very smooth afterward.  Great buy. Try it, good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin c is a really a great antiaging ingredient, I am in my 40s, and offen mistake for much much younger because I am wrinkle free. ....I never have any plastic / procedures , am 100% natural.&lt;br /&gt;I went to my doctor&#x27;s office a couple of weeks ago, my doctor was in vacation, so I have to see a fill in.After he look at my chart and sees my birthday, he insists to see my ID. LOL.&lt;br /&gt;Good skin and bone makes a beauty, please take care of your skin.</li>
            <li> I battled acne for many years and was left with a lot scaring &amp; blotches. My face is very sensitive to a lot product and I needed a very light serum to help aid in skin repair. I tried the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum because of all the good reviews. I&#x27;ve also read the positives on what vitamin C can do for your skin. So glad I tried this product! I&#x27;ve been using this serum for over a month now and I&#x27;m seeing great results. Scaring is minimal and my complexion looks 10 times better. I&#x27;ve also been told that my face looks like it&#x27;s glowing. I love how light this product feels on my skin, one of my worries was that I would breakout out again - relieved I didn&#x27;t! Having sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve become Leary of many products. This Serum gets 5 stars! Thank you!</li>
            <li> A really great product, especially for the price!  Have used it daily for 3-4 weeks, and have noticed that it seems to help with cell regeneration...my skin feels softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> The serum has a nice consistency and a faint citrusy aroma. I don&#x27;t find it sticky and it dries quickly. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Vitamin C serums and this one beats the competition including the one from my dermatologist&#x27;s office.  Light texture and pleasant scent make it a joy to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...this is my second bottle</li>
            <li> Very pleasant to use. I apply this in the am after toning and before moisturizing, giving it a few minutes to sink in. Has a nice odor, somewhat like orange juice. Doesn&#x27;t smell metallic like some other products with ferulic acid. It does seem to improve my skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! Definitely works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for about a month.  It is advertised as helping with brown spots and wrinkles.  I&#x27;ve been taking weekly pictures, same place, same lighting, same pose, and haven&#x27;t noticed a change.  If anything, I am getting more red splotches  on my skin.  It almost looks like rosacea and I seem to be getting more pimples.  It does make my face feel better, as long as I use my own skin conditioner (as recommended by the seller) after I put the serum on.  It smells good, it has a nice consistency and I believe it will last me a long time, as it doesn&#x27;t take much.  I&#x27;m going to keep using it, because it never hurts to do good things for your skin.  If I notice any differences in the wrinkles and brown spots, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> Works ok sometimes I can tell a difference. It does tighten my pores can&#x27;t tell much on my wrinkle I guess after 30 It&#x27;s all down hill</li>
            <li> I have very oily/ hormonal skin and this product is great. It smoothes out easily and dries completely without leaving a nasty film like some other products I have tried. I do use the InstaNatural Vitamin C moisturizer after and they compliment each other very well. No break outs or irritated skin for me which is always a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> Really love this product works great</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my skin within just a couple of weeks. I use the product morning and night. I will definitely be repurchasing and trying other products by this brand.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this on a whim.  My sister is huge on these types of serums and pays quite a bit for them.  It got me to thinking, &amp;#34;Amazon HAS to have something&amp;#34;. And VIOLA, found this little gem.&lt;br /&gt;My overall complexion is not bad.  I have a few dark spots on my forehead and some fine lines around my eyes that could use a bit of help.  I read about the benefits of the ingredients listed and of course thought, &amp;#34;This is exactly what I need&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;The product absorbs very quickly.  I use this after using my toner, dab some on my face and neck and sort of tap it in.  I really was blown away the very first time I used this.  I can&#x27;t really explain what is different about my face, other than it simply looks radiant.  After a bit more than 1month of use, the dark spots are lightening, my eyes look brighter, my overall complexion looks more youthful.  I loved this product so much, I purchased one for my picky sister (who was also blown away by how it left her face and by how inexpensive it was compared to the ones she buys), for my mom, and for a friend who keeps on asking what i&#x27;m doing different.  Yes, people have noticed that there is something different about my skin,  my smoother, more radiant and perky skin.  I will continue to purchase this item not only for myself, but for friends and other family as gifts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy i got this product for free to test out and review..I did my homework on this product and I really love it and I&#x27;m an huge fan of instanatural products anyway I own several and all of them are awesome. I got this vitamin c to help maintain my healty and beautiful skin. Vitamin C serum is great for my skin it leaves it skilly to the touch and moisturise.</li>
            <li> Great product,  would order again</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  I usually put in on at night before bed after washing my face.  In my opinion, its a little too heavy to wear during the day, but OK at night.  A bottle will last a long time if you use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> Great texture and results ! I love it</li>
            <li> When I was asked to try this Vitamin C serum, I admit, I was a bit skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked that it was natural, so I immediately felt at ease trying it on my skin. This product is made in the USA and I like that as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve heard awesome things about using vitamin C on your skin -- to both treat wrinkles and dark spots on your face, but also to help prevent them from even appearing. It absorbed quickly and went on easily. I will continue to use it under my moisturizer with SPF to protect my skin form the damaging sun. This Vitamin C serum is 20%, the highest dose available and it is recommended by DR Oz for anti-aging. I have noticed it has helped with my acne, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting, but of course I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product shipped very quickly and arrived in a nice bubble wrapped package.</li>
            <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
            <li> Gave me an adverse reaction. Dermatitis all over my face. Will not being using again.</li>
            <li> Dries very quickly, skin feels tighter and not as red and blotchy, citrusy smell grows on you. Customer service that follows up on product purchase. Will purchase this serum again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this in combination with their Moroccan Rose Water, my skin has never looked better. I am definately keeping this in my daily routine because I refuse to go back to the way my face / skin looked before.</li>
            <li> *I received a free sample from InstaNatural to try and review.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like what Vitamin C does for how my skin feels. I feel like my skin is tighter and more firm. Truthfully, it could all be in my head as no one has ever said, &amp;#34;Sam, your skin is so tight and firm,&amp;#34; hehe, but I&#x27;m okay with that. I&#x27;d say InstaNatural worked as well as what I&#x27;m used to, but I wasn&#x27;t a fan of the dropper, which was kind of drippy, which then wastes product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;InstaNatural&#x27;s serum includes good choices for preservatives that are not known to be irritating and comes in a dark bottle to minimize light exposure on the vitamin ingredients. That said, I&#x27;d rather have seen a serum in a pump bottle rather than a dropper since each time I open the bottle, I&#x27;m exposing the content to air. Vitamin C isn&#x27;t easy to keep stable and effective when exposed to the air. However, the great ingredients lean me to give this a better than average, four-star rating.</li>
            <li> Love this serum! My face positively glows! At night I use it in combination with rosehip oil. Mornings I follow up with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I received the product for free for testing purposes.  I like this serum a lot.  I have fairly sensitive skin and it did not cause any irritation.  I was told that some people did not like its smell but I found it pleasant.  It has a faint orange fragrance.  The directions call for you to wash and tone your face before applying the serum.  I would then put the serum on my fingers and apply.  I then would apply the Vitamin C moisturizer.  I would not hesitate to recommend this product to others.  I have been pleased with all the InstaNatural products that I have tried so far and the customer service is excellent.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, great price. I&#x27;m in love with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have used several different brands of vitamin C serum.  This one has lots of good ingredient like rosehip oil, hyaluronic acid, ferulic acid, of course, vitamin c.  It is orange in color with very pleasant citrus smell, a bit like orange juice.  But it does not sting at all.....it is light in texture but feels moisturized.  I have freckles on my face and really hope it can make it fade away......that&#x27;s my main concern......I have used it about 3-4 weeks conjunction with Instanatural vitamin c cream moisturizer.  Will keep my fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I am still on my first bottle.  I like the consistency of the product and does seem to make my skin brighter.</li>
            <li> I found this serum to help my skin reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles that seems to have found me as i age . It is easy to use and apply to the skin without any reaction. The price is fairly reasonable as well.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free as part of a product review</li>
            <li> This product was way better than expected! It says that you should apply moisturizer afterwards, but haven&#x27;t found the need yet. It simply leaves my skin soft but firm, not at all dry. I use it after taking a shower, on my clean skin, and it feels great. I do feel my skin better, but I am also using a dermaroller lately so it could be a bit of both. Eitherway, I would definitely recommend this product for the way it absorbs into the skin, and the way it leaves it afterwards.</li>
            <li> Great consistency. I love it. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Insta Natural was one of the first companies I had the pleasure to review a product for. I was so impressed with there professionalism, and the eager to go over and beyond to make sure that I was a satisfied customer, that I just had to apply for all of there products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Excellent customer service is KEY! that will only reflect even more on their products.  It shows that the company stands by their products and that satisfying their customers is very important.  From their skin care, to hair care and body Insta Natural is by far my favorite company.  Their products are amazing.  Everything I have listed above is not only the products that I have tested, but that is my complete daily skin care and hair care regimen.  I have seen a big difference in the look of my skin and my hair.  Insta Natural is definitely my &amp;#34;Fountain of Youth&amp;#34; I give Insta Natural 5 stars for amazing products and excellent customer service.  I look forward to continue to do business with Insta Natural.  I most highly recommend that you give them a try!</li>
            <li> Apply daily at night. The skin seems to be your better.</li>
            <li> I been a big fan of Oz natural products, I decided to try it based on some of the previous reviews however I wasnot impressed with the result. I have used this product for few weeks now and I honestly do not notice any positive effect. Perhaps for others who have tried it but it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> I like the product, it feels great.on my skin...but I.still don&#x27;t see big improvement...i will give it a couple more weeks and will order this product again.</li>
            <li> MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE SERUM. It fixes dark spots, acne spots, uneven skin, acne...anything! It has a delightful citrus scent and I love using it under my moisturizer at night. It&#x27;s so luxurious, easy to use, and at an amazing price!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a great product, I&#x27;ve used it for about 3 weeks and have used other brand name products that are considerably higher in price. It has a citrus smell, which I like, it does leave my skin feeling tight, but not dry. I would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Protects skin from free radicals and is essential in collagen production. Humans do not produce Vitamin C so it needs to be incorporated into everyone&#x27;s diet and skin regimen.</li>
            <li> This seems to be reducing the redness on my face and has a nice orange smell to it.  I have sensitive skin but it has not caused any problems.</li>
            <li> My face and neck LOVE this product! I saw results within 3-4 days. My face is clearer, smoother, pores are tighter,&lt;br /&gt;make-up goes on so smoothly. I mix it with peptides and it feels GOOD. my friends comment on how good my face looks&lt;br /&gt;and others just look at my skin when I tell them my age. the service was prompt , the price is a bit pricey , but worth it !&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product. Now I&#x27;m looking for a product with peptides and ceramides mixed together.</li>
            <li> So far so good. My older skin is softer and clearer. It also tightens the skin when applied.  I use it  a.m. and p.m. does not sting and no strong smell.  I&#x27;m feeling good about this product.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying this product. Watching dark spots that have been lingering from previous breakouts disappear within the first few weeks of using it. I have also been many compliments about my skin since I have added this to my routine. Just saw an advertisement for a Skinceuticals serum with the same ingredients being sold for a whopping $158...no thanks. I will not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I am a 58 yr. old female still struggling with acne and combination skin. This product has made an amazing difference in just a few weeks. I mix 2 or 3 drops of this with 2 drop of this company&#x27;s rosehip oil and that is all I need. I am no longer buying expensive moisturizers at the store. Best of all I don&#x27;t worry about harmful chemicals on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for just over 2 weeks and already have noticed a difference. The wrinkles between my eyebrows on my forehead have become less noticeable. It was easy to add to my daily face cleansing regiment too. Use as directed and great results will follow!</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;ve only been using the InstaNatural Vitamin C serum for a few days and can not speak to visible results yet, this serum sinks into my skin immediately and feels hydrating.  A lot of products containing Hyaluronic Acid can feel sticky/slick when initially applied, and feel as though it&#x27;s overtightening the skin, but this product has not given me that impression.  Additionally, HA can often make sensitive skin red or feel a momentary burn/tingle.  Again, this serum has not provided that sensation.  I can&#x27;t quite describe the scent; however, I can state that I don&#x27;t find it offensive.  The scent is noticeable in the bottle, but not noticeable after application.  The dropper bottle makes application easier, especially if applying a few drops to the dorsal (top) sides of the hands to help lighten sun spots or discoloration.  I will try to provide an update for my results after using the product a bit longer, as it may take several months to achieve maximum benefits.</li>
            <li> It seems an okay serum,rspecially when use before any mosturizers.  The only thing i was concerned about is that the plastic seal onand around the cap was easily screwed off when i turned the cap to open it. i did not have to use a scissors to  cut off the seal. So, i hope the serum  was not messed with before.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely face serum, very light but effective.  The ingredients are all-natural and contain no phthalates or parabens, which is important to me, especially for the face.  Their cucumber eye cream is excellent as well -- very refreshing and effective.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! With only one week I already see results.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks now, but it has taken away the brown spots, made my face feel softer, and decreased some of the wrinkles  I will definitely keep using it...</li>
            <li> I need more time to see if it is working for me or not.</li>
            <li> Skin felt moisture and soft in the morning after one-night use! Good package too to keep it clean and effective for a long time!</li>
            <li> ​I really like this product, and I&#x27;m surprised&lt;br /&gt;to see my dark sun spots slowly diminishing! I hope they will disappear&lt;br /&gt;completely. I&#x27;m so thankful for a product like this that first, does not test on animals and second,&lt;br /&gt;has no harsh ingredients! I would recommend this product to any and everyone!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful serum at a great price! I had to contact the seller and received a fast reply. 5 stars for the product and 5 stars for the customer service-Thanks Melissa for your help! I will be buying the serum again!</li>
            <li> its  ok  not  bad  at  all</li>
            <li> This is  a very good serum, For those that are saying it&#x27;s like water don&#x27;t know what this is supposed to be like. You don&#x27;t wont it oily because it wouldn&#x27;t absorb for you to put your moisturizer on. This is to go under your moisturizer not in place of it. This is a fabulous price. You can easily pay close to $100.00 for these ingredients from high end retailers of big name companies. I know what I&#x27;m talking about I work for 5 Plastic  Surgeons and an Esthetician. Trust me, I have already ordered my second bottle after only having my first bottle for 2 days. PS, make sure to use on your neck, throat, chest and tops of your hands. I am 54 and people guess me for 10 years younger.</li>
            <li> I love this serum! It has a great scent that I can only describe as &amp;#34;citrusy&amp;#34; and I would even categorize the orange color as a &amp;#34;citrusy color&amp;#34;. The smell and color together is downright cheerful. The scent isn&#x27;t super strong and it is very light and delicate on your skin once the serum is absorbed. The ingredients in this serum are nothing short of amazing. Its like it has a little bit of everything in it to address all your skin concerns in one little blue bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit goes a long way, you only use a couple of drops for your entire face so it should last a long time. I know that I get frustrated with many products because I run out of the product right around the same time I start seeing results. That shouldn&#x27;t be a problem with this serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serum isn&#x27;t at all greasy and doesn&#x27;t feel oily on your skin even though it contains many oils. It left my skin feeling soft, smooth, firm and looking MUCH healthier. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin tone is more even, my skin is much smoother, and I&#x27;ve had less breakouts. I&#x27;ve been using this after using the Instanatural Vitamin C toner (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NLKAVL4) and I&#x27;d definitely recommend using these together. They compliment each other well and seem to really work together to make your skin healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be keeping this serum in my daily skincare routine. It has replaced several other products that I used to use because it is more of an all-in-one rather than being for one specific problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided to me for testing and review purposes, but I would never endorse something that I didn&#x27;t believe was worthy of it and I would never post an opinion that wasn&#x27;t my own.</li>
            <li> I have used Estée Lauder Advance Night Repair for about two years now.  I was getting low and just couldn&#x27;t see spending that kind of money on it any longer. While looking for a new serum, I stumbled across this. It was the least expensive, with the best reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it I was a little worried because it is so thin (I&#x27;m used the thick stuff.) It goes on easy, and dissolves quickly. I didn&#x27;t notice a weird smell like other reviewers have said and I tend to have an overly sensitive sense of smell.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had pretty good skin, aside from a blemish or two and the once a month full blown pimple I get right before I start (sorry.)  Since I have started using this, no more small blemishes, no more monthly pimple. The texture of my face seems smoother. I&#x27;d get tiny little white bumps on my cheeks that come and go, but not anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to try their face moisturizer and Rose Hip oil next. The price is right and quality is outstanding. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This serum has become my favorite part of my morning routine. It smells amazing like a refreshing glass of fresh squeezed orange juice and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to receive this to review for my blog and I&#x27;m in love! I used this with the Vitamin C facial toner and my skin is so smooth! It smells so yummy and you just need a little bit! Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for the purest and highest concentration of Vitamin C Serum for a while and this stuff is amazing. Do not be fooled by the price. You are not paying for marketing, advertisement or any of that stuff big name brands have. My skin is loving it and I use it day and night. Will be ordering more before this one is gone.</li>
            <li> helping with discoloration</li>
            <li> I love this InstaNatural Vitamin C Serum, not only does it have vitamin c it has other good things as well that support healthy skin!  That includes Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid &amp; Vitamin E. It also includes other anti aging ingredients such as Organic Rosehip Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, Organic Argan Oil and Carrot Seed Oil!  Most of these items I have bought  &amp; made my own mix of oils.  But here you have it all in one product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also less costly than some similar products that basically are just 20% vitamin c &amp; maybe some hyaluronic acid!  I will be purchasing it again!  Actually I wish it was a subscribe &amp; save item because it would definitely be on my list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is looking marvelous!  The laugh lines around my mouth are softer &amp; my skin seems brighter &amp; clearer too!  When someone finds out my age they are surprised!</li>
            <li> LOVE HOW THIS MAKES MY SKIN FEEL AND THE SMELL IS SO REFRESHING IVE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS AND CAN NOTICE A SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY FACE</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I do see a difference (improvement) in my skin and it is soothing when applied to under eye area. I would love to get a free sample of this product but I did purchase this product and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I started using the Vitamin C Serum about a month ago on my face, and my skin is clearer.  My laugh lines around my eyes are greatly diminished, and overall skin tone is healthier.  My freckles are lighter as well.  I just started using it on my arms and shoulders to see if it would lighten freckles there as well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My skin is seriously lacking in hydrating and nutrients and this serum brought it back to life! Has a very convenient dropper so you don&#x27;t use too much. Fantastic packaging and very high quality product! *Sample provided for review*</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using the Vitamin C Serum, as I was away for 2 weeks.  It seems to me a great product.  Even though, I&#x27;ve just used it for a few days,  my skin becomes softer and brighter.  Is really an amazing serum.  As I continue to use, I notice my skin becomes smooth, soft and plump, I really love the vitamin c serum.  Moreover, is a much cheaper and affordable product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few days now. I am a vitamin C addict. So far, so good. Skin is nice &amp; smooth &amp; it is definitely smoothing out the crows feet. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 and began to notice fine wrinkles on my forehead. I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, yet I feel and see results. Would absolutely recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> Am relatively new to its usage....It does what it promises though it can be quite drying if not topped off with ample moisturizer as recommended in the directions. So far so good.</li>
            <li> This product is light goes under make up well. Take a minute to dry can feel it lifting.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I have used several Vitamin C serums, and this is the best so far!  It has a light citrus scent and absorbs well.  I have also used it on some minor skin irritations, and it seems to speed healing process!  I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously great. Wonderful product. I won&#x27;t be caught without it from now on.</li>
            <li> This product is now my go to for moisterization. I use this before my moisturizer because I have extremely dry skin. It works wonders to hydrate the skin. Also , it has a citrus scent which I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about at first but it turned out to be very pleasant and did not irritate my sensitive skin. I love the face that this is all natural. The packaging is very simple and I love that about it . The orange is a very attractive label color. The labels are easy to read and overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I love this product , definitely will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I love this serum. Not sticky, oily, or too dry! It smells amazing and feels great on the skin. I can&#x27;t comment on any results yet, but it does feel nice!</li>
            <li> Excellent skin care product. No side effects at all.&lt;br /&gt;Skin looks brighter and healthier. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Broke out my skin. I used to use obagi vitamin serum. But it was pretty costly so decided to go cheaper because this product had many good reviews. After Started using this product, I got many pimples and my skin looked horrible.  I was wondering how many true users reviews were posted here.</li>
            <li> I really like the ingredients, that is the reason why I thought I will try it! Unfortunately my skin is very sensitive and reacted after a while of use with  little red discolorations on my cheek. This serum also dried my skin out even with using my normal oilfree cream! Sorry! Not for me!</li>
            <li> The consistency of this is unlike any vitamin serum I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s opaque and had a creamy consistency. Suffice it to say, this serum didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Nice stuff, great orange smell but not sure if I see any difference in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I really like the InstaNatural product line. Products that I received generally do what it promises.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality serum delivered by glass dropper in a blue glass bottle.  The serum is light orange and smells just like orange juice.  It glides on and absorbs quickly and easily.  The company contacted me as a follow-up to my order with helpful tips and tricks on how to use the product - you can layer it with other serums and moisturizers - it will fit into your regular routine.  It just gives an extra boost to even out your skin tone and provide extra nutrients to your skin.  I really feel like it  absorbs b/c the formula is so light, it really feels and smells like a drop of orange juice!  This product is non-irritating and I have sensitive skin!  I use it as a spot treatment on the dark spots and scars and fine lines on my face daily.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous Vitamin C serum, one of the best ones I have tried (and I have tried several), this will definitely be a repurchase for me!!</li>
            <li> I like this serum. It has a suble orange scent and acts as a great hydrator for your skin. Fine to use under makeup or right before bed.</li>
            <li> As with all the instanatural products this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> order arrived really quick, goes on smooth and scent is really nice a fresh. will update as to how it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for couple of weeks. It absorb in the skin pretty quickly and my skin has lightened just after using it for a week. Smell is not at all heavy, you just need 3/4 drops to cover your whole face. I would like to keep on using it and will further update after couple of months on this serum. But so far it has been a great experience.</li>
            <li> This worldwide much nettere thai using Rosehip alone. I borghi Rosehip bifore and it eas thick and sticky for application. Tris serie app lise smonth and dose vive a little life to dull skin. I like it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about two weeks now, and am starting to see results. Nothing drastic, but there is a definite brightening of my skin. I bought it mainly to hopefully diminish the old crone lines around my mouth, and it will take longer for that, I think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took awhile for me to get the hang of the proper amount to use for my skin. At first I was using two drops night and day as advised on the label. Then I changed to three drops per application. Then four. I work outside, and I noticed that my skin was feeling drier than normal despite using moisturizer over the serum. So this week I decided to use it only at night, reducing the amount to three drops, with argan oil and rosehip oil over it. I strongly recommend this - moisturizing oils enhance this beautifully and I wake up with dewy skin. Something about being outside in the sun for extended periods of time causes dryness with this serum, so if you work outdoors and/or have very sensitive skin as I do, I would only use this at night. Also be careful with it around the eyes. Just a minuscule amount is needed there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this has the same effects as exfoliation with brightened skin as a bonus. It does not cause my pores to become enlarged as some exfoliators do, so that is a definite bonus! I would cleanse well, use a good moisturizing toner (InstaNatural&#x27;s rose water works great with this), apply the serum, then the oils over that. I love their argan oil over it as well as rosehip oil. Just remember not to get excited and use too much...my face became a bit red when I was using four drops at a time. Two to three drops are all I need to get a nice, healthy bright complexion!</li>
            <li> My skin looks radiant, lighter and with less wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;Convinient packed in a dropper so it&#x27;s easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Good odor</li>
            <li> Product was delivered as promised.  I am in my mid-50&#x27;s and have a lot of aging spots on my face due to sun exposure from watching my kids play sports when they were young.  After using the Vitamin C Serum, within the first 2 weeks I&#x27;ve noticed amazing results of my aging spots lightening.  I would have given it 5-stars since it does what it says, but there is a slight smell to it from the rosehip oil which some may not care for. Otherwise it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Great product! Was really shocked to see how much it decreases the appearance of scars- which is what I bought the product for- an added bonus to see how it does truly decrease the appearance of my crows feet! Was very pleased with the company who replaced the bottle that I accidentally knocked over!</li>
            <li> Oh yes...nothing like the real stuff, it really works on your skin like magic, a little goes a long way, will buy it again,</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face and neck feel after I apply it to a freshly washed face. I will continue to use and let you know the effects of not aging at a later date.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, I love the texture and the light citrus fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a really great product! I have been using it for a week and I can already see quite a change in my skin.  It look brighter and my fine lines have been reduced.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Have not seen any improvement on my skin. Hate the smell of it too.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, reasonable pricing. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This serum absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling after using it.  Seems to make my skin smoother, but I don&#x27;t know how much it helps with wrinkles and what not.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.</li>
            <li> My comments are based upon comparison to the previous version which was not &amp;#34;Advanced Formula Vitamin C Serum.  ~The former version was a clear, freely adsorbing thinner liquid which was light on skin, relatively little aroma, and soaked into the skin immediately leaving no sticky residue.  I like it because of its ease of use, it was clear leaving no film after drying, and  it allowed me to apply other products over it immediately.  Most important I found the Original version to be more effective. I did see more improvement in dark spots and other pigmented areas around my face, neck and hands.   ~This products--the Advanced Formula--is of thicker, sticky consistency that is cloudy and orange colored.  It did not adsorb freely into my skin after cleansing.  It dried slower and also formed somewhat of a barrier that I personally found annoying because other normally applied products such as moisturizing serum, moisturizer, and perhaps foundation makeup seemed to float on top and not penetrate the Vit C Serum layer. Also if during the day I was exposed to humid outdoor air or warmth due to my own activity, my skin would not breathe and perspiration caused the return of the sticky feeling as if the Vit. C. serum had just been applied,  tI requires more product usage because of its thick consistency.  I don&#x27;t experience improvement of my dark spots or other imperfections like with the Original formula.  .  ~This experience is relevant to my skin type, my exposure to heat and humidity of course.  However, I was extremely happy with the former product and hope that Insta-Natural would offer that as alternative again.  It was unfortunate that the product formula was changed and no warning was given on their Amazon customers.   When I received the Orange colored product I thought some mistake had been made though I had clicked on &amp;#34;order again&amp;#34; and expected the product to be identical.  After researching I found that the name had changed to &amp;#34;Avanced Formula&amp;#34;.  Ordered a 3rd of what I thought to be the original formula only to receive another advanced bottle. ~The company is very good about replacements or refunds--once the product has been tried of course; so I&#x27;m not concerned other than:  I wanted the Original Formula that I ordered and please don&#x27;t make product changes without clearly stating it in your Amazon Ad. I do not appreciate becoming a test market for new products without a choice.  The fine print on the bottle label in the ad is not shopper friendly and it was not easy to see that the name changed to Advanced Formula. ~I will not order again and look for a clear, thinner product .   Thank you.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working - my skin is clearer and brighter after a few weeks of use.  It absorbs quickly and smells great.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this serum. I got through my first bottle and actually ordered more. The first batch was yellow. This batch has no color. Not sure why there&#x27;s a difference. I hope it&#x27;s the same stuff.</li>
            <li> I got this product free for a review and I am currently using it. I really like this under my moisturizer. It makes my face smooth, and its not sticky at all. It has a nice smell. It dries quick, sinks into the I got skin in minutes.Its a little thicker than the other one I have and I like that much better. There are tons of Vitamin C serums out there, I have another but I am going to stick with the Insta Natural. I have used several of their products and this one is just as great as the rest. I am pleased with the results I am getting, I am after that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;. Use this product if you are looking for a serum. Its a 5 star choice.</li>
            <li> makes my face smoother!</li>
            <li> I so love it. I just Cant get enough of this Serum. It literally gave me a brightening effect and keeps away the dullness of my face. One of my beauty regimen everynight is puting this Instanatural Vit.C serum on my face it works great on my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It smells heavenly, like fresh oranges, and it really makes my skin feel wonderful. I&#x27;m seeing a real difference in the appearance and texture of my skin. Dry areas are disappearing, and the color is more even. I would definitely keep buying this product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this vitamin c serum. I use it twice a day, and I always am sure to use it before I apply my make up. I really can see a difference in my skin. It seems glowing and clean and fresh. I get more compliments now on my skin then I did when I was a teen. I&#x27;m very happy with these results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I do not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t like writing reviews but I decided I needed to for InstaNatural products. Not only are there products effective providing great results, there customer service is fabulous as well. Shortly after I ordered the product I received an email from InstaNatural thanking me for purchasing their product and providing thorough instructions on how to use the product.  In addition, after a few weeks of using the product I received another email from InstaNatural asking me what I thought of the product and how I was liking it. To say the least I am very impressed by the products they provide, the effectiveness of the product and the price point is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using this product my skin is brighter, wrinkles appear less around my eyes, skin has more clarity and feels much more supple.  I have used other vitamin C serums &amp; this one is hands down the best! Thank you InstaNatural!</li>
            <li> Smells good, dries quickly, and seems to be evening out my skin tone so far! Hopefully it will show some greater benefits in the long run. Good product!</li>
            <li> Works great to soften skin. Pleasant citrus smell.</li>
            <li> makes my skin feel tight</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the fake reviews fool you.  This stuff is garbage and NOT as advertised.</li>
            <li> My skin was noticeably better after just a week. Pores started shrinking and my overall complexion is still improving. This serum brightens and softens your skin. It&#x27;s one of the best facial products I&#x27;ve ever used. Great investment right here.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on Saturday the 18 (the very day I received it) and I gotta say, I can see a difference. I use it twice daily - when I get up in the morning and before I go to bed.  I follow it with my usual moisturizer and I&#x27;m seeing a difference in my skin in the mornings. My skin looks fresh when I wake up! I read some reviews that said this product is watery or milky looking - I&#x27;ve never used a product like this so I had no idea what to expect however, I wouldn&#x27;t call it watery - its a little thin which makes it easier to apply and as for the color...it&#x27;s a dull orange color - it smells nice but doesn&#x27;t linger at all. I use about 4 drops for my face and about the same for my neck so I think it will last quite a while. I will follow up in 4 weeks to add another review.</li>
            <li> I got it for my mom and she used it for few days. First two days everything was fine but next day she had many pimples, so she stoped using it. I didn&#x27;t try it by myself.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many vitamin C serums in the past and have always been very impressed with the power of vitamin C. I got this in the mail today and was even scared to use it since the highest percentage of vitamin C I have used has been 18% and it seriously irritated my skin. I was so nervous that I used a tiny cotton swab to apply it. What happened? Nothing. No tingling, no stinging. Nothing. I got more daring and applied even more to my skin. I felt nothing. Just like applying water on my face. You&#x27;d think this would be a good thing, right? Wrong. Although I had hoped for it not to irritate my skin as bad as other serums, I certainly didn&#x27;t expect no tingling at all. I looked at the ingredients and noticed that there is no actual vitamin C (L-Ascorbic Acid). Instead, there is a synthetically derived version of vitamin C: Sodium ascorbyl phosphate (SAP). I am seriously disappointed. Studies have repeatedly shown L-Ascorbic Acid as having the most effective antioxidant properties as it is the purest form of vitamin C. I won&#x27;t be using this and I&#x27;ll be ordering another serum, paying more attention to the form of vitamin C.</li>
            <li> Really seems to tighten the facial skin. It is not greasy and drinks right into the skin. Vendor was anxious too know how I liked it and offered a free sample of another product. I would definately purchase again and would try other products as well.</li>
            <li> I think this one not for me...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for a few days, but it seems to be slightly fading a few acne scars i have already. Unlike other serums this one hasn&#x27;t dried out my face whatsoever. I will definitely be using this product for a long time!</li>
            <li> Oh geez, I love this  Vitamin C Serum. I am in shock to learn that there are 22 beauty products in this serum.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to see if I could get rid of some  hypr -pigmentation  and some age spots and a few sun spots.. I have been using for 10 day now and this really does is doing the job for me There is no comparison with this wonderful Vitamin C Serum. With this progress I should be good to go at the end of 30 days.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! my skin has really improved so much in about two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;I actually requested a free sample, the customer service was great! and they sent it pretty quickly and I got a full sized product! the results after two weeks of the product applied twice daily were smoother softer skin, brightening, more even skin tone, and fading of scars/acne!&lt;br /&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;5bUtQ27bo84</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong with this product, I investigated almost every brand, and this product was as comparable to the very expensive brands you hear about on the radio, and in magazines, and more bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely continue to use this product, and the price is so affordable..I&#x27;m 51 Y/O and I never thought I would say this, but I&#x27;m very happy with my complexion since I started using Insta Natural.</li>
            <li> Great Vitamin C Serum that makes my skin feel super soft!  I apply this under my foundation to help reduce discoloration over time.  I wish they sold a bigger bottle as well, though with how little is needed, I think this one should last me a while.  I am glad I was able to purchase this at a special promotion price to try it out.  I truly love it!</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Nice serum. Not drying and smells nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastik! it works just as it says it would. I&#x27;m very pleased happy face.</li>
            <li> 2nd time ordering this product. I think it works better than another serum I recently tried. I will be sticking to this from now on!</li>
            <li> Great product. Exactly as described and expected.</li>
            <li> this is a great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using the product for a couple of weeks now but can already see positive results in my skins appearance. I&#x27;ll do a follow up review in a few weeks but anticipate nothing less than continued positive results.</li>
            <li> Very good. I want to reorder</li>
            <li> InstaNatural is one of my favorite skin care lines and I have tried alot! I LOVE the Vitamin C Serum. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth without a greasy heavy feeling! It&#x27;s perfect alone or under moisturizer. If you use a retinol product, I would use it at a different time of day than the Vitamin C so they don&#x27;t cancel each others benefits out. I prefer using Vitamin C serum in the morning before moisturizing. This Vitamin C serum is loaded with good for your skin ingredients too! 20% Vitamin C, Hyaluronic Acid, Ferulic Acid &amp; Vitamin E, Organic Rosehip Oil, Sea Buckthorn Oil, Organic Argan Oil, Plant Stem Cells, Carrot Seed Oil, Pomegranate....it&#x27;s food for your skin!!!! I can&#x27;t say enough about this product! Give it a try! you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin after using the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a couple of months and love the way my skin feels. I do not think it has done a lot for the wrinkles, but the skintone and healthy glow definitely make me look younger. I have had so many compliments lately on how young I look. I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a very good serum. I am using everyday and I feel very confortable. Maria Elena</li>
            <li> This serum smells like fresh orange!! It leaves my skin feeling fresh and it works perfectly with my Proactiv facial products!!  I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin since using this formula.  I use it with my Proactiv lotion (Step 2) and it blends in nicely, no sticky residue.  I&#x27;m &amp;#34;very&amp;#34; happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I love how soft my skin is with thi. I have been using it for a few weeks and I have noticed a difference. I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabulous. .value for money.I love the smooth feel on my face after using it.its non sticky and absorbs well in skin.</li>
            <li> Pleasant clean fragrance, easy to apply. My complexion does seem smoother, less fine lines, and with more even tone.</li>
            <li> The communication with the distributor was great. I am old and my have waited too long for a miracle. Good luck.</li>
            <li> Love this product!! My skin tone is more even and has a hydrated glow. I use it only at night and feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li> I have been using  this for three weeks now . Have not seen a big difference . But, I am willing to give it a chance .</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make a bit of difference for spots and small wrinkles, but has a nice smell and feels nice on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a week. I have acne prone skin and very VERY oily. Even though I currently have some break outs,  I can definitely see a noticeable difference in my skin texture. I also have old acne scars and they seem to be getting smoother, not so pronounced.  So far so good. I will keep using it since I&#x27;ve had no bad side effects whatsoever.  Good product.</li>
            <li> I just started using it a month ago and people started noticing my skin looking better. I don&#x27;t really see it yet but I will update after longer use</li>
            <li> I think I like this product. I am still waiting to see a difference in my face. But I use it every morning and night along with my DoTerre essential oils. I use frankincense and helichrysum  and other oils and this vitamin c is causing others to comment on my nice skin. So I guess it is working. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It makes your skin feel awesome !</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for a couple of weeks now and I can see how it is starting to change the texture of my skin. It has a fresher appereance now.</li>
            <li> Love this product.Goes on smooth and smells great.No crusty aftermath left on my face.Nice citrus smell.</li>
            <li> This product soakes into your skin, it is not oily, it really helps with wrinkles, and smells like an orange cream ice cream bar!</li>
            <li> I am offering my honest feedback for purchasing this product at discount.  I have been using this product for over a week now. First, I love the smell of this product. It smells like orange/pink grapefruit. Second, I love the texture. It is not oily and it goes right into my skin. Third, it is helping to fade my sunspots right underneath my eye. I noticed these sunspots a few weeks ago. Since then, I tried to cover with my makeup, but it still showed through. I cannot say these sunspots were gone for a week usage, but I am pretty hopeful because I can see the slight change in colors already. My daughter said that spots seems to be lighter than before.  Lastly, their customer service is amazing. It is so easy to work with, and they really want to make sure you are happy with your purchase.  I am happy with this product. I want to use other vitamin C products along with this serum.</li>
            <li> Another amazing product from this company.  I&#x27;ll get right down to it - summer can destroy my skin, I normally go out with sunscreen but this summer there was an emergency (friend&#x27;s house burnt down) and I was out in the scorching sun all day for about 2 weeks, no sunscreen (we were so sleep deprived we didn&#x27;t even think about it).  I was devastated when I noticed I had two small sun spots on the side of my face - I&#x27;m too young for this!  I&#x27;d also been slacking on my skin care regimen due to exhaustion.  I knew this had to work, SOMETHING had to help and this DID. It&#x27;s so soothing on the skin, gentle scent, soaks in and within an hour I can see that I actually look awake, refreshed, moisturized.  I love this serum! My skin tone is even, the sun spots are not gone, of course it&#x27;s only been a couple weeks - but in that time, my skin is re-hydrated, the pesky worry lines on my forehead are GONE, I can&#x27;t see the wrinkles near my eyes unless I smile (that&#x27;s not so bad!), and, the odd uneveness that was happening around the corners of my mouth are GONE. If you&#x27;re looking tired, dehydrated, and overall just feel &amp;#34;blah&amp;#34;, give this a try - if you don&#x27;t see any difference in 2 weeks (take photos, haha, I wish I did!) I&#x27;d be surprised.  And with a 100% guarantee or money back, you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have had acne problem since 15-16 yrs. Have tried all kinds of acne products including Proactiv, they would work for a while but could not completely stop the breakouts. But this vit C serum just zapped all the acne in after about 3-4 uses and has kept them away. The best thing was it did not dry out my skin and instead made it softer, younger looking, beautiful, and flawless. I could say it has even made me a little fairer. I used to avoid nuts as I would have a breakout immediately after taking them. But just a few days back I had about a handful of almonds and peanuts...and no breakouts!</li>
            <li> I took this product faithfully and it did not do anything for me..</li>
            <li> I swear I got a bottle of water. Never again. I even tasted it so I know it was just water. I can hardly believe it. I&#x27;m seriously pissed. Boo instanatural Boo</li>
            <li> My face looks instantly brighter. From first use. Wow !!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for less than a week and I can notice my acne scar has lightened significantly!</li>
            <li> First product I&#x27;ve found, short of prescription anti-virals, that I can successfully use against Shingles. Critically important in keeping down the effects of the occurrence on my face and neck. Very highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to my skincare products.  It&#x27;s awesome with great ingredients.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am a big fan of Vitamin C facial products.  I use this serum first and my Vitamin C oil over it which I feel maximized the result.  I would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> just love this product.</li>
            <li> It works great - saw my brown spots lighten considerably and my wrinkles less noticeable - plus, it feels very refreshing on my skin!</li>
            <li> I like this Vit C serum.  It is gentle on the face and my skin just soaks it up.  My skin is clearer and brighter and firmer.  My skin seems to be holding moisture better too.  I have only been using it for a few weeks but I intend to keep it part of my daily regimen.  I have paid way more for the Obagi C serum and it did not do as much for my skin as the Instanatural Vit C serum.  I say &amp;#34;try it!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like it so much. If you will be using it under sunscreen or make up, you need to let it dry for sometime.&lt;br /&gt;I wish that you can deliver other products such as the mask and other serums internationally.</li>
            <li> I use this serum twice once in the morning and once at night. I can say it has really improved the appearance of my post acne scars on my face. I believe it has been a month since I been using it. It finally feels good being able to be comfortable walking around showing off my face. Also I appreciate the seller sending me an email telling me the best way to use the serum!</li>
            <li> Gave me a really bad rash!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  It really does give you a glow.  It soaks right into your skin, like giving it a drink.  My skin is in great shape with these products.</li>
            <li> Terrific serum.  Fast absorption.  I apply twice daily..morning after cleansing and evening before bed.  After a week I noticed an improvement in fine lines and a great improvement in skin smoothness.  Very inexpensive and without chemicals.</li>
            <li> I never really know how to view the effects but I like it it feels on my face.&lt;br /&gt;It feels clean, freshening and also makes my face glow.</li>
            <li> This serum is the best I&#x27;ve used....my skin is so improved. Especially around my eyes and the skin on my cheeks is tighter and fuller. I am fair and a few age spots were starting to appear. Now they are lighter. I will buy this again.</li>
            <li> Very orange smell, absorbs in skin quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. I&#x27;d buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> So far so good....my old acne scars seems to be fading.</li>
            <li> My pores have minimized greatly</li>
            <li> Great product.  Smells wonderful, no irritation to my skin and I use it almost every day.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would repurchase</li>
            <li> My first time ordering this I liked the product so decided to order it again. The second time I ordered it, the packaging changed to a dark blue bottle with an orange label... also the product changed from a clear sticky liquid to now this orange delicious smelling liquid that isn&#x27;t sticky anymore . amazing!! Please don&#x27;t change the product back to the clear sticky liquid. The new serum smells so good and glides on my face without being tacky nor sticky. I can put makeup on over it without it flaking off. Please do not change the product back! I LOVE this! Will def keep using it</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m not sure what all the hype is about this product.  I had read the reviews before buying it, and I wonder if it is getting good reviews because the company is supplying free bottles? I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of months and I don&#x27;t see much, if any, difference in my skin since I started using the product. Next time, I will try something else.</li>
            <li> I do like the Vitamin C serum. My skin feels smoother and tighter. I will re-order. , I find those feelings to be quite pleasant. Age 70++  Thank  you.</li>
            <li> I like this serum, it is not oily, absorbs quickly and I have noticed a difference in the brightness of my skin and the fading of dark spots.  I will order again</li>
            <li> I do mix it with another serum just because I want the benefits of both, but I love the smell, it leaves my skin softer, I feel it protects and I&#x27;m very happy with it and will be reordering.  llk</li>
            <li> I used my first bottle and can&#x27;t honestly say that I see much improvement in my skin.  Maybe in the long term.  But, this serum goes on easily and drys quickly and does not bother my eyes. I would recommend this product for those reasons and the low price.</li>
            <li> I have found InstaNatural to be a manufacturer of products I really like using.  They are all natural and have given me the opportunity to try a number of their products.  Along with the toner they sent me their Vitamin C Serum For Face with 20% Hyaluronic Acid.  Of all of the hyaluronic acids I&#x27;ve tried I think this one is my favorite.  It is orange in color and a thick gel consistency.  Like the toner, it has a fresh citrus scent.  I feel like it plumped and moisturized my skin and is helping in my anti aging regime. I apply it after using the toner on clean skin.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it works great I am loving the results in my skin. I am buying my second bottle. 😚&lt;br /&gt;xo</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have seen a huge difference  in my skin. It looks and feels GREAT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product for I love to review. I use this every day and every night. My skin feels so nice.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I&#x27;ve tried for my face. Love it</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the new formula.  It leaves my skin soft and supple.  The aroma is a creamy citrus.  Bravo!!</li>
            <li> Love the product-great price and fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I really like using the Vitamin C Serum by instanatural because it goes on smooth and it does not leave your face feeling oily it smells so good like oranges  I find the product easy to apply because it has a little dropper in the lid I used the dropper and dropped some on my hand and used my fingers to massage it on my face i use it before going to bed it makes your face look so nice and smooth and clear i recommend  Vitamin C Serum by instanatural for any one wanting a clear and smooth face i received this for free for my own opinion</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my doctor suggested I purchase a vitamin C serum to reduce scarring on a small facial surgery.  I researched quite a bit and settled on this product for the quality of ingredients and price.  I am very happy with the purchase. The product is very high quality, has a very pleasant odor and so far seems to be helping (it has only been 3 weeks).  I would strongly suggest this product to my friends.  Now on my 4th bottle....still loving it!!!</li>
            <li> great stuff for your skin</li>
            <li> so after spending lots of precious time and frustration sorting through the reviews of the free loaders who got the product for free to test, I was a bit concerned. You can always tell those reviews, they go on and on, about how many ounces in the bottle, listing ingredients and what they are suppose to do.... Here is my fave: this  serum smells delicious,.... and on and on never really being specific about the concrete actual personal changes in their skin. SO after reading all the reviews and I must  say: this company would benefit avoiding these free loaders, because so many of these views made me wonder if this product has any value, not to mention all the precious time going through those. SO I think I vented, now on to the product. It works. I have been using it for one week, just about. I do have a few small bumps from my skin detoxing since I started using it, but that only lets me work the product works!!!. Day one I loved it., I jus turned 42 and I am noticing things about my skin that I never thought I would. ANd it&#x27;s like your skin changes over night. I am into skin, in the beauty industry and have spent a considerable amount of time and money on sooo many products during the course of countless years. Many of the products that did amazing for me no longer suffice.&lt;br /&gt;it is imperative to moisturize the skin after applying the serum and for women in their 40&#x27;s it recommend a deep moisturizer, depending on the skin type. The first thing I loved was the texture and absorbtion and fragrance.. It left me wanting to apply more of it to my skin. I did have some small bumps on my skin, but that just let me know the product works. About a week into it, and i realize it is early to tell, my pores are reduced like all the way, leaving my skin texture smoother, also I see clarity and an even tone now, I had discoloration around my chin and side of my face since my20&#x27;s and that is gone, in specific yellowing around the mouth. That is such a big deal, .. I have a dark spot nothing major but def obvious and that has faded. Below my chin I have a faint line that has been there since my late 20&#x27;s and that is gone, and that is huge to me, because for the life of me I would have to do multiple treatments to make that go away for like 24 hours, and last but not least the lines and a bit of puffines that I began to notice rt after my42nd BD, are gone. I still have some fine lines on my forehead and it has only been a week, I do not use botox or fillers so I have those on my forehead but seeing the results so far  am hoping I can loose those. I do have to say that this does lighten your skin so if you do not want that then beware of this product. OK the only thing I could add is a pump bottle so that the product does not get oxidized every time you open the bottle.  I also bought the eye serum and it is equally wonderful&lt;br /&gt;sorry for the wordy review and venting i hope this helps some people out thererk spot nothing major but def obvious and that has faded.

            <li> Lovely citrus smell. I am using this after home-microdermabrasion treatments and it seems to add hydration and a light velvety touch to my face. Only using for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I really like this product! I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks and I can already see my wrinkles disappearing!</li>
            <li> this is the first serum i ever tried.. i love it... i am happy for purchasing this.. but this bottle may last a month or less than it coz i am  using twice a day... i like the feel of it.. i never had acne before but got it couple of months back and so tried this serum.. i hope this helps me.... will post an update after one month since its only a week after using it.</li>
            <li> There was a slight burnung sensation when I applied it but my skin looked amazing and the lotion calmed the burning feeling! Love it would definitely buy it again! As a note I have very sensitive skin which is probably why I felt the burning.</li>
            <li> Love see the diffrence in my skin</li>
            <li> Wife loves it and it shows!</li>
            <li> Use several times, will order again</li>
            <li> Used as directed.  No noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I received this for free with a promotional code.  It is a somewhat thick serum that has a pleasant citrus scent. It takes a few minutes for your skin to absorb, but once it does, my skin felt soft to the touch. There is no sticky residue, unlike some facial lotions. I suggest waiting a few minutes after you wash your face to use this product. The first time I used it, it felt tingly, due to my open pores, right after a warm face wash. But there is no tingling if you wait just a few minutes after you cleanse your face. I love using this at night.</li>
            <li> Good product, wish it was a bit lighter in consistency. For the price it is working.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum and use it every morning under my moisturizer/makeup and every night after washing my face. I have already seen a difference with the how smooth my skin feels. I lightly rub a small amount over my face, neck and decolette. This is NOT a moisturizer so you really need to make sure you put some on top of this serum. The serum absorbs very quickly and smells like fresh oranges. I feel that it has improved my skin so I would buy it again. I also use a lot of glycolic acid products and none of them have interacted in a negative way. I have sensitive skin too and haven&#x27;t had any reaction to this product.</li>
            <li> This serum is amazing. One of the best i have used. I highly recommend this serum.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice serum. In the first place, it smells like oranges! It goes on very cool and smooth, and absorbs very quickly. I use it every morning and evening on my face and neck. Most days I mix it with a few drops of emu oil and skip moisturizer, just depends on my skin and the weather. It does seem to have improved my skin texture more than the other vitamin C serum I was using. This one has some added ingredients that I was not getting before, and the combination works well for my skin type (older, formerly oily but now on the normal to dry side, tendency to larger pores) and I believe some of my darker spots (no, they are NOT age spots) are fading more. Do I look 25?  No, thank goodness, because that would confuse the grandkids, but I could probably carve off a few years and nobody would accuse me of lying without a license check first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is another quality product from this company, which has great customer service also. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I think this serum is keeping my skin in good shape (62 years old) but no drastic changes. Just seems to be keeping age spots in check.</li>
            <li> This product was provided free to me for product review.  This serum feels and smells wonderful.  I very much enjoy using this product at night.  My skin is sensitive, so I have found that using nightly is perfect for my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this serum.  I am on my 2nd bottle.  I use this with the emu oil, and my complexion has improved!  I don&#x27;t break out anymore, and if I do, I notice it right from the start and the next day it&#x27;s gone!  I use this day and night.  I use CC cream and it goes on perfect after the oils.  Doesn&#x27;t make my face oily!</li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t have a very good reaction to this serum. I wanted to love it because of the great ingredients but unfortunately my skin broke out terribly after 2 uses.  I have combo skin with dry cheeks, and don&#x27;t experience many break outs.  I do however have sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m a product junkie, always like to try new moisturizers, cleaners and serums but this one just didn&#x27;t sit well.  Hopefully everyone else, will like this product.  It has some really good stuff in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I am a serum addict and this one from InstaNatural is in my top 3. My skin feels very smooth and firm after using this underneath moisturizer. It absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like many other vitamin C serums I have tried.  The pink grapefruit oil has a very light and pleasant smell that doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It is really a good product, I got it for free to give my honest opinion.   It absorbed easily in to my skin, and left it feeling soft. My skin feels tighter &amp; brighter</li>
            <li> This serum might work for someone else but it&#x27;s just not for me. My skin is sensitive and prone to redness. After a couple of weeks of using this serum under my normal moisturizer, my skin is getting more dried out, rough, and irritated (I&#x27;m breaking out and I feel like my skin is flushing a lot). It also seems to make my moisturizer not absorb into my skin as well. I just tried the niacinamide serum before this one and I think I&#x27;m going back.  PS It absorbs really well and has a pleasant citrus smell  Update: This company has the best customer service! They contacted me to ask if I was happy with the product and gave me a refund without me even asking after I told them it wasn&#x27;t quite working out. Don&#x27;t be afraid to try their products. They make good stuff at a good price.</li>
            <li> It was kind of orange and from what I have researched is that it is to be clear somewhat.  This was really orange like it had been sitting for a while or a bad batch!  I didn&#x27;t even bother to use it. It just didn&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> I have been making natural skincare for ten years. This was before you could get wonderfully natural products that nurtured skin rather than stripping it and adding chemicals. Since I just recently found InstaNatural, I have come full circle. I study ingredients all the time, and they add all the things I would add to my own skincare, but there is no need to now. I have been testing the Vitamin C Serum for two weeks. I compared it with the best selling Vitamin C Serum on Amazon, and it won hands down for me. I am not barely 40, with a few wrinkles, but 67! Yes, it is orange in color, and smells like grapefruit, but I find that a refreshing scent. Instead of a watered down Serum, it is almost like a face cream. My face feels so soft after using it. I am also testing their Day and Night Cream. That this company gives full sized samples for reviews is great. How do you know if you like something if you don&#x27;t have more than enough for a night or two? I will continue to review and test these products.

            <li> Okay, I&#x27;m going to start by saying instanatural is a great brand. They&#x27;re not a &amp;#34;green washed&amp;#34; one. There are a few ingredients I wasn&#x27;t sure about, but I didn&#x27;t bother looking them up, so I could be wrong. I&#x27;ve never used their products before, so when I was offered this product to test and leave feedback on I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as price goes, this is a steal! The ingredients are top notch. I craft and sell skincare products (on a very small scale... And budget) I know the prices on most the ingredients and some are very expensive. So you&#x27;re getting a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this broke me out SO bad. I noticed rosehip oil was an ingredient, which makes me break out, but I was hoping in a blend of many other ingredients that it wouldn&#x27;t happen. I toughed it out for a week before stopping. (Just so you know, I tend to break out with a lot of things. If coconut oil even looks my way my skin morphs into a 13 year old boy&#x27;s.) Don&#x27;t discount this product unless you can relate to my skin woes! I ended up giving this to my mom and she is loving it. My one con- I don&#x27;t like the dropper. It comes out literally coated and dripping with the serum, and that makes it kind of messy and hard to get the right amount without getting too much/too little. It is a thick serum, so I know it&#x27;s pretty unavoidable. I wish the bottle came with a screw cap and a dropper just to apply. I don&#x27;t like capping bottles with dropper lids anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this in conjunction with the vitamin C moisturizer, and I left a pretty similar review on that as well. It&#x27;s just not the product for me, unfortunately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product provided for free for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product - I apply it in the morning after washing, while my face is still a bit damp. I use 4 drops and smooth it over my entire face - it absorbs very quickly and I only have to wait a minute or so before applying my BB cream. It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks so I can&#x27;t tell how it&#x27;s affecting my dark spots quite yet, but my skin looks beautiful in terms of smoothness and overall radiance. Even though it&#x27;s been a cold, dry winter my skin isn&#x27;t chapped like it normally is this time of year and I believe this serum has been a big part of that. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I having been using the serum for about a month and cannot yet see a noticeable difference. Of course one month is not that long a time and I can also report no negative effects.</li>
            <li> This product really delivers!  I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
            <li> Simply The best product!  Easy to use, effective and affordable,exactly I being looking for! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love this Vitamin C serum. I use it every other night, and alternate it with my prescription dermatology medicine. I discussed it with my dermatologist and she recommends using a Vitamin C serum in tandem with my other skin treatments and medicines and this is the one I love. The first bottle I bought at the end of September ran out at the end of the first week of February (about 4.5 months, using it every other day), not a bad ratio. Going to purchase again! Thanks for this great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum daily for a couple of weeks now and I can already see a difference in the firmness of my face. The serum is not greasy and goes on easily. I have also noticed the blackheads on my face have been reduced significantly. This has always been a major problem with my face. I received a free sample of this product for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Great product, love it</li>
            <li> This has helped me gain more energy.  Don&#x27;t wake up feeling groggy.  Gets me through the work day.</li>
            <li> Beautiful quality. Thick consistency so it doesn&#x27;t drip or run upon application. smooths and glides over your skin effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I love this brand so much! i have owned many things from them and there is never anything that doesn&#x27;t satisfy me! this is a great serum to keep your skin looking youthful and feeling great!</li>
            <li> Dries quickly. I love the citrus smell and once applies doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or sticky. I can see an improvement in my skin just from a couple days of use.</li>
            <li> I was totally amazed the way it made my face feel!! I was unsure at first but this product really works! I would reorder again. Anyone who wants their fine lines to start to disapesr they should try this awesome product</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am on my 3rd or 4th bottle!</li>
            <li> I have been working on getting my skin back in order after having babies and have tried several different vitamin C serums. This one is my favorite. There are quite a few wonderful ingredients in it, it makes my skin feel and look better, and the price is quite reasonable relative to similar products out there.</li>
            <li> Amazing smell great hopefully I see more results but good serum and I would recommended</li>
            <li> This serum has made a noticeable difference in the appearance of my facial skin.  My complexion is better, as well as helped with pores.</li>
            <li> This serum feels good on my face.  I have only had it a couple of weeks so would like to give it a bit longer before I say it works miracles.  My skin does feel tighter though and I am 46.</li>
            <li> I am new to Vitamin C Serum as a face treatment.  I purchased this because of the price and description.  I have used it steadily for a month, and I am pleased with the application ( and hopefully results) and I have re-ordered.</li>
            <li> The best vitamin c serum I have ever used. I use this along with a hyaluronic acid serum after washing my face in the morning and it leaves my face glowing.</li>
            <li> I am beginning to see results, after using this product for a short amount of time. My skin is beginning to become a more even, spot-free tone. Also it is brightening and glowing. Product gives invigorating tingle during use.</li>
            <li> Skin feels very soft and supple. Didn&#x27;t really notice any significant changes as far as diminished wrinkles yet but it has been only a couple of weeks so far since I started using it. Will post an update later if and when I notice changes.</li>
            <li> I always buy vitamin C serum from Obagi in my doctor and it is just great but I decided try  InstaNatural  after I read all the positive comments...  it is complete different, dry my skin and do not feel the same, it is just not good enough...</li>
            <li> The scent of this very orange and viscous serum was at first like vanilla and fresh orange juice.  A month after purchase it smells like very spoiled orange juice.  It absorbs fine but then leaves my skin oily shortly thereafter.</li>
            <li> I have purchased vitamin c products in the past and I have seen results within a month.  This product has not displayed the results I was looking for so therefore I cannot recommend it.  Sorry.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly, feels great and smells great too! I will add more info as I use it longer but definitely a product I would recommend trying.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great. There are some vitamin C serums that are super tacky, very potent smelling... this is neither. I dont know what others do, but I put it on at night and wake up with glowing skin, soft and supple. Great product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good in my skin best purchase that I ever made.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin feeling smooth and soft.  Nice scent!</li>
            <li> I love how bright my skin looks after using this serum for a month.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my face after a deep cleaning with my rotating brush before bed. When I first applied it my skin looked dull but In the morning my skin has a radiating glow that is noticed by all I encounter. I was offered this product  at a reduced price but this is a unbiased  review and it solely based upon my usage of this product. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Mine came colored orange.  I am disappointed.  From what I have read that means it&#x27;s no longer good.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a couple of weeks and really love it. I use it under my primer in the morning and under my moisturizer at night. I have seen an improvement in my skin and it seems firmer and more vibrant. I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have never used a vitamin C serum but this one  seems to do the job. Im young so I dont have any major issues.  It goes very nice under make up or without it. My mom works at a cosmetic surgery place and she tried this vitamin c serum and liked it.</li>
