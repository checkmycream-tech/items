            <li>Definitely a great runner-up.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>felt like smoothing on plastic and didn&#x27;t have great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great but was a bit gritty/ sandy feeling.  </li>

            <li>Lovely tinted primer - I use under mineral powder - great, flawless finish!</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s my kind of makeup!</li>
            <li>This is the most perfect product ever made!</li>
            <li>and I am fair.</li>
            <li>I feel good knowing</li>
            <li>maybe that color is good for some, for me it produces the dreaded line.  </li>
            <li>May be the product is good for some skin.</li>
            <li>Very light and feels good on my skin!</li>
            <li>I have gone without foundation most days now because this does a great job of evening out my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li>I rarely get break-outs when I wear this tinted primer alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as a primer, it&#x27;s not the best.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin with large pores around my nose area and this primer looks really great on me.</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>i love the stuff!</li>
            <li>At first I thought it looked too orange, but once I applied it, it blended in perfectly.</li>
            <li>it has lasted me for more than 5 hours!</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to this product, as I thought what could be better than having a sunscreen and a pore minimizer all in one?!?</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>when I&#x27;m in a hurry, which is quite often, this is my go to favorite make-up item!</li>
            <li>But I love how it feels!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this primer, it had to be awesome right?</li>
            <li>I was impressed by the positive reviews and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>This did a great job of minimizing them and this may sound far-fetched, but I had not one spot of shine on my face.</li>
            <li>This is a great light weight foundation, moisturizes and covers well.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s really nice on</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own too. ^_~</li>
            <li>think the packaging says something about you can use it on its own.</li>
            <li>I have a light complexion and noticeable pores in some areas, but this primer does a pretty good job of smoothing everything out and making my skin almost flawless.</li>
            <li>So worth it!!!</li>
            <li>Very natural and excellent make-up</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best tinted face creams I have tried!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it as a primary foundation or a primary sunscreen, but it perfectly fills a niche for a light, easy-to-apply weekend foundation that will provide a bit of sun protection and raven out my skin tone without looking like full-on make up.  </li>
            <li>I am 60 years old and this is the best primer I have ever used</li>
            <li>I had been given a tube many years ago by a coworker and did not realize how much I liked using it until it was gone.  </li>
            <li>It does go on very smoothly</li>
            <li>The feel and coverage of this product is very light and natural-looking but the sunscreen protection is invaluable.  </li>
            <li>The coverage is VERY light and will even out skin tone and minimize your pores but you will still need concealer for any imperfections like under eye circles or blemishes.</li>
            <li>We both love it.  </li>
            <li>: I don&#x27;t love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love this primer</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>i guess i like more of a matte feel when it comes to makeup.</li>
            <li>plus, it&#x27;s more of an orangey color.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love Philosophy products and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li>Assuming this does sheild you from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, its the best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>and it goes on so smooth!</li>
            <li>no make up look or for a more polished look when I am going out</li>
            <li>Love the coverage of this product.</li>
            <li>I most always wear this Philosophy tinted primer all by itself.  </li>
            <li>I have sunscreen on and even better</li>
            <li>I love that it evens out my skin tones and find myself going without make up more.</li>
            <li>I use this as a primer and love it....  </li>
            <li>Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many so-called pore minimizers, and this one and Dr.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tinted primer.</li>
            <li>I love philosophy products</li>
            <li>but this one is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff..</li>
            <li>There is nothing better.  </li>
            <li>I love philosophy products and wish they still made this one.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 4 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I love Philosophy&#x27;s skin care products, I decided to give this a try -</li>
            <li>(cliche for you free of charge!)  </li>
            <li>I even used this for evening wear by applying a matching powder, and I achieved a lovely matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it and will buy more.  </li>
            <li>it is my favorite Philosophy product.  </li>
            <li>I have been searching for this product in stores for more than a year since it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>that said, the texture of the product is lovely.</li>
            <li>i love philosophy products and i love a tinted moisturizer as i do not like a lot of makeup on my face</li>
            <li>Makes your face look as smooth as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>It keeps my foundation in place much more than without primer.</li>
            <li>My pants and top had to be thrown away.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I am satisfied with this product</li>
            <li>It doesnt make my skin look better, or help my makeup stay on longer.</li>
            <li>so i gladly handed her my tube of this.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the texture</li>
            <li>For winter season, I love it.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on, did the best overall job of meeting my objectives.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth &amp; has a nice, matte finish which is easy to apply make up over.</li>
            <li>is my skin care routine for beautiful and natural looking skin: After washing my face</li>
            <li>For my dry skin, I add moisturizer under this and get a flawless result.</li>
            <li>Smooth, sheer, evens skin tone, protects - excellent.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s very orange out of the tube, it seems to have no color at all on my face (which, to be fair is certainly better than orange).  </li>
            <li>The formula is light and tinted, making it a perfect choice for those who are looking for a simple alternative to foundation, BB creams, and tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I like to top it off with pressed powder to add just a touch more coverage and to seal the primer; the coverage is so light you can&#x27;t afford for it to fade throughout the day and</li>
            <li>love this stuff, goes on so silky and smoothed out my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, goes on light and doesn&#x27;t give you that cakey make up feel that heavier skin products leave.</li>
            <li>it can be used as a primer under foundation making it go on smoother and more evenly, or just alone as a really light foundation.  </li>
            <li>I love how it keeps my skin matte and smooth for hours, even after running in the Texas heat.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t believe how good it really is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really great foundation, very light on the skin, and covers and smooths pores instantly.  </li>
            <li>It makes your foundation go on so easily</li>
            <li>Easily applied.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER, I have to say that Philosophy Supernatural Poreless/Flawless Tinted Primer is so good that it is money well-spent.</li>
            <li>Dr. Brandts is higher priced and it does not have SPF15, which is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li>Not bad by any means, just not my favorite.</li>
            <li>Creates a smooth finish, and is easy to apply make up over.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive/fair skin, this product blends in easily and does not irritate my skin yet provides light coverage..</li>
            <li>I typically love this product, and have used it consistently for many years.</li>
            <li>Also blending is important, but it blends pretty smooth on its own.</li>
            <li>My skin did look nice in pictures and it does a good job of covering up flaws, but for the price I feel like there are better primers out there that feel less oily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is not at all effective in concealing large pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin doesn&#x27;t look any different wearing it which is surprising as I am very light skinned.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is pricey (and I have HUGE pores)</li>
            <li>People tell me I have good skin, but I know that if they only knew--my pores are huge!  </li>
            <li>Great with blush or simply on</li>
            <li>and it was smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li>But for real, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>One smooth, and we&#x27;re talking Ladies Man/Shaft/James Bond smooth, poreless face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make&#x27;s my face look so smooth.</li>
            <li>I do not have smooth skin</li>
            <li>After applying my face feels and appears smoother and the light tint does even out the color although it would not work as a foundation for me.</li>
            <li>I wish all make-up/skin care products fell this light.</li>
            <li>It feels so light airy and smooth yet it perfects the skin.</li>
            <li>I have also occasionally used it as a primer under my foundation with great results.</li>
            <li>this lotion is a fabulous wear alone sunscreen/makeup.  </li>
            <li>I hope it continues to be available.</li>
            <li>Light but smooth coverage, gives a&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;no</li>
            <li>rather it&#x27;s a light shade of orange.  </li>
            <li>I am a big fan of skin primers and have been searching for the absolute best.</li>
            <li>So for my money, this is THE best primer for big pores and it really does help my makeup stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Totally disappears like you&#x27;re not wearing anything but hides mild imperfections beautifully</li>
            <li>I will use this product until something better happens upon the scene, but for right now...</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is very nice, velvety and sheer.</li>
            <li>based on other reviews, i was expecting this to be incredible.</li>
            <li>Amazon never fails and gives me many options for purchasing things from multiple suppliers all at great prices.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes, I even just wear this product alone with a bit of mascara on the weekends because I&#x27;ve gained more confidence in my skins &#x27;natural&#x27; look :)</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Makes skin very smooth before foundation could even use without foundation smells good too fills in little lines and wrinkles covets redness will definitely reorder great product</li>
            <li>really wish I&#x27;d researched it more because what i got sucked.</li>
            <li>So sensitive I cannot wear almost any kind if sunblock.</li>
            <li>I love this product with my whole heart.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this Super Natural and loved it so much I turned around and bought another one!</li>
            <li>That said, idk if it is really doing much for my pores or wrinkles, also it&#x27;s pretty orange on my fair skin.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s not as great as the other product.</li>
            <li>if there were a lighter shade of this, i would happily buy it and forget about all other primers.</li>
            <li>/Flawless over my moisturizer for a clean fresh</li>
            <li>This stuff is clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>I have been using many Philosophy products for years but the Supernatural is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>I can use this product alone for quick coverage or under my mineral foundation.</li>
            <li>it also works nicely under bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li>I just love this product goes on your face lovely and smooth and is not heavy at all, looks natural on your face</li>
            <li>As a primer under powder foundation or for a slight bit of color with skin conditioner it is great.  </li>
            <li>This is my first time using a primer underneath a foundation, and after my friend recommended this, I see why she was stoked about it!  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s VERY LIGHT COVERAGE makes every day wear for a natural look ...</li>
            <li>I like the old, original shade better and this new formula does not go on as smooth</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and blends really well.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s no longer available in the UK.  </li>
            <li>I love this product have used it for a couple of years, feels so natural on the skin, no caking feeling.</li>
            <li>Feel your face right now.</li>
            <li>It blends right in.</li>
            <li>It did a wonderful job at minimizing pores and my skin had less breakouts overall.</li>
            <li>This is my first review on amazon and it really is because this product is so unique.</li>
            <li>I have bought a few different kinds and this has been the best.</li>
            <li>Lightly tinted, it applies smoothly and evenly and provides just enough coverage to enhance your skin without any greasiness or heaviness.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this primer to give it a try after Clinique discontinue the Pore Minimizer Instant Perfector, which for my super oily and large pores works great; and has nothing to do for large pores and oily skin.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need very much at all to make you that magazine</li>
            <li>My skin tone is very light with a yellow undertone, so I was concerned that the tint in this product would not match my skin&#x27;s tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft, decreases pore size, minimizes fine lines....  </li>
            <li>This requires two full minutes before application of make-up and it didn&#x27;t make a big difference in my fine lines</li>
            <li>My daughter bought this for me the first time.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different primers that claim to visibly reduce \\&quot;pores\\&quot; and the NEVER work.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li>With the same amount of investment, I can buy a much better product.</li>
            <li>The bottom of the tube split open and every time I had squeezed the tube it had squirted both out the bottom and the top.  </li>
            <li>First, let me say that I have acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say I am a seasoned bargain hunter.</li>
            <li>it really evens out skin tone, within minutes its like a miracle has happened!</li>
            <li>but this product breathes life in to my skin and gives it a fantastic natural color.</li>
            <li>A lot of trouble to go to, but I&#x27;ve searched for an alternative tinted primer and there&#x27;s nothing even remotely as good as this one.  </li>
            <li>Great and complete coverage for pores and slight lines.</li>
            <li>Applying this product doesn&#x27;t bring me any positive results.</li>
            <li>I have used this for a long time and it is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>On special occasions I wear it underneath my make-up and it makes my super dry skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a light, pore minimizing/ natural mattifying type of makeup.</li>
            <li>and I am confident that my skin looks better than any other tinted facial creams I have used.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Maybelline: pure silicon.</li>
            <li>and I have some large pores in my T-zone area.</li>
            <li>I know that not every product suits every person, but this one certainly works for me.</li>
            <li>It totally IS SUPERnatural!</li>
            <li>But thanks to Philosophy Supernatural Primer, no one need know!  </li>
            <li>It felt a bit too oily/greasy for my liking,  and as someone who already has rather oily skin, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the feeling as it only heightened my fear of looking like a grease ball.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It minimizes the appearance of my pores and evens out my skin tone, but feels very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>but it feels light and definitely reduces the appearance of pore size.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Very greasy going on.</li>
            <li>The color is very unnatural, too orange.</li>
            <li>but I wear it daily as light makeup.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However I do not think that it lasts very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smooth and sheer, but not non comedogenic.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I just got this, and it works really well.</li>
            <li>It makes my makeup go on so much smoother.</li>
            <li>well, it did not have much effect as said in website.</li>
            <li>I dont really find how this primes your skin for makeup.</li>
            <li>For summer, I don&#x27;t like it too much.</li>
            <li>It blurs fine lines, evens out your skin tone, provides a smooth surface for any other makeup application, and has a natural sunscreen that does not make my skin freak out.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than the other two.</li>
            <li>I love their exfoliating mask and other products.</li>
            <li>Supernatural is normally very silky in consistency.</li>
            <li>I received this in a Philosophy Special several years ago.  </li>
            <li>Love the slight tint also.</li>
            <li>I like to use a product with moisture for my dry skin, but with a light tint.</li>
            <li>At 56, less is more and the coverage makes pores disappear.</li>
            <li>the Supernatural: Winner.</li>
            <li>Have been using supernatural for about two years.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product to use as a primer for under the supernatural airbrush canvas powder.</li>
            <li>I apply Supernatural Poreless</li>
            <li>Just my supernatural and some Chapstick...</li>
            <li>The only thing that could make it better is if they would package it in a larger tube.</li>
            <li>I love it, and it is the only such cream that has ever worked for me!</li>
            <li>It worked well as a primer, and it did a decent job of hiding my pores (wouldn&#x27;t say I looked &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; however).</li>
            <li>My mother and I have been using Supernatural for years.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I even got a compliment from a friend last night on how pretty my make up looked!</li>
            <li>Even for $30, the product comes in a relatively large bottle and is such great quality that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>A real natural look for the face and the SPF is a bonus.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores in the way that most spf containing products do and it seems to last all day long.</li>
            <li>When applying liquid foundation, i can feel the resistance of the foundation being saturated into the primer, rather than the ease that it normally takes to rub foundation in.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased with it that I plan to use it year round.</li>
            <li>My skin still remained oily after a few hours when I wore foundation and powder over the top.</li>
            <li>But on normal mornings I wear it alone as my make-up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 years old with medium skin (not oily or dry) with light wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has been discontinued or something new has taken its place on the shelves</li>
            <li>I may need to find a new product.</li>
            <li>The tint is very natural with no orangey look to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for a year or more, and usually wear it alone - not as a primer.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still better than several other face primers I have tried.</li>
            <li>Transforms my face - soft and silky!</li>
            <li>not only is this better for her skin than any other drug store brand, it also has spf.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face feeling soft, not heavy and for decent skin, you can wear it alone like a BB cream or tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>This primer is really small, and works reasonably well, but isn&#x27;t as amazing as I expected for the price.</li>
            <li>I use Take A Breath by Philosophy as my moisturizer, Eye Hope by Philosophy as my eye cream, Bare Minerals as my concealer, Supernatural by Philosophy as my foundation/primer/sunscreen, and then finish it off with MAC pressed powder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Medium pores maybe, but I have several large pores on my nose</li>
            <li>My skin still needs powder foundation over top, but this provides a nice base.</li>
            <li>I think product I purchased was old.</li>
            <li>It is a bit orange(I&#x27;d say, peachy), as some reviewers indicated, but only if too much is used.</li>
            <li>It is natural looking and hides pores.</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so soft and makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>well... NATURAL.  </li>
            <li>also, my 11 year old has been bugging me to wear makeup.</li>
            <li>It goes on like silk, seriously soft.</li>
            <li>I have a basic medium skin and this &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; is much to peachy/orange for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Philosophy&#x27;s The Present in the past and thought I&#x27;d give this a try since it has the SPF, but going forward</li>
            <li>That being said, Philosophy Supernatural has actually minimized my pores.</li>
            <li>and i would bet this would be fabulous on younger less damaged skin.</li>
            <li>again, pure silicon but three times the price of the Maybelline and not only didn&#x27;t work well but didn&#x27;t work well with my moisturizer - created a white residue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very strange, as all the other Philosophy products are available in the UK but not this one.</li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind</li>
            <li>did and INSTANTLY my pores were visibly a whole smaller</li>
            <li>This is a quick way to lesson any uneven skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I, oddly enough do not prefer to wear a lot of make up and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It does not cover large pores as I expected</li>
            <li>but my face and neck are clearly just different colors.</li>
            <li>It leaves a definite velvety feeling on the skin, which some seem to like, but doesn&#x27;t feel natural to me.  </li>
            <li>This really smooths my complexion and tones down any ruddiness.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money because you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a primer that would help fill in fine lines, smooth out pores, and create a natural-looking base for my make-up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good primer, but too bad it doesn&#x27;t have SPF.</li>
            <li>The reviews about this product were of two types:  amazing or scathing.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> It&#x27;s  perfect for the summer!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fortunately, it matches my skin perfectly.  </li>
            <li> ha.... FLAWLESS.</li>
            <li> and I was very impressed.  </li>
            <li> Glides on and creates a perfect canvas for your makeup.</li>
            <li> i have very fair olive colored skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky and beautiful.</li>
            <li> It covers pores and just makes a beautiful canvas for applying makeup .  </li>
            <li> Definitely a great runner-up.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> felt like smoothing on plastic and didn&#x27;t have great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great but was a bit gritty/ sandy feeling.  </li>
            <li> looks great with this underneath it</li>
            <li> The color is peach, not orange but it blends into my skin great</li>
            <li> Great feeling under your makeup.  </li>
            <li> Great primer for smoothing over pores and wrinkles</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  </li>
            <li> i am blessed with great skin, so this and some mascara and im on my way.</li>
            <li> Would recomend to anyone, has great sun protection.</li>
            <li> My skin looks great all day.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  </li>
            <li> It has an SPF and primes my make-up very nice.</li>
            <li> Lovely tinted primer - I use under mineral powder - great, flawless finish!</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s my kind of makeup!</li>
            <li> This is the most perfect product ever made!</li>
            <li> and I am fair.</li>
            <li> I feel good knowing</li>
            <li> maybe that color is good for some, for me it produces the dreaded line.  </li>
            <li> May be the product is good for some skin.</li>
            <li> Very light and feels good on my skin!</li>
            <li> I have gone without foundation most days now because this does a great job of evening out my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> I rarely get break-outs when I wear this tinted primer alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as a primer, it&#x27;s not the best.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with large pores around my nose area and this primer looks really great on me.</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> i love the stuff!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it looked too orange, but once I applied it, it blended in perfectly.</li>
            <li> it has lasted me for more than 5 hours!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this product, as I thought what could be better than having a sunscreen and a pore minimizer all in one?!?</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> when I&#x27;m in a hurry, which is quite often, this is my go to favorite make-up item!</li>
            <li> But I love how it feels!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this primer, it had to be awesome right?</li>
            <li> I was impressed by the positive reviews and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> This did a great job of minimizing them and this may sound far-fetched, but I had not one spot of shine on my face.</li>
            <li> This is a great light weight foundation, moisturizes and covers well.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s really nice on</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own too. ^_~</li>
            <li> think the packaging says something about you can use it on its own.</li>
            <li> I have a light complexion and noticeable pores in some areas, but this primer does a pretty good job of smoothing everything out and making my skin almost flawless.</li>
            <li> So worth it!!!</li>
            <li> Very natural and excellent make-up</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best tinted face creams I have tried!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as a primary foundation or a primary sunscreen, but it perfectly fills a niche for a light, easy-to-apply weekend foundation that will provide a bit of sun protection and raven out my skin tone without looking like full-on make up.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and this is the best primer I have ever used</li>
            <li> I had been given a tube many years ago by a coworker and did not realize how much I liked using it until it was gone.  </li>
            <li> It does go on very smoothly</li>
            <li> The feel and coverage of this product is very light and natural-looking but the sunscreen protection is invaluable.  </li>
            <li> The coverage is VERY light and will even out skin tone and minimize your pores but you will still need concealer for any imperfections like under eye circles or blemishes.</li>
            <li> We both love it.  </li>
            <li> : I don&#x27;t love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love this primer</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> i guess i like more of a matte feel when it comes to makeup.</li>
            <li> plus, it&#x27;s more of an orangey color.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Love Philosophy products and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> Assuming this does sheild you from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, its the best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> and it goes on so smooth!</li>
            <li> no make up look or for a more polished look when I am going out</li>
            <li> Love the coverage of this product.</li>
            <li> I most always wear this Philosophy tinted primer all by itself.  </li>
            <li> I have sunscreen on and even better</li>
            <li> I love that it evens out my skin tones and find myself going without make up more.</li>
            <li> I use this as a primer and love it....  </li>
            <li> Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many so-called pore minimizers, and this one and Dr.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tinted primer.</li>
            <li> I love philosophy products</li>
            <li> but this one is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff..</li>
            <li> There is nothing better.  </li>
            <li> I love philosophy products and wish they still made this one.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 4 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I love Philosophy&#x27;s skin care products, I decided to give this a try -</li>
            <li> (cliche for you free of charge!)  </li>
            <li> I even used this for evening wear by applying a matching powder, and I achieved a lovely matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it and will buy more.  </li>
            <li> it is my favorite Philosophy product.  </li>
            <li> I have been searching for this product in stores for more than a year since it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> that said, the texture of the product is lovely.</li>
            <li> i love philosophy products and i love a tinted moisturizer as i do not like a lot of makeup on my face</li>
            <li> Makes your face look as smooth as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> It keeps my foundation in place much more than without primer.</li>
            <li> My pants and top had to be thrown away.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> It doesnt make my skin look better, or help my makeup stay on longer.</li>
            <li> so i gladly handed her my tube of this.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the texture</li>
            <li> For winter season, I love it.</li>
            <li> Easy to put on, did the best overall job of meeting my objectives.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth &amp; has a nice, matte finish which is easy to apply make up over.</li>
            <li> is my skin care routine for beautiful and natural looking skin: After washing my face</li>
            <li> For my dry skin, I add moisturizer under this and get a flawless result.</li>
            <li> Smooth, sheer, evens skin tone, protects - excellent.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s very orange out of the tube, it seems to have no color at all on my face (which, to be fair is certainly better than orange).  </li>
            <li> The formula is light and tinted, making it a perfect choice for those who are looking for a simple alternative to foundation, BB creams, and tinted moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I like to top it off with pressed powder to add just a touch more coverage and to seal the primer; the coverage is so light you can&#x27;t afford for it to fade throughout the day and</li>
            <li> love this stuff, goes on so silky and smoothed out my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, goes on light and doesn&#x27;t give you that cakey make up feel that heavier skin products leave.</li>
            <li> it can be used as a primer under foundation making it go on smoother and more evenly, or just alone as a really light foundation.  </li>
            <li> I love how it keeps my skin matte and smooth for hours, even after running in the Texas heat.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t believe how good it really is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really great foundation, very light on the skin, and covers and smooths pores instantly.  </li>
            <li> It makes your foundation go on so easily</li>
            <li> Easily applied.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER, I have to say that Philosophy Supernatural Poreless/Flawless Tinted Primer is so good that it is money well-spent.</li>
            <li> Dr. Brandts is higher priced and it does not have SPF15, which is a nice bonus.  </li>
            <li> Not bad by any means, just not my favorite.</li>
            <li> Creates a smooth finish, and is easy to apply make up over.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive/fair skin, this product blends in easily and does not irritate my skin yet provides light coverage..</li>
            <li> I typically love this product, and have used it consistently for many years.</li>
            <li> Also blending is important, but it blends pretty smooth on its own.</li>
            <li> My skin did look nice in pictures and it does a good job of covering up flaws, but for the price I feel like there are better primers out there that feel less oily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not at all effective in concealing large pores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t look any different wearing it which is surprising as I am very light skinned.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is pricey (and I have HUGE pores)</li>
            <li> People tell me I have good skin, but I know that if they only knew--my pores are huge!  </li>
            <li> Great with blush or simply on</li>
            <li> and it was smooth as silk.  </li>
            <li> But for real, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> One smooth, and we&#x27;re talking Ladies Man/Shaft/James Bond smooth, poreless face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make&#x27;s my face look so smooth.</li>
            <li> I do not have smooth skin</li>
            <li> After applying my face feels and appears smoother and the light tint does even out the color although it would not work as a foundation for me.</li>
            <li> I wish all make-up/skin care products fell this light.</li>
            <li> It feels so light airy and smooth yet it perfects the skin.</li>
            <li> I have also occasionally used it as a primer under my foundation with great results.</li>
            <li> this lotion is a fabulous wear alone sunscreen/makeup.  </li>
            <li> I hope it continues to be available.</li>
            <li> Light but smooth coverage, gives a&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;no</li>
            <li> rather it&#x27;s a light shade of orange.  </li>
            <li> I am a big fan of skin primers and have been searching for the absolute best.</li>
            <li> So for my money, this is THE best primer for big pores and it really does help my makeup stay in place.  </li>
            <li> Totally disappears like you&#x27;re not wearing anything but hides mild imperfections beautifully</li>
            <li> I will use this product until something better happens upon the scene, but for right now...</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is very nice, velvety and sheer.</li>
            <li> based on other reviews, i was expecting this to be incredible.</li>
            <li> Amazon never fails and gives me many options for purchasing things from multiple suppliers all at great prices.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes, I even just wear this product alone with a bit of mascara on the weekends because I&#x27;ve gained more confidence in my skins &#x27;natural&#x27; look :)</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Makes skin very smooth before foundation could even use without foundation smells good too fills in little lines and wrinkles covets redness will definitely reorder great product</li>
            <li> really wish I&#x27;d researched it more because what i got sucked.</li>
            <li> So sensitive I cannot wear almost any kind if sunblock.</li>
            <li> I love this product with my whole heart.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Super Natural and loved it so much I turned around and bought another one!</li>
            <li> That said, idk if it is really doing much for my pores or wrinkles, also it&#x27;s pretty orange on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not as great as the other product.</li>
            <li> if there were a lighter shade of this, i would happily buy it and forget about all other primers.</li>
            <li> /Flawless over my moisturizer for a clean fresh</li>
            <li> This stuff is clean and fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> I have been using many Philosophy products for years but the Supernatural is one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I can use this product alone for quick coverage or under my mineral foundation.</li>
            <li> it also works nicely under bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li> I just love this product goes on your face lovely and smooth and is not heavy at all, looks natural on your face</li>
            <li> As a primer under powder foundation or for a slight bit of color with skin conditioner it is great.  </li>
            <li> This is my first time using a primer underneath a foundation, and after my friend recommended this, I see why she was stoked about it!  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s VERY LIGHT COVERAGE makes every day wear for a natural look ...</li>
            <li> I like the old, original shade better and this new formula does not go on as smooth</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and blends really well.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s no longer available in the UK.  </li>
            <li> I love this product have used it for a couple of years, feels so natural on the skin, no caking feeling.</li>
            <li> Feel your face right now.</li>
            <li> It blends right in.</li>
            <li> It did a wonderful job at minimizing pores and my skin had less breakouts overall.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on amazon and it really is because this product is so unique.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few different kinds and this has been the best.</li>
            <li> Lightly tinted, it applies smoothly and evenly and provides just enough coverage to enhance your skin without any greasiness or heaviness.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this primer to give it a try after Clinique discontinue the Pore Minimizer Instant Perfector, which for my super oily and large pores works great; and has nothing to do for large pores and oily skin.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need very much at all to make you that magazine</li>
            <li> My skin tone is very light with a yellow undertone, so I was concerned that the tint in this product would not match my skin&#x27;s tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft, decreases pore size, minimizes fine lines....  </li>
            <li> This requires two full minutes before application of make-up and it didn&#x27;t make a big difference in my fine lines</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for me the first time.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different primers that claim to visibly reduce \\&quot;pores\\&quot; and the NEVER work.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> With the same amount of investment, I can buy a much better product.</li>
            <li> The bottom of the tube split open and every time I had squeezed the tube it had squirted both out the bottom and the top.  </li>
            <li> First, let me say that I have acne and oily skin.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I am a seasoned bargain hunter.</li>
            <li> it really evens out skin tone, within minutes its like a miracle has happened!</li>
            <li> but this product breathes life in to my skin and gives it a fantastic natural color.</li>
            <li> A lot of trouble to go to, but I&#x27;ve searched for an alternative tinted primer and there&#x27;s nothing even remotely as good as this one.  </li>
            <li> Great and complete coverage for pores and slight lines.</li>
            <li> Applying this product doesn&#x27;t bring me any positive results.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and it is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> On special occasions I wear it underneath my make-up and it makes my super dry skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a light, pore minimizing/ natural mattifying type of makeup.</li>
            <li> and I am confident that my skin looks better than any other tinted facial creams I have used.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Maybelline: pure silicon.</li>
            <li> and I have some large pores in my T-zone area.</li>
            <li> I know that not every product suits every person, but this one certainly works for me.</li>
            <li> It totally IS SUPERnatural!</li>
            <li> But thanks to Philosophy Supernatural Primer, no one need know!  </li>
            <li> It felt a bit too oily/greasy for my liking,  and as someone who already has rather oily skin, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the feeling as it only heightened my fear of looking like a grease ball.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It minimizes the appearance of my pores and evens out my skin tone, but feels very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> but it feels light and definitely reduces the appearance of pore size.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Very greasy going on.</li>
            <li> The color is very unnatural, too orange.</li>
            <li> but I wear it daily as light makeup.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However I do not think that it lasts very long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smooth and sheer, but not non comedogenic.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I just got this, and it works really well.</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup go on so much smoother.</li>
            <li> well, it did not have much effect as said in website.</li>
            <li> I dont really find how this primes your skin for makeup.</li>
            <li> For summer, I don&#x27;t like it too much.</li>
            <li> It blurs fine lines, evens out your skin tone, provides a smooth surface for any other makeup application, and has a natural sunscreen that does not make my skin freak out.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better than the other two.</li>
            <li> I love their exfoliating mask and other products.</li>
            <li> Supernatural is normally very silky in consistency.</li>
            <li> I received this in a Philosophy Special several years ago.  </li>
            <li> Love the slight tint also.</li>
            <li> I like to use a product with moisture for my dry skin, but with a light tint.</li>
            <li> At 56, less is more and the coverage makes pores disappear.</li>
            <li> the Supernatural: Winner.</li>
            <li> Have been using supernatural for about two years.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use as a primer for under the supernatural airbrush canvas powder.</li>
            <li> I apply Supernatural Poreless</li>
            <li> Just my supernatural and some Chapstick...</li>
            <li> The only thing that could make it better is if they would package it in a larger tube.</li>
            <li> I love it, and it is the only such cream that has ever worked for me!</li>
            <li> It worked well as a primer, and it did a decent job of hiding my pores (wouldn&#x27;t say I looked &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; however).</li>
            <li> My mother and I have been using Supernatural for years.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I even got a compliment from a friend last night on how pretty my make up looked!</li>
            <li> Even for $30, the product comes in a relatively large bottle and is such great quality that a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A real natural look for the face and the SPF is a bonus.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores in the way that most spf containing products do and it seems to last all day long.</li>
            <li> When applying liquid foundation, i can feel the resistance of the foundation being saturated into the primer, rather than the ease that it normally takes to rub foundation in.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased with it that I plan to use it year round.</li>
            <li> My skin still remained oily after a few hours when I wore foundation and powder over the top.</li>
            <li> But on normal mornings I wear it alone as my make-up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 years old with medium skin (not oily or dry) with light wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it has been discontinued or something new has taken its place on the shelves</li>
            <li> I may need to find a new product.</li>
            <li> The tint is very natural with no orangey look to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a year or more, and usually wear it alone - not as a primer.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still better than several other face primers I have tried.</li>
            <li> Transforms my face - soft and silky!</li>
            <li> not only is this better for her skin than any other drug store brand, it also has spf.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face feeling soft, not heavy and for decent skin, you can wear it alone like a BB cream or tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> This primer is really small, and works reasonably well, but isn&#x27;t as amazing as I expected for the price.</li>
            <li> I use Take A Breath by Philosophy as my moisturizer, Eye Hope by Philosophy as my eye cream, Bare Minerals as my concealer, Supernatural by Philosophy as my foundation/primer/sunscreen, and then finish it off with MAC pressed powder.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Medium pores maybe, but I have several large pores on my nose</li>
            <li> My skin still needs powder foundation over top, but this provides a nice base.</li>
            <li> I think product I purchased was old.</li>
            <li> It is a bit orange(I&#x27;d say, peachy), as some reviewers indicated, but only if too much is used.</li>
            <li> It is natural looking and hides pores.</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so soft and makes your skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> well... NATURAL.  </li>
            <li> also, my 11 year old has been bugging me to wear makeup.</li>
            <li> It goes on like silk, seriously soft.</li>
            <li> I have a basic medium skin and this &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; is much to peachy/orange for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Philosophy&#x27;s The Present in the past and thought I&#x27;d give this a try since it has the SPF, but going forward</li>
            <li> That being said, Philosophy Supernatural has actually minimized my pores.</li>
            <li> and i would bet this would be fabulous on younger less damaged skin.</li>
            <li> again, pure silicon but three times the price of the Maybelline and not only didn&#x27;t work well but didn&#x27;t work well with my moisturizer - created a white residue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very strange, as all the other Philosophy products are available in the UK but not this one.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind</li>
            <li> did and INSTANTLY my pores were visibly a whole smaller</li>
            <li> This is a quick way to lesson any uneven skin tones.  </li>
            <li> I, oddly enough do not prefer to wear a lot of make up and have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It does not cover large pores as I expected</li>
            <li> but my face and neck are clearly just different colors.</li>
            <li> It leaves a definite velvety feeling on the skin, which some seem to like, but doesn&#x27;t feel natural to me.  </li>
            <li> This really smooths my complexion and tones down any ruddiness.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money because you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a primer that would help fill in fine lines, smooth out pores, and create a natural-looking base for my make-up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good primer, but too bad it doesn&#x27;t have SPF.</li>
            <li> The reviews about this product were of two types:  amazing or scathing.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the tube lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> The cream is very caky, even a small amount.</li>
            <li> One day I was putting this on in the car in the dark on the way to an early morning meeting.  </li>
            <li> I was a complete mess.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a long time and won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as a makeup base.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product for those who just need a little daily cover-up with SPF!</li>
            <li> But be prepared to use a little bare minerals over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, did I mention it lasts forever?</li>
            <li> she feels &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;, and i dont feel bad about letting her wear &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34;, :)</li>
            <li> Just be careful as the quality control on the tubes is suspect.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected from description and Philosphy.</li>
            <li> Smooths lines, blurs pores, provides nice, even base for foundation or powder.</li>
            <li> A lot of foundations are either too yellow or too pale on me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how it stacks up against other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of primer too</li>
            <li> I threw it away because after trying several times I have no incentive to waste my time given I already wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Contains no irritants as other products seem to for my average skin type.</li>
            <li> The sad thing is I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> I hate looking \\&quot;made up\\&quot; so I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Too thick and left my face oily.</li>
            <li> Hands down</li>
            <li> i can blend it down</li>
            <li> I am 37 and have typical was-out-in-the-sun-my-whole-life skin</li>
            <li> less oily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sad fact is, this product \\&quot;pills\\&quot; up when you use the Supernatural Foundation.  </li>
            <li> No matter what primer I have ever used (MAC, Smashbox), I usually end up with at least one break out by the end of the day if I wear it constantly.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the &amp;#34;one-size-fits-all&amp;#34; tint to the cream.</li>
            <li> can wear it alone with a little powder</li>
            <li> It looks a little orange coming out of the tube, but somehow it never looks orange on my skin.</li>
            <li> yourself a little, and buy some of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Rigid, Bumpy, uneven?</li>
            <li> I have this and also something called NYC porelessprimer I bought for a few dollars at Target.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kind an orange, and under the sun looks awful.</li>
            <li> In winter, I add a few drops of foundation.  </li>
            <li> Some points for the SPF, but feels like a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to the former which just gives my face a very subtle &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> but I usually use a little foundation.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that this primer would really work as stated.</li>
            <li> It smoothed over my skin and covered some small discolorations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 72 and have my share of small wrinkles...smile and frown lines.  </li>
            <li> I think that the NYC one works just as well, if not better...</li>
            <li> It goes a long way, so if you consider the price-per-use, it&#x27;s actually not that outrageous -- especially given the fact that the results are fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I hate sunscreen and never wear any even though I know I should, until now.</li>
            <li> Not suitable for I think any skin tone.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m sad that i spent A LOT of money on this</li>
            <li> it is expensive for the little results I got from using  it.  </li>
            <li> unfortunately, it&#x27;s getting hard to find.  </li>
            <li> I hate everything about facial makeup</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very greasy and horrible.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed given previous reviews.</li>
            <li> The consistency was mushy and weird.</li>
            <li> Philosophy seems to have this one wrong.</li>
            <li> but, in my opinion, it feels weird on my face.</li>
            <li> , well it&#x27;s expensive..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am a diehard Philosophy fan.  </li>
            <li> Wanted a touch of color on my face with no time for complicated powder foundation.  </li>
            <li> Obsessed with it and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Just disappointed that I can no longer receive automatic shipment.</li>
            <li> Use this as a base.</li>
            <li> However, if you don&#x27;t lilke the silicon base, I would not recommand this product.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base, and put my powder makeup over it.  </li>
            <li> Hated this.</li>
            <li> : I hated this.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So I bought this product a couple weeks ago on a whim. I&#x27;ve heard so many good things about this primer, it had to be awesome right? WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I&#x27;d researched it more because what i got sucked. The consistency was mushy and weird. It made my oily/acne prone skin feel clogged. The sad thing is I really wanted to like this product. I gave it like five freaking shots. I npaired it with my Mufe foundation it was gross. Then I tried it with some Mac it was even worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing this foundation is NOT for African American skin. Gave it to my girlfriend, hoping she&#x27;d make use of it, she didnt like it either. Made her look chalky.</li>
            <li> Hated this. Cake like and gross feel on skin. DO NOT BUY</li>
            <li> My daughter bought this for me the first time.  We both love it.  It makes your foundation go on so easily but it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.  To our dismay it is no longer being carried in the stores in our area.  I don&#x27;t know if it has been discontinued or something new has taken its place on the shelves but this primer is just wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of skin primers and have been searching for the absolute best. I did a test of the following primers on my skin at the same time:&lt;br /&gt;- Chanel - Le Blanc de Chanel Sheer Illuminator&lt;br /&gt;- Philosophy - the Present&lt;br /&gt;- Philosophy - the Supernatural&lt;br /&gt;- Maybelline New York Instant Age Rewind&lt;br /&gt;- DHC Velvet Skin Coat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 43 years old with medium skin (not oily or dry) with light wrinkles. I was looking for a primer that would help fill in fine lines, smooth out pores, and create a natural-looking base for my make-up. Here are the results I found, in ranked order:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Philosophy the Supernatural: Winner. Easy to put on, did the best overall job of meeting my objectives. Very natural and excellent make-up base.&lt;br /&gt;2. Chanel: Silicon-free, which I appreciate. Definitely a great runner-up.&lt;br /&gt;3. Philosophy the Present: I don&#x27;t love this stuff but it&#x27;s better than the other two. This requires two full minutes before application of make-up and it didn&#x27;t make a big difference in my fine lines&lt;br /&gt;4. Maybelline: pure silicon. felt like smoothing on plastic and didn&#x27;t have great results.&lt;br /&gt;5. DHC Velvet Skin Coat: I hated this. again, pure silicon but three times the price of the Maybelline and not only didn&#x27;t work well but didn&#x27;t work well with my moisturizer - created a white residue.</li>
            <li> Have been using supernatural for about two years.  It&#x27;s a really great foundation, very light on the skin, and covers and smooths pores instantly.  Great with blush or simply on it&#x27;s own. A real natural look for the face and the SPF is a bonus.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I hate looking \\&quot;made up\\&quot; so I love this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for a year or more, and usually wear it alone - not as a primer.  It minimizes the appearance of my pores and evens out my skin tone, but feels very lightweight.  It literally glides on.  A little goes a long way, so the tube lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Totally disappears like you&#x27;re not wearing anything but hides mild imperfections beautifully</li>
            <li> Works great but was a bit gritty/ sandy feeling.  Went to local store to purchase another and it was smooth as silk.  I think product I purchased was old.</li>
            <li> I love this primer I use it all the time and my make-up looks great with this underneath it or it&#x27;s really nice on it&#x27;s own too. ^_~</li>
            <li> Hey, Have you ever felt silk? Have you ever felt your face and thought, dang yo, who dat? Now, I&#x27;m not a fan of comparing my facial skin to baby bottoms because it seems to encourage the feeling of baby bottoms. But for real, this stuff is amazing. Feel your face right now. How does it feel?  Rigid, Bumpy, uneven? Get this stuff. You put it on and everything becomes one. One smooth, and we&#x27;re talking Ladies Man/Shaft/James Bond smooth, poreless face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the packaging says something about you can use it on its own. Philosophy seems to have this one wrong. Use this as a base. Use this as an SPF. Use this as a pore even-outer. But be prepared to use a little bare minerals over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, did I mention it lasts forever? Because it almost does. I had a tube for ages. You don&#x27;t need very much at all to make you that magazine even you know you want. So maybe you should buy it. You might as well.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s silky and beautiful. Easily applied.  Matches my skin tone.  Just love it.</li>
            <li> Lovely tinted primer - I use under mineral powder - great, flawless finish!</li>
            <li> based on other reviews, i was expecting this to be incredible. but, in my opinion, it feels weird on my face. i guess i like more of a matte feel when it comes to makeup. plus, it&#x27;s more of an orangey color. i&#x27;m sad that i spent A LOT of money on this and now i won&#x27;t use it...</li>
            <li> I have never tried a primer before so I can&#x27;t say how it stacks up against other brands but it feels light and definitely reduces the appearance of pore size.  I&#x27;ve won it alone and with foundation.  I even got a compliment from a friend last night on how pretty my make up looked!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good as a makeup base. However, if you don&#x27;t lilke the silicon base, I would not recommand this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product have used it for a couple of years, feels so natural on the skin, no caking feeling. Make&#x27;s my face look so smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I do not have smooth skin and I have some large pores in my T-zone area. After applying my face feels and appears smoother and the light tint does even out the color although it would not work as a foundation for me. I purchased this product to use as a primer for under the supernatural airbrush canvas powder. I almost like this primer without the powder even on it... but seem to apply the powder anyway. I am 37 and have typical was-out-in-the-sun-my-whole-life skin and i would bet this would be fabulous on younger less damaged skin. I will use this product until something better happens upon the scene, but for right now... i love the stuff!</li>
            <li> At first I thought it looked too orange, but once I applied it, it blended in perfectly. Creates a smooth finish, and is easy to apply make up over. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Makes skin very smooth before foundation could even use without foundation smells good too fills in little lines and wrinkles covets redness will definitely reorder great product</li>
            <li> I have been using many Philosophy products for years but the Supernatural is one of my favorites. I hate everything about facial makeup but this stuff is perfect. The color is peach, not orange but it blends into my skin great and I am fair. It leaves your face feeling soft, not heavy and for decent skin, you can wear it alone like a BB cream or tinted moisturizer. This is a product I have not been without for going on 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Current April 2016 price at Philosophy is $30 but it can often be found for under $20 on sale..</li>
            <li> Love Philosophy products and this does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> First off, let me say that I hate sunscreen and never wear any even though I know I should, until now. Assuming this does sheild you from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays, its the best facial sunscreen I&#x27;ve tried. Goes on smooth &amp; has a nice, matte finish which is easy to apply make up over. That said, idk if it is really doing much for my pores or wrinkles, also it&#x27;s pretty orange on my fair skin.</li>
            <li> Its not a primer its just a sunscreen!</li>
            <li> I have used many different primers that claim to visibly reduce \\&quot;pores\\&quot; and the NEVER work. This stuff is pricey (and I have HUGE pores) so I though, well it&#x27;s expensive.. but why not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did and INSTANTLY my pores were visibly a whole smaller and it goes on so smooth! it has lasted me for more than 5 hours! So worth it!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Philosophy products for about 4 years now.  I apply Supernatural Poreless/Flawless over my moisturizer for a clean fresh no make up look or for a more polished look when I am going out I apply my foundation on over it...it makes my make up look flawless!  I&#x27;ve tried other brands of primer too but I come back to this one it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing make up...love it!</li>
            <li> Love the coverage of this product. Contains no irritants as other products seem to for my average skin type.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive/fair skin, this product blends in easily and does not irritate my skin yet provides light coverage..</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and visible pores. This did a great job of minimizing them and this may sound far-fetched, but I had not one spot of shine on my face. I even accidentally fell asleep wearing it and got up the next morning with no oilyness. This stuff is such a confidence booster. It is a bit orange(I&#x27;d say, peachy), as some reviewers indicated, but only if too much is used. Also blending is important, but it blends pretty smooth on its own. Thats why it goes with any skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;Im going to buy some for my mom now and definately will keep coming back. Hope this review helped someone.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best tinted face creams I have tried! Love the slight tint also. I have gone without foundation most days now because this does a great job of evening out my skin tone and texture.</li>
            <li> Smooths lines, blurs pores, provides nice, even base for foundation or powder. If they ever stop making it I will die.</li>
            <li> This primer is really small, and works reasonably well, but isn&#x27;t as amazing as I expected for the price. I was a bit disappointed given previous reviews.</li>
            <li> I put this on if I&#x27;m going out on the town or if I&#x27;m in my workout clothes. It is natural looking and hides pores. It is quite pricey but I use it daily and it has lasted months. love-love!!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am a diehard Philosophy fan.  Just look in my makeup bag(s).  I was looking forward to this product, as I thought what could be better than having a sunscreen and a pore minimizer all in one?!? The sad fact is, this product \\&quot;pills\\&quot; up when you use the Supernatural Foundation.  Now, doesn&#x27;t that just knock your hat in the creek?  Yeah.  Sharon Perkins, Cordele, GA</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, goes on light and doesn&#x27;t give you that cakey make up feel that heavier skin products leave.</li>
            <li> I like to use a product with moisture for my dry skin, but with a light tint. I most always wear this Philosophy tinted primer all by itself.  I was impressed by the positive reviews and wanted to try it. I had never bought a Philosophy product before.  This Supernatral Poreless/Flawless Tinted Primer was just that:  Flawless.  It smoothed over my skin and covered some small discolorations. It felt like silk going on my skin. It didn&#x27;t make my wrinkles or pore stand out. I&#x27;m 72 and have my share of small wrinkles...smile and frown lines.  All were covered by this primer. I wear it alone every day and couldn&#x27;t be  happier.!!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it is advertised to do. The only problem I had with it is that it is rather oily, so I have to put translucent powder on after...not a big deal. BUT, the &#x27;tint&#x27; in this product is actually alot more...orange than I was expecting. I can work with it, just beware.</li>
            <li> I wish all make-up/skin care products fell this light. This stuff is clean and fresh feeling. I don&#x27;t feel like I am caking my pores with goop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Caucasian with fair-med skin tones. I was a little concerned about the &amp;#34;one-size-fits-all&amp;#34; tint to the cream. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It blends right in. I feel good knowing I have sunscreen on and even better knowing I can&#x27;t feel it. I love that it evens out my skin tones and find myself going without make up more. Just my supernatural and some Chapstick... Now that&#x27;s my kind of makeup!</li>
            <li> I use this as a primer and love it....  unfortunately, it&#x27;s getting hard to find.  Makes my skin feel so soft, decreases pore size, minimizes fine lines....  can wear it alone with a little powder but I usually use a little foundation.</li>
            <li> Philosophy used to have a tinted moisturizer. That&#x27;s what I wish i could find. This sunscreen is very nice, velvety and sheer. But it&#x27;s not as great as the other product.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing tint I have ever used. It feels so light airy and smooth yet it perfects the skin. Love it!</li>
            <li> I just love this product goes on your face lovely and smooth and is not heavy at all, looks natural on your face</li>
            <li> People tell me I have good skin, but I know that if they only knew--my pores are huge!  But thanks to Philosophy Supernatural Primer, no one need know!  Believe me, I&#x27;ve tried many so-called pore minimizers, and this one and Dr.Brandt&#x27;s are the only two that work for me.  Dr. Brandts is higher priced and it does not have SPF15, which is a nice bonus.  So for my money, this is THE best primer for big pores and it really does help my makeup stay in place.  I have use 3 or 4 tubes of this stuff and Amazon has the best price I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  I do not need to use makeup when i use this! I use the bath and shampoo product too.</li>
            <li> I have this and also something called NYC porelessprimer I bought for a few dollars at Target. I think that the NYC one works just as well, if not better...</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I wear it alone, or as a primer for my foundation.</li>
            <li> This is my first review on amazon and it really is because this product is so unique. I have worked as a makeup artist for 4+ years and have never come across a product like it. I, oddly enough do not prefer to wear a lot of make up and have very sensitive skin. So sensitive I cannot wear almost any kind if sunblock. However this product did not cause any irritation ( despite the SPF 15) and it&#x27;s mouse- like formula feels like your now wearing anything, like it sits just on the surface of you skin. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a light, pore minimizing/ natural mattifying type of makeup. It&#x27;s  perfect for the summer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this product.  I don&#x27;t use it as a primary foundation or a primary sunscreen, but it perfectly fills a niche for a light, easy-to-apply weekend foundation that will provide a bit of sun protection and raven out my skin tone without looking like full-on make up.  I have also occasionally used it as a primer under my foundation with great results.</li>
            <li> Great feeling under your makeup.  Hides blemishes well and even has sunscreen.  Worth the money because you only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tinted primer. I have bought a few different kinds and this has been the best. It&#x27;s so soft and makes your skin feel so soft. I am a fan of Philosophy!</li>
            <li> Very greasy going on. I love philosophy products but this one is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> The color is very unnatural, too orange. The cream is very caky, even a small amount. Applying this product doesn&#x27;t bring me any positive results. With the same amount of investment, I can buy a much better product. I threw it away because after trying several times I have no incentive to waste my time given I already wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.. Great primer for smoothing over pores and wrinkles</li>
            <li> this lotion is a fabulous wear alone sunscreen/makeup.  i used it on the weekends when i want a semi polished look without makeup.  it also works nicely under bare minerals powder.</li>
            <li> I love this product with my whole heart.  There is nothing better.  It blurs fine lines, evens out your skin tone, provides a smooth surface for any other makeup application, and has a natural sunscreen that does not make my skin freak out.  I can wear it under foundation or powder or alone.  This is the most perfect product ever made!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a long time and it is my favorite.  It gives primer plus foundation in one application and stays on all day.  I&#x27;m a big fan of philosophy products!</li>
            <li> love this stuff, goes on so silky and smoothed out my fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this primer to give it a try after Clinique discontinue the Pore Minimizer Instant Perfector, which for my super oily and large pores works great; and has nothing to do for large pores and oily skin. It&#x27;s kind an orange, and under the sun looks awful. Not suitable for I think any skin tone.It&#x27;s very greasy and horrible. Bad,bad choice.</li>
            <li> Did not like the consistency.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I have used it for a long time and won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
            <li> I like the old, original shade better and this new formula does not go on as smooth but it&#x27;s still better than several other face primers I have tried.</li>
            <li> I love philosophy products and wish they still made this one. It&#x27;s light and blends really well. It&#x27;s a good primer, but too bad it doesn&#x27;t have SPF. The tint is very natural with no orangey look to it. My skin still needs powder foundation over top, but this provides a nice base.</li>
            <li> Did not care for this product. Too thick and left my face oily.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 4 years. Great and complete coverage for pores and slight lines.</li>
            <li> It does not cover large pores as I expected&lt;br /&gt;and it is expensive for the little results I got from using  it.  It does go on very smoothly and I like the  sunscreen  aspect.</li>
            <li> The reviews about this product were of two types:  amazing or scathing.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out if it would work for me, or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I love Philosophy&#x27;s skin care products, I decided to give this a try - but I had reservations.  Not about the product&#x27;s composition, but about its coloration.  My skin tone is very light with a yellow undertone, so I was concerned that the tint in this product would not match my skin&#x27;s tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately, it matches my skin perfectly.  Plus, it&#x27;s VERY LIGHT COVERAGE makes every day wear for a natural look ... well... NATURAL.  (cliche for you free of charge!)  I even used this for evening wear by applying a matching powder, and I achieved a lovely matte look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you have a rosy skin tone, DON&#x27;T buy this.  It&#x27;ll clash with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it and will buy more.  It makes my skin look ... ha.... FLAWLESS.</li>
            <li> I received this in a Philosophy Special several years ago.  Hands down it is my favorite Philosophy product.  I use it as a base, and put my powder makeup over it.  The only thing that could make it better is if they would package it in a larger tube.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this product in stores for more than a year since it was discontinued. I love it, and it is the only such cream that has ever worked for me! Smooth, sheer, evens skin tone, protects - excellent. I hope it continues to be available.</li>
            <li> This is a quick way to lesson any uneven skin tones.  For my dry skin, I add moisturizer under this and get a flawless result.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical that this primer would really work as stated. How could it possibly work for different shades/skin tones etc?... I don&#x27;t know how, but it works. I have a light complexion and noticeable pores in some areas, but this primer does a pretty good job of smoothing everything out and making my skin almost flawless. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but a little goes a long way and I am confident that my skin looks better than any other tinted facial creams I have used.</li>
            <li> I purchased this Super Natural and loved it so much I turned around and bought another one! Light but smooth coverage, gives a&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;no make up\\&quot; look. At 56, less is more and the coverage makes pores disappear. It technically is a primer but I wear it daily as light makeup.</li>
            <li> i have very fair olive colored skin. i ordered this primer as i hoped it would be essentially colorless. it&#x27;s not. rather it&#x27;s a light shade of orange.  maybe that color is good for some, for me it produces the dreaded line.  i can blend it down but my face and neck are clearly just different colors. that said, the texture of the product is lovely. it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores in the way that most spf containing products do and it seems to last all day long. if there were a lighter shade of this, i would happily buy it and forget about all other primers.</li>
            <li> i love philosophy products and i love a tinted moisturizer as i do not like a lot of makeup on my face</li>
            <li> This really smooths my complexion and tones down any ruddiness.  In the summer, I wear it alone.  In winter, I add a few drops of foundation.  It looks a little orange coming out of the tube, but somehow it never looks orange on my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this under my foundation. Love it! Makes your face look as smooth as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and this is the best primer I have ever used and I have been using make up since I&#x27;m 13.</li>
            <li> I do not think this is a miracle product.&lt;br /&gt;It does make skin look smoother and less oily.&lt;br /&gt;However I do not think that it lasts very long.&lt;br /&gt;It is not at all effective in concealing large pores.&lt;br /&gt;Medium pores maybe, but I have several large pores on my nose and it does nothing.&lt;br /&gt;It did not irritate my skin and has no odor, so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a primer underneath a foundation, and after my friend recommended this, I see why she was stoked about it!  It keeps my foundation in place much more than without primer. When applying liquid foundation, i can feel the resistance of the foundation being saturated into the primer, rather than the ease that it normally takes to rub foundation in.  With that resistance, I know that it is holding the foundation in place. This will definitely be a product of my daily beauty regimen from now on!</li>
            <li> Smooth and sheer, but not non comedogenic.</li>
            <li> This is a great light weight foundation, moisturizes and covers well.  when I&#x27;m in a hurry, which is quite often, this is my go to favorite make-up item!</li>
            <li> I use this product every day ... it can be used as a primer under foundation making it go on smoother and more evenly, or just alone as a really light foundation.  I had been given a tube many years ago by a coworker and did not realize how much I liked using it until it was gone.  Then the search began to find it again.  Amazon never fails and gives me many options for purchasing things from multiple suppliers all at great prices.  Will buy again!  Thanks</li>
            <li> I just got this, and it works really well. It feels like a mousse concealer, but lighter. Makes big pores seem the smallest they have EVER been since... well ,16 years ago .</li>
            <li> It worked well as a primer, and it did a decent job of hiding my pores (wouldn&#x27;t say I looked &amp;#34;flawless&amp;#34; however). It felt a bit too oily/greasy for my liking,  and as someone who already has rather oily skin, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of the feeling as it only heightened my fear of looking like a grease ball. My skin did look nice in pictures and it does a good job of covering up flaws, but for the price I feel like there are better primers out there that feel less oily.</li>
            <li> I can use this product alone for quick coverage or under my mineral foundation. Poreless/Flawless!! Just disappointed that I can no longer receive automatic shipment.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see the point of this product.  My skin doesn&#x27;t look any different wearing it which is surprising as I am very light skinned.  While it&#x27;s very orange out of the tube, it seems to have no color at all on my face (which, to be fair is certainly better than orange).  It leaves a definite velvety feeling on the skin, which some seem to like, but doesn&#x27;t feel natural to me.  I think my skin feels smoother and softer without it.  I&#x27;ve enjoyed using Philosophy&#x27;s The Present in the past and thought I&#x27;d give this a try since it has the SPF, but going forward I&#x27;ll stick to the former which just gives my face a very subtle &amp;#34;airbrushed&amp;#34; look.  Some points for the SPF, but feels like a waste of money to me.</li>
            <li> This would be a 5 star product if I hadn&#x27;t had a problem with one of the tubes I bought.  I&#x27;ve purchased this 4 times.  One day I was putting this on in the car in the dark on the way to an early morning meeting.  Wanted a touch of color on my face with no time for complicated powder foundation.  I got to the office and had this stuff all over the front of me.  The bottom of the tube split open and every time I had squeezed the tube it had squirted both out the bottom and the top.  I was a complete mess.  I threw a jacket over myself and wore it through the meeting then had to go home to change.  This stuff did NOT come out of my clothes.  My pants and top had to be thrown away.  As a primer under powder foundation or for a slight bit of color with skin conditioner it is great.  Just be careful as the quality control on the tubes is suspect.</li>
            <li> Tried this while on a beach vacation and I was very impressed.  The feel and coverage of this product is very light and natural-looking but the sunscreen protection is invaluable.  Lightly tinted, it applies smoothly and evenly and provides just enough coverage to enhance your skin without any greasiness or heaviness. It&#x27;s a winner.  I&#x27;m so pleased with it that I plan to use it year round.</li>
            <li> Not bad by any means, just not my favorite. I&#x27;m leaving this review so I can remember which primer&#x27;s I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> This is quite simply the one product I canot be without. I really don&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s no longer available in the UK.  I have to order it from Amazon.com and have it shipped to a friend&#x27;s family in the US, who then post it on to me in England (Amazon .com don&#x27;t ship to the UK). A lot of trouble to go to, but I&#x27;ve searched for an alternative tinted primer and there&#x27;s nothing even remotely as good as this one.  It&#x27;s very strange, as all the other Philosophy products are available in the UK but not this one. I know that not every product suits every person, but this one certainly works for me.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I have acne and oily skin. No matter what primer I have ever used (MAC, Smashbox), I usually end up with at least one break out by the end of the day if I wear it constantly. That being said, Philosophy Supernatural has actually minimized my pores. I rarely get break-outs when I wear this tinted primer alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, as a primer, it&#x27;s not the best. My skin still remained oily after a few hours when I wore foundation and powder over the top. Perhaps it is just my skin type, and I will forever be oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with this product and I would recommend it to anyone. It did a wonderful job at minimizing pores and my skin had less breakouts overall. Sometimes, I even just wear this product alone with a bit of mascara on the weekends because I&#x27;ve gained more confidence in my skins &#x27;natural&#x27; look :)</li>
            <li> Very light and feels good on my skin!</li>
            <li> They say \\&quot;No pain, no gain.\\&quot; Well, the price of this product is just about killing me. Let&#x27;s just say I am a seasoned bargain hunter. HOWEVER, I have to say that Philosophy Supernatural Poreless/Flawless Tinted Primer is so good that it is money well-spent. It goes a long way, so if you consider the price-per-use, it&#x27;s actually not that outrageous -- especially given the fact that the results are fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself a little, and buy some of this stuff. You won&#x27;t believe how good it really is. (Prepare to look younger.)</li>
            <li> I have used this for years !  I have tried to do without it....but,always come back. Now, I can&#x27;t do without it. It makes my makeup go on so much smoother. It covers pores and just makes a beautiful canvas for applying makeup .  Have to keep buying !</li>
            <li> well, it did not have much effect as said in website. May be the product is good for some skin.</li>
            <li> Transforms my face - soft and silky! It totally IS SUPERnatural! Glides on and creates a perfect canvas for your makeup. Won&#x27;t use anything else from now on. The hunt is over!</li>
            <li> I dont really find how this primes your skin for makeup. It does have sort of greasy feel, even though it is lightweight. It doesnt make my skin look better, or help my makeup stay on longer.</li>
            <li> i have used this either alone or as a primer for over a year now. i am blessed with great skin, so this and some mascara and im on my way. it really evens out skin tone, within minutes its like a miracle has happened! also, my 11 year old has been bugging me to wear makeup. so i gladly handed her my tube of this. not only is this better for her skin than any other drug store brand, it also has spf. she feels &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;, and i dont feel bad about letting her wear &amp;#34;makeup&amp;#34;, :)</li>
            <li> I typically love this product, and have used it consistently for many years. Supernatural is normally very silky in consistency. This tube is gritty, and leaves what look like sand granules on my face. I may need to find a new product.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough about this stuff! I absolutely love it. On special occasions I wear it underneath my make-up and it makes my super dry skin feel soft and smooth. But on normal mornings I wear it alone as my make-up. Obsessed with it and recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin I guess because this causes a rash with daily use. But I love how it feels! And it does give some protection from the sun.</li>
            <li> Have used this product for several years. Would recomend to anyone, has great sun protection. Hope it stays on the market.</li>
            <li> My mother and I have been using Supernatural for years. It goes on like silk, seriously soft. It has an SPF and primes my make-up very nice. It has a tint when it comes out of the bottom but once I put it on, I dont even notice any color so I can them put on my mineral makeup and it looks just like I want it to.</li>
            <li> This is a purchase I will never regret. The formula is light and tinted, making it a perfect choice for those who are looking for a simple alternative to foundation, BB creams, and tinted moisturizers. I love how it keeps my skin matte and smooth for hours, even after running in the Texas heat. Even for $30, the product comes in a relatively large bottle and is such great quality that a little bit goes a long way. I definitely recommend this product for those who just need a little daily cover-up with SPF!</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin with large pores around my nose area and this primer looks really great on me. A lot of foundations are either too yellow or too pale on me but this product breathes life in to my skin and gives it a fantastic natural color. I LOVE the texture, it is sort of like a whipped texture and it is so creamy. The coverage is VERY light and will even out skin tone and minimize your pores but you will still need concealer for any imperfections like under eye circles or blemishes. I like to top it off with pressed powder to add just a touch more coverage and to seal the primer; the coverage is so light you can&#x27;t afford for it to fade throughout the day and pressed powder locks it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my skin care routine for beautiful and natural looking skin: After washing my face I use Take A Breath by Philosophy as my moisturizer, Eye Hope by Philosophy as my eye cream, Bare Minerals as my concealer, Supernatural by Philosophy as my foundation/primer/sunscreen, and then finish it off with MAC pressed powder. My skin looks great all day.</li>
            <li> I have a basic medium skin and this &amp;#34;tinted&amp;#34; is much to peachy/orange for me.  Not what I expected from description and Philosphy. I love their exfoliating mask and other products.</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this primer. For winter season, I love it. Great for dry skin. For summer, I don&#x27;t like it too much. It makes me break out and the foundation looks cakey. Overall, I would look for a different primer for the price.</li>
