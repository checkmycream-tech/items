            <li>THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M REALLY IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li>Working great !!</li>
            <li>I have persistent, stubborn acne and this is working great!</li>
            <li>One of the best acne products I have used.  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>What I found was that what seemed to work the best for people was a combination of salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used proactiv and ance.org and this is the best choice for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a couple of months now and I am very impressed with it.</li>
            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li>Perfect substitute for Acne.org treatment.</li>
            <li>The best Benzoyl Peroxide preparation I have ever used, and I have used them all.  </li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;ve been using another brand of 2.5% BP, don&#x27;t assume this will be a perfect replacement.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for about a month now, and I will say I am very happy with how it is going.</li>
            <li>my son is having very good luck with this product and it is gentler than the proactive he was using.</li>
            <li>Very good price for the size.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, the results were incredible.</li>
            <li>Good luck!  </li>
            <li>She had acne breakouts before but during pregnancy it had cleared out and her skin was so beautiful.</li>
            <li>am SO happy with this product-</li>
            <li>And it works great in combination with claror.</li>
            <li>He is so happy with it.</li>
            <li>dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a premium product, but also great value as the tube is 8 oz</li>
            <li>and I can see that she is already happy with the results.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price.</li>
            <li>This product has worked great for me.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>Great product - works well.</li>
            <li>Have been using for 6 weeks in conjunction with a salicylic acid wash, and I can honestly say this is the best my face has looked in about 30 years.  </li>
            <li>Kudos to this company for making a great product.</li>
            <li>so I researched a great, oil-free moisturizer to use after applying the Claror cream.</li>
            <li>The best value of its kind.</li>
            <li>These before and after pics aren&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>I think that is all you need since it is very effective.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product morning and night for about 6 months now and the difference in my skin is amazing!</li>
            <li>which is amazing!</li>
            <li>Works great, seems like a really good price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li>Nice size for the price!  </li>
            <li>but I am pleasantly surprise by the results.</li>
            <li>It worked very good, but I still think acne.org works better at keeping any acne at bay.</li>
            <li>Kern is the best and comes in a huge bottle.</li>
            <li>If Benzoyl Peroxide works for you then this is a good brand.</li>
            <li>It seems fairly inexpensive considering the size of the container.</li>
            <li>My husband keeps telling me how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li>My choice will be determined by strength (ideally 0.5% or 1% at most) and price, though if it includes a v.light non-comedogenic moisturizer to counter the BPO drying effect, that would be a plus.</li>
            <li>SO GOOD.</li>
            <li>and I am good.  </li>
            <li>This product is honestly really good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a good lotion.</li>
            <li>sure you have good moisturizer cream also!</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I gave it four stars because the return policy is great and the amount of product you get for the price is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I decided to read more and found it was a leave-on cream!  </li>
            <li>I was pleased that it was affordable!</li>
            <li>Would be AWESOME if it became available on Subscribe &amp; Save!! :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li>Works like magic to remove zits!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I love claror and wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without it!</li>
            <li>I love the size of the tube, too!</li>
            <li>I was using Neutrogena&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide for years, but I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
            <li>I find it indistinguishable from the Acne.org gel, which I love!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful BP in comparison to many I&#x27;ve used -- very gentle and calming!</li>
            <li>I also ordered the topix ultra lite moisture dew from amazon and that stuff is amazing as well.</li>
            <li>It has worked amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>Amazing.  </li>
            <li>The results have been amazing.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and a great amount in the tube.</li>
            <li>This gel is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Acne Treatment is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>Cost effective &amp; works well.  </li>
            <li>Nice stuff.</li>
            <li>Effective and not too drying</li>
            <li>It turns out that benzoyl peroxide is quite effective for me</li>
            <li>Quite effective.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it smelled and felt on my skin...</li>
            <li>My blackheads and therefore pores on my nose have been greatly reduced and the skin on my cheeks is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Works just as effectively as a 10% solution.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use a good face lotion after applying the Claror gel like the company recommends.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and wish you the best.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very easily in to my skin and doesn&#x27;t over</li>
            <li>It seems to bleach clothing it comes into contact with very easily, but it also treats my acne without overly drying my face.</li>
            <li>The best part with this product is having decent price and more quantity lasts longer.  </li>
            <li>, however, Salicylic acid has been more effective to treat my acne.</li>
            <li>This is by far the very best quality one that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I have been using benzoyl peroxide gel for over 30 years, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used, including prescription strength!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s all worth it for how great the treatment works.  </li>
            <li>Claror BP works better than the kind you can get at the drugstore because it absorbs without leaving a film.</li>
            <li>It is also more cost effective.</li>
            <li>I am using it in place of step 2 in proactive + and it seems to be a good fit.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the BEST acne products that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Wow... works great!</li>
            <li>Strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>strongly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nowhere near perfect for me, but it&#x27;s a lot better than using nothing.    </li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have any dryness when used with a very light, oil-free moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>It has immensely helped my confidence and has brought me so much joy!</li>
            <li>I am so glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to answer them.</li>
            <li>And no, I don&#x27;t work for the company :)</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>My face was getting better,</li>
            <li>I am pleased with Claror and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and i have been suffering from acne and tried many products to get these results</li>
            <li>Dermatologists actually recommended that I stick with that option if it worked the best.  </li>
            <li>I began ordering through Amazon, which was a bit more costly.</li>
            <li>but i dont get too many cystic acne anymore.</li>
            <li>Claror&#x27;s product has a better consistency and seems to work quicker than Acne.org&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>it was just so smooth, like it had never been before!</li>
            <li>And as a bonus, nice, smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I use Neutrogena&#x27;s oil-free grapefruit acne wash, and so do many of my friends, who swear it&#x27;s a god-send.</li>
            <li>It would be better with like 5 or 10 Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li>Been using the BP from Acne.org for years, but I love that I can get Claror on Prime.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena sells for more than</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just saying Claror is much better in comparison</li>
            <li>I like the product and am 100 % satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Will be getting more for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many things.</li>
            <li>my skin would be even better</li>
            <li>I’m sure with some discipline</li>
            <li>I tried Proactiv and had okay results</li>
            <li>I have been using it every day since (about four months) and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>This product is thicker than Acne.org and it also feels more potent.</li>
            <li>Perhaps more moisturizer is required.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, this product is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li>I really love this one.</li>
            <li>am age 64 and in the sun most days here in South Florida.  </li>
            <li>Goes on as a gel which is better.</li>
            <li>however I have been use to a bit more Benzoyl Peroxide in my cream.  </li>
            <li>and I love that about it.  </li>
            <li>but then I just apply some more moisturizer</li>
            <li>But I love that I can apply lotion to my skin and not break out</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using acne.org&#x27;s BP for 3+ years now, and decided to give this one a shot because it was a better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I figured the least I could do for the company and to anyone who is reading this is to praise this product as it has made me a much more confident person knowing that my skin looks great every day &amp; I am so happy I found this!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Now, I am confident again and able to look anyone in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>thing I like the most about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t flake once it dries.</li>
            <li>and I agree that he looks much better.</li>
            <li>I do still get blemishes but my skin is looking much better than it was.</li>
            <li>but they do show how much better</li>
            <li>This BP was a world of difference -- very effective yet somehow very soothing.</li>
            <li>and I must say that I have beautiful clear skin!</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>It is a great product and I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li>This treatment is pretty good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Claror is the latest one I have tried, and it is working great amazingly so far.</li>
            <li>It sounds incredible, but it worked just like that, going deep just like</li>
            <li>For first two weeks I did not see much changes but never gave up just kept using it for a month, believe me my skin started clearing up and incredibly it amazed me after two months all gone.</li>
            <li>I am using Alba Hawaiian oil free moisturizer and the combination is really fantastic!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin -</li>
            <li>and my dermatologist told me that Benzoyl Peroxide was safe to use while trying to conceive &amp; also safe to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I special ordered Alpha Hydrox lotion at first because I&#x27;d heard good things, but it burned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now been using this particular formula for about 6 months, so I think I can give it a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gentle but super effective!</li>
            <li>like to use more of higher end skin care products, so the moisturizer I use now are clinique and fresh products, they are a bit pricy, but in combination of this BP gel and these good moisturizer, so far it worked really good for my skin.</li>
            <li>So, to sum it up, expect dry skin and get a REALLY good moisturizer - you will love the results!  </li>
            <li>Product is fine, but I dislike getting nagged for reviews.</li>
            <li>This one is pretty light to put on though, so that is nice.  </li>
            <li>My Dr. recommended a over the counter 4% and it worked much better on mild acne.</li>
            <li>I’m pregnant and for the most part I see it keeping my acne at bay  </li>
            <li>The reason this is good is because it is appropriate for traveling, which was the whole reason I bought this product in the first place.</li>
            <li>As most Benzoyl Peroxide products it bleaches towels and anything you touch...just be aware!</li>
            <li>Seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE fan of this product and also a HUGE fan of the customer service.</li>
            <li>I used this gel for 1 week and noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying the huge prices for acne creams</li>
            <li>--it goes on smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li>It has been so gentle but so effective -</li>
            <li>The premium price is well justified with the 8 OZ tube size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I stuck with the neutrogena on-the-spot acne treatment (vanishing formula) since it was widely available in drug stores and did the job</li>
            <li>it fades scars over time and smooth’s out the bumps from pimples also I just discovered dream dots it helps if you do pop a zit for it not to scar</li>
            <li>My sister have been using this for almost 6 months to keep her skin acne free.</li>
            <li>He will continue to use this product and I will continue to enjoy the cost savings.</li>
            <li>Also, this is cheaper than acne.org&#x27;s BP, plus with free shipping if you have prime.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Acne.org BP for 8 years but found this product on Amazon and the free shipping enticed me.</li>
            <li>It goes on really smooth, and does not leave my skin feeling tacky (Like Neutrogena on the spot does).</li>
            <li>and I have been blemish free since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Be patient, use a good moisturizer with sunscreen, and let Claror clear your skin.</li>
            <li>I’m sure if I gave up fast food when I eat it here and there and drink more water</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Good natural face wash.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, tried everything, dermatologist, light therapy, this really works even on stubborn back acne.</li>
            <li>Still acne free and smiling, thanks Claror!!!</li>
            <li>I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt if I could get my money back - the comments were great, and they seemed to be true to their word with non-satisfied customers.</li>
            <li>Make sure you do use a moisturizer on top of this product though because your skin will seem a littler drier than normal.</li>
            <li>This is much better, faster results, very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li>To be honest, my hopes were high</li>
            <li>At first his face got better and now it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s bringing everything to the surface like cleaning his skin.</li>
            <li>After 2 days I was completely clear, with smooth flawless skin on my chest and back.</li>
            <li>Product is exactly as stated, will look at site to get more products.</li>
            <li>I wanted this to work but didn&#x27;t want to get too excited about it.</li>
            <li>It has worked really well for me, but, as I&#x27;ve learned, skin care tends to depend on a great many factors so this may or may not work for you, in short.</li>
            <li>so I rarely forget!</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li>This absorbs better and is more effective than any other I have used, including the one that has &amp;#34;active&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I guess when you live with the pain of having acnes, you kind of have to try it all.</li>
            <li>THIS Claror WAS the most popular daily treatment cream, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot -</li>
            <li>This is a more cost effective solution than proactive topical lotion and a comparable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8-16</li>
            <li>It is smooth, creamy, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am 28 and have light to mild acne.</li>
            <li>I loved how fast it absorbs into the skin, and it does seem to cause less redness (although that might just be my skin getting used to BP) and the price is good.</li>
            <li>I love that you get a large container of it too.  </li>
            <li>This product completely calmed my skin… I&#x27;m blemish free right now and love it!  </li>
            <li>I am at the MOST stressful point my life has experienced in ten years, yet I&#x27;m glowing and completely clear -</li>
            <li>I would buy it again just to see the full results.</li>
            <li>The consistency is nice &amp; it smooths over your skin and dries clear.</li>
            <li>This works good my acne finally going away afther breaking up alot afther having my baby</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a problem most of my life, and I had never found anything that really helped -- scrubs, toners, creams</li>
            <li>Highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t recommend Claror Acne Treatment more highly!</li>
            <li>Then when i tried it i was pleasantly satisfied to find it also gentle, and didn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li>: Claror does a much better job absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li>I also now use a separate white (almost disposable) hand towel for drying my hands to avoid ruining good towels.    </li>
            <li>I have a 10% as a spot treatment that I put on over this for existing pimples, and that&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>You definitely need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Product was as described and the shipping was quick</li>
            <li>work- or how quickly.</li>
            <li>I am more than pleased, would and will buy it again and totally recommend this to others.</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with this product that I came back to order more.</li>
            <li>I now am a loyal Clarol customer.</li>
            <li>lucky my husband</li>
            <li>People constantly remark that my skin looks so nice, clear and healthy!</li>
            <li>Love this product and would highly recommend to anyone suffering from acne.</li>
            <li>This cream is very good, I usually use clearsil</li>
            <li>It blends easily, does not dry if you don&#x27;t use too much, and gets rid of the pimples quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li>It does not prevent all breakouts but it stops most from starting, and most importantly, it makes those that start fade fast.</li>
            <li>just because I experienced the above does not mean everyone will.</li>
            <li>I tried the acne.org BP regimen, clean and clear BP, etc. etc., and Claror is BY FAR the superior product.</li>
            <li>Some burning is normal, but mine would burn all day, which wasn&#x27;t good on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>(Unless you&#x27;really allergic to BP af course!!)  </li>
            <li>Until one day I was researching the most effective ways to treat acne, and I found that a &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; (some sort of scrub to remove the bulk of surface dead skin) along with an exfoliatant (the true treatment) and a lotion was the way to go.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a good job without irritation, but have not had the product long enough to more accurately judge.</li>
            <li>so if half size bottle exist for harf price, it will be much more Costomer friendly and I will give 5 star!!</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, everyday, with an oil-free moisturizer and have great results.</li>
            <li>It has been 3-4 weeks since I started using this product and my skin really has made a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and does not leave a flaky residue, which happens if you put on too much of the neutrogena treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The topical form is really the best so it absorbs to kill what essentially is a bacterial infection on our skin.</li>
            <li>Nice product and works well when used daily!  </li>
            <li>One great thing about this product is that it never completely dried out my skin and made it red or flaky.</li>
            <li>Now my skin looks clear and healthy, even it helped my beard hair follicles to stop clogging after trimming or shaving.</li>
            <li>Claror is 2x the size and worth</li>
            <li>I use two finger&#x27;s length worth of product b/c I&#x27;ve been using simliar benzoyl peroxide products for almost 13 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I switched over to Claror Acne Treatment because it had a number of distinct advantages over the neutrogena brand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Claror is much more gentle on my skin and every time I accidentally put on too much, I just rub it on anyways</li>
            <li>I rarely have any acne on my skin now.</li>
            <li>But the results make it worth it</li>
            <li>When I was trying to use 10% daily, I didn&#x27;t find it to be as effective as this milder treatment.</li>
            <li>While I had success with acne.org BP</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li>Here I am a month later, and they e-mailed to check in and see how I liked the product &amp; if I had any questions.</li>
            <li>I realize everyone is different, so that suggestion may not work for you, but I just wanted to share because it was not something I had ever thought of or heard about, but it does seem to be a nice addition to this acne treatment.  </li>
            <li>So far, I have been pleased.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been doing wonders - not a miracle worker, but I&#x27;m really happy with my skin, and I&#x27;m not experiencing dry or flaking side effects like one normally might with BP treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend this for someone who already tried other regimens but did not get best results.</li>
            <li>It is also very easy to apply and use since it is a clear quickly absorbing gel.</li>
            <li>Everyone wondering which skin product to buy: you have to find the right chemical for you.</li>
            <li>I could not be any happier right now.</li>
            <li>2.5% is the right amount.  </li>
            <li>my skin  is right now.</li>
            <li>This product works just as good if not better than acne.org products and the free two day</li>
            <li>Since my 20&#x27;s, I have paid thousands of dollars to dermatologists for needles in the face, gels, creams,  tanning salons (sun helps - in small doses), pharmacy prescriptions, and had found that Proactiv system was the most effective of all options.</li>
            <li>I have experienced very little skin irritation with this application process.</li>
            <li>Less drying than most others, and probably more</li>
            <li>BP is great for killing trapped bacteria and as a spot treatment, but many people will need a topical exfoliator (like Salicylic acid or an AHA) to compliment a BP regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend a suitable moisturizer to avoid over drying.</li>
            <li>works great, like acne.org if not better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will be only a couple more weeks till my afce is completely clear</li>
            <li>What she liked about Claror is it has only 2.5% strength and is feeling gentle on her skin when used it the right way.</li>
            <li>Over 1 year later: Still going strong!</li>
            <li>Right around the time my Amazon package got shipped to me, I received an e-mail with instructions on exactly how to use the product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product - it will definitely be worth your while!</li>
            <li>My skin also didn&#x27;t dry out from it which is nice</li>
            <li>I do have to use a salicylic acid astringent and a face wash (I have been using Cetyphil Gentle Skin Cleaner or Acnedote Face Wash) to keep my skin more clear.</li>
            <li>Too strong for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li>However, I just really wanted to get my skin cleared up quickly for an event about a month ago</li>
            <li>Wash with warm to hot water, dry, then immediately apply product while your pores are at their widest.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It was very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li>I tried benzoyl peroxide for the first time using this product.</li>
            <li>I have battled with acne for greater than 15 years and tried various medications, to no avail.</li>
            <li>After a very short time of using it only at night, there is a remarkable change on my face.</li>
            <li>At first I thought I had purchased a face wash, so that is how I used it.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different types of benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>After I applied first time I saw difference.</li>
            <li>I love it, and it is the only one I will use from now on!</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing them!</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter and it really does work!</li>
            <li>We both can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s made his acne disappear after trying out so many products on the market that claim to do the same.</li>
            <li>He gave me a benzoyl peroxide lotion at a higher percentage</li>
            <li>i chose the Claror this time around because it seems to be a better value overall.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is not complicated.</li>
            <li>even though I feel like a pizza face there are people that will love you for who you are its just finding what works for you so that the outside matches the inside that might take awhile</li>
            <li>The first week</li>
            <li>or so my skin was pretty irritated but stuck it out and haven&#x27;t had problems</li>
            <li>Mostly my face was always irritated and red.  </li>
            <li>My completion is so much smoother!  </li>
            <li>Like most I just kept buying the standard 10% BP products at the drug store.  </li>
            <li>My only warning is make sure you wash your hands with soap after applying this lotion because it will bleach/stain your towels/linens.</li>
            <li>At first I used it 2 times a day (morning and evening)</li>
            <li>but again it was a bit slower process since I was use to a higher percentage of benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li>Definitely see better results than anything else I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly the way the company advised to, and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty mind blowing.</li>
            <li>One more item that I have just recently found helps after going on vacation to a place with a beach is that sea water.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Still most of this left...</li>
            <li>and it should work, i had mild acne that ruined my senior year of high school</li>
            <li>Worked great to decrease the black heads on my nose and clear up the acne on my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li>I have an extremely acne-prone area around my mouth/lips and honestly tried everything, from going vegan to taking mega doses of supplements like Zinc and of course tons of antibiotics.  </li>
            <li>, it arrived, is a GIANT, long lasting tube, and my skin in ALL HONESTY, is THE BEST it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m female, in my mid 20s, fair skin and acne prone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY use a good facial lotion.</li>
            <li>I am 32 married man, I really don&#x27;t know why I have had a severe congested skin problem 1 year ago,</li>
            <li>has pretty much cleared the majority of my acne.</li>
            <li>I have used Acne.org&#x27;s regimen in the past (over 5 years ago) and have had good results, so I wanted to start on that again.</li>
            <li>Causes slight drying, but is highly effective.</li>
            <li>After applying make sure it is completely dry before changing your shirts as it does bleach</li>
            <li>I read that 2.5% BP was just as effective as 10% and would cause less redness/irritation, so I decided to buy this product on Amazon</li>
            <li>3.5 months later and still going strong</li>
            <li>Large amount for the price.</li>
            <li>If I feel something coming on, I use a little extra and it never fully comes in.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think Claror is more or less effective than any other 2.5% BPO.  </li>
            <li>and you get a huge tube at a very low price.</li>
            <li>This is a huge plus to me, because generic store brands do this and it tends to look horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few different BPO gels, and this is my favorite, for sure.  </li>
            <li>It can be used during the day and it has not broken ne out.</li>
            <li>but that was too much for my skin.</li>
            <li>And when I do have a bump/zit it heals a LOT faster thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>I really like this product its been 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Anyway, because of my Prime membership, this product saves me a bit of money and arrives much faster.  </li>
            <li>Really, without ANY dryness.</li>
            <li>all is said and done, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This product really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li>Results are fast.</li>
            <li>has been clearing my skin very well</li>
            <li>FAST - Blemishes disappear in 2-4 days.</li>
            <li>AND IT CLEARS MY ACNE UP REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>Goes on like a lotion- not sticky or oily and absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>: If I put on too much Claror, nothing noticeable happens to the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li>When I put on too much neutrogena, my face gets noticeable lighter than my neck, which makes it seem like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of make-up, which is not the look</li>
            <li>/&gt;4) Gentleness: Too much neutrogena makes my skin burn</li>
            <li>Wash gently with cerave cleanser and then use claror cream.</li>
            <li>Be gentle when washing and putting the cream on your face.</li>
            <li>Reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>That being said, Benzoyl Peroxide is a drug and is very drying.</li>
            <li>I think it kills the bacteria really well.</li>
            <li>I was very surprise that this stuff really worked.  </li>
            <li>and this really cleared my skin before i went to college.</li>
            <li>My face looks much clearer.</li>
            <li>Topix is a gentle wash and neither product overly dries my skin.  </li>
            <li>Have had acne practically my whole life</li>
            <li>It washes off my hands really well and hasn&#x27;t accidentally bleached any of my stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have acnea, but my skin is very oily and needs to be cleaned every day.</li>
            <li>but this cream is very concentrated , if I can say so.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>This product works really well, and is very affordable.</li>
            <li>It is the only product I have found that keeps my face acne free (and trust me</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t experience the dryness really.</li>
            <li>It really work.</li>
            <li>and it works really well for my oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I absolutely adore this product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t use lotion, your skin can also react to you taking away all its natural oils by starting to over produce more oil.</li>
            <li>have always known that benzoyl peroxide is effective at treating acne, but it had always left my skin very red and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You must be prepared for several weeks of redness and itching before being able to increase the amount used and clear your skin.</li>
            <li>I had tried many products including Proactiv and Dermalogica, and they ended up being incredibly expensive and not as effective as Claror.</li>
            <li>Goes on incredibly light and clear, and absorbs super-quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>only drawback is that you have to be super consistent-</li>
            <li>His skin quickly cleared up after the initial breakout and he hasn&#x27;t had problems since, but be aware of the possibility of having to adjust to the product.</li>
            <li>You have to find the right combination of all three to get completely clear</li>
            <li>Definitely need to use other products with it, but it is a good product for what it is.use</li>
            <li>I still have a week or two of use left in the original bottle, but I don&#x27;t want to take a chance of running out.</li>
            <li>Since beginning to use this product a month ago I have seen a significant decrease in blemishes on my back.  </li>
            <li>purchased it for my daughter who tried so many other brands.</li>
            <li>It is better than any other acne product I have tried.</li>
            <li>After that, I just took a quick stop by Bi-Mart (I think most drug stores will likely carry it too), picked up some Neutrogena oil-free sensitive skin facial moisturizer, and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and after the first week,  I noticed a huge difference!  </li>
            <li>Cleans the pores well and dries out the skin which is fine as long as you accompany with a moisturizer</li>
            <li>After swimming in the ocean almost every day, my skin was more clear than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li>Since using this gel I have been able to clear my back completely!  </li>
            <li>It is a great big tube, will last a REALLY long time!!  </li>
            <li>This is a very good cream but the only bad thing is that they dont add more Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li>It has ZERO ingredients that are comedogenic (clogging pores)  and no fragrance, no oil, every single ingredient is safe for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>have pretty clear skin when I use this product at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the first product that has done -anything- to clear my face.</li>
            <li>far as the Proactiv daily repairing cream; it&#x27;s a small bottle and lasts a long time, but not 100% effective in clearing up my blemishes, just more effective than any other options I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very effective 👍way better than other expensive promising products.</li>
            <li>This is the most effective topical acne medication I&#x27;ve used - my acne cleared up in a few days, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin when used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Does a better job than any previous Benzoyl Peroxide cream I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s rare for me to give such a lengthy review, but when you spend so long crying about your skin and wishing you could wear a mask to seeing your face be almost completely clear in a matter of weeks.... it&#x27;s a really beautiful thing.</li>
            <li>I tried several different BP products while they all worked, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne on my face.</li>
            <li>I looked and researched some more before I was finally drawn in by the money back guarantee of this product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 49 and still get occasional breakouts and this product nips them in the bud quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has been 4 weeks and there is only mild improvement on my skin, hopefully it will continue to work</li>
            <li>I am currently 34 and trying to become pregnant.</li>
            <li>I was using the severe 10% benzoyl peroxide acnefree.com stuff (you can buy the sets in most stores) and it was always a struggle to keep my face hydrated because it dried it out so much.</li>
            <li>Also, when using any set of stuff (not just the kind I was using), I have found that they put so many ingredients in the lotion, face wash, toner, and retinoid cream that my pores seem to easily get clogged and cause worse acne, especially when your face gets dried out so much that you have to use a ton of lotion too.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Comparable to the highly advertised celebrity endorsed (over priced) brand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I began experiencing acne when I was in high school.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I have used many high-end, really expensive product in my war with acne, but this product is just really honest and simple, and just as effective if not more</li>
            <li>The smell is exactly the same as other benzoyl peroxide products I&#x27;ve used, this just has a better consistency.</li>
            <li>Yes, you pay a little more</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t at first because I thought my skin was too oily, but after two days I started getting major flaking.</li>
            <li>This one is amazing to say the least.  </li>
            <li>This gel is gentle on sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li>left, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>The key to success with this product is to be generous with the amount you apply.</li>
            <li>and it’s like a sticker so it helps you form not going back and further irritating the area best of luck to</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is definitely worth trying</li>
            <li>In the beginning I was using an index finger&#x27;s length of gel, but now am only using 1 inch worth because of the over drying.</li>
            <li>This high quality Gel (NOT Cream) works and leaves ones skin very clear.</li>
            <li>It will over dry your skin if you don&#x27;t use a good lotion though, but the gel itself disappears once it has dried.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t discolor the towel right away, but sometime in the next 2~3 days, you&#x27;ll notice bleached patches on the towel.  </li>
            <li>I only use it 2-3 times per week which seems to be about right for my skin.</li>
            <li>Clarorskincare version is therefore far more convenient than Dr. Song&#x27;s, and I appreciate that the lid tightly seals the product from leaking.</li>
            <li>I myself can see there is a visible reduction in redness and new breakouts (which by the way used to be 1 or 2 new breakouts</li>
            <li>I did not experience any new breakouts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and it was clearly hormonal</li>
            <li>, I was very ready to just go the acne.org route and cross my fingers.</li>
            <li>but I personally do like this product very much, so here you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even if I do get a few spots, it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>My problem with that, is that the only local place to purchase, was an automated kiosk in a mall, that many times was not working properly.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s humid here in Texas, so your face can get pretty gross.</li>
            <li>First of all, I understand that not every product will work for every individual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day rather than the recommended twice a day and saw results in the first couple days.</li>
            <li>Works wonders on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>His whole back started becoming brighter and the acne went down and was gone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The truth is most acne treatments you see infomercials for are just benzoyl peroxide and some other stuff that&#x27;s really just fluff to pad the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting married soon and I adopted this cream in my beauty regiment in an attempt to clear my skin before the big day.</li>
            <li>If using daily, and that &amp;#34;90 day&amp;#34; supply is FALSE advertising, as it cannot clean twice a day, an adult face, for more than 30-40 days.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months and my persistent adult acne is completely gone!</li>
            <li>To be honest I haven&#x27;t been taking care of my skin much, just using random regimens as I travel and live in hotels.</li>
            <li>Can easily apply a thin layer to my whole face in the morning, and by the time I get to work it has absorbed completely and is totally invisible - there is no shine or greasiness to my face.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works very well for what it is and has a limited amount of ingredients that do not dry my face out very much.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear after months of fighting with it.  </li>
            <li>It took no time at all to clear up.  </li>
            <li>As far as the actual product, I have found that it&#x27;s much thicker than the Acne.org product, which I like.</li>
            <li>After two weeks, my skin started to clear.</li>
            <li>My son has been using this for 2 weeks now and it has helped clear up his acne.</li>
            <li>and since then my skin has been almost clear.</li>
            <li>Yes it does clear my bumps when I break out in 3-4 days</li>
            <li>I will continue using it until my skin is completely clear from acne.</li>
            <li>I am writing this review in hopes of helping someone clear their acne.  </li>
            <li>Nothing seemed to work to clear my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear.</li>
            <li>This product worked quickly to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and broke out in the forehead and chin area frequently.  </li>
            <li>, I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 38 years old</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>I am not recommending you do so, but the issue is, the product absorbs and is natural looking at all times.  </li>
            <li>12 year old daughter going through puberty and lots of acne.</li>
            <li>I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this really works for me.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t do much, and I used it religiously.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s quite young still</li>
            <li>WOW,</li>
            <li>I purchased this product out of desperation because nothing I have tried has worked thus far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used facial scrub washes my whole life</li>
            <li>Before application, cleanse your skin with some sort of scrub so that the product can get directly into your pores.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have to be COMPLETELY rubbed in, but mostly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li>It has completely cleared my skin, I have had problems with acne for 10 years.</li>
            <li>I have been battling with adult onset rosacea and have felt so embarrassed by it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used AcneFree Sensitive and Acne.</li>
            <li>But this has not happened so far.</li>
            <li>But, this one is far exceeding my expectations.</li>
            <li>I bought the product as an alternative to Acne.org Acne Treatment, and so far it has done it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>Been using the product for about 2 weeks and so far it has prevented breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I can’t do my old work outs and go to the beach being</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an 18 year old girl with medium to severe acne.</li>
            <li>SO FAR</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t magic but at least helps.</li>
            <li>that it is very light/not oily on my skin and at the same time not overly drying.  </li>
            <li>: I have sensitive skin so</li>
            <li>and it left my skin burning intensely after 4 consecutive days.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really like the product.</li>
            <li>After washing my face with a creamy, oil-free cleanser, I use an astringent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Still get some little pimples now and again but a significant improvement has been shown</li>
            <li>It feels comfortable and does not burn such as other ones that I have used.</li>
            <li>Helped clear my acne when no other product worked!</li>
            <li>, moisturizer and sunscreen are soooo important, can not stress this enough, BPO will make your skin dry but also extra sensitive to sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have had no major breakouts and my skin is so much smoother, clearer and softer.</li>
            <li>Start slow and use moisturizer and enjoy your new, clear skin.</li>
            <li>:)) I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;m gonna buy another tube, because it&#x27;s so big, but I would recommended to every one with oily skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is oily in the T-zone, normal elsewhere; the treatment controls my oily regions, but does not leave my normal areas dry.</li>
            <li>Very glad I bought this and needless to say I plan to be a repeat customer.    </li>
            <li>I guess thats why my skin did not clear as fast as in 30 days.  </li>
            <li>It is more like a light gel than the thick white creams I was used to using in the past.  </li>
            <li>In the 2 weeks I have been using this gel I have not had any new acne, so I believe it is working just as effectively as my last product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin much either which is a plus.</li>
            <li>I am 44yrs old, and suffer regularly, from adult stress/hormone acne.  </li>
            <li>and they never did much, so I started out with a solid twice a day application of two to three pea-sized amounts of this stuff all over my face, and the next day I could already feel a difference.</li>
            <li>This product really really really helped me, i definitely keep this product as my routine and part of daily life.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m writing one on this product because in the past 2 weeks my face looks better than it has in a really long time.  </li>
            <li>My missing product was replaced and my product was replaced quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used acne.org products happily for years and finally wanted a change from the expensive and long shipping process.</li>
            <li>I am a busy 25 year old Mom who has little time to fool with an intense skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>The antibiotics and prescription lotions helped, but I reached the point where the nodules were gone but general acne remained.</li>
            <li>After using the product properly now, my face is totally clear.  </li>
            <li>Within one week of using this product, twice daily, my skin is clear again.</li>
            <li>As long as I don&#x27;t go above 2.5 to 3%, my face clears up without so much of the side effects.</li>
            <li>benzoyl peroxide gel is easier to apply than a cream based benzoyl peroxide and dries clear on your skin rather than white.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from adult acne forever and am approaching my 60th birthday this year.</li>
            <li>We are following directions and so far the product is working well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 26 year old female</li>
            <li>My skin is very oily, acne and wide pores.</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old female and I have dealt with breakouts on and off since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have extra sensitive skin like mine, this would probably work.  </li>
            <li>Just red marks on my shoulders from old acne remains.</li>
            <li>spent 10 years avoiding making eye contact with people and suffering from acne really affected my self esteem.</li>
            <li>I will say that my acne got worse before it got better</li>
            <li>Proactiv made her skin worse with more breakouts and redness all over the cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li>My skin is MUCH clearer and new acne stopped coming after just a few applications.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had this issue with the acne.org BP (after the first two weeks or so), so I found this rather odd.</li>
            <li>It seems pricey at first but the tube is large and lasts a long time, so actually it works out to being less costly than all those tiny 10% tubes.    </li>
            <li>Since I appreciate other&#x27;s reviews so much, I thought for a change I would write one on Claror, since it works so well for me.</li>
            <li>Then tried using every other day, but I&#x27;m still breaking out just as much.</li>
            <li>Just some advice: do invest in a light moisturizer because this will dry out your face, this burns a bit at first so don&#x27;t be alarmed, don&#x27;t be discouraged by the few pimples that pop up after a few days of application, they will disappear soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle, light, and vaguely moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had acne since 5th grade, and boy is it not fun being the first and only kid with acne.</li>
            <li>I only do occasionally in order to cover up old acne scarring.</li>
            <li>I tried a myriad of over-the-counter products, saw three dermatologists, took antibiotics daily for about two years, used topical antibiotics, natural remedies...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The reason for the 4 stars, because it is still very drying even I only use it once a day and with little amount, but it could just be my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It may make your skin a little red and dry at first but your skin adapts and that is coming from a person who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>He even tried using antibiotics prescribed by the doctor and that barely helped, basically the acne came back.</li>
            <li>well it&#x27;s nature course and tried various products which are expensive and spent lot of time dedicated to my good diet etc., but never helped me, all over my fore head with tones of clogged pores, bumps and scares that makes me  low self esteemed with my job and social life.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I do not live near a beach, but I have purchased a sea water mix for aquariums and have been applying a solution of that to my face once or twice a day as well</li>
            <li>I was looking for a big tube of benzoyl peroxide since the store only has the little tubes (&amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li>other internal medications for the first time in a long time!</li>
            <li>It does cause a little irritation for me if I don&#x27;t use lotion after, but if I do it really helps.</li>
            <li>You only need to use little bit of the claror cream, when I use too much my face gets red like its burnt from the sun.</li>

            <li> THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M REALLY IMPRESSED.</li>
            <li> Working great !!</li>
            <li> I have persistent, stubborn acne and this is working great!</li>
            <li> One of the best acne products I have used.  </li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> What I found was that what seemed to work the best for people was a combination of salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactiv and ance.org and this is the best choice for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and I am very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful my skin feels and looks.</li>
            <li> Perfect substitute for Acne.org treatment.</li>
            <li> The best Benzoyl Peroxide preparation I have ever used, and I have used them all.  </li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;ve been using another brand of 2.5% BP, don&#x27;t assume this will be a perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month now, and I will say I am very happy with how it is going.</li>
            <li> my son is having very good luck with this product and it is gentler than the proactive he was using.</li>
            <li> Very good price for the size.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, the results were incredible.</li>
            <li> Good luck!  </li>
            <li> She had acne breakouts before but during pregnancy it had cleared out and her skin was so beautiful.</li>
            <li> am SO happy with this product-</li>
            <li> And it works great in combination with claror.</li>
            <li> He is so happy with it.</li>
            <li> dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a premium product, but also great value as the tube is 8 oz</li>
            <li> and I can see that she is already happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price.</li>
            <li> This product has worked great for me.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> Great product - works well.</li>
            <li> Have been using for 6 weeks in conjunction with a salicylic acid wash, and I can honestly say this is the best my face has looked in about 30 years.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to this company for making a great product.</li>
            <li> so I researched a great, oil-free moisturizer to use after applying the Claror cream.</li>
            <li> The best value of its kind.</li>
            <li> These before and after pics aren&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> I think that is all you need since it is very effective.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product morning and night for about 6 months now and the difference in my skin is amazing!</li>
            <li> which is amazing!</li>
            <li> Works great, seems like a really good price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Nice size for the price!  </li>
            <li> but I am pleasantly surprise by the results.</li>
            <li> It worked very good, but I still think acne.org works better at keeping any acne at bay.</li>
            <li> Kern is the best and comes in a huge bottle.</li>
            <li> If Benzoyl Peroxide works for you then this is a good brand.</li>
            <li> It seems fairly inexpensive considering the size of the container.</li>
            <li> My husband keeps telling me how good my skin looks.</li>
            <li> My choice will be determined by strength (ideally 0.5% or 1% at most) and price, though if it includes a v.light non-comedogenic moisturizer to counter the BPO drying effect, that would be a plus.</li>
            <li> SO GOOD.</li>
            <li> and I am good.  </li>
            <li> This product is honestly really good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a good lotion.</li>
            <li> sure you have good moisturizer cream also!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I gave it four stars because the return policy is great and the amount of product you get for the price is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I decided to read more and found it was a leave-on cream!  </li>
            <li> I was pleased that it was affordable!</li>
            <li> Would be AWESOME if it became available on Subscribe &amp; Save!! :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> Works like magic to remove zits!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I love claror and wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without it!</li>
            <li> I love the size of the tube, too!</li>
            <li> I was using Neutrogena&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide for years, but I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I find it indistinguishable from the Acne.org gel, which I love!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful BP in comparison to many I&#x27;ve used -- very gentle and calming!</li>
            <li> I also ordered the topix ultra lite moisture dew from amazon and that stuff is amazing as well.</li>
            <li> It has worked amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> Amazing.  </li>
            <li> The results have been amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and a great amount in the tube.</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Acne Treatment is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> Cost effective &amp; works well.  </li>
            <li> Nice stuff.</li>
            <li> Effective and not too drying</li>
            <li> It turns out that benzoyl peroxide is quite effective for me</li>
            <li> Quite effective.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it smelled and felt on my skin...</li>
            <li> My blackheads and therefore pores on my nose have been greatly reduced and the skin on my cheeks is nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Works just as effectively as a 10% solution.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use a good face lotion after applying the Claror gel like the company recommends.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and wish you the best.</li>
            <li> It absorbs very easily in to my skin and doesn&#x27;t over</li>
            <li> It seems to bleach clothing it comes into contact with very easily, but it also treats my acne without overly drying my face.</li>
            <li> The best part with this product is having decent price and more quantity lasts longer.  </li>
            <li> , however, Salicylic acid has been more effective to treat my acne.</li>
            <li> This is by far the very best quality one that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> I have been using benzoyl peroxide gel for over 30 years, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used, including prescription strength!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s all worth it for how great the treatment works.  </li>
            <li> Claror BP works better than the kind you can get at the drugstore because it absorbs without leaving a film.</li>
            <li> It is also more cost effective.</li>
            <li> I am using it in place of step 2 in proactive + and it seems to be a good fit.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the BEST acne products that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Wow... works great!</li>
            <li> Strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> strongly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nowhere near perfect for me, but it&#x27;s a lot better than using nothing.    </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have any dryness when used with a very light, oil-free moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> It has immensely helped my confidence and has brought me so much joy!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to answer them.</li>
            <li> And no, I don&#x27;t work for the company :)</li>
            <li> Overall great product!</li>
            <li> My face was getting better,</li>
            <li> I am pleased with Claror and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> and i have been suffering from acne and tried many products to get these results</li>
            <li> Dermatologists actually recommended that I stick with that option if it worked the best.  </li>
            <li> I began ordering through Amazon, which was a bit more costly.</li>
            <li> but i dont get too many cystic acne anymore.</li>
            <li> Claror&#x27;s product has a better consistency and seems to work quicker than Acne.org&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> it was just so smooth, like it had never been before!</li>
            <li> And as a bonus, nice, smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I use Neutrogena&#x27;s oil-free grapefruit acne wash, and so do many of my friends, who swear it&#x27;s a god-send.</li>
            <li> It would be better with like 5 or 10 Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> Been using the BP from Acne.org for years, but I love that I can get Claror on Prime.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena sells for more than</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just saying Claror is much better in comparison</li>
            <li> I like the product and am 100 % satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Will be getting more for the price you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things.</li>
            <li> my skin would be even better</li>
            <li> I’m sure with some discipline</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv and had okay results</li>
            <li> I have been using it every day since (about four months) and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> This product is thicker than Acne.org and it also feels more potent.</li>
            <li> Perhaps more moisturizer is required.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, this product is phenomenal.  </li>
            <li> I really love this one.</li>
            <li> am age 64 and in the sun most days here in South Florida.  </li>
            <li> Goes on as a gel which is better.</li>
            <li> however I have been use to a bit more Benzoyl Peroxide in my cream.  </li>
            <li> and I love that about it.  </li>
            <li> but then I just apply some more moisturizer</li>
            <li> But I love that I can apply lotion to my skin and not break out</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using acne.org&#x27;s BP for 3+ years now, and decided to give this one a shot because it was a better deal on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I figured the least I could do for the company and to anyone who is reading this is to praise this product as it has made me a much more confident person knowing that my skin looks great every day &amp; I am so happy I found this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Now, I am confident again and able to look anyone in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> thing I like the most about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t flake once it dries.</li>
            <li> and I agree that he looks much better.</li>
            <li> I do still get blemishes but my skin is looking much better than it was.</li>
            <li> but they do show how much better</li>
            <li> This BP was a world of difference -- very effective yet somehow very soothing.</li>
            <li> and I must say that I have beautiful clear skin!</li>
            <li> So far so good!</li>
            <li> It is a great product and I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> This treatment is pretty good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Claror is the latest one I have tried, and it is working great amazingly so far.</li>
            <li> It sounds incredible, but it worked just like that, going deep just like</li>
            <li> For first two weeks I did not see much changes but never gave up just kept using it for a month, believe me my skin started clearing up and incredibly it amazed me after two months all gone.</li>
            <li> I am using Alba Hawaiian oil free moisturizer and the combination is really fantastic!</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin -</li>
            <li> and my dermatologist told me that Benzoyl Peroxide was safe to use while trying to conceive &amp; also safe to use while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I special ordered Alpha Hydrox lotion at first because I&#x27;d heard good things, but it burned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now been using this particular formula for about 6 months, so I think I can give it a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gentle but super effective!</li>
            <li> like to use more of higher end skin care products, so the moisturizer I use now are clinique and fresh products, they are a bit pricy, but in combination of this BP gel and these good moisturizer, so far it worked really good for my skin.</li>
            <li> So, to sum it up, expect dry skin and get a REALLY good moisturizer - you will love the results!  </li>
            <li> Product is fine, but I dislike getting nagged for reviews.</li>
            <li> This one is pretty light to put on though, so that is nice.  </li>
            <li> My Dr. recommended a over the counter 4% and it worked much better on mild acne.</li>
            <li> I’m pregnant and for the most part I see it keeping my acne at bay  </li>
            <li> The reason this is good is because it is appropriate for traveling, which was the whole reason I bought this product in the first place.</li>
            <li> As most Benzoyl Peroxide products it bleaches towels and anything you touch...just be aware!</li>
            <li> Seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE fan of this product and also a HUGE fan of the customer service.</li>
            <li> I used this gel for 1 week and noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying the huge prices for acne creams</li>
            <li> --it goes on smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> It has been so gentle but so effective -</li>
            <li> The premium price is well justified with the 8 OZ tube size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I stuck with the neutrogena on-the-spot acne treatment (vanishing formula) since it was widely available in drug stores and did the job</li>
            <li> it fades scars over time and smooth’s out the bumps from pimples also I just discovered dream dots it helps if you do pop a zit for it not to scar</li>
            <li> My sister have been using this for almost 6 months to keep her skin acne free.</li>
            <li> He will continue to use this product and I will continue to enjoy the cost savings.</li>
            <li> Also, this is cheaper than acne.org&#x27;s BP, plus with free shipping if you have prime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Acne.org BP for 8 years but found this product on Amazon and the free shipping enticed me.</li>
            <li> It goes on really smooth, and does not leave my skin feeling tacky (Like Neutrogena on the spot does).</li>
            <li> and I have been blemish free since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Be patient, use a good moisturizer with sunscreen, and let Claror clear your skin.</li>
            <li> I’m sure if I gave up fast food when I eat it here and there and drink more water</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Good natural face wash.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, tried everything, dermatologist, light therapy, this really works even on stubborn back acne.</li>
            <li> Still acne free and smiling, thanks Claror!!!</li>
            <li> I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt if I could get my money back - the comments were great, and they seemed to be true to their word with non-satisfied customers.</li>
            <li> Make sure you do use a moisturizer on top of this product though because your skin will seem a littler drier than normal.</li>
            <li> This is much better, faster results, very gentle on the skin</li>
            <li> To be honest, my hopes were high</li>
            <li> At first his face got better and now it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s bringing everything to the surface like cleaning his skin.</li>
            <li> After 2 days I was completely clear, with smooth flawless skin on my chest and back.</li>
            <li> Product is exactly as stated, will look at site to get more products.</li>
            <li> I wanted this to work but didn&#x27;t want to get too excited about it.</li>
            <li> It has worked really well for me, but, as I&#x27;ve learned, skin care tends to depend on a great many factors so this may or may not work for you, in short.</li>
            <li> so I rarely forget!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far.</li>
            <li> This absorbs better and is more effective than any other I have used, including the one that has &amp;#34;active&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I guess when you live with the pain of having acnes, you kind of have to try it all.</li>
            <li> THIS Claror WAS the most popular daily treatment cream, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot -</li>
            <li> This is a more cost effective solution than proactive topical lotion and a comparable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8-16</li>
            <li> It is smooth, creamy, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am 28 and have light to mild acne.</li>
            <li> I loved how fast it absorbs into the skin, and it does seem to cause less redness (although that might just be my skin getting used to BP) and the price is good.</li>
            <li> I love that you get a large container of it too.  </li>
            <li> This product completely calmed my skin… I&#x27;m blemish free right now and love it!  </li>
            <li> I am at the MOST stressful point my life has experienced in ten years, yet I&#x27;m glowing and completely clear -</li>
            <li> I would buy it again just to see the full results.</li>
            <li> The consistency is nice &amp; it smooths over your skin and dries clear.</li>
            <li> This works good my acne finally going away afther breaking up alot afther having my baby</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a problem most of my life, and I had never found anything that really helped -- scrubs, toners, creams</li>
            <li> Highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t recommend Claror Acne Treatment more highly!</li>
            <li> Then when i tried it i was pleasantly satisfied to find it also gentle, and didn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> : Claror does a much better job absorbing into my skin.</li>
            <li> I also now use a separate white (almost disposable) hand towel for drying my hands to avoid ruining good towels.    </li>
            <li> I have a 10% as a spot treatment that I put on over this for existing pimples, and that&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> You definitely need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and the shipping was quick</li>
            <li> work- or how quickly.</li>
            <li> I am more than pleased, would and will buy it again and totally recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with this product that I came back to order more.</li>
            <li> I now am a loyal Clarol customer.</li>
            <li> lucky my husband</li>
            <li> People constantly remark that my skin looks so nice, clear and healthy!</li>
            <li> Love this product and would highly recommend to anyone suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> This cream is very good, I usually use clearsil</li>
            <li> It blends easily, does not dry if you don&#x27;t use too much, and gets rid of the pimples quickly and effectively.</li>
            <li> It does not prevent all breakouts but it stops most from starting, and most importantly, it makes those that start fade fast.</li>
            <li> just because I experienced the above does not mean everyone will.</li>
            <li> I tried the acne.org BP regimen, clean and clear BP, etc. etc., and Claror is BY FAR the superior product.</li>
            <li> Some burning is normal, but mine would burn all day, which wasn&#x27;t good on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (Unless you&#x27;really allergic to BP af course!!)  </li>
            <li> Until one day I was researching the most effective ways to treat acne, and I found that a &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; (some sort of scrub to remove the bulk of surface dead skin) along with an exfoliatant (the true treatment) and a lotion was the way to go.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a good job without irritation, but have not had the product long enough to more accurately judge.</li>
            <li> so if half size bottle exist for harf price, it will be much more Costomer friendly and I will give 5 star!!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day, everyday, with an oil-free moisturizer and have great results.</li>
            <li> It has been 3-4 weeks since I started using this product and my skin really has made a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and does not leave a flaky residue, which happens if you put on too much of the neutrogena treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The topical form is really the best so it absorbs to kill what essentially is a bacterial infection on our skin.</li>
            <li> Nice product and works well when used daily!  </li>
            <li> One great thing about this product is that it never completely dried out my skin and made it red or flaky.</li>
            <li> Now my skin looks clear and healthy, even it helped my beard hair follicles to stop clogging after trimming or shaving.</li>
            <li> Claror is 2x the size and worth</li>
            <li> I use two finger&#x27;s length worth of product b/c I&#x27;ve been using simliar benzoyl peroxide products for almost 13 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I switched over to Claror Acne Treatment because it had a number of distinct advantages over the neutrogena brand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Claror is much more gentle on my skin and every time I accidentally put on too much, I just rub it on anyways</li>
            <li> I rarely have any acne on my skin now.</li>
            <li> But the results make it worth it</li>
            <li> When I was trying to use 10% daily, I didn&#x27;t find it to be as effective as this milder treatment.</li>
            <li> While I had success with acne.org BP</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Here I am a month later, and they e-mailed to check in and see how I liked the product &amp; if I had any questions.</li>
            <li> I realize everyone is different, so that suggestion may not work for you, but I just wanted to share because it was not something I had ever thought of or heard about, but it does seem to be a nice addition to this acne treatment.  </li>
            <li> So far, I have been pleased.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been doing wonders - not a miracle worker, but I&#x27;m really happy with my skin, and I&#x27;m not experiencing dry or flaking side effects like one normally might with BP treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for someone who already tried other regimens but did not get best results.</li>
            <li> It is also very easy to apply and use since it is a clear quickly absorbing gel.</li>
            <li> Everyone wondering which skin product to buy: you have to find the right chemical for you.</li>
            <li> I could not be any happier right now.</li>
            <li> 2.5% is the right amount.  </li>
            <li> my skin  is right now.</li>
            <li> This product works just as good if not better than acne.org products and the free two day</li>
            <li> Since my 20&#x27;s, I have paid thousands of dollars to dermatologists for needles in the face, gels, creams,  tanning salons (sun helps - in small doses), pharmacy prescriptions, and had found that Proactiv system was the most effective of all options.</li>
            <li> I have experienced very little skin irritation with this application process.</li>
            <li> Less drying than most others, and probably more</li>
            <li> BP is great for killing trapped bacteria and as a spot treatment, but many people will need a topical exfoliator (like Salicylic acid or an AHA) to compliment a BP regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend a suitable moisturizer to avoid over drying.</li>
            <li> works great, like acne.org if not better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will be only a couple more weeks till my afce is completely clear</li>
            <li> What she liked about Claror is it has only 2.5% strength and is feeling gentle on her skin when used it the right way.</li>
            <li> Over 1 year later: Still going strong!</li>
            <li> Right around the time my Amazon package got shipped to me, I received an e-mail with instructions on exactly how to use the product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product - it will definitely be worth your while!</li>
            <li> My skin also didn&#x27;t dry out from it which is nice</li>
            <li> I do have to use a salicylic acid astringent and a face wash (I have been using Cetyphil Gentle Skin Cleaner or Acnedote Face Wash) to keep my skin more clear.</li>
            <li> Too strong for my 12 year old.</li>
            <li> However, I just really wanted to get my skin cleared up quickly for an event about a month ago</li>
            <li> Wash with warm to hot water, dry, then immediately apply product while your pores are at their widest.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It was very gentle on my skin</li>
            <li> I tried benzoyl peroxide for the first time using this product.</li>
            <li> I have battled with acne for greater than 15 years and tried various medications, to no avail.</li>
            <li> After a very short time of using it only at night, there is a remarkable change on my face.</li>
            <li> At first I thought I had purchased a face wash, so that is how I used it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> After I applied first time I saw difference.</li>
            <li> I love it, and it is the only one I will use from now on!</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing them!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and it really does work!</li>
            <li> We both can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s made his acne disappear after trying out so many products on the market that claim to do the same.</li>
            <li> He gave me a benzoyl peroxide lotion at a higher percentage</li>
            <li> i chose the Claror this time around because it seems to be a better value overall.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is not complicated.</li>
            <li> even though I feel like a pizza face there are people that will love you for who you are its just finding what works for you so that the outside matches the inside that might take awhile</li>
            <li> The first week</li>
            <li> or so my skin was pretty irritated but stuck it out and haven&#x27;t had problems</li>
            <li> Mostly my face was always irritated and red.  </li>
            <li> My completion is so much smoother!  </li>
            <li> Like most I just kept buying the standard 10% BP products at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> My only warning is make sure you wash your hands with soap after applying this lotion because it will bleach/stain your towels/linens.</li>
            <li> At first I used it 2 times a day (morning and evening)</li>
            <li> but again it was a bit slower process since I was use to a higher percentage of benzoyl peroxide.  </li>
            <li> Definitely see better results than anything else I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly the way the company advised to, and I could not be happier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty mind blowing.</li>
            <li> One more item that I have just recently found helps after going on vacation to a place with a beach is that sea water.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Still most of this left...</li>
            <li> and it should work, i had mild acne that ruined my senior year of high school</li>
            <li> Worked great to decrease the black heads on my nose and clear up the acne on my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely acne-prone area around my mouth/lips and honestly tried everything, from going vegan to taking mega doses of supplements like Zinc and of course tons of antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> , it arrived, is a GIANT, long lasting tube, and my skin in ALL HONESTY, is THE BEST it&#x27;s ever been!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m female, in my mid 20s, fair skin and acne prone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY use a good facial lotion.</li>
            <li> I am 32 married man, I really don&#x27;t know why I have had a severe congested skin problem 1 year ago,</li>
            <li> has pretty much cleared the majority of my acne.</li>
            <li> I have used Acne.org&#x27;s regimen in the past (over 5 years ago) and have had good results, so I wanted to start on that again.</li>
            <li> Causes slight drying, but is highly effective.</li>
            <li> After applying make sure it is completely dry before changing your shirts as it does bleach</li>
            <li> I read that 2.5% BP was just as effective as 10% and would cause less redness/irritation, so I decided to buy this product on Amazon</li>
            <li> 3.5 months later and still going strong</li>
            <li> Large amount for the price.</li>
            <li> If I feel something coming on, I use a little extra and it never fully comes in.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think Claror is more or less effective than any other 2.5% BPO.  </li>
            <li> and you get a huge tube at a very low price.</li>
            <li> This is a huge plus to me, because generic store brands do this and it tends to look horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different BPO gels, and this is my favorite, for sure.  </li>
            <li> It can be used during the day and it has not broken ne out.</li>
            <li> but that was too much for my skin.</li>
            <li> And when I do have a bump/zit it heals a LOT faster thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this product its been 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Anyway, because of my Prime membership, this product saves me a bit of money and arrives much faster.  </li>
            <li> Really, without ANY dryness.</li>
            <li> all is said and done, I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This product really cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> Results are fast.</li>
            <li> has been clearing my skin very well</li>
            <li> FAST - Blemishes disappear in 2-4 days.</li>
            <li> AND IT CLEARS MY ACNE UP REALLY FAST.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> Goes on like a lotion- not sticky or oily and absorbs fast.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> : If I put on too much Claror, nothing noticeable happens to the appearance of my face.</li>
            <li> When I put on too much neutrogena, my face gets noticeable lighter than my neck, which makes it seem like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of make-up, which is not the look</li>
            <li> /&gt;4) Gentleness: Too much neutrogena makes my skin burn</li>
            <li> Wash gently with cerave cleanser and then use claror cream.</li>
            <li> Be gentle when washing and putting the cream on your face.</li>
            <li> Reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> That being said, Benzoyl Peroxide is a drug and is very drying.</li>
            <li> I think it kills the bacteria really well.</li>
            <li> I was very surprise that this stuff really worked.  </li>
            <li> and this really cleared my skin before i went to college.</li>
            <li> My face looks much clearer.</li>
            <li> Topix is a gentle wash and neither product overly dries my skin.  </li>
            <li> Have had acne practically my whole life</li>
            <li> It washes off my hands really well and hasn&#x27;t accidentally bleached any of my stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acnea, but my skin is very oily and needs to be cleaned every day.</li>
            <li> but this cream is very concentrated , if I can say so.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> This product works really well, and is very affordable.</li>
            <li> It is the only product I have found that keeps my face acne free (and trust me</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t experience the dryness really.</li>
            <li> It really work.</li>
            <li> and it works really well for my oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I absolutely adore this product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t use lotion, your skin can also react to you taking away all its natural oils by starting to over produce more oil.</li>
            <li> have always known that benzoyl peroxide is effective at treating acne, but it had always left my skin very red and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You must be prepared for several weeks of redness and itching before being able to increase the amount used and clear your skin.</li>
            <li> I had tried many products including Proactiv and Dermalogica, and they ended up being incredibly expensive and not as effective as Claror.</li>
            <li> Goes on incredibly light and clear, and absorbs super-quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> only drawback is that you have to be super consistent-</li>
            <li> His skin quickly cleared up after the initial breakout and he hasn&#x27;t had problems since, but be aware of the possibility of having to adjust to the product.</li>
            <li> You have to find the right combination of all three to get completely clear</li>
            <li> Definitely need to use other products with it, but it is a good product for what it is.use</li>
            <li> I still have a week or two of use left in the original bottle, but I don&#x27;t want to take a chance of running out.</li>
            <li> Since beginning to use this product a month ago I have seen a significant decrease in blemishes on my back.  </li>
            <li> purchased it for my daughter who tried so many other brands.</li>
            <li> It is better than any other acne product I have tried.</li>
            <li> After that, I just took a quick stop by Bi-Mart (I think most drug stores will likely carry it too), picked up some Neutrogena oil-free sensitive skin facial moisturizer, and it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and after the first week,  I noticed a huge difference!  </li>
            <li> Cleans the pores well and dries out the skin which is fine as long as you accompany with a moisturizer</li>
            <li> After swimming in the ocean almost every day, my skin was more clear than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> Since using this gel I have been able to clear my back completely!  </li>
            <li> It is a great big tube, will last a REALLY long time!!  </li>
            <li> This is a very good cream but the only bad thing is that they dont add more Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> It has ZERO ingredients that are comedogenic (clogging pores)  and no fragrance, no oil, every single ingredient is safe for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> have pretty clear skin when I use this product at night and in the morning.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the first product that has done -anything- to clear my face.</li>
            <li> far as the Proactiv daily repairing cream; it&#x27;s a small bottle and lasts a long time, but not 100% effective in clearing up my blemishes, just more effective than any other options I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very effective 👍way better than other expensive promising products.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective topical acne medication I&#x27;ve used - my acne cleared up in a few days, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin when used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Does a better job than any previous Benzoyl Peroxide cream I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s rare for me to give such a lengthy review, but when you spend so long crying about your skin and wishing you could wear a mask to seeing your face be almost completely clear in a matter of weeks.... it&#x27;s a really beautiful thing.</li>
            <li> I tried several different BP products while they all worked, this one is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne on my face.</li>
            <li> I looked and researched some more before I was finally drawn in by the money back guarantee of this product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 49 and still get occasional breakouts and this product nips them in the bud quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has been 4 weeks and there is only mild improvement on my skin, hopefully it will continue to work</li>
            <li> I am currently 34 and trying to become pregnant.</li>
            <li> I was using the severe 10% benzoyl peroxide acnefree.com stuff (you can buy the sets in most stores) and it was always a struggle to keep my face hydrated because it dried it out so much.</li>
            <li> Also, when using any set of stuff (not just the kind I was using), I have found that they put so many ingredients in the lotion, face wash, toner, and retinoid cream that my pores seem to easily get clogged and cause worse acne, especially when your face gets dried out so much that you have to use a ton of lotion too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Comparable to the highly advertised celebrity endorsed (over priced) brand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I began experiencing acne when I was in high school.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used many high-end, really expensive product in my war with acne, but this product is just really honest and simple, and just as effective if not more</li>
            <li> The smell is exactly the same as other benzoyl peroxide products I&#x27;ve used, this just has a better consistency.</li>
            <li> Yes, you pay a little more</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t at first because I thought my skin was too oily, but after two days I started getting major flaking.</li>
            <li> This one is amazing to say the least.  </li>
            <li> This gel is gentle on sensitive skin types.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s normal.</li>
            <li> left, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> The key to success with this product is to be generous with the amount you apply.</li>
            <li> and it’s like a sticker so it helps you form not going back and further irritating the area best of luck to</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is definitely worth trying</li>
            <li> In the beginning I was using an index finger&#x27;s length of gel, but now am only using 1 inch worth because of the over drying.</li>
            <li> This high quality Gel (NOT Cream) works and leaves ones skin very clear.</li>
            <li> It will over dry your skin if you don&#x27;t use a good lotion though, but the gel itself disappears once it has dried.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t discolor the towel right away, but sometime in the next 2~3 days, you&#x27;ll notice bleached patches on the towel.  </li>
            <li> I only use it 2-3 times per week which seems to be about right for my skin.</li>
            <li> Clarorskincare version is therefore far more convenient than Dr. Song&#x27;s, and I appreciate that the lid tightly seals the product from leaking.</li>
            <li> I myself can see there is a visible reduction in redness and new breakouts (which by the way used to be 1 or 2 new breakouts</li>
            <li> I did not experience any new breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and it was clearly hormonal</li>
            <li> , I was very ready to just go the acne.org route and cross my fingers.</li>
            <li> but I personally do like this product very much, so here you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even if I do get a few spots, it goes away pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> My problem with that, is that the only local place to purchase, was an automated kiosk in a mall, that many times was not working properly.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s humid here in Texas, so your face can get pretty gross.</li>
            <li> First of all, I understand that not every product will work for every individual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day rather than the recommended twice a day and saw results in the first couple days.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> His whole back started becoming brighter and the acne went down and was gone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The truth is most acne treatments you see infomercials for are just benzoyl peroxide and some other stuff that&#x27;s really just fluff to pad the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married soon and I adopted this cream in my beauty regiment in an attempt to clear my skin before the big day.</li>
            <li> If using daily, and that &amp;#34;90 day&amp;#34; supply is FALSE advertising, as it cannot clean twice a day, an adult face, for more than 30-40 days.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months and my persistent adult acne is completely gone!</li>
            <li> To be honest I haven&#x27;t been taking care of my skin much, just using random regimens as I travel and live in hotels.</li>
            <li> Can easily apply a thin layer to my whole face in the morning, and by the time I get to work it has absorbed completely and is totally invisible - there is no shine or greasiness to my face.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works very well for what it is and has a limited amount of ingredients that do not dry my face out very much.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear after months of fighting with it.  </li>
            <li> It took no time at all to clear up.  </li>
            <li> As far as the actual product, I have found that it&#x27;s much thicker than the Acne.org product, which I like.</li>
            <li> After two weeks, my skin started to clear.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this for 2 weeks now and it has helped clear up his acne.</li>
            <li> and since then my skin has been almost clear.</li>
            <li> Yes it does clear my bumps when I break out in 3-4 days</li>
            <li> I will continue using it until my skin is completely clear from acne.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review in hopes of helping someone clear their acne.  </li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to work to clear my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is clear.</li>
            <li> This product worked quickly to clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and broke out in the forehead and chin area frequently.  </li>
            <li> , I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 38 years old</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> I am not recommending you do so, but the issue is, the product absorbs and is natural looking at all times.  </li>
            <li> 12 year old daughter going through puberty and lots of acne.</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this really works for me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much, and I used it religiously.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s quite young still</li>
            <li> WOW,</li>
            <li> I purchased this product out of desperation because nothing I have tried has worked thus far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used facial scrub washes my whole life</li>
            <li> Before application, cleanse your skin with some sort of scrub so that the product can get directly into your pores.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have to be COMPLETELY rubbed in, but mostly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin as well.</li>
            <li> It has completely cleared my skin, I have had problems with acne for 10 years.</li>
            <li> I have been battling with adult onset rosacea and have felt so embarrassed by it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used AcneFree Sensitive and Acne.</li>
            <li> But this has not happened so far.</li>
            <li> But, this one is far exceeding my expectations.</li>
            <li> I bought the product as an alternative to Acne.org Acne Treatment, and so far it has done it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for about 2 weeks and so far it has prevented breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I can’t do my old work outs and go to the beach being</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an 18 year old girl with medium to severe acne.</li>
            <li> SO FAR</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t magic but at least helps.</li>
            <li> that it is very light/not oily on my skin and at the same time not overly drying.  </li>
            <li> : I have sensitive skin so</li>
            <li> and it left my skin burning intensely after 4 consecutive days.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really like the product.</li>
            <li> After washing my face with a creamy, oil-free cleanser, I use an astringent for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Still get some little pimples now and again but a significant improvement has been shown</li>
            <li> It feels comfortable and does not burn such as other ones that I have used.</li>
            <li> Helped clear my acne when no other product worked!</li>
            <li> , moisturizer and sunscreen are soooo important, can not stress this enough, BPO will make your skin dry but also extra sensitive to sun.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have had no major breakouts and my skin is so much smoother, clearer and softer.</li>
            <li> Start slow and use moisturizer and enjoy your new, clear skin.</li>
            <li> :)) I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;m gonna buy another tube, because it&#x27;s so big, but I would recommended to every one with oily skin.</li>
            <li> My skin is oily in the T-zone, normal elsewhere; the treatment controls my oily regions, but does not leave my normal areas dry.</li>
            <li> Very glad I bought this and needless to say I plan to be a repeat customer.    </li>
            <li> I guess thats why my skin did not clear as fast as in 30 days.  </li>
            <li> It is more like a light gel than the thick white creams I was used to using in the past.  </li>
            <li> In the 2 weeks I have been using this gel I have not had any new acne, so I believe it is working just as effectively as my last product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin much either which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I am 44yrs old, and suffer regularly, from adult stress/hormone acne.  </li>
            <li> and they never did much, so I started out with a solid twice a day application of two to three pea-sized amounts of this stuff all over my face, and the next day I could already feel a difference.</li>
            <li> This product really really really helped me, i definitely keep this product as my routine and part of daily life.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m writing one on this product because in the past 2 weeks my face looks better than it has in a really long time.  </li>
            <li> My missing product was replaced and my product was replaced quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used acne.org products happily for years and finally wanted a change from the expensive and long shipping process.</li>
            <li> I am a busy 25 year old Mom who has little time to fool with an intense skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> The antibiotics and prescription lotions helped, but I reached the point where the nodules were gone but general acne remained.</li>
            <li> After using the product properly now, my face is totally clear.  </li>
            <li> Within one week of using this product, twice daily, my skin is clear again.</li>
            <li> As long as I don&#x27;t go above 2.5 to 3%, my face clears up without so much of the side effects.</li>
            <li> benzoyl peroxide gel is easier to apply than a cream based benzoyl peroxide and dries clear on your skin rather than white.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne forever and am approaching my 60th birthday this year.</li>
            <li> We are following directions and so far the product is working well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 26 year old female</li>
            <li> My skin is very oily, acne and wide pores.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old female and I have dealt with breakouts on and off since I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have extra sensitive skin like mine, this would probably work.  </li>
            <li> Just red marks on my shoulders from old acne remains.</li>
            <li> spent 10 years avoiding making eye contact with people and suffering from acne really affected my self esteem.</li>
            <li> I will say that my acne got worse before it got better</li>
            <li> Proactiv made her skin worse with more breakouts and redness all over the cheeks and forehead.</li>
            <li> My skin is MUCH clearer and new acne stopped coming after just a few applications.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had this issue with the acne.org BP (after the first two weeks or so), so I found this rather odd.</li>
            <li> It seems pricey at first but the tube is large and lasts a long time, so actually it works out to being less costly than all those tiny 10% tubes.    </li>
            <li> Since I appreciate other&#x27;s reviews so much, I thought for a change I would write one on Claror, since it works so well for me.</li>
            <li> Then tried using every other day, but I&#x27;m still breaking out just as much.</li>
            <li> Just some advice: do invest in a light moisturizer because this will dry out your face, this burns a bit at first so don&#x27;t be alarmed, don&#x27;t be discouraged by the few pimples that pop up after a few days of application, they will disappear soon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle, light, and vaguely moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since 5th grade, and boy is it not fun being the first and only kid with acne.</li>
            <li> I only do occasionally in order to cover up old acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I tried a myriad of over-the-counter products, saw three dermatologists, took antibiotics daily for about two years, used topical antibiotics, natural remedies...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars, because it is still very drying even I only use it once a day and with little amount, but it could just be my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It may make your skin a little red and dry at first but your skin adapts and that is coming from a person who has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> He even tried using antibiotics prescribed by the doctor and that barely helped, basically the acne came back.</li>
            <li> well it&#x27;s nature course and tried various products which are expensive and spent lot of time dedicated to my good diet etc., but never helped me, all over my fore head with tones of clogged pores, bumps and scares that makes me  low self esteemed with my job and social life.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I do not live near a beach, but I have purchased a sea water mix for aquariums and have been applying a solution of that to my face once or twice a day as well</li>
            <li> I was looking for a big tube of benzoyl peroxide since the store only has the little tubes (&amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34;).  </li>
            <li> other internal medications for the first time in a long time!</li>
            <li> It does cause a little irritation for me if I don&#x27;t use lotion after, but if I do it really helps.</li>
            <li> You only need to use little bit of the claror cream, when I use too much my face gets red like its burnt from the sun.</li>
            <li> Also felt super dry and hard to move.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t paid attention to staining, because I&#x27;m used to being very careful with it (white linens, wearing old shirts to bed, etc.).</li>
            <li> With one small quantity I can cover the whole face without overseeing, even tho</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sting and a tiny bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> This product alone however would not be enough to combat my severe acne and definitely needs to be supplemented with other products such as facial washes, salicylic acid, and for myself, sea water.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge, will last for ages, and after trying it for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve discovered it works just as well, if not better, without drying out my skin!</li>
            <li> Some much stronger than this, some less, some in other formats.</li>
            <li> I apply a liberal amount each night before bed, let it dry then wear a white t shirt (it does bleach).  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just crazy to me that this simple solution works so much better than anything I have tried with zero side effects.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and maybe others with less sensitive skin won&#x27;t have this issue.</li>
            <li> but even that is managed by moisturizing or spot treating less frequently.</li>
            <li> This has been my routine for the last few months and has given me almost perfectly clear skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle drug, but I think that it helped a little with my adult acne.</li>
            <li> The product itself is less expensive than Claror (by 5 or so dollars), but free shipping only applies to orders over $40, and that&#x27;s only standard shipping.</li>
            <li> This gel is great--it hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out at all, and it has helped clear up my acne.  </li>
            <li> well as long you exfoliate (or it just sits on clogged pores).</li>
            <li> Alpha Hydrox is high quality and also fights wrinkles, but it&#x27;s very harsh on your skin and is known for problems with burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I used to get them everyday, near my mouth, and pop them).  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that it sort of smells like a public swimming pool when you first apply it, but the smell goes away in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> My skin is not completely clear, but I feel like I don&#x27;t break out as often, and any break outs that occur are easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Since I began using everything I&#x27;ve listed at about the same time, it&#x27;s impossible to say what&#x27;s helping the most.</li>
            <li> The generic medication didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the branded drug did, so I resorted to regular facials &amp; expensive products to try to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Other BP products made my eyes puff up, my skin flake, and caused immense irritation.</li>
            <li> Not only does this product feel like a lotion when putting it on my face, but it absorbs within minutes and has cleared up my complexion quicker than other products.</li>
            <li> My skin was softer and smoother, and I probably hindered my treatment a little with how much I touched it -</li>
            <li> My wife, who is currently using this product, had started breaking out couple of months back when our little daughter turned one.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, the acne will come back as with any other acne product that you stop using.  </li>
            <li> I am giving 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really have a long term outcome with using this product yet and my skin is usually worse in the winter, so the big test is still to come.  </li>
            <li> Also, moisturizer is a must- this will dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> This can dry out skin to the point of flaking if you use it alone.  </li>
            <li> It will also stain and bleach non-white towels if there is even a minute smidge of product remaining on your hands when you dry them.  </li>
            <li> It is Benzoyl Peroxide, so it will dry your skin, but as the instructions point out, use a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Some products made my face extremely dry and some didn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> If I skip an application of lotion after using this gel/cream I will experience some dry, shedding skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I seem to have some  dry patches of skin if I overdo the spot treatments</li>
            <li> at least I feel like I have a chance at getting my old skin back after this because of this cream plus there glycolic acid cream !</li>
            <li> In the following days, my acne slowly lessened, and then was gone almost completely</li>
            <li> At two weeks it continued, with no new spots and the redness lightening.</li>
            <li> No new breakouts have appeared since a couple of weeks ago when I started using the product.</li>
            <li> It allows me to apply a generous layer very gently rather than spreading a thin, runny coat over my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I have had a single acne in 2 months which is a miracle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Claror BP for about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t had a single pimple.</li>
            <li> It also helps clear the blemishes from past breakouts.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s really not much better as an adult, when all of your friends have never had an acne problem.</li>
            <li> I seriously think this will last me nearly 6 months.</li>
            <li> (interesting how 2.5% strength is almost impossible to find on drugstore shelves).  </li>
            <li> but I only use about half or a quarter of that</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin slightly red tint and also very dry and tight.</li>
            <li> This product was a little cheaper for the same amount.</li>
            <li> My skin is clearing up and those tiny little bumps all over my face are going away.</li>
            <li> I use this after wet shaving and it prevents any break outs.</li>
            <li> I have had acne for roughly 15 years and have used a variety of products, both over the counter and prescription.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually going without make up except for a few scars that I have to cover.</li>
            <li> Even during my teen years when others were having trouble.</li>
            <li> About 6 weeks ago I spent over $100 at Aveda on their acne line and nothing changed though I used it for almost a month.  </li>
            <li> The gel consistency does not dry in the least, and keeps my skin plump, hydrated, not greasy, nor dry.</li>
            <li> Therefore, if you are just starting to use this product, I would recommend using a lot less (maybe half finger&#x27;s length) and then gradually increase as your skin becomes accustomed to the BP.</li>
            <li> applied to my daughter morning and evening faithfully and saw no positive results.</li>
            <li> Having suffered from adult acne for the past few years, I&#x27;ve tried everything I could find.  </li>
            <li> Treating acne is a very frustrating process, because it involves finding the right cleanser, benzoyl peroxide gel, and lotion.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> One tip when using, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You should still use lotion, but you can use this product without making your face a dry, burny mess of flaky skin.</li>
            <li> It may be the salicylic acid in some other products like proactive.</li>
            <li> always have worn white clothes to avoid bleaching when using it, so I&#x27;m not sure if it discolors clothes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After spending tons of money on facials and other products, I thought I would try Claror.</li>
            <li> I did some search found this product and gave it a try like i did try before with other men products.</li>
            <li> I like that the product comes in a tube with a cap lid, as opposed to the pump style bottle, like some of the other brands offer.</li>
            <li> After trying other leading brands for almost two years, stumbled upon Claror Acne Treatment.  </li>
            <li> but it was so pricy for such a small amount.</li>
            <li> A simple application of a small amount of the lotion, once-daily, cleared up my skin within 2 days.</li>
            <li> Me on the other hand just started using this  </li>
            <li> Now I use it about every other day and it still works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to try other products in their system.</li>
            <li> It seems that it would need to work in conjunction with other products.</li>
            <li> It will bleach whatever it comes into contact with, so be careful with your towels and sheets!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has helped when other things haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> One BIG caveat: it&#x27;s VERY harsh and drying.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to have about the same level of effectiveness in terms of keeping acne at bay, but there&#x27;s something about this formula that is VERY harsh and drying, even after giving my skin months to acclimate.</li>
            <li> It fades dark marks and as long as you don&#x27;t pop or pick at your zits, they will disappear within a few days.</li>
            <li> and I can see the improvements in my acne and dark spots.</li>
            <li> Wanted to return it but won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not worth the headache</li>
            <li> ranging from $6-8 for 0.75 ounce tube, the neutrogena treatment was really expensive considering how much it gave you.</li>
            <li> With other tube containers like this, there&#x27;s a risk that the gel inside slowly leaks, resulting in a mess on the inside of the cap every time you open it.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got facial acne and have been smothering your face in those thick 10% BP creams like I was, you need to try this.  </li>
            <li> I recommend putting it in the fridge and icing down your face to reduce inflammation.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it is too strong and ended up breaking my face out even worse.  </li>
            <li> Almost all of my problem areas are cleared up and the remaining dark spots from previous acne are fading away.</li>
            <li> I started using this as well as a few other adjustments to my skin care regiment</li>
            <li> (I still can&#x27;t get rid of those pesky black heads..</li>
            <li> Its been about 2 and a half weeks</li>
            <li> I previously bought the &#x27;Dr. Song&#x27; version of 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, which I use at home.</li>
            <li> We have done the Pro-Active and X-Out treatments, and, this product is comparable for much less money.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve gotten to where I just have a few bumps instead of a trail across my forehead and down my temples.</li>
            <li> I also find it is much less harsh and drying on my skin.</li>
            <li> But let me be the first to say that they&#x27;ll have to pry this thing from my cold dead hands.</li>
            <li> little by little.  </li>
            <li> A lot of healing for a little money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar with this brand, but I like their face cream.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin a little itchy after applying to skin, and also dries it out a little.</li>
            <li> I saw all the reviews about this product excessively drying other people&#x27;s skin out but having read about use of this type of product via Acne.org and the Acne.org treatment, I knew that my skin would suffer a lot</li>
            <li> It lightened up my redness and little bumps are going away.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over two months now.</li>
            <li> It has little to no odor, is not greasy or heavy, is not over drying, and doesn&#x27;t bleach out your hair line or eyebrows if any gets on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Everything either dried my skin out or made my acne even worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up quite a bit after using this for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used this everyday and NO ACNE.  </li>
            <li> Use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> but after a few weeks I reduced that to 1 time (before bed).  </li>
            <li> I do sometimes get a bit of dried out skin</li>
            <li> I let it absorb a few minutes and follow up with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Not too harsh</li>
            <li> I do use a heavy moisturizer with jojoba oil, so</li>
            <li> Well, that was a few months ago</li>
            <li> I used Differin gel, Clindamycin, Retin A, Clearasil products, Neutrogena products, Oil of Olay products, Proactiv, Murad, Tretin-X cream, tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, and mud masks to name a few.</li>
            <li> But Dr. Song&#x27;s bottle is not good for putting into a suitcase, as you need to lock the pump -- and even doing so is not a guarantee that it won&#x27;t come loose in your luggage</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am not completely clear yet, but after 6 week of use, my skin is defiantly less inflamed, the areas where it would be red like crazy before are now less irritated,the pimple I got during my period are smaller and less painful.</li>
            <li> I started with very little, pea size at night before I sleep.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worked just as well (if not better) than Acne.org&#x27;s BP.</li>
            <li> now, I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> did not start with the usual twice per day usage</li>
            <li> I still got breakout around my cheeks and sometime forehead, but those would usually diminish within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small dots of whiteheads and the small lump-like cysts under my skin are all gone.</li>
            <li> Works without excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> Works as well as prescription creams I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for the past 15 years and have tried every treatment under the sun (Accutane, Proactiv, salicylic acid, tea tree oil, etc).</li>
            <li> I use it to keep small outbreaks of \\&quot;shaving acne\\&quot; in check.  </li>
            <li> and even then I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all off.  </li>
            <li> I bought some Proactive from a seller on amazon, but did not have the results I did in the past, so I purchased this</li>
            <li> My skin did get drier than usual after I started using it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and the transformation is unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> I usually buy my BP from Acne.org, but I decided to give Claror a try this time .</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product.</li>
            <li> I did notice a clearer, smoother feeling to my skin, but I am not sure that this is preventative.</li>
            <li> As other women who deal with acne know, hormonal changes make everything worse.</li>
            <li> I hope that this stuff helps many people especially those like me who have tried everything from harsh prescription toners and creams to Accutane (twice in my case) and still have horrible, painful acne.</li>
            <li> I have had bad white heads for the past few months.</li>
            <li> Then all of of a sudden, I hit 30 and my face went crazy.</li>
            <li> It dries well, even though it&#x27;s thick.   </li>
            <li> ALSO, you are forced to purchase the &amp;#34;90 day supply&amp;#34; of cleanser.</li>
            <li> you acne sucks but keeps shallow people you don’t need in your life away</li>
            <li> I had hormonal acne on my lower cheeks and jawline that was getting increasingly worse, and I&#x27;d tried just about everything in the past.</li>
            <li> and I still find that my skin is red, tight, painful, and angry for 3-4 hours afterward.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong with you or your skin, remember, you just have to find a way to destroy the infection.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> But at least I know what to use to cure it!</li>
            <li> No more!!</li>
            <li> Apply a thin layer and combine with a quality moisturizer like Cephatil.</li>
            <li> Clears up my acne without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> pregers would suck way worse without this</li>
            <li> I still use sometimes when it seems come out and it will never get worse and gone...</li>
            <li> disgusting, but want to share types of issues that were completely cleared), that all disappeared in 3 days.</li>
            <li> He has bad acne where the pimples are red, they get swollen, and are really painful.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did nothing for my acne...</li>
            <li> so I was skeptical that this would help with my acne or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She decided to try Claror as she already tried and failed with Proactiv skin care kit.</li>
            <li> All the reviews are fake..</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> The medication she prescribed me was ridiculously expensive (even with insurance), so I drove away from the pharmacy without my script &amp; decided to look on Amazon for Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> At least once a week I would have zit/blemish and it always frustrated me.</li>
            <li> Seriously!!  </li>
            <li> My skin has never been happier and my stupid scars from my stupid gross face picking habits are going away.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been horrible but since I was 16 (49 now) I have always had slight issues.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find a 2-3% B.O. product (they are all &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; in stores).</li>
            <li> I went to a dermatologist who prescribed a very expensive wash and cream regimen that didn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I used to use Proactive, but it was very expensive.  </li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who has really bad acne.</li>
            <li> but it did make her skin as bad as the stronger 10% over the counter</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying neutrogena on-the-spot acne treatment is a bad product.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t bad, but it is not a miracle cure.</li>
            <li> this product 2-3 times per day and even at this amount, my face is not drying out bad at all.</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I do have to admit I hate having to use anything on my face as I had hoped at age 63</li>
            <li> , it is very painful and embarrassing.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m at three weeks, and it&#x27;s reduced to a couple of spots that had been the worst and some lingering redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible skin since having my twin boys.  </li>
            <li> and at the very worst, lose $20 out of my pocket (though the seller does offer your money back).&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am giving it four stars because it&#x27;s too soon to actually see results but up to now Claror is helping my sons acne. At first his face got better and now it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s bringing everything to the surface like cleaning his skin. I would buy it again just to see the full results.</li>
            <li> Everyone wondering which skin product to buy: you have to find the right chemical for you. It may be the salicylic acid in some other products like proactive. But if you&#x27;re like me and things irritate your skin and you&#x27;ve tried everything at the store, you&#x27;re at a loss. I tried benzoyl peroxide for the first time using this product. The topical form is really the best so it absorbs to kill what essentially is a bacterial infection on our skin. This product has a low dose and the topical avenue came together to work day 1! After 2 days I was completely clear, with smooth flawless skin on my chest and back. It has immensely helped my confidence and has brought me so much joy! It sounds incredible, but it worked just like that, going deep just like the bottle said to kill the propionibacterium acnes bacteria on my skin. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with you or your skin, remember, you just have to find a way to destroy the infection. And if you haven&#x27;t tried this chemical, this product could be your saving grace within your hopeless situation like me. I&#x27;d give it a try if you back chest and back skin problems!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Large amount for the price. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Worked just as well (if not better) than Acne.org&#x27;s BP. Cleared up my face again!</li>
            <li> It works so well, and it is not drying!</li>
            <li> Product was as described and the shipping was quick</li>
            <li> Just like any BPO product, it takes time to work.  This made a noticeable difference within about 2 week.  I&#x27;ve used a few different BPO gels, and this is my favorite, for sure.  Less drying than most others, and probably more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a monster tube, so you dont need to worry about paying tons of money for a tiny amount.  I seriously think this will last me nearly 6 months.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. The consistency is nice &amp; it smooths over your skin and dries clear. It feels comfortable and does not burn such as other ones that I have used. It seems to be working! The smell is exactly the same as other benzoyl peroxide products I&#x27;ve used, this just has a better consistency.</li>
            <li> This is the most effective topical acne medication I&#x27;ve used - my acne cleared up in a few days, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin when used twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always have worn white clothes to avoid bleaching when using it, so I&#x27;m not sure if it discolors clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that you have to be super consistent- I&#x27;ve noticed that acne comes back after 1-2 days of non-use.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I tried this product.  My skin is clear after months of fighting with it.  I have combination skin and broke out in the forehead and chin area frequently.  This product completely calmed my skin… I&#x27;m blemish free right now and love it!  I will continue to buy this product!</li>
            <li> I had no idea how well this was actually going to work- or how quickly. I had hormonal acne on my lower cheeks and jawline that was getting increasingly worse, and I&#x27;d tried just about everything in the past. Now that my I&#x27;m older and it was clearly hormonal, I was very ready to just go the acne.org route and cross my fingers. On a whim I tried this one instead (to save a couple bucks, you know) and from the looks of it, it works just as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one week there was visible improvement, with the acne diminishing to a point where make up could almost fully disguise it. At two weeks it continued, with no new spots and the redness lightening. Now I&#x27;m at three weeks, and it&#x27;s reduced to a couple of spots that had been the worst and some lingering redness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am SO happy with this product- it&#x27;s rare for me to give such a lengthy review, but when you spend so long crying about your skin and wishing you could wear a mask to seeing your face be almost completely clear in a matter of weeks.... it&#x27;s a really beautiful thing.</li>
            <li> I have battled with acne for greater than 15 years and tried various medications, to no avail. This drug has miraculously been working for me. I get a combination of cystic acne and severe hyperpigmentation. After a very short time of using it only at night, there is a remarkable change on my face. My skin is MUCH clearer and new acne stopped coming after just a few applications. Strongly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> used this for about 5-6weeks now, I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but I personally do like this product very much, so here you go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not start with the usual twice per day usage, I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t think my face can take all that stuff twice per day.&lt;br /&gt;Also I started with very little, pea size at night before I sleep.&lt;br /&gt; I guess thats why my skin did not clear as fast as in 30 days.  but I would rather wait than bear the pain of burning.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;Also, moisturizer and sunscreen are soooo important, can not stress this enough, BPO will make your skin dry but also extra sensitive to sun.&lt;br /&gt;So use a sunscreen to avoid look like a lobster, especially if you use BPO in the morning as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use more of higher end skin care products, so the moisturizer I use now are clinique and fresh products, they are a bit pricy, but in combination of this BP gel and these good moisturizer, so far it worked really good for my skin. In terms of a sunscreen, I use a bb cream with a sunscreen to cover up the existing pimple and redness, by doing so not only i can have a bit of coverage but also have sunscreen protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not completely clear yet, but after 6 week of use, my skin is defiantly less inflamed, the areas where it would be red like crazy before are now less irritated,the pimple I got during my period are smaller and less painful. I still got breakout around my cheeks and sometime forehead, but those would usually diminish within a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I say this is a miracle product that would terminate acne forever? No, I doubt anything on earth could do that, but would this gel get your acne under control? You bet. I have used many high-end, really expensive product in my war with acne, but this product is just really honest and simple, and just as effective if not more so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the 4 stars, because it is still very drying even I only use it once a day and with little amount, but it could just be my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Today is 7/10/15 and I just received my second order of this. I still use this product every night. I wanted to give people a suggestion on a cream that is awesome. It can be used during the day and it has not broken ne out. It&#x27;s moisturel cream. And it works great in combination with claror. Just wanted to share.   If I could give this treatment 10 stars I would. This stuff is awesome. I am 38 years old and I&#x27;ve always had acne prone skin. My skin tends to break out on my cheeks. I did some research and came across this on amazon. Yes, you pay a little more BUT you get a lot of product. It will last a while!!! In the beginning I used it in the morning and the evening but that was too much for my skin. Now I only use it in the evening. I also ordered the topix ultra lite moisture dew from amazon and that stuff is amazing as well. You can follow the claror up with the topix for moisture. I can only recommend this product. My skin cleared up. And when I do have a bump/zit it heals a LOT faster thanks to this product. Please let me know if you have any questions about this. I&#x27;d love to answer them. And no, I don&#x27;t work for the company :) I&#x27;m just a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible skin since having my twin boys.  I did a lot of research to find a product to help by acne prone skin.  I use this everyday and after the first week,  I noticed a huge difference!  I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all.  I use a moisturizer after.  Overall great product!</li>
            <li> I really like this product its been 3 weeks and I can see the improvements in my acne and dark spots. I would definitely recommend it to others</li>
            <li> Cost effective &amp; works well.  I like the gel formulation--it goes on smoothly &amp; doesn&#x27;t feel sticky.</li>
            <li> this has def cleared up my upper back and face !</li>
            <li> I have suffered from adult acne forever and am approaching my 60th birthday this year. After spending tons of money on facials and other products, I thought I would try Claror. It has worked amazingly well.  The small dots of whiteheads and the small lump-like cysts under my skin are all gone. It took no time at all to clear up.  I have to admit something.  At first I thought I had purchased a face wash, so that is how I used it.  My face was getting better, little by little.  I decided to read more and found it was a leave-on cream!  After using the product properly now, my face is totally clear.  Like some mentioned, you can put on &amp;#34;excessive&amp;#34; amounts and it doesn&#x27;t leave any white looking smears.  I am not recommending you do so, but the issue is, the product absorbs and is natural looking at all times.  I am more than pleased, would and will buy it again and totally recommend this to others. Since I appreciate other&#x27;s reviews so much, I thought for a change I would write one on Claror, since it works so well for me.</li>
            <li> 12 year old daughter going through puberty and lots of acne. We are following directions and so far the product is working well. She can see the results after 2 weeks and we do  not have to remind her anymore to treat her face. The results make her want to continue without being told. We did end up buying a greaseless face moisturize, and that got rid of the skin drying out. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product several weeks ago. I had been using the Acne.org product, but I went looking for alternatives because of the cost of the Acne.org product. The product itself is less expensive than Claror (by 5 or so dollars), but free shipping only applies to orders over $40, and that&#x27;s only standard shipping. Anyway, because of my Prime membership, this product saves me a bit of money and arrives much faster.  As far as the actual product, I have found that it&#x27;s much thicker than the Acne.org product, which I like. It allows me to apply a generous layer very gently rather than spreading a thin, runny coat over my face. I haven&#x27;t had peeling, but I don&#x27;t have peeling with the Acne.org treatment either, so that&#x27;s normal. I haven&#x27;t paid attention to staining, because I&#x27;m used to being very careful with it (white linens, wearing old shirts to bed, etc.). It dries well, even though it&#x27;s thick.   All that to say, I&#x27;m a fan of this product. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Product is fine, but I dislike getting nagged for reviews.</li>
            <li> Nice product and works well when used daily!  Very difficult to find a 2-3% B.O. product (they are all &amp;#34;extra strength&amp;#34; in stores). I am pleased with Claror and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have used acne.org products happily for years and finally wanted a change from the expensive and long shipping process. This product works just as good if not better than acne.org products and the free two day shipping was awesome! Still acne free and smiling, thanks Claror!!!</li>
            <li> Nice stuff. Works without excessive dryness. Really, without ANY dryness. I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful BP in comparison to many I&#x27;ve used -- very gentle and calming! Other BP products made my eyes puff up, my skin flake, and caused immense irritation. This BP was a world of difference -- very effective yet somehow very soothing. (I&#x27;m female, in my mid 20s, fair skin and acne prone.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, however, Salicylic acid has been more effective to treat my acne. BP is great for killing trapped bacteria and as a spot treatment, but many people will need a topical exfoliator (like Salicylic acid or an AHA) to compliment a BP regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When all is said and done, I highly recommend this product! If BP is what you need, then definitely buy Claror. I tried the acne.org BP regimen, clean and clear BP, etc. etc., and Claror is BY FAR the superior product.</li>
            <li> This works good my acne finally going away afther breaking up alot afther having my baby</li>
            <li> This product really cleared up my skin. I&#x27;m a 26 year old female and I still battle with breakouts, blackheads, and whiteheads. This product cleared up my skin within about a week. Works great!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  I have suffered from skin problems for almost 20 years and this is one of the best products I have used.  It is also very easy to apply and use since it is a clear quickly absorbing gel. I use it twice a day, everyday, with an oil-free moisturizer and have great results.</li>
            <li> I am telling you.....I have tried many different types of benzoyl peroxide.  Creams and gels alike.  And I have researched the heck out of all the OTC topical benzoyl peroxide treatments out there, in depth.  This is by far the very best quality one that I&#x27;ve found.  It has done wonders on my acne prone skin.  Seriously!!  Amazing.  It has ZERO ingredients that are comedogenic (clogging pores)  and no fragrance, no oil, every single ingredient is safe for sensitive skin.  (Unless you&#x27;really allergic to BP af course!!)  Do yourself a favor and order some.  It is a great big tube, will last a REALLY long time!!  A little goes a long way.  Excellent product!!  If I could be their spokeswoman I WOULD!!!  .....IN A HEARTBEAT!!</li>
            <li> my son is having very good luck with this product and it is gentler than the proactive he was using.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did nothing for my acne... I guess when you live with the pain of having acnes, you kind of have to try it all. . .:-(</li>
            <li> It really works! My skin is very oily, acne and wide pores. After I applied first time I saw difference. I tried Proactive, AcneFree, Clinique-over 8 months. All of them didn&#x27;t work like this product. Highly recommend. Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> I know everyone&#x27;s skin is different, but this really works for me.</li>
            <li> I have an extremely acne-prone area around my mouth/lips and honestly tried everything, from going vegan to taking mega doses of supplements like Zinc and of course tons of antibiotics.  But then I went to the basics and started using BP again, they key is to use every-single-day. I don&#x27;t think I have had a single acne in 2 months which is a miracle. I tried several different BP products while they all worked, this one is my favorite. I loved how fast it absorbs into the skin, and it does seem to cause less redness (although that might just be my skin getting used to BP) and the price is good. If Benzoyl Peroxide works for you then this is a good brand.</li>
            <li> Works great, seems like a really good price for the amount you get.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do much, and I used it religiously. My Dr. recommended a over the counter 4% and it worked much better on mild acne. As most Benzoyl Peroxide products it bleaches towels and anything you touch...just be aware!</li>
            <li> I have been using benzoyl peroxide gel for over 30 years, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve ever used, including prescription strength! It blends easily, does not dry if you don&#x27;t use too much, and gets rid of the pimples quickly and effectively. I love it, and it is the only one I will use from now on!</li>
            <li> It worked wonders! Thx</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product! I have suffered from bacne (acne on the back) for years, it is very painful and embarrassing.  I also get hormonal break outs on my chin. Since using this gel I have been able to clear my back completely!  I apply a liberal amount each night before bed, let it dry then wear a white t shirt (it does bleach).  I can finally wear tank tops again!</li>
            <li> best for my son&#x27;s acne</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Very satisfied. Results are fast. Product is exactly as stated, will look at site to get more products.</li>
            <li> great stuff for my daughter!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!  This high quality Gel (NOT Cream) works and leaves ones skin very clear. It&#x27;s a great value! Comparable to the highly advertised celebrity endorsed (over priced) brand.</li>
            <li> Great product! Worked great to decrease the black heads on my nose and clear up the acne on my forehead and chin. Highly recommend it. Rubbed it into my skin every morning and night.</li>
            <li> Love it. .. Completely happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Great product! I used proactive for years. This is much better, faster results, very gentle on the skin and you get a huge tube at a very low price. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works well as long you exfoliate (or it just sits on clogged pores). I recommend putting it in the fridge and icing down your face to reduce inflammation. Best price on Amazon</li>
            <li> has been clearing my skin very well and i have been suffering from acne and tried many products to get these results</li>
            <li> I would give this ONE HUNDRED STARS, if it were an option. I am 44yrs old, and suffer regularly, from adult stress/hormone acne.  Since my 20&#x27;s, I have paid thousands of dollars to dermatologists for needles in the face, gels, creams,  tanning salons (sun helps - in small doses), pharmacy prescriptions, and had found that Proactiv system was the most effective of all options. Dermatologists actually recommended that I stick with that option if it worked the best.  My problem with that, is that the only local place to purchase, was an automated kiosk in a mall, that many times was not working properly.  I began ordering through Amazon, which was a bit more costly. ALSO, you are forced to purchase the &amp;#34;90 day supply&amp;#34; of cleanser. If using daily, and that &amp;#34;90 day&amp;#34; supply is FALSE advertising, as it cannot clean twice a day, an adult face, for more than 30-40 days.....&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Proactiv daily repairing cream; it&#x27;s a small bottle and lasts a long time, but not 100% effective in clearing up my blemishes, just more effective than any other options I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;SEEING THAT THIS Claror WAS the most popular daily treatment cream, I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot - and at the very worst, lose $20 out of my pocket (though the seller does offer your money back).&lt;br /&gt;Well, it arrived, is a GIANT, long lasting tube, and my skin in ALL HONESTY, is THE BEST it&#x27;s ever been! I am at the MOST stressful point my life has experienced in ten years, yet I&#x27;m glowing and completely clear - and it works FAST - Blemishes disappear in 2-4 days. The gel consistency does not dry in the least, and keeps my skin plump, hydrated, not greasy, nor dry. I have had standard, simple blemishes, an ingrown hair chin pimple, and 3 cystic type breakout pimples on cheeks(I know; disgusting, but want to share types of issues that were completely cleared), that all disappeared in 3 days. I could not be any happier right now.</li>
            <li> product has since cleared my acne. its not 100&amp; but i dont get too many cystic acne anymore.</li>
            <li> Works well.  My daughter&#x27;s pimples cleared up virtually overnight. She&#x27;s quite young still so we only use it sparingly and infrequently.</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCT IS AWESOME. WOW, I&#x27;M REALLY IMPRESSED. AND IT CLEARS MY ACNE UP REALLY FAST. :) I&#x27;m definitely repurchasing them! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter and it really does work!</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne on my face. Not only does this product feel like a lotion when putting it on my face, but it absorbs within minutes and has cleared up my complexion quicker than other products. I used Acne.org&#x27;s products for several years, until finding Claror on Amazon. Claror&#x27;s product has a better consistency and seems to work quicker than Acne.org&#x27;s. I also find it is much less harsh and drying on my skin. As a plus, we can order with Amazon Prime!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend who has really bad acne. He&#x27;s tried using everything you could possibly think of and nothing ever worked. He has bad acne where the pimples are red, they get swollen, and are really painful. The would pop or just swell up underneath the skin and he&#x27;s had this for years. He even tried using antibiotics prescribed by the doctor and that barely helped, basically the acne came back. After using this cream, his acne actually cleared up! His whole back started becoming brighter and the acne went down and was gone. He is so happy with it. We both can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s made his acne disappear after trying out so many products on the market that claim to do the same. This cream ACTUALLY WORKS!!</li>
            <li> This product works as intended over the course of several weeks. It seems fairly inexpensive considering the size of the container. Would definitely recommend a suitable moisturizer to avoid over drying. Personally did not have any problems though.</li>
            <li> I use this after wet shaving and it prevents any break outs. Does a better job than any previous Benzoyl Peroxide cream I&#x27;ve used before. Doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin much either which is a plus.</li>
            <li> Working great !! My son uses it at night because he works in the sun all day. Seen a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product out of desperation because nothing I have tried has worked thus far. To be honest, my hopes were high but my expectations were low - I wanted this to work but didn&#x27;t want to get too excited about it. It has been 3-4 weeks since I started using this product and my skin really has made a huge improvement. I started using this as well as a few other adjustments to my skin care regiment and I am pleased with this product that I came back to order more. I still have a week or two of use left in the original bottle, but I don&#x27;t want to take a chance of running out. I started out using a smaller amount and have built up to using a larger amount, sometimes twice a day. One great thing about this product is that it never completely dried out my skin and made it red or flaky. It has been so gentle but so effective - I have had no major breakouts and my skin is so much smoother, clearer and softer. I would highly recommend this product - it will definitely be worth your while!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since 5th grade, and boy is it not fun being the first and only kid with acne. Although it&#x27;s really not much better as an adult, when all of your friends have never had an acne problem. It&#x27;s been a problem most of my life, and I had never found anything that really helped -- scrubs, toners, creams, I tried a lot of things. Until one day I was researching the most effective ways to treat acne, and I found that a &amp;#34;cleanser&amp;#34; (some sort of scrub to remove the bulk of surface dead skin) along with an exfoliatant (the true treatment) and a lotion was the way to go. I looked and researched some more before I was finally drawn in by the money back guarantee of this product. I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt if I could get my money back - the comments were great, and they seemed to be true to their word with non-satisfied customers. But let me be the first to say that they&#x27;ll have to pry this thing from my cold dead hands. I&#x27;ve used facial scrub washes my whole life and they never did much, so I started out with a solid twice a day application of two to three pea-sized amounts of this stuff all over my face, and the next day I could already feel a difference. My skin was softer and smoother, and I probably hindered my treatment a little with how much I touched it - it was just so smooth, like it had never been before! In the following days, my acne slowly lessened, and then was gone almost completely (I still can&#x27;t get rid of those pesky black heads.. although this did help). I felt the need to leave a review now, because I&#x27;m about to reorder this again. After over 4 months of application of this one to two times a day, I still have about a fifth of it left, so it&#x27;s definitely worth the money. About 6 bucks a month to get rid of my acne? Yes please! Now I don&#x27;t even need to wear concealer - I only do occasionally in order to cover up old acne scarring. And as a bonus, nice, smooth skin. Here are my recommendations for similar results:&lt;br /&gt;- Before application, cleanse your skin with some sort of scrub so that the product can get directly into your pores. I use Neutrogena&#x27;s oil-free grapefruit acne wash, and so do many of my friends, who swear it&#x27;s a god-send. Wash with warm to hot water, dry, then immediately apply product while your pores are at their widest.&lt;br /&gt;- Apply liberal amounts, and spend some time rubbing it into your skin. It doesn&#x27;t have to be COMPLETELY rubbed in, but mostly.&lt;br /&gt;- DEFINITELY use a good facial lotion. I didn&#x27;t at first because I thought my skin was too oily, but after two days I started getting major flaking. If you don&#x27;t use lotion, your skin can also react to you taking away all its natural oils by starting to over produce more oil. Not good. I special ordered Alpha Hydrox lotion at first because I&#x27;d heard good things, but it burned. Some burning is normal, but mine would burn all day, which wasn&#x27;t good on my sensitive skin. After that, I just took a quick stop by Bi-Mart (I think most drug stores will likely carry it too), picked up some Neutrogena oil-free sensitive skin facial moisturizer, and it worked like a charm. I recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin as well. Alpha Hydrox is high quality and also fights wrinkles, but it&#x27;s very harsh on your skin and is known for problems with burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. Unfortunately, only two days after I tried to stop using it the acne started to creep back in, so I guess I&#x27;ll need treatment forever. But at least I know what to use to cure it!</li>
            <li> Works as well as prescription creams I have used in the past. A lot of healing for a little money.</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old female and I have dealt with breakouts on and off since I was a teenager. I thought I had moved on to greener pastures in my 30&#x27;s but recently began to experience breakouts again. Within one week of using this product, twice daily, my skin is clear again. One tip when using, a little goes a long way. Apply a thin layer and combine with a quality moisturizer like Cephatil. I have experienced very little skin irritation with this application process.</li>
            <li> This is a very good cream but the only bad thing is that they dont add more Benzoyl Peroxide. It would be better with like 5 or 10 Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne for the past 15 years and have tried every treatment under the sun (Accutane, Proactiv, salicylic acid, tea tree oil, etc). Everything either dried my skin out or made my acne even worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always known that benzoyl peroxide is effective at treating acne, but it had always left my skin very red and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try Claror S1 because its concentration is low (2.5%). The results have been amazing. After two weeks, my skin started to clear. It absorbs very easily in to my skin and doesn&#x27;t over dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a premium product, but also great value as the tube is 8 oz and it&#x27;s lasted for over two months. Highly recommended! :)</li>
            <li> Nice size for the price!  It was very gentle on my skin and I didn&#x27;t have any dryness when used with a very light, oil-free moisturizer.  My skin looks and feels terrific!</li>
            <li> Causes slight drying, but is highly effective. The key to success with this product is to be generous with the amount you apply.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It has completely cleared my skin, I have had problems with acne for 10 years. I even went to a dermatologist for 5 years. He gave me a benzoyl peroxide lotion at a higher percentage but it worked nothing like this. It may make your skin a little red and dry at first but your skin adapts and that is coming from a person who has very sensitive skin. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It worked very good, but I still think acne.org works better at keeping any acne at bay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting married soon and I adopted this cream in my beauty regiment in an attempt to clear my skin before the big day. I have very oily skin so I was skeptical that this would help with my acne or not. It&#x27;s been 3 weeks and I must say that I have beautiful clear skin! It fades dark marks and as long as you don&#x27;t pop or pick at your zits, they will disappear within a few days. I will say that my acne got worse before it got better but I am pleasantly surprise by the results. Just some advice: do invest in a light moisturizer because this will dry out your face, this burns a bit at first so don&#x27;t be alarmed, don&#x27;t be discouraged by the few pimples that pop up after a few days of application, they will disappear soon. I will definitely purchase more in the future!</li>
            <li> Goes on like a lotion- not sticky or oily and absorbs fast.  Skin is clearer already! Of note- wash the excess off of your hands before drying with a towel.  The peroxide in the treatment will discolor any towels that aren&#x27;t white. Also, moisturizer is a must- this will dry out your skin.  But it&#x27;s all worth it for how great the treatment works.  I have persistent, stubborn acne and this is working great!</li>
            <li> I am so amazed at this product. I have been battling with adult onset rosacea and have felt so embarrassed by it. It brought back memories of being a teenager! I went to a dermatologist who prescribed a very expensive wash and cream regimen that didn&#x27;t work well. I finally went online and researched. I found this product and decided to give it a try. I was pleased that it was affordable! Since using this product, my rosacea has cleared up!!!! I can&#x27;t recommend Claror Acne Treatment more highly! Thank you!!!!</li>
            <li> I am 32 married man, I really don&#x27;t know why I have had a severe congested skin problem 1 year ago, well it&#x27;s nature course and tried various products which are expensive and spent lot of time dedicated to my good diet etc., but never helped me, all over my fore head with tones of clogged pores, bumps and scares that makes me  low self esteemed with my job and social life. I did some search found this product and gave it a try like i did try before with other men products. For first two weeks I did not see much changes but never gave up just kept using it for a month, believe me my skin started clearing up and incredibly it amazed me after two months all gone. Now my skin looks clear and healthy, even it helped my beard hair follicles to stop clogging after trimming or shaving.The best part with this product is having decent price and more quantity lasts longer.  This product really really really helped me, i definitely keep this product as my routine and part of daily life.</li>
            <li> Effective and not too drying</li>
            <li> Just a bit of history on the events that resulted in trying Claror. My wife, who is currently using this product, had started breaking out couple of months back when our little daughter turned one. She had acne breakouts before but during pregnancy it had cleared out and her skin was so beautiful. She knew acne might show up again, but she didn&#x27;t knew it will be severe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She decided to try Claror as she already tried and failed with Proactiv skin care kit. Proactiv made her skin worse with more breakouts and redness all over the cheeks and forehead. What she liked about Claror is it has only 2.5% strength and is feeling gentle on her skin when used it the right way. Proactiv treatments are also 2.5% based but it did make her skin as bad as the stronger 10% over the counter products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second week of her regimen with Claror and I can see that she is already happy with the results. I myself can see there is a visible reduction in redness and new breakouts (which by the way used to be 1 or 2 new breakouts everyday).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this for someone who already tried other regimens but did not get best results. This gel is gentle on sensitive skin types. The premium price is well justified with the 8 OZ tube size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS: I also recommend to supplement these topical treatments with control on diet as well as some regular exercises to sweat and clean-up pores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not familiar with this brand, but I like their face cream. I purchased a couple from Amazon. Daniel Kern&#x27;s solution as well as Paula&#x27;s Choice. Kern is the best and comes in a huge bottle. I buy from their site because shipping is faster and cheaper. Paula&#x27;s Choice was a cheap, thin gel. Wanted to return it but won&#x27;t because it&#x27;s not worth the headache and I can use it at the gym. Claror is 2x the size and worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty clear skin when I use this product at night and in the morning. It&#x27;s humid here in Texas, so your face can get pretty gross. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used AcneFree Sensitive and Acne.Org&#x27;s BP. They (including Claror) all work about the same. As long as I don&#x27;t go above 2.5 to 3%, my face clears up without so much of the side effects. i chose the Claror this time around because it seems to be a better value overall. Then when i tried it i was pleasantly satisfied to find it also gentle, and didn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price. Been using the BP from Acne.org for years, but I love that I can get Claror on Prime. Would be AWESOME if it became available on Subscribe &amp; Save!! :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> Its been about 2 and a half weeks and I have noticed some differences. Not quite what I thought.</li>
            <li> I like that the product comes in a tube with a cap lid, as opposed to the pump style bottle, like some of the other brands offer. The reason this is good is because it is appropriate for traveling, which was the whole reason I bought this product in the first place. I previously bought the &#x27;Dr. Song&#x27; version of 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, which I use at home. But Dr. Song&#x27;s bottle is not good for putting into a suitcase, as you need to lock the pump -- and even doing so is not a guarantee that it won&#x27;t come loose in your luggage when you travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Clarorskincare version is therefore far more convenient than Dr. Song&#x27;s, and I appreciate that the lid tightly seals the product from leaking. With other tube containers like this, there&#x27;s a risk that the gel inside slowly leaks, resulting in a mess on the inside of the cap every time you open it. But this has not happened so far.</li>
            <li> One of the best acne products I have used.  I love that you get a large container of it too.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a more cost effective solution than proactive topical lotion and a comparable product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8-16&lt;br /&gt;Why does Amazon no longer offer this item???  Great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 3 weeks now and definitely feel some type of improvement. Still get some little pimples now and again but a significant improvement has been shown</li>
            <li> First of all, I understand that not every product will work for every individual. But, this one is far exceeding my expectations. I did some research online before I bought this. What I found was that what seemed to work the best for people was a combination of salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I bought the product as an alternative to Acne.org Acne Treatment, and so far it has done it&#x27;s job. I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts since using it. I apply two finger&#x27;s length of the product twice a day (once in the morning and once at night).  Edit - still using it after a year maybe and it still works  Tip: I use two finger&#x27;s length worth of product b/c I&#x27;ve been using simliar benzoyl peroxide products for almost 13 years. Therefore, if you are just starting to use this product, I would recommend using a lot less (maybe half finger&#x27;s length) and then gradually increase as your skin becomes accustomed to the BP.</li>
            <li> Works like magic to remove zits!</li>
            <li> I have had acne for roughly 15 years and have used a variety of products, both over the counter and prescription. It turns out that benzoyl peroxide is quite effective for me and I stuck with the neutrogena on-the-spot acne treatment (vanishing formula) since it was widely available in drug stores and did the job well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched over to Claror Acne Treatment because it had a number of distinct advantages over the neutrogena brand:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Price: ranging from $6-8 for 0.75 ounce tube, the neutrogena treatment was really expensive considering how much it gave you. Cloror comes in an 8 oz tube for about $25. Neutrogena sells for more than double to almost triple the cost of Claror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Quality: Claror does a much better job absorbing into my skin. It goes on smooth and does not leave a flaky residue, which happens if you put on too much of the neutrogena treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Appearance: If I put on too much Claror, nothing noticeable happens to the appearance of my face. When I put on too much neutrogena, my face gets noticeable lighter than my neck, which makes it seem like I&#x27;m wearing a lot of make-up, which is not the look I&#x27;m going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Gentleness: Too much neutrogena makes my skin burn and it gets irritated. Claror is much more gentle on my skin and every time I accidentally put on too much, I just rub it on anyways and I did not suffer any side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying neutrogena on-the-spot acne treatment is a bad product. It works pretty well. I&#x27;m just saying Claror is much better in comparison and I see no reason to go back. Hope that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jon</li>
            <li> Clears up my acne without irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> Gentle but super effective! Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used proactiv and ance.org and this is the best choice for me. Wash gently with cerave cleanser and then use claror cream. Finish with cerave moisturing loition. You only need to use little bit of the claror cream, when I use too much my face gets red like its burnt from the sun. Be gentle when washing and putting the cream on your face. Hope this helps someone. I love claror and wouldn&#x27;t know what to do without it!</li>
            <li> Quite effective. Reasonable priced. I like the product and am 100 % satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Since beginning to use this product a month ago I have seen a significant decrease in blemishes on my back.  Additionally, I have seen a decrease in frequency and severity of breakout.  For me this product seems to be working well and I hope to see continued improvement the longer I use it.</li>
            <li> My son has been using this for 2 weeks now and it has helped clear up his acne. Will be getting more for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. Thank you Claror</li>
            <li> I began using this product a month ago and since then my skin has been almost clear. I am a busy 25 year old Mom who has little time to fool with an intense skin care regimen. I now am a loyal Clarol customer. As other women who deal with acne know, hormonal changes make everything worse. I recently stopped breastfeeding and the return of my cycle brought with it an onslaught of acne. Claror BP works better than the kind you can get at the drugstore because it absorbs without leaving a film. It is also more cost effective. That being said, Benzoyl Peroxide is a drug and is very drying. You must be prepared for several weeks of redness and itching before being able to increase the amount used and clear your skin. As with any acne product don&#x27;t expect miracles overnight. Be patient, use a good moisturizer with sunscreen, and let Claror clear your skin. I still maybe have a pimple or two at a time but nothing compared to what was going on a month ago.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a big tube of benzoyl peroxide since the store only has the little tubes (&amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34;).  I also didn&#x27;t want the 10% because I think it&#x27;s overkill.  This product has worked great for me.  My skin has never been clearer and the tube is big so I don&#x27;t have to worry about running out anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is most acne treatments you see infomercials for are just benzoyl peroxide and some other stuff that&#x27;s really just fluff to pad the price. Get this, save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things. This is not complicated. I wash my face, put this on until it soaks in, and go to sleep. My skin has never been happier and my stupid scars from my stupid gross face picking habits are going away. My husband keeps telling me how good my skin looks. I&#x27;m 23 with hormonal acne and this stuff works for me. No change in diet really, so it&#x27;s definitely this product. I think it kills the bacteria really well. If I&#x27;d thought to do before and after pictures I&#x27;d have posted them.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it smelled and felt on my skin...unfortunately it is too strong and ended up breaking my face out even worse.  So I had to return it.  If you don&#x27;t have extra sensitive skin like mine, this would probably work.  I gave it four stars because the return policy is great and the amount of product you get for the price is outstanding.  I wish this would have worked for me.</li>
            <li> Works great. Great value.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think Claror is more or less effective than any other 2.5% BPO.  I use it to keep small outbreaks of \\&quot;shaving acne\\&quot; in check.  It doesn&#x27;t sting and a tiny bit goes a long way.  I suspect this one 8oz tube will last 10~12 months.  It&#x27;s nowhere near perfect for me, but it&#x27;s a lot better than using nothing.    One BIG caveat: it&#x27;s VERY harsh and drying.  I thought the comments on BPO about applying a moisturizer afterwards were just for driving moisturizer sales.  Not so.  This can dry out skin to the point of flaking if you use it alone.  I never had to use any moisturizer before using this product.  Now it&#x27;s essential.      It will also stain and bleach non-white towels if there is even a minute smidge of product remaining on your hands when you dry them.  It won&#x27;t discolor the towel right away, but sometime in the next 2~3 days, you&#x27;ll notice bleached patches on the towel.  I can no longer just dash water over my hands to rinse afterwards.  I have to scrub while rinsing and even then I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s all off.  I also now use a separate white (almost disposable) hand towel for drying my hands to avoid ruining good towels.    I&#x27;ll be shopping for a different brand next time I buy.  My choice will be determined by strength (ideally 0.5% or 1% at most) and price, though if it includes a v.light non-comedogenic moisturizer to counter the BPO drying effect, that would be a plus.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a good job without irritation, but have not had the product long enough to more accurately judge.</li>
            <li> Been using the product for about 2 weeks and so far it has prevented breakouts.  It does make my skin a little itchy after applying to skin, and also dries it out a little.</li>
            <li> I’m pregnant and for the most part I see it keeping my acne at bay  I’m sure if I gave up fast food when I eat it here and there and drink more water my skin would be even better but my self-control went out the window with this baby but that’s on me I’m sure with some discipline I could fight the urges but foods all I have to look forward to sense I can’t do my old work outs and go to the beach being pregers would suck way worse without this at least I feel like I have a chance at getting my old skin back after this because of this cream plus there glycolic acid cream ! it fades scars over time and smooth’s out the bumps from pimples also I just discovered dream dots it helps if you do pop a zit for it not to scar and it’s like a sticker so it helps you form not going back and further irritating the area best of luck to you acne sucks but keeps shallow people you don’t need in your life away lucky my husband’s still here even though I feel like a pizza face there are people that will love you for who you are its just finding what works for you so that the outside matches the inside that might take awhile</li>
            <li> Great product - works well.</li>
            <li> After trying other leading brands for almost two years, stumbled upon Claror Acne Treatment.  It simply works!!  It also helps clear the blemishes from past breakouts.</li>
            <li> I was very surprise that this stuff really worked.  I bought this for my teenage son.  I could start seeing a difference after about five days.  I bought  this along with the CeraVe foaming facial cleaner and moisturising lotion.  It&#x27;s only three steps.  I have my kid wash his face with the cleanser add this product and let it sit for about five minutes and then apply the moisturizer over it.  He was supposed to do it in the morning and evening but he only did it once a day and it still worked.</li>
            <li> This gel is great--it hasn&#x27;t dried my skin out at all, and it has helped clear up my acne.  I love the size of the tube, too!</li>
            <li> Coming from someone who has tried just about everything, it works! Just use it twice a day and it should work, i had mild acne that ruined my senior year of high school and this really cleared my skin before i went to college.</li>
            <li> Bought this on my husbands account. I am using it in place of step 2 in proactive + and it seems to be a good fit. You get a lot for your money with the  claror</li>
            <li> My skin has cleared up quite a bit after using this for a few weeks. My skin also didn&#x27;t dry out from it which is nice</li>
            <li> purchased it for my daughter who tried so many other brands. This one works.</li>
            <li> I have a love hate relationship with this product. Yes it does clear my bumps when I break out in 3-4 days but I still break out in the same area a week or so after it could be because I touch my bumps and sometimes eat junk I am going on a health journey and hopefully by changing my eating habits I will no longer break out</li>
            <li> My missing product was replaced and my product was replaced quickly. The treatment indeed seems to help with the process of killing the bacteria on my face. My face looks much clearer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an 18 year old girl with medium to severe acne. I&#x27;ve been using this product morning and night for about 6 months now and the difference in my skin is amazing! I rarely have any acne on my skin now. I tried Proactiv and had okay results but it was so pricy for such a small amount. I put this on after washing my face with Topix Benzoyl Peroxide 10% wash.  I definitely recommend using the products together.  Topix is a gentle wash and neither product overly dries my skin.  Then I just wear my regular lotion and makeup on top.&lt;br /&gt;* The first week or so my skin was pretty irritated but stuck it out and haven&#x27;t had problems since.&lt;br /&gt;* After applying make sure it is completely dry before changing your shirts as it does bleach clothes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend trying this product!</li>
            <li> Cleans the pores well and dries out the skin which is fine as long as you accompany with a moisturizer</li>
            <li> 2 thumbs up! Never had a break out especially in  my nose.</li>
            <li> works great, like acne.org if not better.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the BEST acne products that I have ever used. A simple application of a small amount of the lotion, once-daily, cleared up my skin within 2 days. I have been using it every day since (about four months) and my skin has never looked better. I had tried many products including Proactiv and Dermalogica, and they ended up being incredibly expensive and not as effective as Claror. One bottle lasts me about two months. Make sure you do use a moisturizer on top of this product though because your skin will seem a littler drier than normal. Overall, this product is definitely worth trying and I will be only be using it in the future.</li>
            <li> My sister have been using this for almost 6 months to keep her skin acne free. Me on the other hand just started using this  and i can see 50% improvement on my skin after a month. I will continue using it until my skin is completely clear from acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff works!  I never write reviews but I&#x27;m writing one on this product because in the past 2 weeks my face looks better than it has in a really long time.  Mostly my face was always irritated and red.  My completion is so much smoother!  I&#x27;m actually going without make up except for a few scars that I have to cover.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I am writing this review in hopes of helping someone clear their acne.  I have had bad white heads for the past few months. To be honest I haven&#x27;t been taking care of my skin much, just using random regimens as I travel and live in hotels. After coming home, I immediately decided to take care of my skin again. I have used Acne.org&#x27;s regimen in the past (over 5 years ago) and have had good results, so I wanted to start on that again. After searching on Amazon however, I stumbled on this product and decided to give it a try.  SO FAR SO GOOD. I am Day 3 in the regimen and my skin has dramatically improved already. NO whiteheads today (I used to get them everyday, near my mouth, and pop them).  I use this in conjunction with: CERAVE Foaming Cleanser, and CERAVE Moisturizer. Today I added Jojoba oil to the moisturizer. I use 2 pumps of moisturizer.  This product is thicker than Acne.org and it also feels more potent. In the beginning I was using an index finger&#x27;s length of gel, but now am only using 1 inch worth because of the over drying. I think that is all you need since it is very effective.   SOME PROBLEMS: This product makes my skin slightly red tint and also very dry and tight. Perhaps more moisturizer is required. But the results make it worth it and I think these side effects will subside in the future.  I highly recommend this product and wish you the best.</li>
            <li> This is for my teenage son.  We have done the Pro-Active and X-Out treatments, and, this product is comparable for much less money.  He will continue to use this product and I will continue to enjoy the cost savings.</li>
            <li> Only one that worked for me</li>
            <li> It actually works, but I still have acne. If I don&#x27;t use it one night, I pay that later with blemishes, so it works... it isn&#x27;t magic but at least helps.</li>
            <li> I only have acne on my chin and I&#x27;ve used this everyday and NO ACNE.  It worked in 1 weeks time.  You have to remember to put it on even if your skin cleared up.  Use it everyday.  If you don&#x27;t, the acne will come back as with any other acne product that you stop using.  I used to use Proactive, but it was very expensive.  I bought some Proactive from a seller on amazon, but did not have the results I did in the past, so I purchased this and I&#x27;m so glad I did.  It has the same amount of Benzoyl Peroxide, it&#x27;s cheaper, and it works.......2.5% is the right amount.  It is Benzoyl Peroxide, so it will dry your skin, but as the instructions point out, use a moisturizer and you will have no issues.</li>
            <li> Have had acne practically my whole life (I&#x27;m male in my mid-40s).  Like most I just kept buying the standard 10% BP products at the drug store.  It would help my pimples but stained my face, my sheets, etc., and made my face red and irritated.    I read that 2.5% BP was just as effective as 10% and would cause less redness/irritation, so I decided to buy this product on Amazon (interesting how 2.5% strength is almost impossible to find on drugstore shelves).  It seems pricey at first but the tube is large and lasts a long time, so actually it works out to being less costly than all those tiny 10% tubes.    Anyway, this product is phenomenal.  Goes on incredibly light and clear, and absorbs super-quickly and completely.  It is more like a light gel than the thick white creams I was used to using in the past.  Can easily apply a thin layer to my whole face in the morning, and by the time I get to work it has absorbed completely and is totally invisible - there is no shine or greasiness to my face.  And it doesn&#x27;t over-dry or make my face red the way the 10% did.    Have been using for 6 weeks in conjunction with a salicylic acid wash, and I can honestly say this is the best my face has looked in about 30 years.  Very glad I bought this and needless to say I plan to be a repeat customer.    If you&#x27;ve got facial acne and have been smothering your face in those thick 10% BP creams like I was, you need to try this.  Kudos to this company for making a great product.</li>
            <li> Wow... works great! I&#x27;ve only been using it once a day rather than the recommended twice a day and saw results in the first couple days. My only warning is make sure you wash your hands with soap after applying this lotion because it will bleach/stain your towels/linens.</li>
            <li> This combined with a face wash that I use has pretty much cleared the majority of my acne. It has worked really well for me, but, as I&#x27;ve learned, skin care tends to depend on a great many factors so this may or may not work for you, in short. Also, this is cheaper than acne.org&#x27;s BP, plus with free shipping if you have prime.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 39 and I&#x27;ve used Proactiv acne treatment for years.The bottle is huge, will last for ages, and after trying it for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve discovered it works just as well, if not better, without drying out my skin! Never again will I buy Proactiv!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a loooot of benzoyl peroxide treatments over the years. Some much stronger than this, some less, some in other formats. I really love this one. It&#x27;s gentle, light, and vaguely moisturizing. It washes off my hands really well and hasn&#x27;t accidentally bleached any of my stuff. I&#x27;ve been using it every evening since I got it and it&#x27;s been doing wonders - not a miracle worker, but I&#x27;m really happy with my skin, and I&#x27;m not experiencing dry or flaking side effects like one normally might with BP treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acne.org recommends nothing stronger than 2.5% for daily treatments, and I&#x27;m inclined to agree. I have a 10% as a spot treatment that I put on over this for existing pimples, and that&#x27;s good enough. When I was trying to use 10% daily, I didn&#x27;t find it to be as effective as this milder treatment.</li>
            <li> This product works well for me in eliminating blackheads and clearing occasional breakouts.  At first I used it 2 times a day (morning and evening) but after a few weeks I reduced that to 1 time (before bed).  It is a bit drying but I use a moisturizer and that helps quite a bit.  Now I use it about every other day and it still works for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am age 64 and in the sun most days here in South Florida.  I use sunscreen as directed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely would recommend this product to anyone.  It is better than any other acne product I have tried.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a couple of months now and I am very impressed with it. I&#x27;m 38 and still get acne...the big embarrassing kind...one at a time, over and over in the same spots. I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since using this. If I feel something coming on, I use a little extra and it never fully comes in.&lt;br /&gt;The product goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely. My skin did get drier than usual after I started using it but it got used to it. I just used my moisturizer after using this.&lt;br /&gt;When I run out, I will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> Bought as a replacement for a pad based 2.5% benzoyl peroxide product that does not seem to be being made anymore.  I am giving 4 stars because I don&#x27;t really have a long term outcome with using this product yet and my skin is usually worse in the winter, so the big test is still to come.  I do like that it is very light/not oily on my skin and at the same time not overly drying.  It also does not seem to cause fabric bleaching like the 10% benzoyl peroxide product that I had tried in the interim.  I only use it 2-3 times per week which seems to be about right for my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Goes on as a gel which is better. I have already purchased 3 tubes. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I  like your product.  It does work however I have been use to a bit more Benzoyl Peroxide in my cream.  I was using a prescription strength but they stopped making it so I tried your treatment. It is working but again it was a bit slower process since I was use to a higher percentage of benzoyl peroxide.  The tube is big enough to last and I love that about it.  It is a bit more expensive than my prescription was actually but the tube is larger.  I appreciate the product and will continue to use it.  I do have to admit I hate having to use anything on my face as I had hoped at age 63 I would have grown out of the oily skin.  No such luck!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have acnea, but my skin is very oily and needs to be cleaned every day. This cream is very good, I usually use clearsil but this cream is very concentrated , if I can say so. With one small quantity I can cover the whole face without overseeing, even tho my skin never overdries..:)) I&#x27;m not sure when I&#x27;m gonna buy another tube, because it&#x27;s so big, but I would recommended to every one with oily skin. I&#x27;m 33yo.</li>
            <li> I never had acne problems growing up.  Even during my teen years when others were having trouble. Then all of of a sudden, I hit 30 and my face went crazy. Having suffered from adult acne for the past few years, I&#x27;ve tried everything I could find.  Some products made my face extremely dry and some didn&#x27;t help at all. This one is amazing to say the least.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and the transformation is unbelievable.  Almost all of my problem areas are cleared up and the remaining dark spots from previous acne are fading away. I&#x27;m sure it will be only a couple more weeks till my afce is completely clear and I can&#x27;t wait. Love this product and would highly recommend to anyone suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> Definitely seeing a big improvement in my skin after about 3 weeks of use. I noticed results within a week, actually. I saw all the reviews about this product excessively drying other people&#x27;s skin out but having read about use of this type of product via Acne.org and the Acne.org treatment, I knew that my skin would suffer a lot so I researched a great, oil-free moisturizer to use after applying the Claror cream. I am using Alba Hawaiian oil free moisturizer and the combination is really fantastic! I do sometimes get a bit of dried out skin but then I just apply some more moisturizer and I am good.  So, to sum it up, expect dry skin and get a REALLY good moisturizer - you will love the results!  --  3.5 months later and still going strong! I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful my skin feels and looks. I will reiterate that the lotion is essential!! If I skip an application of lotion after using this gel/cream I will experience some dry, shedding skin. But I love that I can apply lotion to my skin and not break out so I rarely forget! My cystic acne, white heads and blackheads are gone. My pores are shrinking, too. I hope that this stuff helps many people especially those like me who have tried everything from harsh prescription toners and creams to Accutane (twice in my case) and still have horrible, painful acne. It&#x27;s just crazy to me that this simple solution works so much better than anything I have tried with zero side effects. Good luck!  --  Over 1 year later: Still going strong! I do get the occasional pimple now and again, but I can totally deal with it (plus this stuff zaps any pimples in 1-2 days, it&#x27;s like they were never there to begin with). I didn&#x27;t think my skin would get used to this stuff to the point where I wouldn&#x27;t need to wear lotion after applying but I don&#x27;t have to at night - which is amazing! Of course, that may not be the case for everyone. Bonus: I no longer pick at my face, as there is nothing there to pick at. People constantly remark that my skin looks so nice, clear and healthy! I recommend this product constantly.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve used Acne.org BP for 8 years but found this product on Amazon and the free shipping enticed me. While I had success with acne.org BP I would still breakout on my chin, get whiteheads deep under the skin on my cheeks and always had blackheads on my nose. I&#x27;ve been using Claror BP for about 3 weeks and haven&#x27;t had a single pimple. My blackheads and therefore pores on my nose have been greatly reduced and the skin on my cheeks is nice and smooth. My skin has never looked better. The product caused a small amount of redness and irritation at first, but I don&#x27;t experience that anymore. Start slow and use moisturizer and enjoy your new, clear skin.</li>
            <li> Works very well. I&#x27;m 49 and still get occasional breakouts and this product nips them in the bud quickly. I let it absorb a few minutes and follow up with moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Perfect substitute for Acne.org treatment. Feels the same. Smells the same. Works the same.</li>
            <li> Good natural face wash. Not too harsh</li>
            <li> The best Benzoyl Peroxide preparation I have ever used, and I have used them all.  This absorbs better and is more effective than any other I have used, including the one that has &amp;#34;active&amp;#34; info-mercials.  I highly recommend it.  For some, it may cause transient redness, dryness or irritation of the skin where it is applied, but only for the short-term.  I am off of antibiotics and other internal medications for the first time in a long time!</li>
            <li> Used this for 2 months.. I don&#x27;t see any change. All the reviews are fake.. and this is such a scam.. They&#x27;ll give a 15$ discount for giving 5 star rating.  Don&#x27;t buy Claror.</li>
            <li> This product works really well, and is very affordable. I was using Neutrogena&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide for years, but I&#x27;m so glad I found this!</li>
            <li> I can see a noticeable difference when I put this on at night versus when I wake up. It does cause a little irritation for me if I don&#x27;t use lotion after, but if I do it really helps. I use a neutrogena lotion to offset the drying and irritation. Definitely see better results than anything else I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I have sensitive skin so just because I experienced the above does not mean everyone will.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, unfortunately. Tried using once per day and it left my skin burning intensely after 4 consecutive days. Also felt super dry and hard to move. Then tried using every other day, but I&#x27;m still breaking out just as much.</li>
            <li> I have been using 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide for about a decade, and it has done wonders for my skin. It is the only product I have found that keeps my face acne free (and trust me I tried a lot of stuff back in the day). I usually buy my BP from Acne.org, but I decided to give Claror a try this time . I am an Amazon Prime member, so Claror came out a bit cheaper with faster shipping. Overall, I really like the product. It goes on really smooth, and does not leave my skin feeling tacky (Like Neutrogena on the spot does). It doesn&#x27;t flake at all, and it works well under my makeup. The only negative I can think of is that it sort of smells like a public swimming pool when you first apply it, but the smell goes away in a few minutes. I would definitely buy Claror BP again!</li>
            <li> Does everything I hoped it would do. Didn&#x27;t experience the dryness really. Goes on smoothly and a great amount in the tube. Definitely going to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very effective 👍way better than other expensive promising products. It really work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has been 4 weeks and there is only mild improvement on my skin, hopefully it will continue to work</li>
            <li> Unbelievable product. The best value of its kind.</li>
            <li> Each night, I  have been using this on blemishes. I do notice that it helps to make them go away/fade faster. I still continue to get recurring pimples though. I did notice a clearer, smoother feeling to my skin, but I am not sure that this is preventative. Maybe I need to try other products in their system. This isn&#x27;t bad, but it is not a miracle cure. It seems that it would need to work in conjunction with other products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product to replace my 2.5% Benzoyl Peroxide Gel from Acne.org. This product was a little cheaper for the same amount. I find it indistinguishable from the Acne.org gel, which I love! I use it daily (morning after cleansing/before moisturizing, in the evening after cleansing). In the 2 weeks I have been using this gel I have not had any new acne, so I believe it is working just as effectively as my last product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This benzoyl peroxide gel is easier to apply than a cream based benzoyl peroxide and dries clear on your skin rather than white. It will bleach whatever it comes into contact with, so be careful with your towels and sheets! I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 because my husband is also using it and broke out initially. His skin quickly cleared up after the initial breakout and he hasn&#x27;t had problems since, but be aware of the possibility of having to adjust to the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for several weeks now and can say that I see a noticeable difference... it&#x27;s the first product that has done -anything- to clear my face. Overnight improvement in my case. Not a miracle product in the sense that it hasn&#x27;t entirely cleared my face but I&#x27;ve gotten to where I just have a few bumps instead of a trail across my forehead and down my temples. Can&#x27;t complain, works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, tried everything, dermatologist, light therapy, this really works even on stubborn back acne. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works just as effectively as a 10% solution.  Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This product works for me. There has been noticeable change in the frequency of breakouts. Even if I do get a few spots, it goes away pretty quickly. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months now and I use it nightly. It is definitely drying, so it&#x27;s necessary to apply moisturizer afterwards.</li>
            <li> Just to preface this, I&#x27;m no stranger to BP. I&#x27;ve been using acne.org&#x27;s BP for 3+ years now, and decided to give this one a shot because it was a better deal on Amazon. I&#x27;ve now been using this particular formula for about 6 months, so I think I can give it a fair review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have about the same level of effectiveness in terms of keeping acne at bay, but there&#x27;s something about this formula that is VERY harsh and drying, even after giving my skin months to acclimate. I&#x27;ve never had this issue with the acne.org BP (after the first two weeks or so), so I found this rather odd. Since both products have the same concentration of BP (2.5%), and very similar inactive ingredients, I can only conclude that there must be something about the \\&quot;micronized BP\\&quot; they advertise that just does not agree with my skin. I apply this every night and I still find that my skin is red, tight, painful, and angry for 3-4 hours afterward. I do use a heavy moisturizer with jojoba oil, so I know that&#x27;s not the issue. I&#x27;ve decided to grin and bear it until I&#x27;ve used up the last of the tube, but I won&#x27;t be repurchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and maybe others with less sensitive skin won&#x27;t have this issue. But if you&#x27;ve been using another brand of 2.5% BP, don&#x27;t assume this will be a perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle drug, but I think that it helped a little with my adult acne. My skin is not completely clear, but I feel like I don&#x27;t break out as often, and any break outs that occur are easier to manage.</li>
            <li> Do what is supose to do!&lt;br /&gt;Be sure you have good moisturizer cream also!</li>
            <li> I began experiencing acne when I was in high school. Nothing seemed to work to clear my skin. When I was in college, I went to a dermatologist who put me on acne medication which worked like a charm. About 3 years ago, my insurance company decided to stop covering my acne meds and put me on a generic version of that drug. The generic medication didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as the branded drug did, so I resorted to regular facials &amp; expensive products to try to keep my skin clear. I also tried topical creams &amp; prescription washes from my dermatologist. I have been on a never ending quest to find something that works for TWENTY YEARS! I am currently 34 and trying to become pregnant. I had to stop taking the generic acne meds and my dermatologist told me that Benzoyl Peroxide was safe to use while trying to conceive &amp; also safe to use while pregnant. The medication she prescribed me was ridiculously expensive (even with insurance), so I drove away from the pharmacy without my script &amp; decided to look on Amazon for Benzoyl Peroxide. I came across Claror and read the reviews. I figured I would buy it &amp; try it. I have been using this product for about a month now, and I can see SUCH a difference in my skin. I wish my teenage self had tried Benzoyl Peroxide, it would have saved me a lot of aggravation, heartache &amp; money! I followed the directions exactly the way the company advised to, and I could not be happier. I have not had a breakout in almost a month (which is a RECORD for me!). I am a HUGE fan of this product and also a HUGE fan of the customer service. Right around the time my Amazon package got shipped to me, I received an e-mail with instructions on exactly how to use the product. Here I am a month later, and they e-mailed to check in and see how I liked the product &amp; if I had any questions. I figured the least I could do for the company and to anyone who is reading this is to praise this product as it has made me a much more confident person knowing that my skin looks great every day &amp; I am so happy I found this! No doubt I will be purchasing again when I run out. THANK YOU CLAROR!</li>
            <li> My skin has never been horrible but since I was 16 (49 now) I have always had slight issues. At least once a week I would have zit/blemish and it always frustrated me. I actually was thinking about going to see a doctor about it. Instead I jumped on Amazon and did some searching. I found this and read the reviews. I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt anything to try. Well, that was a few months ago and I am blown away! My skin is clear. It&#x27;s pretty mind blowing. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin and I have been blemish free since I started using it. Buy it. Try it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months and my persistent adult acne is completely gone! Just red marks on my shoulders from old acne remains. Use as directed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I&#x27;m still getting breakouts. I use it morning and evening and apply generously. Have been using like 6 weeks now.</li>
            <li> So far so good! My skin is clearing up and those tiny little bumps all over my face are going away. I need to remember to keep using it day and night, not just in the evening. Don&#x27;t give zits a chance! You definitely need a good moisturizer. They aren&#x27;t kidding about that.</li>
            <li> This gel is amazing.  About 6 weeks ago I spent over $100 at Aveda on their acne line and nothing changed though I used it for almost a month.  I used this gel for 1 week and noticed a huge difference.  Within two weeks my face cleared up.  Make sure to use a good face lotion after applying the Claror gel like the company recommends.</li>
            <li> This product is honestly really good. I Got this and it works really well for my oily acne prone skin. It lightened up my redness and little bumps are going away. No new breakouts have appeared since a couple of weeks ago when I started using the product. Btw they say to use a fingers length but I only use about half or a quarter of that</li>
            <li> I waited a year before writing this review. I suffered from moderate acne for 10 years. I tried a myriad of over-the-counter products, saw three dermatologists, took antibiotics daily for about two years, used topical antibiotics, natural remedies...nothing worked. Would you like some specific examples? I used Differin gel, Clindamycin, Retin A, Clearasil products, Neutrogena products, Oil of Olay products, Proactiv, Murad, Tretin-X cream, tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, and mud masks to name a few. After finding Claror on Amazon and reading reviews, I decided to give yet another product a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claror Acne Treatment is amazing. It is smooth, creamy, and absorbs quickly. The consistency is similar to lotion, as opposed to a gel. My skin is oily in the T-zone, normal elsewhere; the treatment controls my oily regions, but does not leave my normal areas dry. After two weeks, the results were incredible. I did not experience any new breakouts. After a year, I no longer use concealer or foundation to cover my skin. I absolutely adore this product and will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spent 10 years avoiding making eye contact with people and suffering from acne really affected my self esteem. Now, I am confident again and able to look anyone in the eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:  I use the treatment twice a day. After washing my face with a creamy, oil-free cleanser, I use an astringent for sensitive skin. Then, I apply a dime-sized amount of the acne treatment to my forehead and each cheek.</li>
            <li> This product worked quickly to clear up my acne. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Treating acne is a very frustrating process, because it involves finding the right cleanser, benzoyl peroxide gel, and lotion. You have to find the right combination of all three to get completely clear skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Claror is the latest one I have tried, and it is working great amazingly so far. It has little to no odor, is not greasy or heavy, is not over drying, and doesn&#x27;t bleach out your hair line or eyebrows if any gets on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing I like the most about this gel is that it doesn&#x27;t flake once it dries. It will over dry your skin if you don&#x27;t use a good lotion though, but the gel itself disappears once it has dried. This is a huge plus to me, because generic store brands do this and it tends to look horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 28 and have light to mild acne. My current routine is now Cerave foaming cleanser, AHA lotion, Claror 2.5% benzoyl peroxide, and Cerave SA lotion. This has been my routine for the last few months and has given me almost perfectly clear skin. Your results may vary though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not found a benzoyl peroxide gel that beats Claror in both effectiveness and price. It is a great product and I highly recommend trying it.</li>
            <li> This treatment is pretty good. I had been seeing a dermatologist for moderate acne with nodules and everything else along with it. The antibiotics and prescription lotions helped, but I reached the point where the nodules were gone but general acne remained. I didn&#x27;t want to keep paying the huge prices for acne creams so I started looking for a non-prescription benzoyl peroxide lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good lotion. It does not prevent all breakouts but it stops most from starting, and most importantly, it makes those that start fade fast. It seems to bleach clothing it comes into contact with very easily, but it also treats my acne without overly drying my face. You should still use lotion, but you can use this product without making your face a dry, burny mess of flaky skin. Overall I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product so far. I was using the severe 10% benzoyl peroxide acnefree.com stuff (you can buy the sets in most stores) and it was always a struggle to keep my face hydrated because it dried it out so much. Also, when using any set of stuff (not just the kind I was using), I have found that they put so many ingredients in the lotion, face wash, toner, and retinoid cream that my pores seem to easily get clogged and cause worse acne, especially when your face gets dried out so much that you have to use a ton of lotion too. This one is pretty light to put on though, so that is nice.  I have been using it for about a month now, and I will say I am very happy with how it is going. Definitely need to use other products with it, but it is a good product for what it is.use this product 2-3 times per day and even at this amount, my face is not drying out bad at all. I do have to use a salicylic acid astringent and a face wash (I have been using Cetyphil Gentle Skin Cleaner or Acnedote Face Wash) to keep my skin more clear. One more item that I have just recently found helps after going on vacation to a place with a beach is that sea water. After swimming in the ocean almost every day, my skin was more clear than it has been in a long time. Unfortunately, I do not live near a beach, but I have purchased a sea water mix for aquariums and have been applying a solution of that to my face once or twice a day as well and this seems to have made a big difference.  I realize everyone is different, so that suggestion may not work for you, but I just wanted to share because it was not something I had ever thought of or heard about, but it does seem to be a nice addition to this acne treatment.  tl;dr  This stuff works very well for what it is and has a limited amount of ingredients that do not dry my face out very much. This product alone however would not be enough to combat my severe acne and definitely needs to be supplemented with other products such as facial washes, salicylic acid, and for myself, sea water.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my son. It&#x27;s only been a couple of weeks but he seems to like it. The shipping was fast also.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I hope that Claror continue to sell this treatment.</li>
            <li> Helped clear my acne when no other product worked!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Claror Acne Treatment on my cat Claude and it is doing the trick!  Vet and I agree that he looks much better.</li>
            <li> did not help at all!!  applied to my daughter morning and evening faithfully and saw no positive results.</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin - no perfumes, etc.  Very good price for the size.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic...is reducing my 14 year olds embarrassing acne. It&#x27;s has helped when other things haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Too strong for my 12 year old. It burned her face.</li>
            <li> It works!!! It cleared out my all zits in 10 days. No more!! I still use sometimes when it seems come out and it will never get worse and gone...&lt;br /&gt;Still most of this left...&lt;br /&gt;I can keep this but it&#x27;s very big bottle so if half size bottle exist for harf price, it will be much more Costomer friendly and I will give 5 star!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over two months now. I am using it in combination with Insta-Natural Age Defying Skin Clearing Serum (in the morning) and spot treatments with Bye Bye Blemish or tea tree oil, plus the occasional Moroccan red clay powder mask. I am using Claror at night. Since I began using everything I&#x27;ve listed at about the same time, it&#x27;s impossible to say what&#x27;s helping the most. However, I just really wanted to get my skin cleared up quickly for an event about a month ago and so I just started to buy stuff that seemed like it would help and using it all, hoping that something would work. So far, I have been pleased. I seem to have some  dry patches of skin if I overdo the spot treatments but even that is managed by moisturizing or spot treating less frequently. Otherwise no problems for me! I do still get blemishes but my skin is looking much better than it was. These before and after pics aren&#x27;t great but they do show how much better my skin  is right now.</li>
