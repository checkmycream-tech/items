            <li>This image plate has different options and works great.</li>
            <li>Easy payment options and quick shippment.</li>
            <li>I like the designs that are on the plate; it is made out of very strong steel or metal; the designs are spaced very well on the plate.</li>
            <li>The designs are cute and very festive.</li>
            <li>I wish they would come out with more image plates like this where the whole plate is dedicated to a holiday.</li>
            <li>New to stamping wasn&#x27;t able to transfer some of the designs.</li>
            <li>Our 2 granddaughters love them and is always looking for new ones.</li>
            <li>Fun product.  </li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter is able to use these to make very clean, clear designs on her nails.  </li>
            <li>I love the idea of switching my nail art up for different occasions and themes so I was excited when I found this stamp.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ever using a konad image stamping supplies</li>
            <li>i love all the different designs you can put on your nails without having to be a nail artist.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Also you must be aware of the viscosity of the nail polish.</li>
            <li>Would rate higher is it worked with all nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I love adding designs to my nails especially for the holidays.</li>
            <li>I will definately do more business with this vendor in the future.</li>
            <li>You can use them with normal polish or the Konad polish(recomended)!!</li>
            <li>I had trouble getting most of the images to transfer, but I adore the snowman!</li>
            <li>I really like this plate.</li>
            <li>But my real issue was WHY DOES THE REINDEER HAVE AN EYEPATCH???</li>
            <li>She loves them much better then the other brand that was advertised as a &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34</li>
            <li>This plate is kind of hard to use.  </li>
            <li>I have the kit with all the other original image plates and they work find.</li>
            <li>It is great for Christmas with all the little Christmasy little fellows on it!!</li>
            <li>Will definitely get much use out of this one.</li>
            <li>However, if you&#x27;re seriously into stamping like I am, and you want some holiday cheer, there are better options out there, like Bundle Monster&#x27;s holiday plate</li>
            <li>This was a Christmas present for my 10 yr old.  </li>
            <li>When I use the Merry Christmas image, I just use a small nail art brush to make the letters stand out a little more.</li>

            <li> poor design could not get the stamp to pick up the impression and was very messy to use would not get any more</li>
            <li> One little thing is that all of the patterns are cute except for that weird pirate Rudolph thing.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the price and lack of a larger set.</li>
            <li> Can not really be used with Gel colors.</li>
            <li> and I wasnt let down.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that these designs would be a little bigger because even the Merry Christmas is hard to see and read on the nails b/c</li>
            <li> The price is a little steep for one plate too.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with the place is that a couple of the images don&#x27;t transfer very well - the bell is a little hard to transfer and the Merry Christmas is borderline impossible.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so small.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing negative that can be said about the quality of these plates.</li>
            <li> Nothing bad to say about this.</li>
            <li> and I could not get it to work, I hated it.</li>

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t get the nail polish to transfer to the sponge.  What a waist of money. This was a Christmas present for my 10 yr old.  Guess I will send it back to Santa.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters 13th birthday and she LOVES it!  Now she is always doing her friend&#x27;s fingernails.</li>
            <li> I love this Konad plate!!! It is great for Christmas with all the little Christmasy little fellows on it!! Really spruces up any mani!!!! :)</li>
            <li> Only two of the images dont come out well, the saying Merry Christmas and the bell. But the others work great! This was my first time ever using a konad image stamping supplies and I wasnt let down. Even though two of the images didnt work I still like the product.</li>
            <li> I really like this plate. The designs are cute and very festive. The only issue I have with the place is that a couple of the images don&#x27;t transfer very well - the bell is a little hard to transfer and the Merry Christmas is borderline impossible. When I use the Merry Christmas image, I just use a small nail art brush to make the letters stand out a little more. Still cute, though!</li>
            <li> I love this image plate. Konad makes very good image plates that work well with stamping. I wish they would come out with more image plates like this where the whole plate is dedicated to a holiday.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping would buy again i love all the different designs you can put on your nails without having to be a nail artist.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I wanted. My girls and I use it all the time. We got so many complements on our nails.</li>
            <li> We purchased this along with the Konad Stamping nail art kit B set. Nothing bad to say about this. One little thing is that all of the patterns are cute except for that weird pirate Rudolph thing. This Pallet is very nice.</li>
            <li> I have the kit with all the other original image plates and they work find. This one I ordered would not hold enough nail polish and the image would not go on the tool that is used for the stamping. I will be returning it for a refund</li>
            <li> This plate is kind of hard to use.  New to stamping wasn&#x27;t able to transfer some of the designs. Also you must be aware of the viscosity of the nail polish. Would rate higher is it worked with all nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Can not really be used with Gel colors.</li>
            <li> This is a good quality plate that works well, as all Konad plates do. I got it for the Merry Christmas and candy cane designs. However, if you&#x27;re seriously into stamping like I am, and you want some holiday cheer, there are better options out there, like Bundle Monster&#x27;s holiday plate collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a more casual stamper and just want some holiday cheer, I&#x27;d say go for it.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast receipt.  Fun product.  Easy to use and much better price and fun to use than paying 5.00 per nail for a salon to put something cute on your nail....</li>
            <li> This is a great image plate. I love adding designs to my nails especially for the holidays. This image plate has different options and works great.</li>
            <li> There is nothing negative that can be said about the quality of these plates. They are well made and will hold up well. The only complaint is the price and lack of a larger set. I dislike buying three or four of these for the price of another brands sets..... I will still keep purchasing these for my girlfriend though...</li>
            <li> I like the designs that are on the plate; it is made out of very strong steel or metal; the designs are spaced very well on the plate.</li>
            <li> This is a great stamping plate, cute x mass designs. I use these in my salon for quick nail art! You can use them with normal polish or the Konad polish(recomended)!!</li>
            <li> The designs are not deep enough. I could only get three images to stamp properly with multiple attempts, polishes, etc.</li>
            <li> Another great konad stamp for holiday designs. I love the idea of switching my nail art up for different occasions and themes so I was excited when I found this stamp. Will definitely get much use out of this one.</li>
            <li> poor design could not get the stamp to pick up the impression and was very messy to use would not get any more</li>
            <li> I had trouble getting most of the images to transfer, but I adore the snowman! But my real issue was WHY DOES THE REINDEER HAVE AN EYEPATCH??? Just wondering if I&#x27;m the only one to notice this...</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to christmas to use this plate. I can&#x27;t wait. Konad plates are all great so I know I will love the designs. I bought a similar product in a store and I could not get it to work, I hated it. I bought the konad kit and it is great  product I love all there plates and polish. I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Konad is the best stamping kit out there.  My 13 year old daughter is able to use these to make very clean, clear designs on her nails.  She loves them much better then the other brand that was advertised as a &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; product.</li>
            <li> Super cute love this one!</li>
            <li> Product was as described. Easy payment options and quick shippment. I will definately do more business with this vendor in the future.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like different colored nails and would have to paint one nail white in order to use the santa image.  Since this is the one I wanted to use most, not the best option for me.  The Candy cane didn&#x27;t work well for me either.  Quality of the plate itself is OK, This just wasn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> I was hoping that these designs would be a little bigger because even the Merry Christmas is hard to see and read on the nails b/c it&#x27;s so small.  The price is a little steep for one plate too.</li>
            <li> LOve my plate...it was perfect for the holidays...every week, I got to do my nails with a different picture of christmas...Love it...</li>
            <li> The nail stamps are so much fun and to have holiday ones is just great.  Our 2 granddaughters love them and is always looking for new ones.</li>
