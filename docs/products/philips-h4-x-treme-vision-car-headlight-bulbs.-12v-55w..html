    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Best price around would buy again if I need to replace them</li>
            <li>THE BEST and brightest bulbs I have ever had on any of my vehicles</li>
            <li>I will never again trust my life and the lives of my loved ones on a Philips automotive product!</li>
            <li>These are great H4 bulbs for car or motorcycle use.  </li>
            <li>These X-treme headlights for my FZ are definitely bright.  </li>
            <li>Not as bright as stated.</li>
            <li>Headlight works good and is brighter than the stock headlights.</li>
            <li>Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the best price around and free shipping</li>
            <li>I was so amazed and happy with these super bright bulbs that I purchased them for my Toyota Venza as well.  </li>
            <li>I ride a lot, and they seem to be holding their own, but time will tell.  </li>
            <li>Very easy install but thought would be brighter.</li>
            <li>If you go from one very dim headlights to two very bright headlights, you would  be very pleased too.  </li>
            <li>Very bright, very visible.</li>
            <li>More light is a good thing.</li>
            <li>Upgrading to these bulbs gives you a very impressive step up in high beam light.  </li>
            <li>The longevity of the bulbs are what concern me most though.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than OEM.</li>
            <li>Philips has a reputation for manufacturing some of the most technogically advanced auto bulbs on the market and these bulbs are proof of that!  </li>
            <li>These lights are better than the stock</li>
            <li>Next best thing to HID lighting.</li>
            <li>Though they arent nearly as bright as HID lights, they get pretty close.  </li>
            <li>The safety benefits of these bulbs plus the price divided by the expected life cycle of the bulbs makes it a great buy!  </li>
            <li>I would like them better if the light was bluer.</li>
            <li>Once your eyes have adjusted to the light you realize that alot more things can be seen.</li>
            <li>These are bright and so far have lasted 10 months!</li>
            <li>Reality is the light output of my headlights did noticeably improve.</li>
            <li>The product its fantastic</li>
            <li>These light up the road well</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>White bright.</li>
            <li>BUT if you are looking for regular lights these are definitely as bright as you will probably get at this wattage.</li>
            <li>These are much brighter than anything else I have tried, and I have tried a lot of H4 products, mostly from Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good set of bulbs, it will never live up to HID lighting</li>
            <li>When going on vacation with the family in the big SUV, those high beams come in very handy, and reduce the stress of driving at night.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the 3 week wait.</li>
            <li>When you have fog conditions, the lights do not give off as much white light which means you can see through fog better.</li>
            <li>I guess it comes in pairs, so it&#x27;s worth the money for a bike.</li>
            <li>but they wont seem as bright as other cars at first.</li>
            <li>These are almost as bright as 100 watt halogens but won&#x27;t melt down your turn signal stalk.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyone who wants a quick upgrade, I would recommend these bulbs.</li>
            <li>Really like this one!</li>
            <li>At first I was hesitant to purchase these bulbs because of the price but, after doing some research I was sold.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The extra light and safety is worth the added costs and shorter life.</li>
            <li>These X-Treme Vision bulbs really do deliver 90% more light than low cost standard and competitor&#x27;s premium bulbs.  </li>
            <li>These bulbs were great while they lasted but, six months of light use (very little night driving) before burning out is ridiculous especially as much as they cost.  </li>
            <li>Mine died in 7 months of intense use.</li>
            <li>but i guess i have been spoiled by HID kits because i wasint really wowed like i thought i would be.</li>
            <li>These lights give off a tinge of yellow light but don&#x27;t be scared.</li>
            <li>know its not suppose to give you any blue light when on or off</li>
            <li>It does work very well at night for a motorcycle.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve used H4 from other brands with much better results.</li>
            <li>YMMV; a motorcycle headlight bulb burns 100% of the time (on most bikes anyway) and is subject to more vibration/jarring than the typical auto.</li>
            <li>bulbs that I replaced them with a new set.</li>
            <li>The light is solidly white, with no blue.  </li>
            <li>The bulbs don&#x27;t last as long as bulbs from the dealer, but the difference in light output on high beam is substantial.  </li>
            <li>I would buy these again even if they are not long-lived (trade-off for higher intensity at same wattage)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using them for a week now, so far they&#x27;re far brighter than my stock halogen bulbs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far, it is as advertised.</li>
            <li>I purchased these bulbs for my Toyota Highlander and they are BY FAR</li>
            <li>Philips has defintely gone downhill as far as quality and peoduct dependability are concerned.  </li>
            <li>My first set lasted only a year, first one then the other quit working.</li>
            <li>I wished the bulb lasted longer than about a year (7-8K miles), despite proper handling/installation, particularly considering the cost.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m interested to see how long they last.</li>
            <li>They work as the OEM part maybe a very little brither ,  if you are looking for a white light, you should look for another product</li>
            <li>She drives some back roads near Clifton, Virgina.  </li>
            <li>The only real downside is that they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I carefully installed the product wearing new gloves and within 2 usage hours the low beam burned out.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this one!</li>
            <li> These X-treme headlights for my FZ are definitely bright.  White bright. The longevity of the bulbs are what concern me most though. I ride a lot, and they seem to be holding their own, but time will tell.  The bulbs are not rated as one of the longer lasting bulbs on the market, but they are rated as one of the brighter ones.</li>
            <li> Both of these bulbs died within days of each other after only THREE MONTHS! We&#x27;ve used H4 from other brands with much better results. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are much brighter than anything else I have tried, and I have tried a lot of H4 products, mostly from Europe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time will tell how long they last.</li>
            <li> We put them on my wife&#x27;s 2005 Subaru Legacy.  She drives some back roads near Clifton, Virgina.  The bulbs took all the stress out of drivi9ng home in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra light and safety is worth the added costs and shorter life.</li>
            <li> Upgrading to these bulbs gives you a very impressive step up in high beam light.  The light is solidly white, with no blue.  The bulbs don&#x27;t last as long as bulbs from the dealer, but the difference in light output on high beam is substantial.  When going on vacation with the family in the big SUV, those high beams come in very handy, and reduce the stress of driving at night.  More light is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Headlight works good and is brighter than the stock headlights. Unfortunately it is not a bright or as white as I expected, or even as compared to some other products I have purchased in the past. However, it is definitely brighter than the stock lights we had on our motorcycles. Which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> These are great H4 bulbs for car or motorcycle use.  Very bright, very visible. Phillips are known for their durability and long life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using them for a week now, so far they&#x27;re far brighter than my stock halogen bulbs.&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who wants a quick upgrade, I would recommend these bulbs.</li>
            <li> Color between the typical dirty T shirt and a white light.  I would guess 4200 kelvin.  Definitely better than OEM. The low beams seemed around 1100 lumens and the hight around 2000 lumens.  Regular halogens are 1000 kelvin lows, and 1600 kelvin highs. Xenons are typically 3000 lumens low, and 5000 kelvins hight.</li>
            <li> Very easy install but thought would be brighter. Best price around would buy again if I need to replace them</li>
            <li> Mine died in 7 months of intense use. Seems to be common problem with high output lamps. Used them in Mitsubishi Lancer IX.</li>
            <li> Quite a bit brighter than the stock bulbs on my &#x27;05 GSXR 600. They were quite pricey but definitely a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m interested to see how long they last. So far so good.</li>
            <li> These are almost as bright as 100 watt halogens but won&#x27;t melt down your turn signal stalk. The only real downside is that they don&#x27;t last long. My first set lasted only a year, first one then the other quit working. Still, they are sufficiently brighter than &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; bulbs that I replaced them with a new set. So -- buy a spare set. You&#x27;ll need it.</li>
            <li> So far, it is as advertised. Only time will tell how long they will last.&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, I cannot yet give them a  5 STAR rating.</li>
            <li> I purchased these bulbs for my Toyota Highlander and they are BY FAR THE BEST and brightest bulbs I have ever had on any of my vehicles (Audi A4 Turbo, Toyota Venza, Mini Cooper S convertible).  At first I was hesitant to purchase these bulbs because of the price but, after doing some research I was sold.  Philips has a reputation for manufacturing some of the most technogically advanced auto bulbs on the market and these bulbs are proof of that!  These X-Treme Vision bulbs really do deliver 90% more light than low cost standard and competitor&#x27;s premium bulbs.  The safety benefits of these bulbs plus the price divided by the expected life cycle of the bulbs makes it a great buy!  I was so amazed and happy with these super bright bulbs that I purchased them for my Toyota Venza as well.  I also plan on buying these bulbs for our &#x27;06 Audi A4 Turbo and &#x27;06 Mini Cooper S convertible.  Thank goodness Amazon has the best price around and free shipping&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/12/2013: We purchased these bulbs in January 2013 and this morning the driver&#x27;s side bulb burned out!  DO NOT THROW YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AWAY ON THESE SUBSTANDARD BULBS!!!  Avoid at all cost.  These bulbs were great while they lasted but, six months of light use (very little night driving) before burning out is ridiculous especially as much as they cost.  We wish we had our money back that we paid for this junk.  Philips has defintely gone downhill as far as quality and peoduct dependability are concerned.  I will never again trust my life and the lives of my loved ones on a Philips automotive product!</li>
            <li> A definite upgrade for a mid-80&#x27;s Honda motorcycle over the factory halogen.  Just wish it came in a 1-pack...</li>
            <li> Not as bright as stated. I will not purchase again.  Update 10/28/2015 lasted one year.</li>
            <li> If you go from one very dim headlights to two very bright headlights, you would  be very pleased too.  Though they arent nearly as bright as HID lights, they get pretty close.  It was worth the 3 week wait.</li>
            <li> Was unhappy with stock headlights on my Toyota. Heard about these on an automotive lighting website but was a bit skeptical. Reality is the light output of my headlights did noticeably improve. I would buy these again even if they are not long-lived (trade-off for higher intensity at same wattage)</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace a set of eurolights and i did notice them to be brighter but i guess i have been spoiled by HID kits because i wasint really wowed like i thought i would be. BUT if you are looking for regular lights these are definitely as bright as you will probably get at this wattage.</li>
            <li> The product its fantastic</li>
            <li> I carefully installed the product wearing new gloves and within 2 usage hours the low beam burned out.  I replaced the bulb with the second one in the package and it also burned out within about 2 working hours.  I wouldnt recommend.</li>
            <li> Quite a bit brighter than the stock bulbs I replaced.  I would like them better if the light was bluer.</li>
            <li> These lights give off a tinge of yellow light but don&#x27;t be scared. These lights are better than the stock Piaa&#x27;s that came with my 2011 Kia Soul. When you have fog conditions, the lights do not give off as much white light which means you can see through fog better. These light up the road well but they wont seem as bright as other cars at first. Once your eyes have adjusted to the light you realize that alot more things can be seen.</li>
            <li> These are bright and so far have lasted 10 months!</li>
            <li> Good set of bulbs, it will never live up to HID lighting BUT, it is brighter then any stock lamps out there.&lt;br /&gt;And for those of you whos wondering about the blue tint at the tip of the bulb, for me, I dont see any blue while the bulbs are on nor do you see any blue in the headlight with the lights on or off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know its not suppose to give you any blue light when on or off but it was a question I was wondering myself before I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this bulb (H-4 version) in my motorcycle&#x27;s headlight for a few years, since it won a comparison test in a magazine.  It throws a slightly longer, slightly brighter pattern than other similar aftermarket bulbs. I wished the bulb lasted longer than about a year (7-8K miles), despite proper handling/installation, particularly considering the cost. YMMV; a motorcycle headlight bulb burns 100% of the time (on most bikes anyway) and is subject to more vibration/jarring than the typical auto.</li>
            <li> They work as the OEM part maybe a very little brither ,  if you are looking for a white light, you should look for another product</li>
            <li> Next best thing to HID lighting. It does work very well at night for a motorcycle. I guess it comes in pairs, so it&#x27;s worth the money for a bike.</li>
