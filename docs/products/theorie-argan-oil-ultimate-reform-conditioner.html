            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and makes my hair look</li>
            <li>I will never buy another kind of conditioner ever again.  </li>
            <li>Normally I see best results</li>
            <li>Just like the shampoo, use it sparingly and it keeps my color and keratin staying nice and it has a very light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I dont think it get s any more humid than that.</li>
            <li>I am completely in love with this conditioner because it makes my hair feel healthy and shiny and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I comb it thru with a wide-toothed comb before rinsing out, and my hair has never been shinier, smoother, sleeker, more well-behaved EVER.  </li>
            <li>but I would gladly pay more if I can&#x27;t find it there anymore.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product,</li>
            <li>As a level-set:  I have wavy caucasian hair; tends more towards FRIZZY than wavy.  </li>
            <li>love my hair</li>
            <li>and I love  Theorie:))&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>but it also leaves me with that silky feeling when I brush it and a gentle but pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>I tried this conditioner and now looking for it everywhere because it is truly the best on the market for dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waiting to see if my hair will get repaired as it claims to do so, but for the time being, it&#x27;s a great conditioner that I switched to from my old one that I had used for years.</li>
            <li>Ever since I went for the keratin treatment I have been trying to find a good conditioner that deeply softens and restores my hair; this conditioner not only does that marvelously well</li>
            <li>pretty much all leave my hair feeling the same, but I did notice it felt softer and not so fly awayish, kind of a silky feel to it.  </li>
            <li>With these products my hair is full, wavy, shiny.</li>
            <li>She said not only was my hair in great ccondition, I also have a lot of new growth throughout my scalp.</li>
            <li>have been on the hunt for the best out there for nearly 20 years...using the most expensive ($100+) to store bought....</li>
            <li>So this one has water as its first ingredient, then argania spinosa kernel oil, vitis vinifera seed oil, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone/silsequioxane copolymer, ceteareth-10,</li>
            <li>attached picture of my hair that I colored last time like 6 months ago:)</li>
            <li>and as we &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; it becomes more dry.  </li>
            <li>When the weather is humid, i just add pure argan oil before it dries.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are the results I had with my fine blonde hair..</li>
            <li>The frizz factor is eliminated (although summer may prove otherwise); my hair is so much softer, shinier with well defined curl.  </li>
            <li>None of the preservitives SLS etc like many other products.</li>
            <li>I have full, curly hair and use this conditioner regularly.</li>
            <li>I would most definitely recommend this product to anybody who wishes to enjoy all the benefits I described before with a paraben and sulfate (and other harsh chemicals) free product.</li>
            <li>I bought it and used it on clean dry hair.  </li>
            <li>so I have to wash it right away next day.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to find anymore bottles at Marshalls, TJ Maxx or Homegoods - but thank goodness for Amazon!!</li>
            <li>But it seems to make my hair soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is shinier, thicker and so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and</li>
            <li>Very rich, thick, creamy.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I have only used this conditioner once, and normally conditioners</li>
            <li>So, it is not fully &amp;#34;natural&#x27;, the last ingredient is a bit controversial, but at least it is last.  </li>
            <li>With 2  daughters with kind of difficult hair, I am always on the look out for non drying hair products.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my fine thin hair actually feeling full and fluffy.  </li>
            <li>I have saved so much money in hair products that just create build up and wighs it down.</li>
            <li>When I want a sleek, close-to-the-head look, not fluffy, I use this as a styling tool on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Naturally curly hair is typically dry to begin with</li>
            <li>No blow drying, no flat iron, no diffuser.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using these products (shampoo/conditioner) for over a year now. Very rich, thick, creamy. I have waist long, thick, coarse wavy to curly hair. After using this for so long, my hair always receives compliments. I didn&#x27;t use mouse, gel or any other hair products. Never in my life I imagined this could be possibe. When the weather is humid, i just add pure argan oil before it dries. I have saved so much money in hair products that just create build up and wighs it down. With these products my hair is full, wavy, shiny. Victoria secret style. I used to hate my hair, and always had it up. Now I looove my hair. No blow drying, no flat iron, no diffuser. I just wash it at night. Go to bed with it humid. Wake up next day and and just slightly fixt it with fingers or a broad coam and that&#x27;s it. And all this in Orlando, Florida weather. I dont think it get s any more humid than that. Cant imagune how it would look if i lived up north. The only product I know with Argan oil as second ingredient.</li>
            <li> Leaves my fine thin hair actually feeling full and fluffy.  None of the preservitives SLS etc like many other products.</li>
            <li> This is probably the best product I could have ever used on my hair and God knows I have tried plenty. Ever since I went for the keratin treatment I have been trying to find a good conditioner that deeply softens and restores my hair; this conditioner not only does that marvelously well but it also leaves me with that silky feeling when I brush it and a gentle but pleasant smell. I would most definitely recommend this product to anybody who wishes to enjoy all the benefits I described before with a paraben and sulfate (and other harsh chemicals) free product.</li>
            <li> Just like the shampoo, use it sparingly and it keeps my color and keratin staying nice and it has a very light fragrance. Love it!</li>
            <li> So far so good! I love the smell! But it seems to make my hair soft. I&#x27;m waiting to see if my hair will get repaired as it claims to do so, but for the time being, it&#x27;s a great conditioner that I switched to from my old one that I had used for years.</li>
            <li> I am completely in love with this conditioner because it makes my hair feel healthy and shiny and moisturized. I tried this conditioner and now looking for it everywhere because it is truly the best on the market for dry and damaged hair. And believe me, it tried EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> With 2  daughters with kind of difficult hair, I am always on the look out for non drying hair products.  I am so tired of all these fancy shampoos and conditioners that promise the world, and then when I read their ingredient panel, they all sound the same, chemical after chemical, alcohols, sulfates and petroleum products.  I saw this bottle and one daughter has become borderline obsessed with argan oil, swearing that it is making her hair softer and grow fast.  So this one has water as its first ingredient, then argania spinosa kernel oil, vitis vinifera seed oil, glyceryl stearate, dimethicone/silsequioxane copolymer, ceteareth-10, boswellia carterii oil, peg-4 sorbita stearate, cetrimonium chloride, hyaluronic acid, parfum, hydroxypropyl guar, phenoxyethanol.  So, it is not fully &amp;#34;natural&#x27;, the last ingredient is a bit controversial, but at least it is last.  Nonetheless, I have only used this conditioner once, and normally conditioners pretty much all leave my hair feeling the same, but I did notice it felt softer and not so fly awayish, kind of a silky feel to it.  Very nice.  Might splurge for the shampoo half of it now.</li>
            <li> This is the elite in conditioners!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been on the hunt for the best out there for nearly 20 years...using the most expensive ($100+) to store bought....my search is over!  I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;These are the results I had with my fine blonde hair..&lt;br /&gt;Easy combing&lt;br /&gt;No breakage&lt;br /&gt;Quick drying time&lt;br /&gt;Bounce lightness to my hair when dried&lt;br /&gt;Glossy Shen and shine&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to all!  Don&#x27;t be afraid to try this one...it&#x27;s a winner:).&lt;br /&gt;Should be #1 at amazon for beauty for sure!</li>
            <li> Favorite conditioner ever! I have full, curly hair and use this conditioner regularly. I don&#x27;t rinse it out, just scrunch it through my curls. It smells amazing and makes my hair look it&#x27;s best. Love it!</li>
            <li> A little goes a loooooooooong way (I have very long thick hair that sometimes decides to be curly or wavy depending on the mood its in, but i prefer it to be straight and pretty with very little wave......this stuff only requires 3 pumps (4 on a badly tangled day) .....this is far less than I have had to use with every other conditioner under the sun....and I&#x27;ve tried them all....drugstore brand, salon brands, you name it, I&#x27;ve probably tried it.  I will never buy another kind of conditioner ever again.  I&#x27;m sold.    I comb it thru with a wide-toothed comb before rinsing out, and my hair has never been shinier, smoother, sleeker, more well-behaved EVER.  I found mine at TJ Maxx or Marshalls for around $14 but I would gladly pay more if I can&#x27;t find it there anymore.  I will cry if they stop making this stuff.  I use it with the \\&quot;matching\\&quot; shampoo.  Only need 2 or 3 pumps of that stuff.</li>
            <li> I got this at Marshall&#x27;s for a fraction of the cost.  But you never know what you will find there from visit to visit.  I bought it and used it on clean dry hair.  I have a very short pixie cut.  Love love love this product, esp when I don&#x27;t want to use hair gels and thickeners to &amp;#34;spike&amp;#34; my look.  When I want a sleek, close-to-the-head look, not fluffy, I use this as a styling tool on dry hair.  It only takes a little.  I will def purchase again.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a shampoo and conditioner that would restore and help my hair to grow back. I had substantial hair loss after an extensive stay in the hospital. No matter what product I had gotten in the drugstore, it never worked. After using just half a bottle of the shampoo and conditioner( which you do not have to use a lot) my beautician was amazed. She said not only was my hair in great ccondition, I also have a lot of new growth throughout my scalp. My hair is shinier, thicker and so soft. It also smells great. If your looking for a great product to manage and help hair growth this is the one.</li>
            <li> As a level-set:  I have wavy caucasian hair; tends more towards FRIZZY than wavy.  Normally I see best results when I condition like crazy, DO NOT let a brush touch it, and dry naturally.  I&#x27;m always fighting frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this in my local Marshalls for just under $15 and decided to give it a try based on igredients (Argan oil is 2nd ingredient).  I am amazed.  A little goes a LONG way; with drugstore conditioners I have to use handfulls just to work it through my hair, I only need a tablespoon of this.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I have battled a life long war to tame my very curly, very thick Caucasian hair.  Naturally curly hair is typically dry to begin with and as we &amp;#34;mature&amp;#34; it becomes more dry.  I also found the Theorie Argan Oil shampoo and conditioner at Marshall&#x27;s and after a careful review of the ingredients decided to give it a try.  The results have been awesome!  The frizz factor is eliminated (although summer may prove otherwise); my hair is so much softer, shinier with well defined curl.  Unfortunately I haven&#x27;t been able to find anymore bottles at Marshalls, TJ Maxx or Homegoods - but thank goodness for Amazon!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best product I have used so far!&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair in the evening with regular shampoo, put theorie Argan oil conditioner, comb through and I go to bed with wet hair. I wake up in the morning with the softest, beach waves/curls.&lt;br /&gt;I have tons of hair, hard to manage - not any more.&lt;br /&gt;This condition doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down, doesn&#x27;t make them too oily so I have to wash it right away next day. My hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I love my hair and I love  Theorie:))&lt;br /&gt;I attached picture of my hair that I colored last time like 6 months ago:) and they still look great!!!:)</li>
            <li> GREAT CONDITIONER!!!MY HAIR FILLS LIKE SILK</li>
            <li> Helped repair my hair from damage caused by medication.</li>
