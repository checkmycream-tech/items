            <li>This product worked better than anything on the shelf.</li>
            <li>I would reorder more soon.</li>
            <li>anyway product worked ok in the mixture</li>
            <li>Blends well with the oils I&#x27;m using, and spreads easily.</li>
            <li>Finely ground</li>
            <li>I added a little bit of this to my home made sunscreen I think it made wonders for my sunscreen used it during camp loved it!!</li>

            <li>I spent a great deal of time breaking this down on a plastic plate and a credit card.</li>
            <li>To date it has worked so far</li>
            <li>But so far I like it.</li>
            <li>Mixed in fine with the other ingredients and worked well as a sun protectant.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t burned and I do live in central Florida</li>
            <li>and it wasnt as dusty as i thought it would be :) my mixture didnt comeout completly smooth and there was still a glopy consitiancy not really sure if all zinc oxide is like that or not.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that is leaves a little white cast on my skin when i mix it in my oil free face moisturiser.</li>

            <li> yes it is white and i like thick sunscreen because all of the sheer sunscreens keep letting me tan.</li>
            <li> for pimples just take a little powder, mix with water and apply.</li>
            <li> I also like that the bag isn&#x27;t insanely small</li>
            <li> not really sure how well of a sunblock it will be</li>
            <li> Though I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so hard to blend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen people use the paste for cold sores as well.</li>

            <li> Well this is my fist time using a pure zinc oxide powder for my home made sun screen. To date it has worked so far, I haven&#x27;t gotten any burn in the sun since i started using it. The only problem is that is leaves a little white cast on my skin when i mix it in my oil free face moisturiser. But when I mix it in coconut oil, and olive oil and apply to the rest of my body there is no white on my skin. If my face wasn&#x27;t so prone to acne break outs i would have mixed it with the oils and apply to my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the only reason I gave it a 4, is because of the white cast on my face. But so far I like it. I will continue to use it on my body. If I could find something to mix it with to take away the white cast I would be  more satisfied.</li>
            <li> Blends well with the oils I&#x27;m using, and spreads easily. While it isn&#x27;t completely invisible once applied, it is very close, and I am quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> I added a little bit of this to my home made sunscreen I think it made wonders for my sunscreen used it during camp loved it!!</li>
            <li> I mix this with beeswax and make my own sunscreen. yes it is white and i like thick sunscreen because all of the sheer sunscreens keep letting me tan. I do not want a tan on my face.</li>
            <li> Used this to make sunscreen and it worked great!</li>
            <li> I saw that this was a non-nano product so I snatched it up for a lotion with SPF that I wanted to make. It seems to work! I haven&#x27;t burned and I do live in central Florida and it&#x27;s July.</li>
            <li> Buy several powders seller and is a great option! very good service and packing, all excellent quality products to create my own fabulous makeup combinations without damaging my skin that is delicate. Thanks for the quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this to make homemade sunscreen. Mixed in fine with the other ingredients and worked well as a sun protectant.</li>
            <li> for pimples just take a little powder, mix with water and apply. I&#x27;ve seen people use the paste for cold sores as well. for sunscreen just add a spoon to a bottle of lotion( or look up proportions online)</li>
            <li> This product worked better than anything on the shelf. I would reorder more soon. Love it love it great product.</li>
            <li> I know that I was purchasing a powder with bigger fragments. Though I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so hard to blend. I spent a great deal of time breaking this down on a plastic plate and a credit card. I blended it into coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I should have read the description better!  My fault.  This is nano particles and will be absorbed into the bloodstream.  NOT what I wanted when making my own non toxic sunscreen</li>
            <li> Used this to make homemade sunscreen for my boys. Worked great!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly in the diaper rash cream I make. I also like that the bag isn&#x27;t insanely small so u can measure from it without spilling everywhere</li>
            <li> Great in making sunscreen or lotion.  Finely ground so mixes well. Found it to be excellent for the products I created.</li>
            <li> I use this in my lip balms and hand salves - perfect for my needs - would purchase more. thanks</li>
            <li> This is the very first time i have used Zinc Oxide. overall i was impressed at how well it mixed into the liquids for my sunscreen. and it wasnt as dusty as i thought it would be :) my mixture didnt comeout completly smooth and there was still a glopy consitiancy not really sure if all zinc oxide is like that or not. shipping sucked it is way too much but that really doesnt have anything to do with the product. anyway product worked ok in the mixture not really sure how well of a sunblock it will be but lets hope its a good one :)</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; sunscreen. Works great even on my red-head and my kid who has eczema and skin allergies to other sunscreens.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m making my own sunscreen fron a recipe on Pinterest. Can&#x27;t wait to test it in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;I also put it in a loose powder container and apply it with a brush. I blend it well on my arms and hands and I don&#x27;t look white.</li>
            <li> My package arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased it to make my own sun screen&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the product and will re order when I need to.</li>
