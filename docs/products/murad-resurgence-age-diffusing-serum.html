            <li>I have tried everything over the counter and heard that Murad was a good Acne product.</li>
            <li>It is no miracle in a bottle, but it&#x27;s good for my skin.  </li>
            <li>However, it does feel good on my skin</li>
            <li>but I think I can find something just as good.</li>
            <li>, SO YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOOD.  </li>
            <li>and I receive many compliments on how great it looks.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the product and will always be a Murad user.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased, and I know I will reorder.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite Murad product!  </li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite finds!</li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time that my face looks very fresh and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>After watching the infomercial I guess I was expecting amazing results.  </li>
            <li>Really happy to discover these thoughtful products.</li>
            <li>but Murad products are amazing</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many wrinkle creams and lotions but none work as good as this one or any of the Murad products.  </li>
            <li>This cream has a nice consistency, texture and scent</li>
            <li>product was packaged nicely.....</li>
            <li>My sister liked this product a lot and recommended to me.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it for a good price.</li>
            <li>Have been using the Resurgence line for about one month with noticeably Quick and Great results.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s really light with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I think the most amazing thing was when I couldn&#x27;t afford to purchase more</li>
            <li>Not so sure it does so well.  </li>
            <li>I do love the smell</li>
            <li>I am so glad I chose this product.</li>
            <li>My skin has gotten so much better</li>
            <li>I thought, \\&quot;This stuff better work miricles for this price.\\</li>
            <li>Murad&#x27;s age-diffusing serum is my favorite and I intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love that product.</li>
            <li>Works better as a hair serum than on my skin.</li>
            <li>Since using Murad serum in combination with the night cream, my face has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>Murad is one of my favorite skin care lines.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite serum, but it is pricey.</li>
            <li>I kept telling myself to be patient and give it more time</li>
            <li>LOVE YOU, Dr. Murad.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite serum.</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it.  </li>
            <li>I love Murad.</li>
            <li>My skin is simply better ; wrinkles are not as noticable and pores are refined, plus it just somehow makes your skin look and feel --- uh....</li>
            <li>I can not think of a better description.</li>
            <li>Great deal and fast s/h</li>
            <li>Love Murad products..switched from Mary Kay three Yeats ago.</li>
            <li>An informercial caught my eye, so I looked for the items on Amazon ( I love Amazon) and ordered it to try it out.  </li>
            <li>However, after I apply this product around the mouth area, it appears to be more wrinkles.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>The 3 SkinWest products have the Murad authentic hologram seal  -  the Payless product did not.  </li>
            <li>I love all things with the Murad name.</li>
            <li>It is helping lighten some of my sun damage and my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>purchased not one, but 3 resurgence items and although I was able to return them I paid a 15% restocking fee-</li>
            <li>This product I have been using for 4 months, and it keeps on working, not like others I have brought, and stop after a short period, very HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It is a good moisterizer though but for the money there are much cheaper ones!</li>
            <li>If purchased in fine beauty stores, it costs considerably more.</li>
            <li>It does leave skin smooth and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>It seems to smooth out the appearance of wrinkles and give a more dewy look.</li>
            <li>Since becoming a user of this product, I will never change to any thing else.  </li>
            <li>I wear a mineral foundation and it glides on easily.</li>
            <li>I have tried many skin products, but I have never found a product that produces such great results as this one does.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to find this on Amazon for the price and happier yet when it came, fast &amp; fresh..</li>
            <li>Helps with blemishes, fine lines, and for me, filling in a childhood scar I have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light and quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li>Treat yourself, you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li>PRODUCT, AND AMAZON MAKES IT AVAILABLE</li>
            <li>and I liked it so much I bought it again.</li>
            <li>Glad to be able to get this product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>was good enough, refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is dose-related and is definitely better if I don&#x27;t use the full pump&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I applied too much on day two (more is better, right?)</li>
            <li>I consider the Murad hologram sealed box of great value - however, with counterfeiters rampant, the bottom of the Murad box is unsealed and, therefore, unprotected from frauders slipping in a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li>I love the whole resurgence line.</li>
            <li>I tried so many creams nothing really worked....</li>
            <li>I have used Murad for 1 1/2 years and Love this serum, makes my skin smooth with no heavy fragance.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li>Seriously, the best way to get clear skin in my opinion is going to see a dermatologist who can decide a personalized method according to your skin, eating healthy, drinking water, and working out.</li>
            <li>I am not sure how good or better it is compared to the Murad Intensive Wrinkle Reducer.</li>
            <li>It feels very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is a marvelous product and I was thrilled to see it on amazon for about 30% off, now for the bad news....</li>
            <li>I have used this product for over a year now, and the results are just incredible, it has taken at least 2 or more years of age off my 50 year old face.  </li>
            <li>The products are a bit pricey but in my opinion well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>If you are on the fence it is definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li>WORTH BUYING,</li>
            <li>It always arrives right on schedule.</li>
            <li>You see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>so I bought the promo offer first - very easy to follow the regimen, simple.  </li>
            <li>if something seems too good to be true, usually it</li>
            <li>I like all Murad products very much.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need more than one pump for your entire face.</li>
            <li>Bare skin looks fresh, dewy, absolutely younger, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>I was wary when reading about Murad&#x27;s Resurgence line, However, I am very happy with the way my skin has improved in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>It burned the first time I used it but hasn&#x27;t since so give it a chance.</li>
            <li>The interesting thing is though when I tried it at Sephora it had completely different smell and feel to it than when I received mine from this seller.</li>
            <li>, I kid you not, the day after I stopped using it my skin instantly felt better and I have now been off it for a week</li>
            <li>A real skin changer!</li>
            <li>I bought my first Murad Resurgence Age Diffusing Serum 2 from Sephora.  </li>
            <li>I suggest trying the trial size first to see if the Serum works on your skin, too.  </li>
            <li>This really does work!  </li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend to anyone still searching for the right skincare line.</li>
            <li>This is the only product in the Murad line that I have used and I will most certainly continue with it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all the Murad products for both young and old... (better to start young, taking care of your skin)and better not to have to pay to much to do it.  </li>
            <li>I did exactly as the directions stated and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li>I am actually seeing fine wrinkle lines along my cheek area.</li>
            <li>I feel like my skin has improved so much.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I really use this product and it meets all my expectations.</li>
            <li>It arrived intact and at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Started using a couple years ago and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>/&gt;shipping was fast.....</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon I am now using the product I know</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 63 and don&#x27;t notice moisture as much as firming.  </li>
            <li>Murad Resurgence Age-Diffusing Serum, is the real deal.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast service too.</li>
            <li>I really like this serum.</li>
            <li>really like it.</li>
            <li>For some reason it didn&#x27;t seem to do all that much this time around.</li>
            <li>Maybe because I am going through that time of life when the hormones are really kicking my butt.</li>
            <li>I may try it in another five years but for now, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>It eliminates frizz wihout weighing my baby blonde fair hair down and won&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Luckily it went away fairly quickly, but it was very alarming.</li>
            <li>I have used this brand in the past and continue to use it although I cant honestly say I notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>This product is OK but not worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I am about to turn 58 years old and this serum helps hide that little fact nicely.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue using this entire line.</li>
            <li>The one from Sephora was a year older than the one from I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>-I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just resigned to the fact that it will be Mama&#x27;s little helper for the rest of her days  :)</li>
            <li>and when I touched my face to feel its new smoothness, it was peeling off in my hands.</li>
            <li>but I do have those fine lines and dark circles under my eyes that I wanted to lighten.</li>
            <li>Initially, the products were only available through infomercials.  </li>
            <li>Love this product, It really makes your skin soft and glowing but it only takes a few drops if you use to much it will make your face sticky..</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and can not use anything with an SPF in it.  </li>
            <li>It lasts a long time and is worth the hefty price.  </li>
            <li>This did nothing for me other than to dry my skin out even more.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers the same product at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>Been using this product every eve on only one side of my face to see if there really would be difference.</li>
            <li>And as far as the seller - it&#x27;s always is packaged well and delivered on time.  </li>
            <li>I use the entire line of Murad products and this Age Diffusing Serum works very well.</li>
            <li>I started using it at the same time I switched to the whole Resurgence line.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>THE PRODUCTS WERE DEVELOPED BY</li>
            <li>I have the whole series and it took years out of my face within a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I saw an old review of mine on this product</li>
            <li>I, of course, love the idea of paying less for Murad - but am I really paying less.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much a bomb and a lot of money down the tube!</li>
            <li>The wrinkles on my forehead and laugh lines are considerably less noticeable.</li>
            <li>My 60ish skin has never looked better (well, at least in the last 10 years!).</li>
            <li>I was not willing to pay an arm and leg however, I had a boundry of what I was willing to spend.</li>
            <li>Even my critical 14 year old Daughter noticed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52 and don&#x27;t have truly major wrinkles</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this serum adds anything significant -</li>
            <li>Spent my youth adoring the sun with no protection.</li>
            <li>and I started my first one less than a month ago.  </li>
            <li>I used it several times and noticed that it would burn a little when applied to freshly cleansed skin.  </li>
            <li>With this line, my skin has changed to never t-zone oily and no dry patches.</li>
            <li>I suffer dry patches and this completely got rid of them.</li>
            <li>but all of those high priced creams do the same as all the other moisterizers.</li>
            <li>Will probably try to find something a bit less expensive that does just as good when I run out.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased, and I know I will reorder.</li>
            <li> and most people say I look great foe my age.</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I would literally wake up and have more acne!</li>
            <li> Love the product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite Murad product!  </li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite finds!</li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time that my face looks very fresh and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> After watching the infomercial I guess I was expecting amazing results.  </li>
            <li> Really happy to discover these thoughtful products.</li>
            <li> but Murad products are amazing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many wrinkle creams and lotions but none work as good as this one or any of the Murad products.  </li>
            <li> This cream has a nice consistency, texture and scent</li>
            <li> product was packaged nicely.....</li>
            <li> My sister liked this product a lot and recommended to me.  </li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it for a good price.</li>
            <li> Have been using the Resurgence line for about one month with noticeably Quick and Great results.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really light with a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> I think the most amazing thing was when I couldn&#x27;t afford to purchase more</li>
            <li> Not so sure it does so well.  </li>
            <li> I do love the smell</li>
            <li> I am so glad I chose this product.</li>
            <li> My skin has gotten so much better</li>
            <li> I thought, \\&quot;This stuff better work miricles for this price.\\</li>
            <li> Murad&#x27;s age-diffusing serum is my favorite and I intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love that product.</li>
            <li> Works better as a hair serum than on my skin.</li>
            <li> Since using Murad serum in combination with the night cream, my face has never looked better.  </li>
            <li> Murad is one of my favorite skin care lines.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite serum, but it is pricey.</li>
            <li> I kept telling myself to be patient and give it more time</li>
            <li> LOVE YOU, Dr. Murad.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite serum.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it.  </li>
            <li> I love Murad.</li>
            <li> My skin is simply better ; wrinkles are not as noticable and pores are refined, plus it just somehow makes your skin look and feel --- uh....</li>
            <li> I can not think of a better description.</li>
            <li> Great deal and fast s/h</li>
            <li> Love Murad products..switched from Mary Kay three Yeats ago.</li>
            <li> An informercial caught my eye, so I looked for the items on Amazon ( I love Amazon) and ordered it to try it out.  </li>
            <li> However, after I apply this product around the mouth area, it appears to be more wrinkles.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> The 3 SkinWest products have the Murad authentic hologram seal  -  the Payless product did not.  </li>
            <li> I love all things with the Murad name.</li>
            <li> It is helping lighten some of my sun damage and my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> purchased not one, but 3 resurgence items and although I was able to return them I paid a 15% restocking fee-</li>
            <li> This product I have been using for 4 months, and it keeps on working, not like others I have brought, and stop after a short period, very HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> It is a good moisterizer though but for the money there are much cheaper ones!</li>
            <li> If purchased in fine beauty stores, it costs considerably more.</li>
            <li> It does leave skin smooth and healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> It seems to smooth out the appearance of wrinkles and give a more dewy look.</li>
            <li> Since becoming a user of this product, I will never change to any thing else.  </li>
            <li> I wear a mineral foundation and it glides on easily.</li>
            <li> I have tried many skin products, but I have never found a product that produces such great results as this one does.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find this on Amazon for the price and happier yet when it came, fast &amp; fresh..</li>
            <li> Helps with blemishes, fine lines, and for me, filling in a childhood scar I have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> Treat yourself, you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT, AND AMAZON MAKES IT AVAILABLE</li>
            <li> and I liked it so much I bought it again.</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to get this product at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> was good enough, refreshing.</li>
            <li> It is dose-related and is definitely better if I don&#x27;t use the full pump&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I applied too much on day two (more is better, right?)</li>
            <li> I consider the Murad hologram sealed box of great value - however, with counterfeiters rampant, the bottom of the Murad box is unsealed and, therefore, unprotected from frauders slipping in a counterfeit product.  </li>
            <li> I love the whole resurgence line.</li>
            <li> I tried so many creams nothing really worked....</li>
            <li> I have used Murad for 1 1/2 years and Love this serum, makes my skin smooth with no heavy fragance.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li> Seriously, the best way to get clear skin in my opinion is going to see a dermatologist who can decide a personalized method according to your skin, eating healthy, drinking water, and working out.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how good or better it is compared to the Murad Intensive Wrinkle Reducer.</li>
            <li> It feels very smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> This is a marvelous product and I was thrilled to see it on amazon for about 30% off, now for the bad news....</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now, and the results are just incredible, it has taken at least 2 or more years of age off my 50 year old face.  </li>
            <li> The products are a bit pricey but in my opinion well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> If you are on the fence it is definitely worth trying.  </li>
            <li> WORTH BUYING,</li>
            <li> It always arrives right on schedule.</li>
            <li> You see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> so I bought the promo offer first - very easy to follow the regimen, simple.  </li>
            <li> if something seems too good to be true, usually it</li>
            <li> I like all Murad products very much.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need more than one pump for your entire face.</li>
            <li> Bare skin looks fresh, dewy, absolutely younger, smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> I was wary when reading about Murad&#x27;s Resurgence line, However, I am very happy with the way my skin has improved in just 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> It burned the first time I used it but hasn&#x27;t since so give it a chance.</li>
            <li> The interesting thing is though when I tried it at Sephora it had completely different smell and feel to it than when I received mine from this seller.</li>
            <li> , I kid you not, the day after I stopped using it my skin instantly felt better and I have now been off it for a week</li>
            <li> A real skin changer!</li>
            <li> I bought my first Murad Resurgence Age Diffusing Serum 2 from Sephora.  </li>
            <li> I suggest trying the trial size first to see if the Serum works on your skin, too.  </li>
            <li> This really does work!  </li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend to anyone still searching for the right skincare line.</li>
            <li> This is the only product in the Murad line that I have used and I will most certainly continue with it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all the Murad products for both young and old... (better to start young, taking care of your skin)and better not to have to pay to much to do it.  </li>
            <li> I did exactly as the directions stated and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.</li>
            <li> I am actually seeing fine wrinkle lines along my cheek area.</li>
            <li> I feel like my skin has improved so much.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I really use this product and it meets all my expectations.</li>
            <li> It arrived intact and at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Started using a couple years ago and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> /&gt;shipping was fast.....</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon I am now using the product I know</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 63 and don&#x27;t notice moisture as much as firming.  </li>
            <li> Murad Resurgence Age-Diffusing Serum, is the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the fast service too.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum.</li>
            <li> really like it.</li>
            <li> For some reason it didn&#x27;t seem to do all that much this time around.</li>
            <li> Maybe because I am going through that time of life when the hormones are really kicking my butt.</li>
            <li> I may try it in another five years but for now, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> It eliminates frizz wihout weighing my baby blonde fair hair down and won&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Luckily it went away fairly quickly, but it was very alarming.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand in the past and continue to use it although I cant honestly say I notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> This product is OK but not worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I am about to turn 58 years old and this serum helps hide that little fact nicely.</li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue using this entire line.</li>
            <li> The one from Sephora was a year older than the one from I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> -I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just resigned to the fact that it will be Mama&#x27;s little helper for the rest of her days  :)</li>
            <li> and when I touched my face to feel its new smoothness, it was peeling off in my hands.</li>
            <li> but I do have those fine lines and dark circles under my eyes that I wanted to lighten.</li>
            <li> Initially, the products were only available through infomercials.  </li>
            <li> Love this product, It really makes your skin soft and glowing but it only takes a few drops if you use to much it will make your face sticky..</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and can not use anything with an SPF in it.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time and is worth the hefty price.  </li>
            <li> This did nothing for me other than to dry my skin out even more.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers the same product at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li> Been using this product every eve on only one side of my face to see if there really would be difference.</li>
            <li> And as far as the seller - it&#x27;s always is packaged well and delivered on time.  </li>
            <li> I use the entire line of Murad products and this Age Diffusing Serum works very well.</li>
            <li> I started using it at the same time I switched to the whole Resurgence line.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> THE PRODUCTS WERE DEVELOPED BY</li>
            <li> I have the whole series and it took years out of my face within a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I saw an old review of mine on this product</li>
            <li> I, of course, love the idea of paying less for Murad - but am I really paying less.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much a bomb and a lot of money down the tube!</li>
            <li> The wrinkles on my forehead and laugh lines are considerably less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My 60ish skin has never looked better (well, at least in the last 10 years!).</li>
            <li> I was not willing to pay an arm and leg however, I had a boundry of what I was willing to spend.</li>
            <li> Even my critical 14 year old Daughter noticed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52 and don&#x27;t have truly major wrinkles</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this serum adds anything significant -</li>
            <li> Spent my youth adoring the sun with no protection.</li>
            <li> and I started my first one less than a month ago.  </li>
            <li> I used it several times and noticed that it would burn a little when applied to freshly cleansed skin.  </li>
            <li> With this line, my skin has changed to never t-zone oily and no dry patches.</li>
            <li> I suffer dry patches and this completely got rid of them.</li>
            <li> but all of those high priced creams do the same as all the other moisterizers.</li>
            <li> Will probably try to find something a bit less expensive that does just as good when I run out.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same serum from Lancome for a few years, and just wanted something different and new.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> i use this serum before applying my tinted moisturizer and it blends in softly and thin, yet you can really feel it working</li>
            <li> I have mild acne that is prone to hormonal changes (gets worse during that time of the month).</li>
            <li> My skin is soft, tight and well moisturized.</li>
            <li> I do not regret ording this and will continue to use it as long as it is working.  </li>
            <li> waited to long to return it.</li>
            <li> I am in awe, because I have spent a ton of money on skin creams and serums in the last 6 mo.</li>
            <li> I order this every few months, as I use it morning and night on my oily, sensitive, post-menopausal skin; and it is helping combat the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else here, I&#x27;ve been using quality products on my face for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The price of it was also almost 50% lower than everywhere else, so I can&#x27;t say for sure if the dr. Murad came out with something not worth a penny, or I just purchased a fake product.</li>
            <li> I tried this serum as part of the Murad Resurgence trial kit and woke up the next day with small red patches all over my face, dry skin and sun spots much darker than usual.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products but always come back to Murad.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;off\\&quot;- the package was not exactly the same as the ones that I had purchased from Sephora, so I called Murad, it turns out that&lt;br /&gt;none</li>
            <li> I feel like it is actually evening out my skin after only a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I can not live without the age-diffusing serum.</li>
            <li> Besides by using a fake product on our face we are possibly  damaging the very skin we&#x27;re trying to take care of!  </li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have decided to use it on my body, so I don&#x27;t totally feel like I wasted my money, but it stung there too.</li>
            <li> Regrets...</li>
            <li> within a few days I knew that I had to figure out how to get back this products.</li>
            <li> The Murad Serum is very different from all the similar products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it works!</li>
            <li> You suffer from crows feet due to hormonal aging and/or smoking, exposure to rough elements.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Somewhat pricey but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Other products that I use are from the Age Reform line.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I am looking forward to ordering some of their other products at this point.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> Use other face products they offer as well.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until I had to return several over the past year that the caution flags went up.  </li>
            <li> wondered why,  with each small pump of the eye cream,  the initial portion of the eye cream pumped out came out in a congealed form?  </li>
            <li> This winter was rough on my skin and this product help keep moisture and dryness way down!  </li>
            <li> Disappointed that amazon is becoming as risky as ebay.</li>
            <li> This stuff takes a few years off when used with the other Murad products.</li>
            <li> I noticed the difference in about a week, less lines &amp; wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and I needed some serious facial skin care products.</li>
            <li> but I feel slightly greasy after layering it under my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m using less of the products each day as my skin continues to improve.  </li>
            <li> not too greasy, but gives my face the hydration it needs and wrinkles appear less.</li>
            <li> If there was a little progress.</li>
            <li> It is a little pricier than some of the stuff</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s with very dry skin.</li>
            <li> , I think my skin actually looks worse than before.  </li>
            <li> It stung my skin, then the serum started to peel off after it dried out on my skin.</li>
            <li> Noticeable results in a few days and see continuous improvement over time.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t try it, you will never know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> + for a product that might, in fact, be a total complete useless fake.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I have seen any visible difference to date.</li>
            <li> Beware of Counterfeits posted 11-7-2012 and started thinking about how we might be spending our hard-earned money on nothing more than expensive fake useless products.  </li>
            <li> It does improve my skin, a lady in my 60&#x27;s with the usual skin problems.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is VERY expensive  - instead, I&#x27;d suggest that you try other similar products to see how their results are: like Aveeno and Revitalize.  </li>
            <li> Hard to tell, as there are no ingredient listings in the trial kit...</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t found anything I like as well as this.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this line for at least a year or two now</li>
            <li> it now lives in the graveyard with all the other failed face potions.</li>
            <li> they will not reverse the postage of $8 which is not fair.  </li>
            <li> Or, at the very least, doing nothing whatsoever,</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely the worst.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin at all, but I had a very bad reaction to this product.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I was given a bad batch(which has not happened before)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely sad to report that on my skin (I have olive complexion)</li>
            <li> Ouch, it was expensive.  </li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Unable to give highest rating as yet because I have not been using this&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I bought a knock out, but I have never experienced something so bad from a prestigeous brand.</li>
            <li> Ordered this about a month ago and since then my skin has been breaking out like crazy.</li>
            <li> I tried the Murad Acne Complex system and it was HORRIBLE!</li>
            <li> , I hae tried a lot from very expensive to store brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at the amount of entries stating reduced wrinkles?</li>
            <li> Disappointed with it as a facial....anything.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;purging\\&quot; stage made my skin break out something terrible</li>
            <li> It was insane!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T TRY THIS AWFUL PRODUCT!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not so sure it does so well.  My wife and I have used it for a month, and not a lot of results seen.  This stuff is VERY expensive  - instead, I&#x27;d suggest that you try other similar products to see how their results are: like Aveeno and Revitalize.  That&#x27;s what we&#x27;re going to do once we are out of this product brand.</li>
            <li> I can not live without the age-diffusing serum. It makes my skin look so much younger &amp; healthier. I&#x27;ve tried the Lancome line &amp; it doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to this. I noticed the difference in about a week, less lines &amp; wrinkles. I learned my lesson-Murad to the end!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many wrinkle creams and lotions but none work as good as this one or any of the Murad products.  The products are a bit pricey but in my opinion well worth the price.  The wrinkles on my forehead and laugh lines are considerably less noticeable.</li>
            <li> After watching the infomercial I guess I was expecting amazing results.  Not only did I not see any, I think my skin actually looks worse than before.  I do love the smell and I guess I bought the big sizes after trying the SAMPLE sizes you get when you order from the Murad Site because of the smell.  Pretty much a bomb and a lot of money down the tube!</li>
            <li> I have been using Murad products since I turned 40, 16 years ago.  Initially, the products were only available through infomercials.  I cannot imagine life without them.  Until two years ago I only used the treatment phase for combination skin.  Now I use the Resurgence formula.  I love it!  It lasts a long time and is worth the hefty price.  I don&#x27;t wear any foundation and I get compliments all the time!  If you are on the fence it is definitely worth trying.  You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin at all, but I had a very bad reaction to this product.  I used it several times and noticed that it would burn a little when applied to freshly cleansed skin.  Then one day, I fully broke out in a rash.  Luckily it went away fairly quickly, but it was very alarming.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for busiiness and put the Murad serum in my travel bag.  I received compliments every  day on  my skin.  I plan on giving one to my mom and best friend as well. THANK YOU.</li>
            <li> I am pushing 5o and I needed some serious facial skin care products. I was not willing to pay an arm and leg however, I had a boundry of what I was willing to spend. I am so glad I chose this product. I do not regret ording this and will continue to use it as long as it is working.  I feel like my skin has improved so much.  I have very sensitive skin and can not use anything with an SPF in it.  This treatment that I am using as of today is the best I have ever found and am extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This serum is incredible. My skin has gotten so much better and I receive many compliments on how great it looks.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for a week and I immediately noticed a difference in my deep forehead wrinkles. Even my critical 14 year old Daughter noticed! I bought it at the suggestion of a spa employee after she waxed my brows and saw the deep lines on my forehead under the her 10x magnifying lamp. It was $70 at the spa and I agreed to purchase it before she rang me up. I thought, \\&quot;This stuff better work miricles for this price.\\&quot; I am happy to report that it does. This is the only product in the Murad line that I have used and I will most certainly continue with it. I applied too much on day two (more is better, right?) and when I touched my face to feel its new smoothness, it was peeling off in my hands. You don&#x27;t need more than one pump for your entire face. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked at the amount of entries stating reduced wrinkles? I&#x27;m 52 and don&#x27;t have truly major wrinkles but I do have those fine lines and dark circles under my eyes that I wanted to lighten. I&#x27;ve been using the cream for 2 months &amp; 2 weeks and I see no difference whatsoever. It is a good moisterizer though but for the money there are much cheaper ones! After consulting my dermatologist he said there are 100s of creams on the market that claim the same thing but all of those high priced creams do the same as all the other moisterizers. So save yourself some money, drink more water and stay out of the sun or do what my derm recommended, use retin-a or kinerase!!</li>
            <li> Have been using the Resurgence line for about one month with noticeably Quick and Great results. Started with the Evening Renewal kit. Immediate improvement in the color, tone and overall appearance of my face. My skin is olive tone, combination. Spent my youth adoring the sun with no protection. With this line, my skin has changed to never t-zone oily and no dry patches. Bare skin looks fresh, dewy, absolutely younger, smooth and healthy. I wear a mineral foundation and it glides on easily. I will most definitely continue using this entire line. Try it!  Tip: The Murad Vitalic Pomegrante Energizing (foam)cleanser is amazing and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> You suffer from crows feet due to hormonal aging and/or smoking, exposure to rough elements. I started using this product about 3 years ago and it has dramatically changed my face. I saw a difference after only a day of use. Great product.</li>
            <li> I was wary when reading about Murad&#x27;s Resurgence line, However, I am very happy with the way my skin has improved in just 2 weeks. Murad&#x27;s age-diffusing serum is my favorite and I intend to continue using it.</li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t impressed. waited to long to return it. it now lives in the graveyard with all the other failed face potions.</li>
            <li> This product was not what I expected.  I use the Resurgence eye cream and I absolutely love that product. Other products that I use are from the Age Reform line.  This cream has a nice consistency, texture and scent but I feel slightly greasy after layering it under my moisturizer. It is dose-related and is definitely better if I don&#x27;t use the full pump&#x27;s worth. It does leave skin smooth and healthy looking.  I may be using it prematurely though, and may try the serum from the Age Reform line next.</li>
            <li> Nope. Works better as a hair serum than on my skin. It eliminates frizz wihout weighing my baby blonde fair hair down and won&#x27;t cause breakouts. Disappointed with it as a facial....anything. Oh well. I say buy obaji and save your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I see a difference when I stop using this product. It seems to smooth out the appearance of wrinkles and give a more dewy look.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a year now and Amazone has the best pricing I&#x27;ve found on these products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and always get compliments on my complexion, so I&#x27;ll keep using it.  It&#x27;s very light and quickly absorbed.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this serum at Sephora and was stunned by the effect it had on my skin.  I suffer dry patches and this completely got rid of them.</li>
            <li> This product with the collagen infusion works miracles on wrinkles.  It also makes your face glow and feels just like velvet.</li>
            <li> Since using Murad serum in combination with the night cream, my face has never looked better.  I get compliments all the time that my face looks very fresh and beautiful.  I don&#x27;t even wear any foundation!  Since becoming a user of this product, I will never change to any thing else.  In fact, I am looking forward to ordering some of their other products at this point.  The price on Amazon is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> I love the whole resurgence line. The serum is great I feel like it is actually evening out my skin after only a few weeks. It burned the first time I used it but hasn&#x27;t since so give it a chance.</li>
            <li> This serum is absolutely the worst. I don&#x27;t know if I bought a knock out, but I have never experienced something so bad from a prestigeous brand. It stung my skin, then the serum started to peel off after it dried out on my skin. I have decided to use it on my body, so I don&#x27;t totally feel like I wasted my money, but it stung there too. The interesting thing is though when I tried it at Sephora it had completely different smell and feel to it than when I received mine from this seller. Also, it didn&#x27;t come in a box, rather than sealed in a plastic wrap. The price of it was also almost 50% lower than everywhere else, so I can&#x27;t say for sure if the dr. Murad came out with something not worth a penny, or I just purchased a fake product.</li>
            <li> Murad is one of my favorite skin care lines. This is a great product and works well with the Murad Resurgence Moisturizer!so happy to find on Amazon!</li>
            <li> It is my favorite serum, but it is pricey. It does work and smells great. Treat yourself, you will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Noticeable results in a few days and see continuous improvement over time.  A little goes a long way!  Great price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I tried the Murad Acne Complex system and it was HORRIBLE! I did exactly as the directions stated and it did absolutely nothing for my skin. I have mild acne that is prone to hormonal changes (gets worse during that time of the month). I have tried everything over the counter and heard that Murad was a good Acne product. So I gave the three step system a go. I followed through with the regimen for TWO MONTHS and it NEVER cleared my skin. The \\&quot;purging\\&quot; stage made my skin break out something terrible and I was getting acne in places I had never gotten it before! It was insane! I would literally wake up and have more acne! I kept telling myself to be patient and give it more time but enough was enough, I kid you not, the day after I stopped using it my skin instantly felt better and I have now been off it for a week and my skin has practically cleared up! I swear it&#x27;s like the Murad CAUSED me to break out. Thankfully the company honors a 60 day money back guarantee so I was refunded. Do yourself a favor and DON&#x27;T TRY THIS AWFUL PRODUCT! Seriously, the best way to get clear skin in my opinion is going to see a dermatologist who can decide a personalized method according to your skin, eating healthy, drinking water, and working out.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that truly moisturizes and changes the appearance of the skin. I had stripped my skin with a laser and acid peels. The Murad Resurgence system has revitalized and renewed it. I am in awe, because I have spent a ton of money on skin creams and serums in the last 6 mo. and these products are the only ones which noticibly work. I can put the moisturizer on and it lasts all day, but I am not left feeling greasy. It soaks in and remains. LOVE YOU, Dr. Murad. A real skin changer!</li>
            <li> What a great price!!  And great shipping time!  I will buy this again and again since I use it daily.</li>
            <li> I order this every few months, as I use it morning and night on my oily, sensitive, post-menopausal skin; and it is helping combat the signs of aging. It always arrives right on schedule.</li>
            <li> Been using this product every eve on only one side of my face to see if there really would be difference. I&#x27;m extremely sad to report that on my skin (I have olive complexion) I am actually seeing fine wrinkle lines along my cheek area. Did not have this before and don&#x27;t have this on the opposite side.  I&#x27;ll continue, just in case this is temporary.  I&#x27;ll keep you posted.[[ASIN:B000GDF48Y Murad Resurgence Age-Diffusing Serum, 2: Treat/Repair, 1.0 fl oz (30 ml)]]</li>
            <li> Its been weeks and I can already see a difference!!</li>
            <li> This winter was rough on my skin and this product help keep moisture and dryness way down!  Love the product!</li>
            <li> Great skincare product.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Murad Resurgence Age Diffusing Serum 2 from Sephora.  I tried the trial size.  It was wonderful!  I have tried many skin products, but I have never found a product that produces such great results as this one does.  I do not have to wear foundation anymore.  I bought the regular size next.  Ouch, it was expensive.  Amazon offers the same product at a much lower price.  I kept my boxes from Sephora&#x27;s.  They are the same as the boxes from the Amazon purchase including the seal.  The product is the same, also.  I suggest trying the trial size first to see if the Serum works on your skin, too.  As a helpful hint, look at the bottom of the box.  There is a year date on it.  The one from Sephora was a year older than the one from I bought on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Great Price. Shipped fast</li>
            <li> Been suing this product for years and switched to Murad with Lange went out of business.  Tried others that were cheaper, but came back to this and will not switch again.  Use other face products they offer as well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite serum. Loves the way it goes on your skin and the way it makes your skin feel.</li>
            <li> These products in the Murad line are some of the best I have ever used in my life.  My skin just takes to it.  Definitely lives up to its advertising.  And as far as the seller - it&#x27;s always is packaged well and delivered on time.  Love it, love it, love it.  (And they are not paying me to say this!)</li>
            <li> I really use this product and it meets all my expectations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to run out of this product. I use it before my day cream or night cream.  It make my face a bit firmer.</li>
            <li> I try everything.  I could probably paid for a face lift by now.  I have used this brand in the past and continue to use it although I cant honestly say I notice a difference.  I keep telling myself that I am holding back further facial damage by continuing to use and that I do believe.  Should have started earlier.</li>
            <li> The Murad Resurgence Age-Diffusing Serum is just what it says...it is the best product that I&#x27;ve ever used, and believe you me, I hae tried a lot from very expensive to store brands. If you don&#x27;t try it, you will never know what you are missing.</li>
            <li> I have used Murad for 1 1/2 years and Love this serum, makes my skin smooth with no heavy fragance. I was happy to find this on Amazon for the price and happier yet when it came, fast &amp; fresh..I was concerned it might be &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;, but it was just the same as what I ordered when member of the &amp;#34;muradclub&amp;#34;.. Will order from here again.</li>
            <li> I love Murad. I started using it three months ago. My skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I use the entire line of Murad products and this Age Diffusing Serum works very well. My skin is soft, tight and well moisturized. If purchased in fine beauty stores, it costs considerably more. Very pleased with the product and will always be a Murad user.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 5 years now and always get compliments on my skin. Was out for about 6 months, could see the difference. Ordered this about a month ago and since then my skin has been breaking out like crazy. Not sure if I was given a bad batch(which has not happened before) but there&#x27;s something wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this serum adds anything significant - I started using it at the same time I switched to the whole Resurgence line.  My 60ish skin has never looked better (well, at least in the last 10 years!).</li>
            <li> Glad to be able to get this product at a reasonable price. It arrived intact and at a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 3 months and it has truly made a difference. My skin is simply better ; wrinkles are not as noticable and pores are refined, plus it just somehow makes your skin look and feel --- uh.... well .... YOUNGER I can not think of a better description.</li>
            <li> I did not see any results</li>
            <li> Used this product for over five years now, and I still love it !!!</li>
            <li> Great deal and fast s/h</li>
            <li> Always have this. Started using a couple years ago and it really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> This really does work!  You see a difference right away.  My daughter saw it on TV and suggested it.  I am in my late 50&#x27;s and haven&#x27;t found anything I like as well as this.  I would recommend this for women from their mid 30&#x27;s and up!!</li>
            <li> i use this serum before applying my tinted moisturizer and it blends in softly and thin, yet you can really feel it working</li>
            <li> I have used Murad one and off for several years now. I am about to turn 58 years old and this serum helps hide that little fact nicely. It tones....it tightens....shrinks pores.....does it all. I&#x27;m just resigned to the fact that it will be Mama&#x27;s little helper for the rest of her days  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;shipping was fast.....product was packaged nicely.....no complaints at all. Would order again and again</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is the real thing. Came without any packing and no silver sticker on the bottle. Regrets...</li>
            <li> I tried this serum as part of the Murad Resurgence trial kit and woke up the next day with small red patches all over my face, dry skin and sun spots much darker than usual. That might be a reaction to the glycolic acid. Hard to tell, as there are no ingredient listings in the trial kit...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t work for me. Good luck to you!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my skin feel great!  I use it day and night.  It&#x27;s my favorite Murad product!  AND I think it makes my skin look younger.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now, and the results are just incredible, it has taken at least 2 or more years of age off my 50 year old face.  I think the most amazing thing was when I couldn&#x27;t afford to purchase more I tried another product,  within a few days I knew that I had to figure out how to get back this products. Thanks to Amazon I am now using the product I know works for me.</li>
            <li> Love Murad products..switched from Mary Kay three Yeats ago. Somewhat pricey but a little goes a long way. I apply this on my face sparingly before a apply moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been using the same serum from Lancome for a few years, and just wanted something different and new.  An informercial caught my eye, so I looked for the items on Amazon ( I love Amazon) and ordered it to try it out.  I&#x27;m very pleased, and I know I will reorder.</li>
            <li> As I stated about Murad product. After three to four weeks, I stop counting. If there was a little progress. I&#x27;m just 63 and most people say I look great foe my age. However, after I apply this product around the mouth area, it appears to be more wrinkles. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference and its been a month of using it.  Back to cheaper serums.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite finds! Lasts about 6 months so really great value. Great results!!</li>
            <li> was good enough, refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like this product. It is no miracle in a bottle, but it&#x27;s good for my skin.  It is a little pricier than some of the stuff I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;tried. This is my third bottle.  I would totally recommend that anyone try it.</li>
            <li> Skin never felt so good!  It feels very smooth and soft.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and will continue to buy it.</li>
            <li> This product is OK but not worth the money.  Beware, when you order the sample kit&lt;br /&gt;they will set you up automatically for reorders and not notify you. When you send it&lt;br /&gt;back they will not reverse the postage of $8 which is not fair.  You didn&#x27;t order the&lt;br /&gt;second shipment. Don&#x27;t waste your time.</li>
            <li> I have just started using Murad product.  I was about a month into the regimen, when I decided to try the serum.  I must say, there is a noticeable difference. I&#x27;m 63 and don&#x27;t notice moisture as much as firming.  This stuff takes a few years off when used with the other Murad products.</li>
            <li> I have used the serum for about 2 weeks. Not sure I have seen any visible difference to date. However, it does feel good on my skin</li>
            <li> Murad Resurgence Age-Diffusing Serum, is the real deal.  It works great.. I have been using it for some time, but the fact that I can get it for almost half-price of what I would have to pay in the store, is awesome...  I highly recommend all the Murad products for both young and old... (better to start young, taking care of your skin)and better not to have to pay to much to do it.  :)</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was as described.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else here, I&#x27;ve been using quality products on my face for a long time.  It wasn&#x27;t until I had to return several over the past year that the caution flags went up.  I read the review Beware of Counterfeits posted 11-7-2012 and started thinking about how we might be spending our hard-earned money on nothing more than expensive fake useless products.  That  writer described the hologram Murad seals it&#x27;s boxes with.  Recently I&#x27;ve purchased, thru Amazon:  Murad Resurgence Renewing Eye Cream from seller Payless  -  Murad Resurgence Age-Balancing Night Cream and Hydro-Dynamic Ultimate Moisture and Murad Resurgence Age-Diffusing Firming Mask all from seller SkinWest.  The 3 SkinWest products have the Murad authentic hologram seal  -  the Payless product did not.  I&#x27;ve been using the Eye Cream from Payless since December 2012 and from the beginning I questioned/wondered why,  with each small pump of the eye cream,  the initial portion of the eye cream pumped out came out in a congealed form?  I like all Murad products very much.  I respect how the company is attempting to improve our skin thru proper products.  I do not like the fact that I may be spending $50. + for a product that might, in fact, be a total complete useless fake.  None of us wish to be throwing our money away.  Besides by using a fake product on our face we are possibly  damaging the very skin we&#x27;re trying to take care of!  Or, at the very least, doing nothing whatsoever, while, all the while,  thinking we&#x27;re doing and spending for benefits.  I consider the Murad hologram sealed box of great value - however, with counterfeiters rampant, the bottom of the Murad box is unsealed and, therefore, unprotected from frauders slipping in a counterfeit product.  I, of course, love the idea of paying less for Murad - but am I really paying less.  The jury is out.  And, it&#x27;s definitely a \\&quot;consumer beware\\&quot; area.</li>
            <li> My sister liked this product a lot and recommended to me.  She is now on the 2nd bottle and I started my first one less than a month ago.  I am not sure how good or better it is compared to the Murad Intensive Wrinkle Reducer.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. It is a must. Helps with blemishes, fine lines, and for me, filling in a childhood scar I have. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Unable to give highest rating as yet because I have not been using this&lt;br /&gt;long enough to tell what if anything will happen with it; however, I put&lt;br /&gt;some on and was chagrined to realize that I am still seventy.</li>
            <li> I love all things with the Murad name. I can tell when i run out, my face feels and shows it. Thanks for the fast service too.</li>
            <li> It is helping lighten some of my sun damage and my skin looks better. I&#x27;ve tried other products but always come back to Murad.</li>
            <li> This is a marvelous product and I was thrilled to see it on amazon for about 30% off, now for the bad news....&lt;br /&gt;The item that I received was counterfeit, so be forewarned- if something seems too good to be true, usually it is.&lt;br /&gt;It just looked \\&quot;off\\&quot;- the package was not exactly the same as the ones that I had purchased from Sephora, so I called Murad, it turns out that&lt;br /&gt;none of the items that I bought are authentic.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased not one, but 3 resurgence items and although I was able to return them I paid a 15% restocking fee- almost $25!&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned. Disappointed that amazon is becoming as risky as ebay.</li>
            <li> Started using this about 6 months ago and it works! Can&#x27;t do without it! And, these are the best prices around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely a fan of this stuff!  I use it every morning and have definitely noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I really like this serum. It makes my skin feel nice. It doesn&#x27;t work miracles or anything. Glad I found it for a good price. Will probably try to find something a bit less expensive that does just as good when I run out. I bought it because it was recommended to me when I got a facial. Great product but I think I can find something just as good.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin so I bought the promo offer first - very easy to follow the regimen, simple.  I keep the cleanser in my shower, it&#x27;s really light with a pleasant scent. I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m using less of the products each day as my skin continues to improve.  Really happy to discover these thoughtful products. Would certainly recommend to anyone still searching for the right skincare line.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time</li>
            <li> This product I have been using for 4 months, and it keeps on working, not like others I have brought, and stop after a short period, very HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> really like it. not too greasy, but gives my face the hydration it needs and wrinkles appear less.</li>
            <li> Helps reduce the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> EXCELLANT PRODUCT.  WORTH BUYING, PRICED WELL ON AMAZON.&lt;br /&gt;MURAD HAS SOME OF THE BEST SKIN CARE PRODUCTS I HAVE EVER USED.&lt;br /&gt;THEY ARE ALSO WELL TRUSTED, THE PRODUCTS WERE DEVELOPED BY A&lt;br /&gt;DERMATOLOGIST, SO YOU KNOW THEY ARE GOOD.  -I HIGHLY RECOMMEND&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT, AND AMAZON MAKES IT AVAILABLE AT A GOOD PRICE!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product that I will continue to apply.  It does improve my skin, a lady in my 60&#x27;s with the usual skin problems.  The Murad Serum is very different from all the similar products I&#x27;ve tried in the past, it works!</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50&#x27;s with very dry skin. This did nothing for me other than to dry my skin out even more. Will not be using it again!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using this line for at least a year or two now and I have seen results.</li>
            <li> Love this product, It really makes your skin soft and glowing but it only takes a few drops if you use to much it will make your face sticky..</li>
            <li> I tried so many creams nothing really worked....but Murad products are amazing I have the whole series and it took years out of my face within a short period of time.</li>
            <li> I saw an old review of mine on this product and I liked it so much I bought it again. For some reason it didn&#x27;t seem to do all that much this time around. Maybe because I am going through that time of life when the hormones are really kicking my butt. And my skin, my inner thermostat, my mood, etc.  I may try it in another five years but for now, I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference in my skin. And it is pricey.</li>
