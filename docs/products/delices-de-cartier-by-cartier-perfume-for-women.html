            <li> I would also buy the body cream to make the fragrance last longer. Love  the fragrance.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and can&#x27;t find it at a department store near me. Cartier Delices is a great fragrance, and the 3.4 oz bottle will last a really long time.  The price was well worth it!</li>
