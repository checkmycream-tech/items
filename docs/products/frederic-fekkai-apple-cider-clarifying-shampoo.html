    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I smelt wonderful and cleaned the residue from the week out of my hair as stated.  </li>
            <li>So, I purchased it and have to say it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li>wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>One of the best scented shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Excellent service.</li>
            <li>The scent of this shampoo is delicious!  </li>
            <li>The results have been very good</li>
            <li>I also tried the Brilliant Glossing Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product - clears the build up and smells great.</li>
            <li>But this shampoo is brilliant.</li>
            <li>This clarifying shampoo smells so good!  </li>
            <li>Smells great tho</li>
            <li>Its great.</li>
            <li>I washed off the conditioner and put on the Beverly Hills Masque which is great stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair feels just great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 times with great results, but I feel like it is just on the edge of stripping my hair.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li>Federic Fekkai Apple Cider Shampoo is a great cleansing shampoo.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The scent is also great.</li>
            <li>and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair feels lighter, cleaner, and smells great.</li>
            <li>And smells great.</li>
            <li>GREAT SHAMPOO, LOVE THE AROMA !!</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, the apple scent of this shampoo is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>what I can say is that my hair gets very clean and the apple scent is absoluelty wonderful.</li>
            <li>but I feel like this shampoo was not that good.</li>
            <li>It also seemed to do good things for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it works as good as it smells.</li>
            <li>Yet, in using it, I can certify that there is perceived quality and good results.</li>
            <li>It is a clarifying shampoo, smells good, works well.</li>
            <li>it don&#x27;t wrap up in a good way and leak every where in the box ,almost ruin everything in the box</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite that, I can&#x27;t in good faith recommend this shampoo because its performance isn&#x27;t so exceptional as to justify the $17 a bottle price tag.</li>
            <li>Oh and it smells great also :)&lt;</li>
            <li>I am so in love with the scent of this shampoo!</li>
            <li>This product by Fekkai was a nice alternative and stripped by hair of just about everything.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, though.</li>
            <li>Nice lather, rinses easily, pleasant (but not overly strong)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the Full Blown Conditioner and found it to be a great combination for the summer.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to be used to clean your hair shafts of build up, and I guarantee you will not smell of vinegar when finished!!.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, smells good -- not overpowering or overly perfumey) and rinses cleanly away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this and my hair was so soft and felt wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Good product, leave my hair so clean.</li>
            <li>It does a good job getting my hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice lather, it smells nice and gets hair clean.</li>
            <li>This product smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean but not overly clean.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell of this shampoo - very crisp and refreshing like a Granny Smith Apple.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase it again and through Amazon great price!</li>
            <li>and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>My favorite product I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li>Love the scent.  </li>
            <li>it lathers up great and rinsed out very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, every beauty product you use leaves some sort of residue on your face or skin, and some products leave more residue than others.</li>
            <li>When used once in a while, has a way of thoroughly cleaning all sorts of residue and buildup from your hair that can rob you of the shine and healthy looking hair you deserve.</li>
            <li>love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I wanted to love this shampoo</li>
            <li>Love the way it works and smells</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably better for your hair</li>
            <li>Use of these conditioners may help you to achieve greater fullness and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lasting impression: great for cleaning hair, occasional use, and make sure to have a good conditioner for the ends.</li>
            <li>I just love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I seriously love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The scent is fruity, mostly apple.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair clean and shiny, I will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li>It smells synthetic yet refined, more sophisticated than the apple scents you find in cheap drugstore shampoos like Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li>First is fragrance; the Fekkai shampoo has a light and pleasant fruit scent, while the Neutrogena shampoo has an almost medicinal smell.</li>
            <li>It clean my hair well, and soft ( I used with Brilliant glossing conditioner )</li>
            <li>The smell is mild and very nice, clean, and simple--of fresh apples.  </li>
            <li>It smells good and does make my hair feel smoother and more natural after use.</li>
            <li>My wife loved the clean, fresh scent of this product and the clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li>short, get the beautiful hair you&#x27;ve always wanted with Fekkai&#x27;s hair care products.</li>
            <li>I love the apple scent; it is fresh and clean smelling!</li>
            <li>This is a really fine, clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have used this shampoo in the past and loved it and was happy to find it again.</li>
            <li>Super shine and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot!</li>
            <li>Nice squeaky clean and clean fragrance, fresh.</li>
            <li>light apple scent shampoo.  </li>
            <li>Then, I rinse it all out, use sodium lauryl sulfate FREE shampoo were</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fekkai makes several great shampoos and I recommend this one if you don&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I’ve been really happy with the results I received or I wouldn’t have gotten a second bottle.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product for its purpose.</li>
            <li>I also thought that it provided a nice gentle cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shampoo is great but the bottle was open when I received it and a quarter of the shampoo had spelt out into the box .</li>
            <li>They suggest using this on the weekend, to free your hair of all of the weekly chemicals.  </li>
            <li>Fekkai Apple Cider shampoo did a fine job of leaving my hair clean and comb-able without the need for conditioner.</li>
            <li>In that case, follow use of this shampoo with one of Fekkai&#x27;s specially formulated conditioners, either the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Conditioner or the Fekkai Full Blown Volume Conditioner which is perhaps better suited to hair that may be too fine and tend towards being too limp.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically, the occasional use of a rinsing shampoo will wash out styling product buildup so you can get better results out of your existing favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li>you got when you first found your favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use a ton of products on my hair because my hair is very fine and very oily.</li>
            <li>I use this to clean my hair from the hair spray and styling products periodically.  </li>
            <li>While that product is great for removing buildup, there are a few reasons why Fekkai Apple Cider might be better, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>hair and scalp feel clean, but I still use a conditioner after</li>
            <li>I also feel that it doesn&#x27;t clean out the oiliness in my hair as well as before.  </li>
            <li>This takes a lot out of your hair and makes it almost &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, not oily, just clean and shiny hair.</li>
            <li>I can now go a couple of days without washing my hair (hair shouldn&#x27;t be washed every day, anyway) and it retains its bounce and clean look and feel.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a invigorating shampoo with Apple Cider benefits to the scalp and hair but felt like I got a soapy, ultra clean, hi lathered product.</li>
            <li>I use it once a week to clean all the product off my color</li>
            <li>It washes your hair clean, so it removes all of the product you have used throughout the week.  </li>
            <li>My scalp felt clean and didn&#x27;t have any itchy build up.  </li>
            <li>this stuff gives you a clean slate.</li>
            <li>I definitely don&#x27;t use this every day because my hair is best with a certain amount of the coating built up on it from the glossing shampoo and conditioner, but once a week or two if it builds up too much or if I used a lot of hair spray etc.</li>
            <li>Really cleans the scalp and my hair is fuller and works better with the blow dryer, too.</li>
            <li>Imagine sweet apples and pears....</li>
            <li>As someone who regularly swims, I needed a good shampoo that could &amp;#34;clarify&amp;#34; my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li>and I use this clarifying shampoo at the end of the week, making sure to really condition after using it.  </li>
            <li>Where as with my hair, I&#x27;ve learned it really needs the &#x27;oil&#x27; in the conditioner and serums to help manage the frizz a bit better.  </li>
            <li>a soft rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;Great for your hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t look fried from too much drying, and I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the smell of this shampoo and my teenage daughters love how it makes their hair feel.</li>
            <li>While the shampoo does clean perfectly well, the price tag is more selling artificial status than clean hair.</li>
            <li>, I use the Fekkai boost shampoo, but on the weekends I like a nice deep cleaning to get a really clean. ....</li>
            <li>My hair felt super clean after the first use.</li>
            <li>The product smells super yummy and fresh and it&#x27;s concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really smell exactly like apple cider, but more like a floral apple scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Fekkai shampoos and conditioners for years, and this is one of my favorite products the company offers.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li>I will continue using it, as the shine of the naked hair follicle is nice -</li>
            <li>I have brown, very fine and thinning hair that has a mind of its own and usually needs to be washed every day.  </li>
            <li>Love this clarifying shampoo, I have hard water and this gets all the build up out and makes me love my hair!  </li>
            <li>Because of this, the products build up in my hair, weighing it down, and causing my hair to not look as good as it could.</li>
            <li>It does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works very well!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you have oily hair or use too many hair products,  and are looking for a DEEP cleaning.</li>
            <li>So I will use it on the weekend or when I know I will not be able to wash my hair next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>For that purpose, many people believe that Neutrogena&#x27;s Anti-Residue Formula shampoo is the gold standard.</li>
            <li>That shampoo you fell in love with, that seemed to not work so well over time, can suddenly work wonders again.</li>
            <li>Apple cider vinegar is famous as rinse agent, which you can actually use yourself instead of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this again for the first time in two years.  </li>
            <li>I use this shampoo for my first wash and afterwards I follow up with a  Fekkai shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>great for thick hair that build up wax</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny how the more \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; chemicals the society produces to help us clean our hair, the worse our hair becomes, and then requires more products to repair the damage.</li>
            <li>This is a clarifying shampoo, ie the kind you use once a week in order to strip off residue which other shampoos may not get.  </li>
            <li>There are other high quality brands available for a much better price.</li>
            <li>With this product you definitely feel the clean !</li>
            <li>It lathered nicely and cleaned my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly a judgement call, since the Neutrogena shampoo is stronger at removing buildup and cheaper.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other Fekkai shampoos but this works best on my find long blonde hair.</li>
            <li>Normally clarifying shampoos leave your hair clean but brittle, this one leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Works really well with my old,dry hair.</li>
            <li>but you have to really wash your hair in order to remove the smell.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo in comparison does not smell at all,  but cleans it too much.</li>
            <li>I read about this brand of shampoo in a magazine article which gave it a very favorable review.</li>
            <li>Once my hair is damp, I take argan oil and really rub it into my scalp and surrounding hair to restore the oils lost from the apple cider shampoo.</li>
            <li>Unless you swim a lot, you won&#x27;t need this product very often.</li>
            <li>you can use this apple cider vinegar containing shampoo with no need for an additional shampooing step afterwards like you would from using straight vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too intense a perfume</li>
            <li>and I really thought I would.  </li>
            <li>It really does strip off all the styling lotions and what not you use on your hair that build up over time.  </li>
            <li>The bottle recommends using once a week, but I think that may be too much for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This cleans really well without stripping hair.</li>
            <li>I expected a better product from Fekkai.</li>
            <li>It seems gentle</li>
            <li>Let’s you fall in love with that other brand, whatever it is, all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though it is recommended to use once a week, I feel using it every other week is better.  </li>
            <li>, I use cheap conditioner on the hair beneath the scalp and really slather it on to protect it from the shampoo as it will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li>the price is a bit high for shampoo, but in its defense, I have tried the Fredrick Fekkai Color Technician Glaze Color Protector and it did help keep my dyed hair from fading out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise you will end up with clean but dry hair.</li>
            <li>You can smell the apple and pear and even though I normally don&#x27;t care for fruit-scented shampoos, this one is delectable.</li>
            <li>This definitely removes *EVERYTHING* from your hair, for a fresh start.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair daily and this shampoo makes my hair so clean (not dry!)</li>
            <li>While the Neutrogena shampoo is better at removing buildup, it also leaves hair feeling dried out, while the Fekkai shampoo leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I have hair that is wavy and tends toward the frizzy, and I&#x27;ve found that once I&#x27;ve used this my hair is a bit more frizzy - likely because it&#x27;s been stripped back to the naked follicle.  </li>
            <li>On the other hand, for those with oily hair like mine, this is safe to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I use it every other day or so and have noticed a significant improvement in the feel and appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo, which I&#x27;ve used about 5 times now, has left my hair pretty frizzy and flyaway each time.  </li>
            <li>Excellent product to clean hair of residue from spray, city grim, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have found that Natural Instincts Clarifying shampoo gave me better results with a bigger bottle for less money.  </li>
            <li>but I am certain I will be purchasing this item for my personal use once this bottle is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a little bit is needed, ( so even though it costs more it will last a pretty long time )</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve washed my hair with the natural apple cider before, it removes the buildup so it gets soft and shiny,  </li>
            <li>This shampoo removes all that and still leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because it was old</li>
            <li>However, I would rather use the Fekkai shampoo twice a week, because I like the fragrance and appreciate that it leaves hair feeling soft (for a buildup removing shampoo,</li>
            <li>one drawback that some people won&#x27;t like is that it contains Sodium Laureth, a chemical that makes the suds, and it might irritate sensitive scalps and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I use it every third washing and that seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it (a week later), I used a much heavier conditioner for my ends and was much happier with the result.</li>
            <li>Apple fragrance is soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, but not oily.</li>
            <li>It is rather difficult to review a shampoo fairly.</li>
            <li>I typically wash my hair every day because of the oil buildup, but was able to go 3 days (with some dry shampoo on day 3) after using the Fekkai.</li>
            <li>I prefer a shampoo that leaves my hair squeaky clean and this one does that without being harsh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Recommended usage is ONCE A WEEK / WEEKEND, so make sure you will get some other (Fekkai) shampoo for the other days.</li>
            <li>Everyone in my family loved it and we have a variety of hair types, ranging from thin, fine and prone to being oily to thick, curly, coarse, and then in between hair as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue using it into the fall but might switch to something a little more moisturizing when the dry winter air moves in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve made sure to wet my hair down before I hit the pool</li>
            <li>I have very long, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I only really put a bit of gel in my hair so I can&#x27;t speak extensively on how well this works as a purifying cleanser style shampoo, but</li>
            <li>but I just really didn&#x27;t get any specific results after using the entire bottle.  </li>
            <li>Gives  my hair a lift and body that no other shampoo does.</li>
            <li>Worth the price because you should only use it once a week, which means it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>There is nothing too different about this product from many other shampoos, other than the strength.  </li>
            <li>This is a clarifying shampoo, so for individuals with normal to dry hair, it should only be used moderately because it tends to be very drying on the hair.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, just an ordinary shampoo.</li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried so many different brands and types of shampoos that have never really impressed me too much, nor have they worked miracles on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, and therefore use a lot of product daily in my hair to keep it from being frizzy and to help it hold the curl.</li>
            <li>that are just as nice, but aren&#x27;t as expensive.</li>
            <li>The Apple Cider Shampoo bottle cautions against using it too frequently but my hair tends to get very oily in the summer and actually seems to benefit from using this shampoo every day or every other day.</li>
            <li>My hair runs a little dry, so you really shouldn&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry your hair out.  </li>
            <li>An oversimplified explanation is that if your product claims to *do* something (make hair shinier, make hair smoother, etc) it is most likely doing that by leaving traces of the product behind on your hair, even after you rinse.</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to lose a little more shampoo than usual to get a good lather, which is disappointing given the price of the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That said, I am not sure I&#x27;d pay the full price for this product as we all agreed that Neutrogena achieves the same affect for far less $$$</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>

            <li> I smelt wonderful and cleaned the residue from the week out of my hair as stated.  </li>
            <li> So, I purchased it and have to say it is an excellent product.</li>
            <li> wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> One of the best scented shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Excellent service.</li>
            <li> The scent of this shampoo is delicious!  </li>
            <li> The results have been very good</li>
            <li> I also tried the Brilliant Glossing Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - clears the build up and smells great.</li>
            <li> But this shampoo is brilliant.</li>
            <li> This clarifying shampoo smells so good!  </li>
            <li> Smells great tho</li>
            <li> Its great.</li>
            <li> I washed off the conditioner and put on the Beverly Hills Masque which is great stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair feels just great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it 3 times with great results, but I feel like it is just on the edge of stripping my hair.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Federic Fekkai Apple Cider Shampoo is a great cleansing shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The scent is also great.</li>
            <li> and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair feels lighter, cleaner, and smells great.</li>
            <li> And smells great.</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAMPOO, LOVE THE AROMA !!</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, the apple scent of this shampoo is very nice.  </li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> what I can say is that my hair gets very clean and the apple scent is absoluelty wonderful.</li>
            <li> but I feel like this shampoo was not that good.</li>
            <li> It also seemed to do good things for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it works as good as it smells.</li>
            <li> Yet, in using it, I can certify that there is perceived quality and good results.</li>
            <li> It is a clarifying shampoo, smells good, works well.</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t wrap up in a good way and leak every where in the box ,almost ruin everything in the box</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite that, I can&#x27;t in good faith recommend this shampoo because its performance isn&#x27;t so exceptional as to justify the $17 a bottle price tag.</li>
            <li> Oh and it smells great also :)&lt;</li>
            <li> I am so in love with the scent of this shampoo!</li>
            <li> This product by Fekkai was a nice alternative and stripped by hair of just about everything.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, though.</li>
            <li> Nice lather, rinses easily, pleasant (but not overly strong)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the Full Blown Conditioner and found it to be a great combination for the summer.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to be used to clean your hair shafts of build up, and I guarantee you will not smell of vinegar when finished!!.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, smells good -- not overpowering or overly perfumey) and rinses cleanly away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this and my hair was so soft and felt wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Good product, leave my hair so clean.</li>
            <li> It does a good job getting my hair squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice lather, it smells nice and gets hair clean.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean but not overly clean.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this shampoo - very crisp and refreshing like a Granny Smith Apple.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase it again and through Amazon great price!</li>
            <li> and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> My favorite product I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  </li>
            <li> it lathers up great and rinsed out very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, every beauty product you use leaves some sort of residue on your face or skin, and some products leave more residue than others.</li>
            <li> When used once in a while, has a way of thoroughly cleaning all sorts of residue and buildup from your hair that can rob you of the shine and healthy looking hair you deserve.</li>
            <li> love the smell of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this shampoo</li>
            <li> Love the way it works and smells</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably better for your hair</li>
            <li> Use of these conditioners may help you to achieve greater fullness and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lasting impression: great for cleaning hair, occasional use, and make sure to have a good conditioner for the ends.</li>
            <li> I just love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent is fruity, mostly apple.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair clean and shiny, I will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> It smells synthetic yet refined, more sophisticated than the apple scents you find in cheap drugstore shampoos like Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> First is fragrance; the Fekkai shampoo has a light and pleasant fruit scent, while the Neutrogena shampoo has an almost medicinal smell.</li>
            <li> It clean my hair well, and soft ( I used with Brilliant glossing conditioner )</li>
            <li> The smell is mild and very nice, clean, and simple--of fresh apples.  </li>
            <li> It smells good and does make my hair feel smoother and more natural after use.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the clean, fresh scent of this product and the clean feeling after using it.</li>
            <li> short, get the beautiful hair you&#x27;ve always wanted with Fekkai&#x27;s hair care products.</li>
            <li> I love the apple scent; it is fresh and clean smelling!</li>
            <li> This is a really fine, clarifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo in the past and loved it and was happy to find it again.</li>
            <li> Super shine and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot!</li>
            <li> Nice squeaky clean and clean fragrance, fresh.</li>
            <li> light apple scent shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Then, I rinse it all out, use sodium lauryl sulfate FREE shampoo were</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fekkai makes several great shampoos and I recommend this one if you don&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ve been really happy with the results I received or I wouldn’t have gotten a second bottle.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product for its purpose.</li>
            <li> I also thought that it provided a nice gentle cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great but the bottle was open when I received it and a quarter of the shampoo had spelt out into the box .</li>
            <li> They suggest using this on the weekend, to free your hair of all of the weekly chemicals.  </li>
            <li> Fekkai Apple Cider shampoo did a fine job of leaving my hair clean and comb-able without the need for conditioner.</li>
            <li> In that case, follow use of this shampoo with one of Fekkai&#x27;s specially formulated conditioners, either the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Conditioner or the Fekkai Full Blown Volume Conditioner which is perhaps better suited to hair that may be too fine and tend towards being too limp.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Basically, the occasional use of a rinsing shampoo will wash out styling product buildup so you can get better results out of your existing favorite shampoo!</li>
            <li> you got when you first found your favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a ton of products on my hair because my hair is very fine and very oily.</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my hair from the hair spray and styling products periodically.  </li>
            <li> While that product is great for removing buildup, there are a few reasons why Fekkai Apple Cider might be better, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> hair and scalp feel clean, but I still use a conditioner after</li>
            <li> I also feel that it doesn&#x27;t clean out the oiliness in my hair as well as before.  </li>
            <li> This takes a lot out of your hair and makes it almost &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, not oily, just clean and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> I can now go a couple of days without washing my hair (hair shouldn&#x27;t be washed every day, anyway) and it retains its bounce and clean look and feel.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a invigorating shampoo with Apple Cider benefits to the scalp and hair but felt like I got a soapy, ultra clean, hi lathered product.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week to clean all the product off my color</li>
            <li> It washes your hair clean, so it removes all of the product you have used throughout the week.  </li>
            <li> My scalp felt clean and didn&#x27;t have any itchy build up.  </li>
            <li> this stuff gives you a clean slate.</li>
            <li> I definitely don&#x27;t use this every day because my hair is best with a certain amount of the coating built up on it from the glossing shampoo and conditioner, but once a week or two if it builds up too much or if I used a lot of hair spray etc.</li>
            <li> Really cleans the scalp and my hair is fuller and works better with the blow dryer, too.</li>
            <li> Imagine sweet apples and pears....</li>
            <li> As someone who regularly swims, I needed a good shampoo that could &amp;#34;clarify&amp;#34; my hair once a week.  </li>
            <li> and I use this clarifying shampoo at the end of the week, making sure to really condition after using it.  </li>
            <li> Where as with my hair, I&#x27;ve learned it really needs the &#x27;oil&#x27; in the conditioner and serums to help manage the frizz a bit better.  </li>
            <li> a soft rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;Great for your hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look fried from too much drying, and I absolutely love the smell.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the smell of this shampoo and my teenage daughters love how it makes their hair feel.</li>
            <li> While the shampoo does clean perfectly well, the price tag is more selling artificial status than clean hair.</li>
            <li> , I use the Fekkai boost shampoo, but on the weekends I like a nice deep cleaning to get a really clean. ....</li>
            <li> My hair felt super clean after the first use.</li>
            <li> The product smells super yummy and fresh and it&#x27;s concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really smell exactly like apple cider, but more like a floral apple scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Fekkai shampoos and conditioners for years, and this is one of my favorite products the company offers.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I will continue using it, as the shine of the naked hair follicle is nice -</li>
            <li> I have brown, very fine and thinning hair that has a mind of its own and usually needs to be washed every day.  </li>
            <li> Love this clarifying shampoo, I have hard water and this gets all the build up out and makes me love my hair!  </li>
            <li> Because of this, the products build up in my hair, weighing it down, and causing my hair to not look as good as it could.</li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well!</li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you have oily hair or use too many hair products,  and are looking for a DEEP cleaning.</li>
            <li> So I will use it on the weekend or when I know I will not be able to wash my hair next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> For that purpose, many people believe that Neutrogena&#x27;s Anti-Residue Formula shampoo is the gold standard.</li>
            <li> That shampoo you fell in love with, that seemed to not work so well over time, can suddenly work wonders again.</li>
            <li> Apple cider vinegar is famous as rinse agent, which you can actually use yourself instead of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this again for the first time in two years.  </li>
            <li> I use this shampoo for my first wash and afterwards I follow up with a  Fekkai shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> great for thick hair that build up wax</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny how the more \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; chemicals the society produces to help us clean our hair, the worse our hair becomes, and then requires more products to repair the damage.</li>
            <li> This is a clarifying shampoo, ie the kind you use once a week in order to strip off residue which other shampoos may not get.  </li>
            <li> There are other high quality brands available for a much better price.</li>
            <li> With this product you definitely feel the clean !</li>
            <li> It lathered nicely and cleaned my hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly a judgement call, since the Neutrogena shampoo is stronger at removing buildup and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other Fekkai shampoos but this works best on my find long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> Normally clarifying shampoos leave your hair clean but brittle, this one leaves your hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Works really well with my old,dry hair.</li>
            <li> but you have to really wash your hair in order to remove the smell.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo in comparison does not smell at all,  but cleans it too much.</li>
            <li> I read about this brand of shampoo in a magazine article which gave it a very favorable review.</li>
            <li> Once my hair is damp, I take argan oil and really rub it into my scalp and surrounding hair to restore the oils lost from the apple cider shampoo.</li>
            <li> Unless you swim a lot, you won&#x27;t need this product very often.</li>
            <li> you can use this apple cider vinegar containing shampoo with no need for an additional shampooing step afterwards like you would from using straight vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too intense a perfume</li>
            <li> and I really thought I would.  </li>
            <li> It really does strip off all the styling lotions and what not you use on your hair that build up over time.  </li>
            <li> The bottle recommends using once a week, but I think that may be too much for my hair.  </li>
            <li> This cleans really well without stripping hair.</li>
            <li> I expected a better product from Fekkai.</li>
            <li> It seems gentle</li>
            <li> Let’s you fall in love with that other brand, whatever it is, all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though it is recommended to use once a week, I feel using it every other week is better.  </li>
            <li> , I use cheap conditioner on the hair beneath the scalp and really slather it on to protect it from the shampoo as it will dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> the price is a bit high for shampoo, but in its defense, I have tried the Fredrick Fekkai Color Technician Glaze Color Protector and it did help keep my dyed hair from fading out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you will end up with clean but dry hair.</li>
            <li> You can smell the apple and pear and even though I normally don&#x27;t care for fruit-scented shampoos, this one is delectable.</li>
            <li> This definitely removes *EVERYTHING* from your hair, for a fresh start.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair daily and this shampoo makes my hair so clean (not dry!)</li>
            <li> While the Neutrogena shampoo is better at removing buildup, it also leaves hair feeling dried out, while the Fekkai shampoo leaves hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have hair that is wavy and tends toward the frizzy, and I&#x27;ve found that once I&#x27;ve used this my hair is a bit more frizzy - likely because it&#x27;s been stripped back to the naked follicle.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, for those with oily hair like mine, this is safe to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I use it every other day or so and have noticed a significant improvement in the feel and appearance of my hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo, which I&#x27;ve used about 5 times now, has left my hair pretty frizzy and flyaway each time.  </li>
            <li> Excellent product to clean hair of residue from spray, city grim, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have found that Natural Instincts Clarifying shampoo gave me better results with a bigger bottle for less money.  </li>
            <li> but I am certain I will be purchasing this item for my personal use once this bottle is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a little bit is needed, ( so even though it costs more it will last a pretty long time )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed my hair with the natural apple cider before, it removes the buildup so it gets soft and shiny,  </li>
            <li> This shampoo removes all that and still leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because it was old</li>
            <li> However, I would rather use the Fekkai shampoo twice a week, because I like the fragrance and appreciate that it leaves hair feeling soft (for a buildup removing shampoo,</li>
            <li> one drawback that some people won&#x27;t like is that it contains Sodium Laureth, a chemical that makes the suds, and it might irritate sensitive scalps and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I use it every third washing and that seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it (a week later), I used a much heavier conditioner for my ends and was much happier with the result.</li>
            <li> Apple fragrance is soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, but not oily.</li>
            <li> It is rather difficult to review a shampoo fairly.</li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every day because of the oil buildup, but was able to go 3 days (with some dry shampoo on day 3) after using the Fekkai.</li>
            <li> I prefer a shampoo that leaves my hair squeaky clean and this one does that without being harsh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recommended usage is ONCE A WEEK / WEEKEND, so make sure you will get some other (Fekkai) shampoo for the other days.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my family loved it and we have a variety of hair types, ranging from thin, fine and prone to being oily to thick, curly, coarse, and then in between hair as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue using it into the fall but might switch to something a little more moisturizing when the dry winter air moves in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made sure to wet my hair down before I hit the pool</li>
            <li> I have very long, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I only really put a bit of gel in my hair so I can&#x27;t speak extensively on how well this works as a purifying cleanser style shampoo, but</li>
            <li> but I just really didn&#x27;t get any specific results after using the entire bottle.  </li>
            <li> Gives  my hair a lift and body that no other shampoo does.</li>
            <li> Worth the price because you should only use it once a week, which means it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> There is nothing too different about this product from many other shampoos, other than the strength.  </li>
            <li> This is a clarifying shampoo, so for individuals with normal to dry hair, it should only be used moderately because it tends to be very drying on the hair.</li>
            <li> Nothing special, just an ordinary shampoo.</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried so many different brands and types of shampoos that have never really impressed me too much, nor have they worked miracles on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and therefore use a lot of product daily in my hair to keep it from being frizzy and to help it hold the curl.</li>
            <li> that are just as nice, but aren&#x27;t as expensive.</li>
            <li> The Apple Cider Shampoo bottle cautions against using it too frequently but my hair tends to get very oily in the summer and actually seems to benefit from using this shampoo every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> My hair runs a little dry, so you really shouldn&#x27;t use it very often.  </li>
            <li> Does not dry your hair out.  </li>
            <li> An oversimplified explanation is that if your product claims to *do* something (make hair shinier, make hair smoother, etc) it is most likely doing that by leaving traces of the product behind on your hair, even after you rinse.</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to lose a little more shampoo than usual to get a good lather, which is disappointing given the price of the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, I am not sure I&#x27;d pay the full price for this product as we all agreed that Neutrogena achieves the same affect for far less $$$</li>
            <li> It still works, but no where near well as Fekkai&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> It definitely left my hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It will go a long way, i.e., last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair so</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fantastic to use once or twice a week to remove buildup from your hair that&#x27;s left behind from heavy conditioners and styling products.</li>

            <li> Since beginning to use it I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my hair, both when I&#x27;ve taken the time to blow dry and style my hair and when letting it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have oily hair, but shampoos that aren&#x27;t moisturizing can make it really dry.</li>

            <li> I do have to say though that you have to be careful with it as well.  </li>
            <li> I think it would be too drying for everyday, but as an occasional clarifier I like to have it in my rotation.</li>
            <li> Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Shampoo, for example, comes in a 25 ounce size for almost half the price of the Fekkai shampoo (and much less if you buy it from your local grocery store instead of Amazon!).</li>
            <li> I am always walking the tight rope between way too oily and too dry.</li>
            <li> I use the Apple Cider Shampoo one to two times a week to remove hair spray and any other product I might have used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying Fekkai&#x27;s Apple Cider Shampoo for over a year, and this isn&#x27;t what any other version felt like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing especially chemical-free about this shampoo either - the ingredients are the usual chemicals.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> light apple scent shampoo.  Does not dry your hair out.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> Works really well with my old,dry hair. In fact its the only shampoo that does work.Gives  my hair a lift and body that no other shampoo does.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this brand but I feel like this shampoo was not that good. I feel that it would dry out my hair too much nd leave it feeling dead. Smells great tho but I didn&#x27;t like it the product</li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised. It clean my hair well, and soft ( I used with Brilliant glossing conditioner ) I used only once a week, for my hair to rest from all the hair product.</li>
            <li> Its great. I would definitely purchase it again and through Amazon great price!</li>
            <li> Nice squeaky clean and clean fragrance, fresh.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works very well! My hair felt super clean after the first use. Feels like it lifted product build-up that my regular shampoo left behind...and it smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> My favorite product I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> I used this and my hair was so soft and felt wonderful.  I used the Shea conditioner with it as a conditioner.  I smelt wonderful and cleaned the residue from the week out of my hair as stated.  Will continue to use every weekend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed my hair with the natural apple cider before, it removes the buildup so it gets soft and shiny,  but you have to really wash your hair in order to remove the smell.  This shampoo in comparison does not smell at all,  but cleans it too much. I would recommend it if you have oily hair or use too many hair products,  and are looking for a DEEP cleaning. Otherwise you will end up with clean but dry hair.</li>
            <li> I read about this brand of shampoo in a magazine article which gave it a very favorable review. So, I purchased it and have to say it is an excellent product. I use the Apple Cider Shampoo one to two times a week to remove hair spray and any other product I might have used. This shampoo removes all that and still leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I also tried the Brilliant Glossing Shampoo. I have brown, very fine and thinning hair that has a mind of its own and usually needs to be washed every day.  With both of these Fekkai shampoos however, I only need to wash my hair every other day, sometimes every two days.  My hair is soft and manageable, easier to style and not as dull as it usually is.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - clears the build up and smells great. Worth the price because you should only use it once a week, which means it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Really cleans the scalp and my hair is fuller and works better with the blow dryer, too. I have long hair so, I use cheap conditioner on the hair beneath the scalp and really slather it on to protect it from the shampoo as it will dry your hair out. Then, I rinse it all out, use sodium lauryl sulfate FREE shampoo were I washed off the conditioner and put on the Beverly Hills Masque which is great stuff. Once my hair is damp, I take argan oil and really rub it into my scalp and surrounding hair to restore the oils lost from the apple cider shampoo.</li>
            <li> Expensive, but really didn&#x27;t do what it advertised.</li>
            <li> Love the scent.  Do not use too often as it may be a little too harsh for regular use.</li>
            <li> Imagine sweet apples and pears.... I am so in love with the scent of this shampoo! It is something I can look forward to in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended usage is ONCE A WEEK / WEEKEND, so make sure you will get some other (Fekkai) shampoo for the other days. I wash my hair daily and this shampoo makes my hair so clean (not dry!) that I could even pull off 2nd day hair as my hair does not feel as greasy as with other shampoos. So I will use it on the weekend or when I know I will not be able to wash my hair next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I use this to clean my hair from the hair spray and styling products periodically.  I recommend this product to be used to clean your hair shafts of build up, and I guarantee you will not smell of vinegar when finished!!.</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAMPOO, LOVE THE AROMA !!</li>
            <li> wonderful product.  My hair feels just great.  Removed all that yucky build up of products.</li>
            <li> Use only once a week, if that. It has a nice lather, it smells nice and gets hair clean. It will go a long way, i.e., last a long time. This is not the watered-down stuff that some drugstores sell. Clarifying shampoo tends to dry out hair. Unless you swim a lot, you won&#x27;t need this product very often.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t what I expect when I ordered it. I&#x27;ve been buying Fekkai&#x27;s Apple Cider Shampoo for over a year, and this isn&#x27;t what any other version felt like. The shampoo is thin, the bottle feels cheap and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as past bottles. I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s because it was old, Fekkai changed the formula, or something else. It still works, but no where near well as Fekkai&#x27;s other products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Fekkai shampoos and conditioners for years, and this is one of my favorite products the company offers. It&#x27;s fantastic to use once or twice a week to remove buildup from your hair that&#x27;s left behind from heavy conditioners and styling products. For that purpose, many people believe that Neutrogena&#x27;s Anti-Residue Formula shampoo is the gold standard. While that product is great for removing buildup, there are a few reasons why Fekkai Apple Cider might be better, depending on what you&#x27;re looking for. First is fragrance; the Fekkai shampoo has a light and pleasant fruit scent, while the Neutrogena shampoo has an almost medicinal smell. While the Neutrogena shampoo is better at removing buildup, it also leaves hair feeling dried out, while the Fekkai shampoo leaves hair feeling soft. It&#x27;s certainly a judgement call, since the Neutrogena shampoo is stronger at removing buildup and cheaper. However, I would rather use the Fekkai shampoo twice a week, because I like the fragrance and appreciate that it leaves hair feeling soft (for a buildup removing shampoo, that is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fekkai makes several great shampoos and I recommend this one if you don&#x27;t mind the price.</li>
            <li> I like the FEKKAI APPLE CIDER SHAMPOO. It lathers nicely, smells good -- not overpowering or overly perfumey) and rinses cleanly away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair and scalp feel clean, but I still use a conditioner after it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one drawback that some people won&#x27;t like is that it contains Sodium Laureth, a chemical that makes the suds, and it might irritate sensitive scalps and skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the price is a bit high for shampoo, but in its defense, I have tried the Fredrick Fekkai Color Technician Glaze Color Protector and it did help keep my dyed hair from fading out.</li>
            <li> I work in a metal shop and I get my hair pretty much filthy daily, I use the Fekkai boost shampoo, but on the weekends I like a nice deep cleaning to get a really clean. ....actually squeaky clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a little bit is needed, ( so even though it costs more it will last a pretty long time ) it lathers up great and rinsed out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Oh and it smells great also :)&lt;br /&gt;*****&lt;br /&gt;Jim</li>
            <li> I only really put a bit of gel in my hair so I can&#x27;t speak extensively on how well this works as a purifying cleanser style shampoo, but what I can say is that my hair gets very clean and the apple scent is absoluelty wonderful. One of the best scented shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This shampoo lathers efficiently. It does contain what&#x27;s listed as apple juice, way down the list behind the usual chemical components of most shampoos. It&#x27;s the scent that got to me. I can only describe it as \\&quot;eau de green apple jolly rancher.\\&quot;  If you like that taste and want to smell it on your head, by all means.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M. Feldman</li>
            <li> Looking for an everyday shampoo? Stop, turn around, do not pass Go, [moves hand slowly across face like Jedi] this is not the shampoo you are looking for. The Fekkai Apple Cider Shampoo is for occasional use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, every beauty product you use leaves some sort of residue on your face or skin, and some products leave more residue than others. An oversimplified explanation is that if your product claims to *do* something (make hair shinier, make hair smoother, etc) it is most likely doing that by leaving traces of the product behind on your hair, even after you rinse. Over time, these traces of product can “build up” to quantities that make them less or even entirely ineffective at getting you the results you desire. That shampoo you fell in love with, that seemed to not work so well over time, can suddenly work wonders again. You probably already know this so let’s skip ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, the occasional use of a rinsing shampoo will wash out styling product buildup so you can get better results out of your existing favorite shampoo! Apple cider vinegar is famous as rinse agent, which you can actually use yourself instead of this shampoo. Seriously, you can get yourself some plain old apple cider vinegar at the grocery store and save yourself some cash. However, if you’re like me and prefer something less messy and less smelly (the Fekkai doesn’t smell like vinegar; it smells like flowers and apples) you can use this apple cider vinegar containing shampoo with no need for an additional shampooing step afterwards like you would from using straight vinegar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How often you use would depend on the type and amount of product(s) you use in your hair. I use some but not an enormous amount of styling products so my use is about once a month. The last bottle I bought lasted me forever! A friend of mine who uses a lot of hairspray uses hers about once a week. Just use it as occasionally as you need to get back to that fantasticfeeling you got when you first found your favorite shampoo. Let’s you fall in love with that other brand, whatever it is, all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ve been really happy with the results I received or I wouldn’t have gotten a second bottle. Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> When used once in a while, has a way of thoroughly cleaning all sorts of residue and buildup from your hair that can rob you of the shine and healthy looking hair you deserve. Nice lather, rinses easily, pleasant (but not overly strong) fragrance and leaves your hair squeaky-clean like nothing else I&#x27;ve tried. Absolutely worth a try.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of products on my hair, so this product may be too cleansing for me. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times with great results, but I feel like it is just on the edge of stripping my hair. It also seemed to do good things for my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the smell of this shampoo. I wish I could use it allllll the time. It&#x27;s not too intense a perfume either.&lt;br /&gt;But I feel like I need to lose a little more shampoo than usual to get a good lather, which is disappointing given the price of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s nothing especially chemical-free about this shampoo either - the ingredients are the usual chemicals.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t like anything else about this shampoo, buy it for the scent! You can smell the apple and pear and even though I normally don&#x27;t care for fruit-scented shampoos, this one is delectable. And it works as good as it smells. Normally clarifying shampoos leave your hair clean but brittle, this one leaves your hair soft and manageable. You could probably use this as a daily shampoo without consequence. I use it every third washing and that seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo with the Full Blown Conditioner and found it to be a great combination for the summer. The Apple Cider Shampoo bottle cautions against using it too frequently but my hair tends to get very oily in the summer and actually seems to benefit from using this shampoo every day or every other day. Since beginning to use it I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on my hair, both when I&#x27;ve taken the time to blow dry and style my hair and when letting it air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s hair is different but for me, in the humid summer of the DC suburbs, this shampoo is definitely a must have and one I&#x27;ll have to remember for next summer. I&#x27;ll continue using it into the fall but might switch to something a little more moisturizing when the dry winter air moves in.</li>
            <li> I wanted to love this shampoo and I really thought I would.  I have been reading all the benefits of apple cider for your body including your hair but I just really didn&#x27;t get any specific results after using the entire bottle.  And it is a smallish bottle.  I have found that Natural Instincts Clarifying shampoo gave me better results with a bigger bottle for less money.  You can always use a traditional conditioner and then rinse with apple cider.</li>
            <li> This is a clarifying shampoo, ie the kind you use once a week in order to strip off residue which other shampoos may not get.  Like all clarifying shampoos it uses harsh surfactants and has a relatively simple formulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the scent, there is really no appreciable difference between this shampoo and Prell which you can get for $3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the apple scent of this shampoo is very nice.  It smells synthetic yet refined, more sophisticated than the apple scents you find in cheap drugstore shampoos like Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> It is rather difficult to review a shampoo fairly. This product seems to deliver what it promises. In that sense is not your every day shampoo but rather, a &amp;#34;weekend purifier to help rid of the week&#x27;s hair stress&amp;#34;. Whether such is a marketing ploy or actual positioning, again, it is difficult to know. Yet, in using it, I can certify that there is perceived quality and good results. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this again for the first time in two years.  Previously I had used it for almost 8 years as my weekly &#x27;detox&#x27; shampoo.  They had changed the design of the bottle.  However, I feel that the fragrance, color of the shampoo liquid changed too...not as apple-y as before.  I also feel that it doesn&#x27;t clean out the oiliness in my hair as well as before.  I don&#x27;t know why the content would change but my hair could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> Love the way it works and smells</li>
            <li> As someone who regularly swims, I needed a good shampoo that could &amp;#34;clarify&amp;#34; my hair once a week.  I&#x27;ve had it done in the salon, but that costs a little extra.  This product by Fekkai was a nice alternative and stripped by hair of just about everything.  I do have to say though that you have to be careful with it as well.  My hair runs a little dry, so you really shouldn&#x27;t use it very often.  This takes a lot out of your hair and makes it almost &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean.  It needs a lot of conditioner when I&#x27;m finished with it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I can tell that I&#x27;m helping to sustain the health of my hair.  I&#x27;ve made sure to wet my hair down before I hit the pool and I use this clarifying shampoo at the end of the week, making sure to really condition after using it.  The results have been very good and I&#x27;m really happy with it. The smell is mild and very nice, clean, and simple--of fresh apples.  There is nothing too different about this product from many other shampoos, other than the strength.  Overall, a great product for its purpose.</li>
            <li> The bottle was leaking when received and a half inch of shampoo had already left the bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny how the more \\&quot;advanced\\&quot; chemicals the society produces to help us clean our hair, the worse our hair becomes, and then requires more products to repair the damage. Just saying...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Fekkai shampoo is recommended by the maker to use as a weekend clarifier for damaged hair. I don&#x27;t know what happens if you use it daily; might be too harsh for daily use? It smells good and does make my hair feel smoother and more natural after use. I also have a conditioner from the same company and that seems to go well with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The bad news is yes it has sls. But I&#x27;ve been using it once a week. I don&#x27;t use a ton of product but I do think it builds up and I like this shampoo. Apple cider vinegar seems like a nuisance tho it&#x27;s probably better for your hair</li>
            <li> I have very long, straight hair. Fekkai Apple Cider shampoo did a fine job of leaving my hair clean and comb-able without the need for conditioner. It also has a light, crisp scent that lasts for a long time without being artificially perfumey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite that, I can&#x27;t in good faith recommend this shampoo because its performance isn&#x27;t so exceptional as to justify the $17 a bottle price tag. There are other high quality brands available for a much better price. Tresemme Renewal Hair and Scalp Shampoo, for example, comes in a 25 ounce size for almost half the price of the Fekkai shampoo (and much less if you buy it from your local grocery store instead of Amazon!). While the shampoo does clean perfectly well, the price tag is more selling artificial status than clean hair.</li>
            <li> This clarifying shampoo smells so good!  It really does strip off all the styling lotions and what not you use on your hair that build up over time.  The bottle recommends using once a week, but I think that may be too much for my hair.  I have hair that is wavy and tends toward the frizzy, and I&#x27;ve found that once I&#x27;ve used this my hair is a bit more frizzy - likely because it&#x27;s been stripped back to the naked follicle.  Where as with my hair, I&#x27;ve learned it really needs the &#x27;oil&#x27; in the conditioner and serums to help manage the frizz a bit better.  I will continue using it, as the shine of the naked hair follicle is nice - but once a week is too often for my hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice. It is a clarifying shampoo, smells good, works well.</li>
            <li> Federic Fekkai Apple Cider Shampoo is a great cleansing shampoo.I use quite a few products on my relaxed color treated hair.After awhile I end up with product build up.This product cleanses my hair thoroughly so nothing is weighing my hair down.I use this shampoo for my first wash and afterwards I follow up with a  Fekkai shampoo and conditioner.I do this once every two months or so.It varies.I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this clarifying shampoo, I have hard water and this gets all the build up out and makes me love my hair!  Not greasy, not oily, just clean and shiny hair.</li>
            <li> This is a really fine, clarifying shampoo. If you have used a lot of hair products like coloring agents, gels, thickeners, etc., periodically, your hair (and no doubt your scalp, too.) will benefit from removing these agents from the individual strands. Get a deep-\\&quot;down to the roots\\&quot; cleansing with this clarifying shampoo. As it removes oils and all greasy product, you may find your hair feeling a bit dryer. In that case, follow use of this shampoo with one of Fekkai&#x27;s specially formulated conditioners, either the Fekkai Brilliant Glossing Conditioner or the Fekkai Full Blown Volume Conditioner which is perhaps better suited to hair that may be too fine and tend towards being too limp.  Use of these conditioners may help you to achieve greater fullness and body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, get the beautiful hair you&#x27;ve always wanted with Fekkai&#x27;s hair care products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use a ton of products on my hair because my hair is very fine and very oily. The fineness of my hair tends to negate effects of product. However, the Apple Cider Shampoo does get rid of the oil. I typically wash my hair every day because of the oil buildup, but was able to go 3 days (with some dry shampoo on day 3) after using the Fekkai. It definitely left my hair feeling dry. The second time I used it (a week later), I used a much heavier conditioner for my ends and was much happier with the result. It is spendy for shampoo but I am certain I will be purchasing this item for my personal use once this bottle is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasting impression: great for cleaning hair, occasional use, and make sure to have a good conditioner for the ends.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. Great product.</li>
            <li> This cleans really well without stripping hair. Everyone in my family loved it and we have a variety of hair types, ranging from thin, fine and prone to being oily to thick, curly, coarse, and then in between hair as well. The product smells super yummy and fresh and it&#x27;s concentrated so you don&#x27;t need a lot. That said, I am not sure I&#x27;d pay the full price for this product as we all agreed that Neutrogena achieves the same affect for far less $$$</li>
            <li> Good product, leave my hair so clean. I have oily hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair that goes from just washed to greasy mess overnight. Over the years, I have tried so many different brands and types of shampoos that have never really impressed me too much, nor have they worked miracles on my hair. It&#x27;s always the same routine. Washing my hair on a daily (and sometimes twice a day) basis because it becomes too oily and dirty-looking to handle. Before coming across this product, I had never given Fekkai products a chance. I&#x27;m all for the more expensive, salon-quality brands, but this brand never really stood out to me until I randomly decided to try this out because of the apple scent. Needless to say, I&#x27;m very impressed. This is a clarifying shampoo, so for individuals with normal to dry hair, it should only be used moderately because it tends to be very drying on the hair. On the other hand, for those with oily hair like mine, this is safe to use on a regular basis. I use it every other day or so and have noticed a significant improvement in the feel and appearance of my hair. I can now go a couple of days without washing my hair (hair shouldn&#x27;t be washed every day, anyway) and it retains its bounce and clean look and feel. The scent is also great. It doesn&#x27;t really smell exactly like apple cider, but more like a floral apple scent. Would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Apple fragrance is soft. I use Ferakki color treatment /with a soft rose scent.&lt;br /&gt;Great for your hair.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the smell of this shampoo and my teenage daughters love how it makes their hair feel.</li>
            <li> Super shine and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot!</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a invigorating shampoo with Apple Cider benefits to the scalp and hair but felt like I got a soapy, ultra clean, hi lathered product.</li>
            <li> I just love this shampoo. It leaves my hair clean and shiny, I will buy again for sure! I&#x27;ve tried other Fekkai shampoos but this works best on my find long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo in the past and loved it and was happy to find it again. I use it once a week to clean all the product off my color treated hair- it doesn&#x27;t hurt the color-- and my hair feels great. My daughter turned me on to this product.</li>
            <li> I seriously love this shampoo. I have oily hair, but shampoos that aren&#x27;t moisturizing can make it really dry. I am always walking the tight rope between way too oily and too dry. But this shampoo is brilliant. My hair is soft, but not oily. It doesn&#x27;t look fried from too much drying, and I absolutely love the smell. I will definitely be buying this shampoo again.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the clean, fresh scent of this product and the clean feeling after using it. I also thought that it provided a nice gentle cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would definably buy it again.</li>
            <li> great for thick hair that build up wax</li>
            <li> Excellent product to clean hair of residue from spray, city grim, etc.  Though it is recommended to use once a week, I feel using it every other week is better.  With this product you definitely feel the clean !</li>
            <li> it don&#x27;t wrap up in a good way and leak every where in the box ,almost ruin everything in the box</li>
            <li> I prefer a shampoo that leaves my hair squeaky clean and this one does that without being harsh. It&#x27;s the only Fekkai shampoo that I would use.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is touted as a clarifying shampoo, and recommends weekly usage to remove build-up.  I have been using this shampoo not every day, but every few days, and it has been working well for me.  The scent is fruity, mostly apple.  Thankfully it does not smell like cider or vinegar.  It does a good job getting my hair squeaky clean.  I think it would be too drying for everyday, but as an occasional clarifier I like to have it in my rotation.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great but the bottle was open when I received it and a quarter of the shampoo had spelt out into the box .</li>
            <li> I expected a better product from Fekkai. Nothing special, just an ordinary shampoo.</li>
            <li> The scent of this shampoo is delicious!  I can even smell it lingering in my hair throughout the day.  It washes your hair clean, so it removes all of the product you have used throughout the week.  They suggest using this on the weekend, to free your hair of all of the weekly chemicals.  It lives up to its promise.  It is expensive, as all Fekkai products are, but if you only use this once every couple days, it will last you awhile.</li>
            <li> This product smells great and leaves my hair feeling clean but not overly clean. It seems gentle but I am hesitant to use it on my color treated hair. I dye my hair a color known for fading and usually use the Fekkai color care shampoo and conditioners. I don&#x27;t see anything warning against use on dyed hair but I wonder.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, and therefore use a lot of product daily in my hair to keep it from being frizzy and to help it hold the curl. Because of this, the products build up in my hair, weighing it down, and causing my hair to not look as good as it could. I have used the Fekkai Apple Cider shampoo for several weeks now (once a week, as recommended on the bottle). After using it, my hair feels lighter, cleaner, and smells great. I love the apple scent; it is fresh and clean smelling! Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo, which I&#x27;ve used about 5 times now, has left my hair pretty frizzy and flyaway each time.  I definitely will not buy it again.  It smells nice, though.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this shampoo - very crisp and refreshing like a Granny Smith Apple.  It lathered nicely and cleaned my hair without weighing it down. My scalp felt clean and didn&#x27;t have any itchy build up.  The reason I am giving this product only four stars is because of the price.  Quite frankly, there are other shampoos out there that are just as nice, but aren&#x27;t as expensive.</li>
            <li> This definitely removes *EVERYTHING* from your hair, for a fresh start. And smells great. I definitely don&#x27;t use this every day because my hair is best with a certain amount of the coating built up on it from the glossing shampoo and conditioner, but once a week or two if it builds up too much or if I used a lot of hair spray etc. this stuff gives you a clean slate.</li>
