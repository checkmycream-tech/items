            <li>/&gt;That is what I call excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Excellently constructed.</li>
            <li>so I went with the walgreens brand and still got the best shave of my life.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome buy.</li>
            <li>I am an experienced shaver!</li>
            <li>He LOVED it!  </li>
            <li>I ordered the shave set for my husband as a Christmas gift and he loved it!</li>
            <li>The razor handle was a perfect length and the brush is good quality.</li>
            <li>This is a great set!&lt;br /&gt;It is beautiful and functional.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that my wife got this for me.</li>
            <li>The item title here says it all, it really is a great gift for a boyfriend, husband, or father.</li>
            <li>This really is a great combo.  </li>
            <li>All three are great quality. ..</li>
            <li>brush feels/looks really great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Stand also feels really great.</li>
            <li>He was pleased with the design and the set up and said it was a great shave!</li>
            <li>I had a good balance and feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Once I have used up all these product I will go to a face scrub, and good shave soap with my brush</li>
            <li>, it is a good starter set</li>
            <li>Reviews said the razor was good (one even said it was a rebranded Merkur), badger brush was good, and the stand was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my husband say is the best gift for him,I&#x27;m so happy thanks</li>
            <li>I do believe this multi-part head adds weight to the top of the razor and greatly improves the balance over the butterfly type razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>amazing</li>
            <li>It came Christmas Eve and was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>Nice finish.  </li>
            <li>I suspect my set was some kind of \\&quot;loss leader\\</li>
            <li>&quot; but what do we have here, some kind of reverse bait-and-switch?  </li>
            <li>I figured for the money this set cost here at Amazon, i could just try it out, and if i liked it</li>
            <li>Nice hefty feel to the razor and brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice not having a field of burning razor bumps on my chin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The whole set looks awesome together</li>
            <li>If the screw had not fallen off of the top of the razor I would have loved to use thisthing</li>
            <li>It feels good in the hand and is easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The razor is very sturdy and has a great feel on my face while shaving.</li>
            <li>The brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the choice.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting much better results than I ever have from the likes of the Fusion or Sensor.</li>
            <li>Most badger hair brushes</li>
            <li>(love the YouTube videos from ShaveNation and others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>also found a &amp;#34;sample pack&amp;#34; of 11 different blades and am working my way through the lot to find which works best for me.  </li>
            <li>This works way better.</li>
            <li>Great shaver and brush really makes you take your time shaving</li>
            <li>I love everything about this gift set.</li>
            <li>&quot; Im glad I did.</li>
            <li>youll be glad you did.</li>
            <li>no adjustment knob like most safety razors do and</li>
            <li>The quality of shave will depend on the brand you buy, but most brands will still give you a better shave than plastic razors.  </li>
            <li>I decided that a double edge safety razor seemed like my best bet.</li>
            <li>Product is great quality and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>If you have a man in your life that is looking for a classic shave this is a great bet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this set; the brush is soft, the safety razor has a nice weight to it and it is well made.</li>
            <li>works with all brands of double-edged blades, and it&#x27;s easy to replace them.  </li>
            <li>He posted a picture online to show it off and many of his guy friends who use safety razors gave great review of this on a personal level.</li>
            <li>You get a very nice shaving soap brush a very very nice razor and last but not least a holder for them both.  </li>
            <li>The stand looks good and works very well, the razor works very well and feels comfortable in my hands, and the badger brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>All in all I am very pleased with the razor and will be purchasing more as gifts over the next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I originally was looking at the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>It is a great inexpensive way to try the wet shaving experience.</li>
            <li>The badger brush is quite soft and makes a nice lather.</li>
            <li>Adequate brush and razor</li>
            <li>I am sure that is normal for a brush.</li>
            <li>It is great quality and the razor is heavy.</li>
            <li>The razor itself has a nice heft with a solid feel.</li>
            <li>So far of the 3 I have tried the flexible seem to work better for my face shape and beard type.  </li>
            <li>and it would have been well worth the $38.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to order as far as blades go.</li>
            <li>Apparently the set I purchased is not sold any more and the price was MUCH less and is a great set for the money.</li>
            <li>This collection is similar to other hyped up sets, the badger hair brush is nice and the razor is just as good as those $90 specialty store sets.  </li>
            <li>I NEVER got a good 1 pass shave (the main reason I kept trying different technologies).  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone new to safety razors or those who are already experienced with them that are looking for a safety razor and brush set that&#x27;s made to last and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, even with my limited experience with wet shaving, I got an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>favorite part of shaving with this type of razor is the cost per shave is a fraction of the price of a razor you get at the grocery store and leaves a much less carbon footprint and is a better shave for me as well.</li>
            <li>I chose the beautiful chrome swirl crafted heavy weight design with the badger brush, de razor and with the stand for just 39.99, things just doesn&#x27;t get any better than that, and if I&#x27;m not mistaken, this model is a MEKUR long handle.</li>
            <li>Through some very courteous email exchanges back and forth, even with me willing to buy a new handle, they sent me a new brush.</li>
            <li>Delivery by seller was very fast.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about not going with a Merkur razor but decided that with 5 star reviews this set must be pretty good for the price.</li>
            <li>the first shave</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll shed the badger hairs upfront and won&#x27;t have as many issues in the future.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a butterfly head and at first was somewhat dismayed at the &amp;#34;remove head to change blade&amp;#34; system.  </li>
            <li>use a hot towel, then lather up with my Edge save gel.  </li>
            <li>The set I purchased does not look like this one but has the central post stand which is much better.</li>
            <li>This will not fall apart any time soon although bristles fell out of the brush (from what Ive been told that will happen first couple of shaves)</li>
            <li>Not only has it paid for itself already, but it&#x27;s also a way better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, after I opened the razor and put in my DE blade, the screw that twists the top part of the razor back on fell off.</li>
            <li>When I received the set, first thing I noticed was the moldy smelling brush.</li>
            <li>In full disclosure, I don&#x27;t need to shave daily as I don&#x27;t grow quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Through my own negligence I dropped the brush (I have the black version with resin handles) and the handle shattered.</li>
            <li>set comes with what seems to be a very high quality kit.</li>
            <li>But the razor felt and looked very high quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m black and maybe if other black men see this and do their own research with the same problem I have, it will greatly change the way how you shave, save money and look forward to a very good shave everyday.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something like a razor (which I use every day), I think it&#x27;s worth it to invest a little more in well known brand names like Merkur.</li>
            <li>The stand is very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li>I know now that de and straight razor shaving cures ingrown, razor bumps and hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li>This stand looks much cheaper and unstable.  </li>
            <li>Product was as described, delivery very prompt.  </li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>If the manufacturer had spent a couple extra cents on not supergluing this screw on, I would have loved this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice item, well made, heavy weight.</li>
            <li>After seeing a ton of items from other retailers ranging in the hundreds of dollars we wanted to find a better alternative.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think that will be necessary as the quality here feels as if it will last many years.</li>
            <li>I was a little intimidated when I first bought It, but now it was really easy to learn.</li>
            <li>The extensive and thorough research that I&#x27;ve done on DE and multi-blade razors really questioned my inability to shave properly and understanding that these so called baby smooth market razors are really just sending your face to the meat grinder.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product a week ago, and was surprised to see it on my doorstep much sooner than the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li>Saw this set reasonably priced and went with it even though could not find much as far as reviews for \\&quot;Boss Razors\\</li>
            <li>first mistake was to take it out of the package and use the razor without exercising the proper caution.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a little bit of weight to it and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>Surprised me how not durable it was.</li>
            <li>We found a cheap brush holder for a few bucks, and have been using that since.  </li>
            <li>If you do decide to get the set just be a little more careful when installing new blades.</li>
            <li>The bristles did have a slight odor but went away after I washed it with a mild shampoo.</li>
            <li>Long Handled Safety Razor]], the [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]], and</li>
            <li>I found the blades very easy to change by unscrewing the head, turning it upside down on the counter, separating the halves, and dropping the blade on the posts, replacing the lower half of the head onto the blade and screwing on the handle with the assembly still sitting on the counter.  </li>
            <li>Let me start off this review by saying I am new to wet shaving as a whole.</li>
            <li>I purchased this set as my first try at wet shaving</li>
            <li>I got this for the first birthday that I spent with my husband.</li>
            <li>38 years old and new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>I have discovered a little better prep, and slowing down was key to a good/safe shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s well worth the money, and even costs less in the long run.</li>
            <li>The brush is well constructed however some bristles came out the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty heavy and feels durable, but I do wish it was longer.</li>
            <li>It is held on by a little bit of superglue and didn&#x27;t take much at all to fall off.</li>
            <li>I wanted to see if it would handle such a tough test as I often don&#x27;t shave after many days and a week is not unusual.</li>

            <li> The set I purchased does not look like this one but has the central post stand which is much better.</li>
            <li> This will not fall apart any time soon although bristles fell out of the brush (from what Ive been told that will happen first couple of shaves)</li>
            <li> Not only has it paid for itself already, but it&#x27;s also a way better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, after I opened the razor and put in my DE blade, the screw that twists the top part of the razor back on fell off.</li>
            <li> When I received the set, first thing I noticed was the moldy smelling brush.</li>
            <li> In full disclosure, I don&#x27;t need to shave daily as I don&#x27;t grow quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Through my own negligence I dropped the brush (I have the black version with resin handles) and the handle shattered.</li>
            <li> set comes with what seems to be a very high quality kit.</li>
            <li> But the razor felt and looked very high quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and maybe if other black men see this and do their own research with the same problem I have, it will greatly change the way how you shave, save money and look forward to a very good shave everyday.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something like a razor (which I use every day), I think it&#x27;s worth it to invest a little more in well known brand names like Merkur.</li>
            <li> The stand is very sturdy as well.</li>
            <li> I know now that de and straight razor shaving cures ingrown, razor bumps and hyper pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stand looks much cheaper and unstable.  </li>
            <li> Product was as described, delivery very prompt.  </li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> If the manufacturer had spent a couple extra cents on not supergluing this screw on, I would have loved this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice item, well made, heavy weight.</li>
            <li> After seeing a ton of items from other retailers ranging in the hundreds of dollars we wanted to find a better alternative.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that will be necessary as the quality here feels as if it will last many years.</li>
            <li> I was a little intimidated when I first bought It, but now it was really easy to learn.</li>
            <li> The extensive and thorough research that I&#x27;ve done on DE and multi-blade razors really questioned my inability to shave properly and understanding that these so called baby smooth market razors are really just sending your face to the meat grinder.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a week ago, and was surprised to see it on my doorstep much sooner than the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Saw this set reasonably priced and went with it even though could not find much as far as reviews for \\&quot;Boss Razors\\</li>
            <li> first mistake was to take it out of the package and use the razor without exercising the proper caution.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a little bit of weight to it and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> Surprised me how not durable it was.</li>
            <li> We found a cheap brush holder for a few bucks, and have been using that since.  </li>
            <li> If you do decide to get the set just be a little more careful when installing new blades.</li>
            <li> The bristles did have a slight odor but went away after I washed it with a mild shampoo.</li>
            <li> Long Handled Safety Razor]], the [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]], and</li>
            <li> I found the blades very easy to change by unscrewing the head, turning it upside down on the counter, separating the halves, and dropping the blade on the posts, replacing the lower half of the head onto the blade and screwing on the handle with the assembly still sitting on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off this review by saying I am new to wet shaving as a whole.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as my first try at wet shaving</li>
            <li> I got this for the first birthday that I spent with my husband.</li>
            <li> 38 years old and new to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> I have discovered a little better prep, and slowing down was key to a good/safe shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s well worth the money, and even costs less in the long run.</li>
            <li> The brush is well constructed however some bristles came out the first few times I used it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty heavy and feels durable, but I do wish it was longer.</li>
            <li> It is held on by a little bit of superglue and didn&#x27;t take much at all to fall off.</li>
            <li> I wanted to see if it would handle such a tough test as I often don&#x27;t shave after many days and a week is not unusual.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only do they make a high quality product for the modest cost, but the company stands behind their product.</li>
            <li> Some blades are very stiff and others are very flexible.  </li>
            <li> It is too large to hold the brush at the end, however, so it is forced to hang where the bristles meet the handle.  </li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for a safety razor set for a long time.  </li>
            <li> He really liked the set, especially how soft the brush was, but he absolutely hated the stand.  </li>
            <li> My first shave was done after a thick growth of a week!</li>
            <li> the brush does loose one or two hairs every time I use it.</li>
            <li> The little u that hold the brush is actually smaller.  </li>
            <li> have wet shaved with twin, triple, and quadruple blades for years.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty solid stand.</li>
            <li> Should get my blade price down to pennies per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I will narrow it down to 1 blade and purchase them by the 100 pack.  </li>
            <li> the only negative is the razor is very heavy</li>
            <li> I do have one or two little issues, the razor gas</li>
            <li> I was not familiar with this type of razor</li>
            <li> I was tired spending $15 to $20 for 5 blades and decided to go back to DE blades.  </li>
            <li> The build of the razor is heavy duty and well made as well as the brush.</li>
            <li> no cheap stuff here.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-a few hairs come out of the brush with each use</li>
            <li> plan on giving these as gifts as most guys I know are sick of the obscene prices of today&#x27;s mediocre multi-blade</li>
            <li> razor isn&#x27;t really that bad quality.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I ordered the proraso pre-shave and shaving cream that I&#x27;m anxiously waiting for.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was seller error or product error????</li>
            <li> : The brush loses tuns of bristle&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> so you can see what I mean.</li>
            <li> unable to shave due to poor design of the head.</li>
            <li> Not a good look, and we were worried it was damaging the brush.  </li>
            <li> you can still get a pretty nasty cut if handled incorrectly.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was tired of paying over $3 apiece for Mach 3 razors.  </li>
            <li> By then, it was too late, and my entire beard area on my face broke out in a nasty rash...</li>
            <li> I picked up this set to help combat the outrageous prices of the current crop of multi-blade razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried DISPOSABLES, ELECTRIC RAZORS and the cartridges that are ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> Forget those expensive cartridges.</li>
            <li> Worst Double Edge Razor I bought to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has seemed to be a expensive gamble if it wasn&#x27;t going to work out until i found this set from the JCG collection.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is difficult mechanically to use....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if maybe I&#x27;m unlucky or there are fake reviews.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-stand is awkward</li>
            <li> It was awkwardly shaped, and the part holding the brush isn&#x27;t shaped as it is in the picture.</li>
            <li> I never got a chance to use it (as I will be packing this set up for return to Amazon after I finish typing this review) but it doesn&#x27;t look bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I do hate wasting money).</li>

            <li> I bought this razor a day or 2 before Christmas expecting it after the holidays. It came Christmas Eve and was a nice surprise. The razor is very sturdy and has a great feel on my face while shaving. The stand is very sturdy as well. The brush is well constructed however some bristles came out the first few times I used it. I am sure that is normal for a brush. The bristles did have a slight odor but went away after I washed it with a mild shampoo. All in all I am very pleased with the razor and will be purchasing more as gifts over the next year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of shaving with this type of razor is the cost per shave is a fraction of the price of a razor you get at the grocery store and leaves a much less carbon footprint and is a better shave for me as well. Everyone should switch to a double edge razor!</li>
            <li> Dropped razor after 1 week and it bent shaft. Surprised me how not durable it was. The brush is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I picked up this set to help combat the outrageous prices of the current crop of multi-blade razors. I&#x27;m glad I made the choice. Right off the bat, even with my limited experience with wet shaving, I got an excellent shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set comes with what seems to be a very high quality kit. The badger brush is quite soft and makes a nice lather. The razor itself has a nice heft with a solid feel. It feels good in the hand and is easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the first shave I&#x27;m getting much better results than I ever have from the likes of the Fusion or Sensor. My first shave was done after a thick growth of a week! I wanted to see if it would handle such a tough test as I often don&#x27;t shave after many days and a week is not unusual. In full disclosure, I don&#x27;t need to shave daily as I don&#x27;t grow quickly. I also have a goatee. That said, this set is such a pleasure to use, I won&#x27;t mind a daily shave! It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on giving these as gifts as most guys I know are sick of the obscene prices of today&#x27;s mediocre multi-blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets 5 stars from me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/5/14 Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through my own negligence I dropped the brush (I have the black version with resin handles) and the handle shattered. I emailed the company and explained my plight. I emailed them pictures of my folly. Through some very courteous email exchanges back and forth, even with me willing to buy a new handle, they sent me a new brush. Gratis!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is what I call excellent customer service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do they make a high quality product for the modest cost, but the company stands behind their product. Above and beyond the call of duty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, if you break in the brush properly from the start you&#x27;ll shed the badger hairs upfront and won&#x27;t have as many issues in the future. Most badger hair brushes will she&#x27;d initially. After. Use they settle in. A vigorous break in helps quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that my wife got this for me. She knows my woes of razor bumps and ingrown hairs. I&#x27;ve tried DISPOSABLES, ELECTRIC RAZORS and the cartridges that are ridiculously expensive. The extensive and thorough research that I&#x27;ve done on DE and multi-blade razors really questioned my inability to shave properly and understanding that these so called baby smooth market razors are really just sending your face to the meat grinder. I know now that de and straight razor shaving cures ingrown, razor bumps and hyper pigmentation. So I threw my chips on the table and got this 3pc razor set. I chose the beautiful chrome swirl crafted heavy weight design with the badger brush, de razor and with the stand for just 39.99, things just doesn&#x27;t get any better than that, and if I&#x27;m not mistaken, this model is a MEKUR long handle. Anyway, I ordered the proraso pre-shave and shaving cream that I&#x27;m anxiously waiting for. I&#x27;m black and maybe if other black men see this and do their own research with the same problem I have, it will greatly change the way how you shave, save money and look forward to a very good shave everyday. Thanks Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a week ago, and was surprised to see it on my doorstep much sooner than the estimated delivery date. I&#x27;m very pleased with this set; the brush is soft, the safety razor has a nice weight to it and it is well made. I recommend this product to anyone new to safety razors or those who are already experienced with them that are looking for a safety razor and brush set that&#x27;s made to last and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> My name is David,  I bought this on my wife account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wet shaved with twin, triple, and quadruple blades for years.  I NEVER got a good 1 pass shave (the main reason I kept trying different technologies).  I was tired spending $15 to $20 for 5 blades and decided to go back to DE blades.  I was expecting a butterfly head and at first was somewhat dismayed at the &amp;#34;remove head to change blade&amp;#34; system.  But the razor felt and looked very high quality.  I had a good balance and feel to it.  I found the blades very easy to change by unscrewing the head, turning it upside down on the counter, separating the halves, and dropping the blade on the posts, replacing the lower half of the head onto the blade and screwing on the handle with the assembly still sitting on the counter.  I do believe this multi-part head adds weight to the top of the razor and greatly improves the balance over the butterfly type razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first mistake was to take it out of the package and use the razor without exercising the proper caution.  The mechanics of a shaving with a DE are a bit different than with multi-blade razors.  I have discovered a little better prep, and slowing down was key to a good/safe shave.  (love the YouTube videos from ShaveNation and others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found a &amp;#34;sample pack&amp;#34; of 11 different blades and am working my way through the lot to find which works best for me.  Some blades are very stiff and others are very flexible.  So far of the 3 I have tried the flexible seem to work better for my face shape and beard type.  Once I find 2 or 3 blades I prefer I will order a 10 pack and check consistency of the product.  Then I will narrow it down to 1 blade and purchase them by the 100 pack.  Should get my blade price down to pennies per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I am working my way back into DE shaving I am using up the product I have at home.  So I prep with Gillette face scrub/shave gel,  use a hot towel, then lather up with my Edge save gel.  Once I have used up all these product I will go to a face scrub, and good shave soap with my brush (I do hate wasting money).</li>
            <li> The set I purchased does not look like this one but has the central post stand which is much better. When I tried to review my set this is the model I kept being diverted to.  This stand looks much cheaper and unstable.  Apparently the set I purchased is not sold any more and the price was MUCH less and is a great set for the money. Heavy duty solid stand. Nice finish.  Adequate brush and razor (although, I am going to upgrade the razor).  I suspect my set was some kind of \\&quot;loss leader\\&quot; but what do we have here, some kind of reverse bait-and-switch?  I&#x27;ll give this one three stars just by the looks of the stand.  I would rate my set five stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been months since I purchased this Product and let me tell you that it works miracles. Forget those expensive cartridges. This works way better. I was a little intimidated when I first bought It, but now it was really easy to learn.</li>
            <li> Great shaver and brush really makes you take your time shaving</li>
            <li> Worst Double Edge Razor I bought to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: The material feels sturdy and quality. Aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The brush loses tuns of bristle&#x27;s. unable to shave due to poor design of the head.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking to switch to the safety razor experience for a while now. It has seemed to be a expensive gamble if it wasn&#x27;t going to work out until i found this set from the JCG collection. You can&#x27;t go wrong here. It is a great inexpensive way to try the wet shaving experience. I figured for the money this set cost here at Amazon, i could just try it out, and if i liked it i could then upgrade to a more expensive set. I don&#x27;t think that will be necessary as the quality here feels as if it will last many years. I love everything about this gift set. The stand looks good and works very well, the razor works very well and feels comfortable in my hands, and the badger brush is amazing. The item title here says it all, it really is a great gift for a boyfriend, husband, or father. I would add for yourself into the title. I highly recommend this set.</li>
            <li> 38 years old and new to wet shaving. Saw this set reasonably priced and went with it even though could not find much as far as reviews for \\&quot;Boss Razors\\&quot; Im glad I did. Nice hefty feel to the razor and brush. Excellently constructed. This will not fall apart any time soon although bristles fell out of the brush (from what Ive been told that will happen first couple of shaves) The set came in the mail before the derby blades I ordered so I went with the walgreens brand and still got the best shave of my life. So for all those unsure about this product I say go for It youll be glad you did. Oh yeah, I also went with the Van der Hagen shave soap.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set as my first try at wet shaving and I was not disappointed. The build of the razor is heavy duty and well made as well as the brush. I do have one or two little issues, the razor gas no adjustment knob like most safety razors do and the brush does loose one or two hairs every time I use it. But don&#x27;t let that deter you from buying this, it is a good starter set and I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This really is a great combo.  You get a very nice shaving soap brush a very very nice razor and last but not least a holder for them both.  All three are great quality. ..no cheap stuff here.  I would recommend to any one.  This is an awesome buy.</li>
            <li> My husband has been looking for a safety razor set for a long time.  After seeing a ton of items from other retailers ranging in the hundreds of dollars we wanted to find a better alternative.  This collection is similar to other hyped up sets, the badger hair brush is nice and the razor is just as good as those $90 specialty store sets.  If you have a man in your life that is looking for a classic shave this is a great bet.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item as a gift and he loves it. It is great quality and the razor is heavy. Delivery by seller was very fast.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I was tired of paying over $3 apiece for Mach 3 razors.  Not only has it paid for itself already, but it&#x27;s also a way better shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works with all brands of double-edged blades, and it&#x27;s easy to replace them.  The quality of shave will depend on the brand you buy, but most brands will still give you a better shave than plastic razors.  It&#x27;s nice not having a field of burning razor bumps on my chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well worth the money, and even costs less in the long run.</li>
            <li> This is a great set!&lt;br /&gt;It is beautiful and functional. A very solid razor and the softest brush I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> my husband say is the best gift for him,I&#x27;m so happy thanks</li>
            <li> Product was as described, delivery very prompt.  the only negative is the razor is very heavy but I don&#x27;t plan to use it - just  wanted the brush and stand anyway.</li>
            <li> The razor itself is difficult mechanically to use....one has to remove the entire head to replace the blade.....not convenient whatsoever.</li>
            <li> Let me start off this review by saying I am new to wet shaving as a whole. After my electric razor ripped up my face last week I decided it was time for a change. Looking at my options (Gillette cartridges, standard razor, etc) I decided that a double edge safety razor seemed like my best bet. I originally was looking at the [[ASIN:B000NL0T1G Merkur Model 180 Long Handled Safety Razor]], the [[ASIN:B003WR3QSG Escali 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush]], and [[ASIN:B001XURHNY Colonel Conk Evernice Model 775 Chrome Safety Razor Stand]]. Then, I saw this set. Looking at the reviews it seemed like this set was the same as the items I was going to buy, just $25 cheaper. I was a little worried about not going with a Merkur razor but decided that with 5 star reviews this set must be pretty good for the price. Reviews said the razor was good (one even said it was a rebranded Merkur), badger brush was good, and the stand was good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The razor isn&#x27;t really that bad quality. It&#x27;s pretty heavy and feels durable, but I do wish it was longer. HOWEVER, after I opened the razor and put in my DE blade, the screw that twists the top part of the razor back on fell off. It is held on by a little bit of superglue and didn&#x27;t take much at all to fall off. Really? If the manufacturer had spent a couple extra cents on not supergluing this screw on, I would have loved this set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Badger brush feels/looks really great. I never got a chance to use it (as I will be packing this set up for return to Amazon after I finish typing this review) but it doesn&#x27;t look bad at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Stand also feels really great. It&#x27;s got a little bit of weight to it and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap. The whole set looks awesome together and I wish I got the chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For something like a razor (which I use every day), I think it&#x27;s worth it to invest a little more in well known brand names like Merkur. If the screw had not fallen off of the top of the razor I would have loved to use thisthing and it would have been well worth the $38. I don&#x27;t know if maybe I&#x27;m unlucky or there are fake reviews. If you do decide to get the set just be a little more careful when installing new blades. I will be returning this set pronto and investing the extra $25 so I can have a well working Merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please look for my PHOTOS of the screw and the razor so you can see what I mean.</li>
            <li> Nice item, well made, heavy weight.</li>
            <li> When I received the set, first thing I noticed was the moldy smelling brush. When lathering I always squeeze brush for the last bit of lather, and a rusty color was mixed in with the lather. By then, it was too late, and my entire beard area on my face broke out in a nasty rash...I am an experienced shaver! Not sure if it was seller error or product error????</li>
            <li> I got this for the first birthday that I spent with my husband. He LOVED it!  He was pleased with the design and the set up and said it was a great shave! He posted a picture online to show it off and many of his guy friends who use safety razors gave great review of this on a personal level. Big winner for a gift!</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-great price&lt;br /&gt;-looks amazing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-a few hairs come out of the brush with each use&lt;br /&gt;-stand is awkward&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my husband as a gift along with Taylor of Bond Street&#x27;s Sandalwood shaving cream.  He really liked the set, especially how soft the brush was, but he absolutely hated the stand.  It was awkwardly shaped, and the part holding the brush isn&#x27;t shaped as it is in the picture. The little u that hold the brush is actually smaller.  It is too large to hold the brush at the end, however, so it is forced to hang where the bristles meet the handle.  Not a good look, and we were worried it was damaging the brush.  We found a cheap brush holder for a few bucks, and have been using that since.  Also the razor doesn&#x27;t seal as well as some others, so even it it&#x27;s &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; mode you can still get a pretty nasty cut if handled incorrectly.</li>
            <li> I ordered the shave set for my husband as a Christmas gift and he loved it! The razor handle was a perfect length and the brush is good quality. The only thing I would do differently is suggest a refill blade along with the description of the razor. I was not familiar with this type of razor and I wasn&#x27;t sure what to order as far as blades go.</li>
            <li> Product is great quality and fast shipping.  Not disappointed at all.</li>
