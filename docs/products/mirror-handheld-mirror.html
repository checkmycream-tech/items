            <li>/&gt;Waste of money, nothing about this product is good.</li>
            <li>Good size and made with good materials.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still fairly good.</li>
            <li>Mirror was packed well &amp; in good shape considering the distance it came to get here.</li>
            <li>As advertised, good product.</li>
            <li>superior value.................</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good handheld mirror.  </li>
            <li>was too good a price to pass, its one of amazons specials.  </li>
            <li>It works good, but is not of the highest quality.  </li>
            <li>What good fortune to get one.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need anything else to help with my morning duties; my hair looks good with the use of this mirror.</li>
            <li>Good quality mirror.</li>
            <li>I thought this would have been a good purchase because I cut my own hair</li>
            <li>Beautiful and easy to grab.  </li>
            <li>Very large for a hand mirror, perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Flexible handle, large surface and just excellent feel.</li>
            <li>My opinion is that the frame and handle should be strengthen and then it would be an excellent large mirror for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link</li>
            <li>Nice product and well made.</li>
            <li>and I liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li>and i still own and use it.</li>
            <li>I am a home barber and I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li>I use it to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li>buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>This is the kind they use in barber shops and beauty parlors.</li>
            <li>Nice size.</li>
            <li>Great price, great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The mirror is a great size, but I can&#x27;t get it clean.  </li>
            <li>It could easily sell for over twice the price in a store and it would still be a good mirror.  </li>
            <li>This mirror fit both bills, and was a good price to boot.</li>
            <li>I cut my own hair and wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it without this mirror.</li>
            <li>Good thing they are cheap and an add-on item.  </li>
            <li>This mirror works for the job that it was designed to do but it is very cheap.</li>
            <li>No distortion and very light weight.</li>
            <li>The plastic is made of very cheap material.</li>
            <li>It is, however, made very cheaply.  </li>
            <li>It is large but lightweight, great to pack travel with,</li>
            <li>It has a nice large mirror area and the quality of the reflection is good.</li>
            <li>Try not to drop it and you will forever be able to see yourself without cracked glass.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d purchased many years ago.</li>
            <li>This mirror is ok.</li>
            <li>then you should make a product review stating this mirror isn&#x27;t any better than a 2 dollar mirror a discount beauty store.</li>
            <li>Cheap!</li>
            <li>But now I ordered a replacement, and the quality seems much better.</li>
            <li>What more can you say about a mirror?</li>
            <li>confirmed by this handy dandy hand mirror.  </li>
            <li>but when I do need it I&#x27;m glad I have it.  </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m currently completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>The glass part feels like it weighs more than the plastic.</li>
            <li>The handle is cheap plastic, and the mirror its self is not magnified nor a good quality, plus the mirrow was so cheap</li>
            <li>probably better to spend more on one better made for safety and quality.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself doesn&#x27;t have any imperfections in it, so I am satisfied with it for my use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mirror, what more do you want?  </li>
            <li>(if I can&#x27;t find anything better)</li>
            <li>It would be much better with a thicker frame.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>A day after ordering this I found a store that sells it for a dollar more.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t count on was not being able to remove the sticker on the front of the mirror.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.</li>
            <li>Fits great in travel bags, very flexible that way.</li>
            <li>and I shattered many of these against the wall.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure I like scales or  my bulging eyes.  </li>
            <li>Mirror is ok but not sturdy...poor design on handle, but it works as well as any mirror could.  </li>
            <li>I prefer something more sturdy.</li>
            <li>I am glad that it is lightweight</li>
            <li>Very large and gives a good viewing angle.  </li>
            <li>and I hope it is very useful!</li>
            <li>While this mirror would be fine for many, for me</li>
            <li>easy to clean and affordable!</li>
            <li>Seems like it could break easily.</li>
            <li>I can picture it break easily if some pressure is applied.</li>
            <li>Either that or it breaks easily.</li>
            <li>It is a good size and it is real clear.</li>
            <li>This mirror is perfect for my hairdressing business as it is large enough for the customers to see the back of their heads and the price is very good too.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine for that.</li>
            <li>Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
            <li>Light in weight &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>The mirror is fine.</li>
            <li>The mirror part is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and large for your viewing needs.</li>
            <li>Large mirror is nice but not supported well on handle</li>
            <li>Large and nice for makeup.</li>
            <li>Nice large hand mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is nice and large, but the handle/casing is the problem.</li>
            <li>Nice and large with a good clear mirror.  </li>
            <li>However, I returned it for a refund because it felt too cheap.  </li>
            <li>I needed a mirror that was light weight and portable.</li>
            <li>It works, but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>This Mirror came a bit foggy looking and cheap.</li>
            <li>If you do your own hair like me this is an absolute must have.</li>
            <li>A bit cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>However, I got nail polish remover on that cheap mirror and destroyed it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice big mirror, perfect for seeing the back of your head.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just a mirror that works in a cheap design</li>
            <li>Cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>This thing&#x27;s made of cheap material.</li>
            <li>Attach a paint stick to stiffen the back side and it work great.</li>
            <li>The handle snapped off after a couple months of light use, so I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>It feels totally cheap and tacky.  </li>
            <li>simply cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Cheap flimsy mirror.  </li>
            <li>so im happy as i had low expectations.  </li>
            <li>seems like others have experienced the same.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great purchase for the price listed.</li>
            <li>I will definitely enjoy using this item</li>
            <li>Great sturdy handle balance, and big size.</li>
            <li>To me it&#x27;s not flimsy at all and provides a great view of all angles in terms of the back of your head and sides.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Yes, as others have said - it is cheaply made and flimsy.  </li>
            <li>But, look at the price you are paying - it is a cheap product - don&#x27;t expect expert craftsmanship, expect cheap, utilitarian.  </li>
            <li>on&amp;#34; to meet the free shipping requirement of our order.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li>mirror is clear and a good size.</li>
            <li>The mirror is clear and a good size.</li>
            <li>A couple months in, so far so good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the handle will eventually break off the bottom of the mirror where it is weakest.  </li>
            <li>Super cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>I have to clean it a lot.</li>
            <li>I sent mine back &amp; of course amazon.com was completely pleasant to deal with in terms of processing the return</li>
            <li>If I simply hold it still horizontally, the top of the mirror flexes a full 1\\&quot; out of line with the handle under its own weight.</li>
            <li>Reflects accurately w/o distortion.&lt;br /&gt;Would certainly be a great buy for some purposes as other reviews</li>
            <li>It actually is pretty big for a handheld mirror, its a really great feature.</li>
            <li>It took three times to get the hazy film and streaks off, and it still isn&#x27;t super clean.  </li>
            <li>I guess what they say is true, you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Brittny Professional\\&quot; and is much sturdier: the glass seems better, too.</li>
            <li>Nice and clear; well made.</li>
            <li>Works very well. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my only mirror.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s not bad and it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it was the exact mirror</li>
            <li>These are nice and light when women are trying on different necklaces and earrings.</li>
            <li>It does a good enough job for as little as I use it, but don&#x27;t expect anything great.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>This mirror is not a bad deal economically.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is very clear and the size makes it easy to see while still being a light weight mirror meaning you don&#x27;t feel like you are carrying a lump weight while using</li>
            <li>I believe if I wiggle it too much it will break off easily.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a mirror that I could use to see the back of my head when I do my hair (I have very long hair) and this was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your $ on this mirror, I&#x27;m sure there are much better on amazon!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap and large mirror.</li>
            <li>Light weight, large mirror.</li>
            <li>great little mirror i have been using it for years</li>
            <li>Large, fairly lightweight, easy to handle, with a good, flat mirror; not particularly sturdy but entirely adequate for normal use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and great for self haircuts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li>This mirror is huge, but feels flimsy, as though it might fall out of the plastic covering if I shake it too much.</li>
            <li>Nice big view of everything.</li>
            <li>If it were priced at $3 then it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>It is clear and works ok for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not putting nail polish remover on this mirror to find out if it&#x27;s actually worth the money or not.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d probably be better served getting a Goody brand mirror for far cheaper.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s even worth</li>
            <li>Nice big</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know I could own one until recently.</li>
            <li>I kind of like my greyish-green hue and my pearlish white belly.  </li>
            <li>And, that it is -it works, it actually reflects (a nice feature for a mirror) and it doesn&#x27;t disolve in your hand.  </li>
            <li>If you need an economical hand mirror - here it is.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is the right shape, size, and price.</li>
            <li>and they were right</li>
            <li>The crack is in the lower right hand corner of mirror</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li>and very durable if you used right!</li>
            <li>The mirror is fine, but has a very flimsy handle that I anticipate will break very soon.</li>
            <li>They are great for seeing the sides and back of your head while in front of a larger mirror.</li>
            <li>But doing that to any glass object is kind of strange in the first place.</li>
            <li>Have to be very gentle.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast and the box was intact</li>
            <li>I realize its a cheap mirror but really fogs up easy and the geniuses who either sell it or make it placed the bar code sticker on the mirror surface instead of the back plastic.</li>
            <li>My only concern is that the handle seems very flimsy and could break very easily.</li>
            <li>I had to clean what was supposed to be a brand new mirror.  </li>
            <li>and it is built more solidly.  </li>
            <li>The handle will break off first</li>
            <li>Overall its just a much better mirror.</li>
            <li>i can also use it to make sure i&#x27;m still breathing and the same can be said for friends and family.</li>
            <li>needed to be able to see the back of his head when he cut his hair.</li>
            <li>The mirror distorts the image, you feel like you are in a funny house looking at yourself.</li>
            <li>Nice wide mirror, but</li>
            <li>I would invest another dollar or two and get something more solid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li>This mirror is nice, big, and very clear.</li>
            <li>It is ok for the price but does feel a little cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I Ordered one of these a while back, and it was ok, but very flimsy.</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;ve had for many years, and that one has never broken, despite falling numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact the handle is an extension of the back - a &#x27;rubbery&#x27; feeling soft kind of plastic.</li>
            <li>The reason I was really interested by this mirror was its large size.</li>
            <li>Nice size and a clear, smooth reflection but the handle and frame are a little on the flimsy side.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Anti fogging really works after a hot bath</li>
            <li>It was larger than I expected, but very light weight (feels cheap), and apparently does break too easily.</li>
            <li>i can easily see the back of my head without turning around.</li>
            <li>This is a fairly large mirror</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a large mirror to hang on the bathroom wall across from the vanity mirror.  </li>
            <li>mirror so large</li>
            <li>I like the large size of the mirror.  </li>
            <li>A mirror is a mirror, and if you are in need in a large mirror, then go click the &#x27;purchase&#x27; button.</li>
            <li>and you can see in the large viewing area.</li>
            <li>Large.</li>
            <li>Makes no functional difference, but demonstrates for certain that what one gets is NOT what is pictured.</li>
            <li>It is large but very flimsy.</li>
            <li>The mirror handle and the back of the mirror are just a cheap piece of plastic that encase the mirror.</li>
            <li>I would have much better preferred to have paid a few extra dollars for a better quality handle.</li>
            <li>I really like it and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one when I need it.</li>
            <li>It seems like it is going to break with too much handling.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a Goody mirror (Amazon sells the real thing in a three-pack</li>
            <li>The mirror part is very robust: no cracks noted as I looked at my reflection.</li>
            <li>, will probably break someday without much stress.</li>
            <li>&quot; It&#x27;s a inexpensive mirror, I didn&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>They really need to work on the quality of the mirror before they offer it for sale.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t very sturdy, but it&#x27;s a plastic mirror.</li>
            <li>The handle or frame is light and seems it might break with only one trip in the suitcase, though I have not yet travelled with it.</li>
            <li>It it also very flimsy and feels like the mirror will come out of the casing..</li>
            <li>Feels very flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Very Disapointed in the quality for the price.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like how the handle, doesn&#x27;t really hold the mirror well, but will work for what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li>The construction of the mirror isn&#x27;t very durable.</li>
            <li>If you hold the mirror upright by the handle, it flops forward or backward and does not stand straight up.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very flimsy and floppy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just big enough and fits nicely in my hand, but can be tucked sideways in a bin under my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li>Enormous size makes seeing my back from a wall mounted mirror very easy.</li>
            <li>and it barely felt worth that price,</li>
            <li>It does have a really cool repeating pattern on the back that&#x27;s molded into the plastic.</li>
            <li>However, the mirror was placed on the bottom of the box (with no padding, that was placed on top of it) with the mirror facing down.</li>
            <li>The mirror produces a decent reflection but the handle is a tad flimsy.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d pay a few dollars more to have a real handle.</li>
            <li>I would not feel comfortable using this product on a daily basis for fear of the handle breaking near where it attaches to the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The mirror is very clear, the frame is sturdy but the handle is very flimsy</li>
            <li>The mirror is clear and large, and does what it needs to.  </li>
            <li>When I pick it up I make sure I get a couple of fingers under the mirror itself to brace the handle a little.</li>
            <li>this one was built just a little bit better though.</li>
            <li>My old cheapie mirror was a waste I would have to contort my body to even get a good look at the back of my hair.</li>
            <li>It will brake for sure in a few days.</li>
            <li>All because i didnt spend a few more dollars.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it will break from normal use.</li>
            <li>but perhaps the people who use it everyday find it more flimsy than I do.  </li>
            <li>looked very similar to what I had and the price was right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this vendor is making a killing, selling this cheap product at such a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mirror as an add-on item alongside a few other items and have to say that I am surprisingly impressed with the quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>Light, and solid enough to use for my biweekly self-haircut.</li>
            <li>wide enough to see back of head, use it to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a mirror; pretty big.</li>
            <li>This is my first &amp; last time swaying from that formula.</li>
            <li>It is large enough to check the back of your head in another mirror and light enough that it doesn&#x27;t tire you out lifting it.</li>
            <li>This mirror is wide enough for the job and since having it I have never been able to see the whole back of my hair.</li>
            <li>This mirror was exactly what I was searching for as I had broken mine the week before and wondered if I would be able to find its replacement.</li>
            <li>This mirror is big enough for me to easily see the back of my head.</li>
            <li>Clear.</li>
            <li>I bought this mirror because my old one broke</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>Helps me cut my hair for that professional look.</li>
            <li>So far no accidents</li>
            <li>I hasn&#x27;t so far, but I know that it&#x27;s just a matter of time before it does.</li>
            <li>The biggest problem I have is the fact it is not made as a professional Salon Mirror.  </li>
            <li>I just felt like eventually the handle will crack if moved too suddenly since it was so top heavy and by the handle swaying and bending when moving it.  </li>
            <li>If you want to open a hair salon and use this 50 times a day, then maybe pay a few more bucks for something industrial strength.</li>
            <li>I had to assemble it, but most of the two sided tape (for the back of the mirror) was missing.  </li>
            <li>Normally, you&#x27;d expect a handlebar on a mirror to be firm and strong, but this is the opposite!</li>
            <li>The mirror is loose and rattles in the plastic frame, which itself is pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li>Should have gone to the store and bought a decent one for the same money.</li>
            <li>Quite a big mirror, just be careful, the handle is very flimsy and seems very prone to breaking if not held</li>
            <li>The handle is not very sturdy, but should be fine if the user is careful.</li>
            <li>Large enough to see around me entire head.</li>
            <li>The handle was weak and the glass cracked pretty quickly; the brand was \\&quot;Luxor</li>
            <li>Recently my husband dropped it and the mirror shattered, so I was in the market for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>No complaints, but don&#x27;t expect some super high quality hard plastic mirror for the price.</li>
            <li>The mirror is nice and big but the plastic is thin and  is flimsy so the image is never still.</li>
            <li>but occasionally when I&#x27;m not lazy</li>
            <li>ON GOOGLE IMAGES &amp; FIND THE EXACT MIRROR CHEAPER ON EVERY OTHER SITE..</li>
            <li>a little flimsy but gets the job done, as long as your not violent with it</li>
            <li>The mirror is very inexpensive and the only real flaw it has is the plastic is a little flimsy.</li>
            <li>The handle/case was made of flimsy plastic that barely held the mirror&#x27;s weight, and the mirror itself looked like it wanted to pop out of its frame.</li>
            <li>Go to Target and get the exact same style (Conair brand), but with sturdy plastic, for half the price.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a million pieces, and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost of shipping to return it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m becoming too addicted to online shopping, proven by the fact that I paid $10 for a $2 hand mirror.</li>
            <li>The mirror arrived broken and there was no option for returning or exchanging it (other than paying $4.95 for postage -- hardly worth it), so the brand new mirror, shipping box and all went straight to the trash.</li>
            <li>The plastic around the mirror is weak and cheap.</li>
            <li>Granted, it&#x27;s a cheap hand mirror, but since the handle is so weak it makes it a bit floppy, which makes the reflection blurry.</li>
            <li>The plastic is a little cheap and the handle of the mirror is a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li>The mirror was fairly poor quality, which was fine by me based on the price.</li>
            <li>Plastic is a bit thin for the weight, but it will work fine.  </li>

            <li> Good size and made with good materials.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s still fairly good.</li>
            <li> Mirror was packed well &amp; in good shape considering the distance it came to get here.</li>
            <li> As advertised, good product.</li>
            <li> superior value.................</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good handheld mirror.  </li>
            <li> was too good a price to pass, its one of amazons specials.  </li>
            <li> It works good, but is not of the highest quality.  </li>
            <li> What good fortune to get one.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need anything else to help with my morning duties; my hair looks good with the use of this mirror.</li>

            <li> Very large for a hand mirror, perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Flexible handle, large surface and just excellent feel.</li>
            <li> My opinion is that the frame and handle should be strengthen and then it would be an excellent large mirror for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link</li>
            <li> Nice product and well made.</li>
            <li> and I liked it a lot.  </li>
            <li> and i still own and use it.</li>
            <li> I am a home barber and I cut my own hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to cut my own hair.  </li>
            <li> buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> This is the kind they use in barber shops and beauty parlors.</li>
            <li> Nice size.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The mirror is a great size, but I can&#x27;t get it clean.  </li>
            <li> It could easily sell for over twice the price in a store and it would still be a good mirror.  </li>
            <li> This mirror fit both bills, and was a good price to boot.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it without this mirror.</li>
            <li> Good thing they are cheap and an add-on item.  </li>
            <li> This mirror works for the job that it was designed to do but it is very cheap.</li>
            <li> No distortion and very light weight.</li>
            <li> The plastic is made of very cheap material.</li>
            <li> It is, however, made very cheaply.  </li>
            <li> It is large but lightweight, great to pack travel with,</li>
            <li> It has a nice large mirror area and the quality of the reflection is good.</li>
            <li> Try not to drop it and you will forever be able to see yourself without cracked glass.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d purchased many years ago.</li>
            <li> This mirror is ok.</li>
            <li> then you should make a product review stating this mirror isn&#x27;t any better than a 2 dollar mirror a discount beauty store.</li>
            <li> Cheap!</li>
            <li> But now I ordered a replacement, and the quality seems much better.</li>
            <li> What more can you say about a mirror?</li>
            <li> confirmed by this handy dandy hand mirror.  </li>
            <li> but when I do need it I&#x27;m glad I have it.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m currently completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The glass part feels like it weighs more than the plastic.</li>
            <li> The handle is cheap plastic, and the mirror its self is not magnified nor a good quality, plus the mirrow was so cheap</li>
            <li> probably better to spend more on one better made for safety and quality.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself doesn&#x27;t have any imperfections in it, so I am satisfied with it for my use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mirror, what more do you want?  </li>
            <li> (if I can&#x27;t find anything better)</li>
            <li> It would be much better with a thicker frame.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> A day after ordering this I found a store that sells it for a dollar more.</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t count on was not being able to remove the sticker on the front of the mirror.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.</li>
            <li> Fits great in travel bags, very flexible that way.</li>
            <li> and I shattered many of these against the wall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure I like scales or  my bulging eyes.  </li>
            <li> Mirror is ok but not sturdy...poor design on handle, but it works as well as any mirror could.  </li>
            <li> I prefer something more sturdy.</li>
            <li> I am glad that it is lightweight</li>
            <li> Very large and gives a good viewing angle.  </li>
            <li> and I hope it is very useful!</li>
            <li> While this mirror would be fine for many, for me</li>
            <li> easy to clean and affordable!</li>
            <li> Seems like it could break easily.</li>
            <li> I can picture it break easily if some pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> Either that or it breaks easily.</li>
            <li> It is a good size and it is real clear.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for my hairdressing business as it is large enough for the customers to see the back of their heads and the price is very good too.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine for that.</li>
            <li> Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
            <li> Light in weight &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine.</li>
            <li> The mirror part is fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and large for your viewing needs.</li>
            <li> Large mirror is nice but not supported well on handle</li>
            <li> Large and nice for makeup.</li>
            <li> Nice large hand mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is nice and large, but the handle/casing is the problem.</li>
            <li> Nice and large with a good clear mirror.  </li>
            <li> However, I returned it for a refund because it felt too cheap.  </li>
            <li> I needed a mirror that was light weight and portable.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> This Mirror came a bit foggy looking and cheap.</li>
            <li> If you do your own hair like me this is an absolute must have.</li>
            <li> A bit cheap, but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> However, I got nail polish remover on that cheap mirror and destroyed it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice big mirror, perfect for seeing the back of your head.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just a mirror that works in a cheap design</li>
            <li> Cheap and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This thing&#x27;s made of cheap material.</li>
            <li> Attach a paint stick to stiffen the back side and it work great.</li>
            <li> The handle snapped off after a couple months of light use, so I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> It feels totally cheap and tacky.  </li>
            <li> simply cheaply made.</li>
            <li> Cheap flimsy mirror.  </li>
            <li> so im happy as i had low expectations.  </li>
            <li> seems like others have experienced the same.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great purchase for the price listed.</li>
            <li> I will definitely enjoy using this item</li>
            <li> Great sturdy handle balance, and big size.</li>
            <li> To me it&#x27;s not flimsy at all and provides a great view of all angles in terms of the back of your head and sides.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Yes, as others have said - it is cheaply made and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> But, look at the price you are paying - it is a cheap product - don&#x27;t expect expert craftsmanship, expect cheap, utilitarian.  </li>
            <li> on&amp;#34; to meet the free shipping requirement of our order.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really cheap and does the job.</li>
            <li> mirror is clear and a good size.</li>
            <li> The mirror is clear and a good size.</li>
            <li> A couple months in, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the handle will eventually break off the bottom of the mirror where it is weakest.  </li>
            <li> Super cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> I have to clean it a lot.</li>
            <li> I sent mine back &amp; of course amazon.com was completely pleasant to deal with in terms of processing the return</li>
            <li> If I simply hold it still horizontally, the top of the mirror flexes a full 1\\&quot; out of line with the handle under its own weight.</li>
            <li> Reflects accurately w/o distortion.&lt;br /&gt;Would certainly be a great buy for some purposes as other reviews</li>
            <li> It actually is pretty big for a handheld mirror, its a really great feature.</li>
            <li> It took three times to get the hazy film and streaks off, and it still isn&#x27;t super clean.  </li>
            <li> I guess what they say is true, you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Brittny Professional\\&quot; and is much sturdier: the glass seems better, too.</li>
            <li> Nice and clear; well made.</li>
            <li> Works very well. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my only mirror.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s not bad and it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it was the exact mirror</li>
            <li> These are nice and light when women are trying on different necklaces and earrings.</li>
            <li> It does a good enough job for as little as I use it, but don&#x27;t expect anything great.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> This mirror is not a bad deal economically.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is very clear and the size makes it easy to see while still being a light weight mirror meaning you don&#x27;t feel like you are carrying a lump weight while using</li>
            <li> I believe if I wiggle it too much it will break off easily.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mirror that I could use to see the back of my head when I do my hair (I have very long hair) and this was the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your $ on this mirror, I&#x27;m sure there are much better on amazon!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap and large mirror.</li>
            <li> Light weight, large mirror.</li>
            <li> great little mirror i have been using it for years</li>
            <li> Large, fairly lightweight, easy to handle, with a good, flat mirror; not particularly sturdy but entirely adequate for normal use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and great for self haircuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> This mirror is huge, but feels flimsy, as though it might fall out of the plastic covering if I shake it too much.</li>
            <li> Nice big view of everything.</li>
            <li> If it were priced at $3 then it would be worth it.</li>
            <li> It is clear and works ok for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not putting nail polish remover on this mirror to find out if it&#x27;s actually worth the money or not.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d probably be better served getting a Goody brand mirror for far cheaper.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s even worth</li>
            <li> Nice big</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know I could own one until recently.</li>
            <li> I kind of like my greyish-green hue and my pearlish white belly.  </li>
            <li> And, that it is -it works, it actually reflects (a nice feature for a mirror) and it doesn&#x27;t disolve in your hand.  </li>
            <li> If you need an economical hand mirror - here it is.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is the right shape, size, and price.</li>
            <li> and they were right</li>
            <li> The crack is in the lower right hand corner of mirror</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right.  </li>
            <li> and very durable if you used right!</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine, but has a very flimsy handle that I anticipate will break very soon.</li>
            <li> They are great for seeing the sides and back of your head while in front of a larger mirror.</li>
            <li> But doing that to any glass object is kind of strange in the first place.</li>
            <li> Have to be very gentle.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and the box was intact</li>
            <li> I realize its a cheap mirror but really fogs up easy and the geniuses who either sell it or make it placed the bar code sticker on the mirror surface instead of the back plastic.</li>
            <li> My only concern is that the handle seems very flimsy and could break very easily.</li>
            <li> I had to clean what was supposed to be a brand new mirror.  </li>
            <li> and it is built more solidly.  </li>
            <li> The handle will break off first</li>
            <li> Overall its just a much better mirror.</li>
            <li> i can also use it to make sure i&#x27;m still breathing and the same can be said for friends and family.</li>
            <li> needed to be able to see the back of his head when he cut his hair.</li>
            <li> The mirror distorts the image, you feel like you are in a funny house looking at yourself.</li>
            <li> Nice wide mirror, but</li>
            <li> I would invest another dollar or two and get something more solid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is nice, big, and very clear.</li>
            <li> It is ok for the price but does feel a little cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I Ordered one of these a while back, and it was ok, but very flimsy.</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve had for many years, and that one has never broken, despite falling numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact the handle is an extension of the back - a &#x27;rubbery&#x27; feeling soft kind of plastic.</li>
            <li> The reason I was really interested by this mirror was its large size.</li>
            <li> Nice size and a clear, smooth reflection but the handle and frame are a little on the flimsy side.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Anti fogging really works after a hot bath</li>
            <li> It was larger than I expected, but very light weight (feels cheap), and apparently does break too easily.</li>
            <li> i can easily see the back of my head without turning around.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly large mirror</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a large mirror to hang on the bathroom wall across from the vanity mirror.  </li>
            <li> mirror so large</li>
            <li> I like the large size of the mirror.  </li>
            <li> A mirror is a mirror, and if you are in need in a large mirror, then go click the &#x27;purchase&#x27; button.</li>
            <li> and you can see in the large viewing area.</li>
            <li> Large.</li>
            <li> Makes no functional difference, but demonstrates for certain that what one gets is NOT what is pictured.</li>
            <li> It is large but very flimsy.</li>
            <li> The mirror handle and the back of the mirror are just a cheap piece of plastic that encase the mirror.</li>
            <li> I would have much better preferred to have paid a few extra dollars for a better quality handle.</li>
            <li> I really like it and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one when I need it.</li>
            <li> It seems like it is going to break with too much handling.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a Goody mirror (Amazon sells the real thing in a three-pack</li>
            <li> The mirror part is very robust: no cracks noted as I looked at my reflection.</li>
            <li> , will probably break someday without much stress.</li>
            <li> &quot; It&#x27;s a inexpensive mirror, I didn&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> They really need to work on the quality of the mirror before they offer it for sale.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t very sturdy, but it&#x27;s a plastic mirror.</li>
            <li> The handle or frame is light and seems it might break with only one trip in the suitcase, though I have not yet travelled with it.</li>
            <li> It it also very flimsy and feels like the mirror will come out of the casing..</li>
            <li> Feels very flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Very Disapointed in the quality for the price.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like how the handle, doesn&#x27;t really hold the mirror well, but will work for what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> Very dissappointed.</li>
            <li> The construction of the mirror isn&#x27;t very durable.</li>
            <li> If you hold the mirror upright by the handle, it flops forward or backward and does not stand straight up.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very flimsy and floppy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just big enough and fits nicely in my hand, but can be tucked sideways in a bin under my bathroom vanity.</li>
            <li> Enormous size makes seeing my back from a wall mounted mirror very easy.</li>
            <li> and it barely felt worth that price,</li>
            <li> It does have a really cool repeating pattern on the back that&#x27;s molded into the plastic.</li>
            <li> However, the mirror was placed on the bottom of the box (with no padding, that was placed on top of it) with the mirror facing down.</li>
            <li> The mirror produces a decent reflection but the handle is a tad flimsy.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d pay a few dollars more to have a real handle.</li>
            <li> I would not feel comfortable using this product on a daily basis for fear of the handle breaking near where it attaches to the mirror.  </li>
            <li> The mirror is very clear, the frame is sturdy but the handle is very flimsy</li>
            <li> The mirror is clear and large, and does what it needs to.  </li>
            <li> When I pick it up I make sure I get a couple of fingers under the mirror itself to brace the handle a little.</li>
            <li> this one was built just a little bit better though.</li>
            <li> My old cheapie mirror was a waste I would have to contort my body to even get a good look at the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> It will brake for sure in a few days.</li>
            <li> All because i didnt spend a few more dollars.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will break from normal use.</li>
            <li> but perhaps the people who use it everyday find it more flimsy than I do.  </li>
            <li> looked very similar to what I had and the price was right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this vendor is making a killing, selling this cheap product at such a ridiculous price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror as an add-on item alongside a few other items and have to say that I am surprisingly impressed with the quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Light, and solid enough to use for my biweekly self-haircut.</li>
            <li> wide enough to see back of head, use it to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mirror; pretty big.</li>
            <li> This is my first &amp; last time swaying from that formula.</li>
            <li> It is large enough to check the back of your head in another mirror and light enough that it doesn&#x27;t tire you out lifting it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is wide enough for the job and since having it I have never been able to see the whole back of my hair.</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I was searching for as I had broken mine the week before and wondered if I would be able to find its replacement.</li>
            <li> This mirror is big enough for me to easily see the back of my head.</li>
            <li> Clear.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because my old one broke</li>
            <li> WOW.</li>
            <li> Helps me cut my hair for that professional look.</li>
            <li> So far no accidents</li>
            <li> I hasn&#x27;t so far, but I know that it&#x27;s just a matter of time before it does.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I have is the fact it is not made as a professional Salon Mirror.  </li>
            <li> I just felt like eventually the handle will crack if moved too suddenly since it was so top heavy and by the handle swaying and bending when moving it.  </li>
            <li> If you want to open a hair salon and use this 50 times a day, then maybe pay a few more bucks for something industrial strength.</li>
            <li> I had to assemble it, but most of the two sided tape (for the back of the mirror) was missing.  </li>
            <li> Normally, you&#x27;d expect a handlebar on a mirror to be firm and strong, but this is the opposite!</li>
            <li> The mirror is loose and rattles in the plastic frame, which itself is pretty flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Should have gone to the store and bought a decent one for the same money.</li>
            <li> Quite a big mirror, just be careful, the handle is very flimsy and seems very prone to breaking if not held</li>
            <li> The handle is not very sturdy, but should be fine if the user is careful.</li>
            <li> Large enough to see around me entire head.</li>
            <li> The handle was weak and the glass cracked pretty quickly; the brand was \\&quot;Luxor</li>
            <li> Recently my husband dropped it and the mirror shattered, so I was in the market for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> No complaints, but don&#x27;t expect some super high quality hard plastic mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> The mirror is nice and big but the plastic is thin and  is flimsy so the image is never still.</li>
            <li> but occasionally when I&#x27;m not lazy</li>
            <li> ON GOOGLE IMAGES &amp; FIND THE EXACT MIRROR CHEAPER ON EVERY OTHER SITE..</li>
            <li> a little flimsy but gets the job done, as long as your not violent with it</li>
            <li> The mirror is very inexpensive and the only real flaw it has is the plastic is a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> The handle/case was made of flimsy plastic that barely held the mirror&#x27;s weight, and the mirror itself looked like it wanted to pop out of its frame.</li>
            <li> Go to Target and get the exact same style (Conair brand), but with sturdy plastic, for half the price.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a million pieces, and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost of shipping to return it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m becoming too addicted to online shopping, proven by the fact that I paid $10 for a $2 hand mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived broken and there was no option for returning or exchanging it (other than paying $4.95 for postage -- hardly worth it), so the brand new mirror, shipping box and all went straight to the trash.</li>
            <li> The plastic around the mirror is weak and cheap.</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s a cheap hand mirror, but since the handle is so weak it makes it a bit floppy, which makes the reflection blurry.</li>
            <li> The plastic is a little cheap and the handle of the mirror is a little flimsy.  </li>
            <li> The mirror was fairly poor quality, which was fine by me based on the price.</li>
            <li> Plastic is a bit thin for the weight, but it will work fine.  </li>
            <li> I just put it down in a normal fashion.</li>
            <li> Seriously if you can&#x27;t make one of these right</li>
            <li> I do not expect it to last long.  </li>
            <li> Mostly just using it for hair cutting and checking back</li>
            <li> The second one just cracked through the middle for unknown reasons.</li>
            <li> So happy to find this one even though I may now have seven years of bad luck after breaking mine!  </li>
            <li> see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> I am repulsed by my looks but am strangely drawn to my image.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s strange isn&#x27;t it?  </li>
            <li> Just need to be careful using it and storing it properly to prevent damage to it.</li>
            <li> Not clear, and the handle is flimsy.</li>
            <li> , I expect it to break down the road if I&#x27;m not extremely careful when moving it around.  </li>
            <li> The plastic handle for the mirror was not durable enough, when you hold it in your hand the mirror will actually bend backwards slightly from the weight of the glass.  </li>
            <li> Very thin glass and cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li> Not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> When holding the mirror by the handle, you are definitely aware that the handle is inadequate - too thin and flexible.  </li>
            <li> not once but twice, broken the first time the re shipped it.</li>
            <li> Weak handle but large mirror is what I was after.</li>
            <li> I found a mirror slightly smaller at a discount beauty store for about 5 bucks less, without including shipping.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the image seen in it is slightly distorted and somehow smaller than it should be.</li>
            <li> Just know you could go to your local Walmart or Sally&#x27;s hair store and grab you one of these, without the pain of waiting 4-7 days, receiving the thing, and it&#x27;s in a mess.</li>
            <li> It seems fine to me for use when cutting my hair</li>
            <li> Bought a similar, heavy duty frame in different colors from WalMart for less than $3.</li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the handle is not sufficient for the weight of the frame and mirror and sways a little bit during use.  </li>
            <li> only con was it was a little bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> the handle is a little flimsy and not solid like it looks in picture.</li>
            <li> nothing wrong with the mirror, but the casing is made of very flimsy plastic, where it literally rocks back and forth when you hold it by the handle.  </li>
            <li> This mirror is not very sturdy as mentioned, and mine also broke in shipment.  </li>
            <li> You must be careful so you don&#x27;t break the mirror.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive, but I don&#x27;t feel it is worth even $8.98 for a couple months use.</li>
            <li> so be careful with the handle.</li>
            <li> The handle is pretty thin and will bend slightly when you move the mirror.  </li>
            <li> (the mirror was face down on a flat counter and the hair dryer was not set down roughly).  </li>
            <li> It is big, and lightweight, but the plastic in thin, flexes and will break if I am not careful with it.  </li>
            <li> The handle is wobbly so it&#x27;s not a good choice for professional use</li>
            <li> Honestly, I am not sure how to review this mirror, it is plastic, hand held, and I can see my bald spot getting bigger.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> The weight of the low quality short and weak handle causes the handle to bend when you hold it by the handle alone.</li>
            <li> The handle is no more fragile than any other part of it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it that long to comment on the durability but for a few bucks</li>
            <li> If you need a mirror like this, listen to other reviewers and save your money....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more disappointed in Amazon for carrying this junk and myself for falling for it than I am with the guys who produced it.</li>
            <li> other times, I do not.</li>
            <li> One after the other got broke.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what the other comments about it being fragile was all about.</li>
            <li> And minus 2 points for the handle half being flimsy.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very thin, and the handle is pretty flimsy.</li>
            <li> On one, the glass broke when I set down a small hair dryer on the back of the mirror</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have is for the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Totally not worth the price.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror because I wanted a larger one to use when cutting my hair with my new clippers.  </li>
            <li> Very flimsy and who thought to put the sticker that is almost impossible to remove in the middle of the mirror?&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> When the price drops down below $5, it&#x27;s quite a deal.</li>
            <li> Typically I&#x27;d have someone else do it</li>
            <li> it bends slightly when you hold it level</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even remember that it dropped; just picked it up one day and the glass was cracked in half.</li>
            <li> Its a hand mirror &amp; its black.</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 of these mirrors in both the black and burgandy and use them for jewelry shows.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one down side is that the handle is a little bit too flexible.</li>
            <li> But the main problem with it is the glass of the mirror is very thin.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time removing it and even after soaping the mirror down, I still have sticky residue on the center.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but does the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little blurry and scratched (as it came).  </li>
            <li> the handle is a little flimsy and has trouble holding the mirror part up.  </li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected, though that&#x27;s my fault for being unable to visualize dimensions.</li>
            <li> I noticed the glue placed between the mirror and back didn&#x27;t even hold the broken pieces in, which might have been usable in my situation.</li>
            <li> I was at the barber shop a few days ago</li>
            <li> buy one at a beauty supply store as this was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> now i need to waste time doing returns, dropping it off, waiting for refund.</li>
            <li> the mirror part is way too heavy for the handle.</li>
            <li> broken a second time.</li>
            <li> The mirror is big and heavy but the handle is thin and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> The plastic is thin and the actual piece of mirrored glass is not securely attached, so it can wobble around.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for one thing only, cutting hair, cutting my hair to be exact.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pretty disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> It does its job and the only thing wrong with it that I can think of</li>
            <li> Arrived broken, and as far as I can tell, no options for returning or replacing, next time I will just run to the store for a mirror :(</li>
            <li> Not very good quality.</li>
            <li> Worse, I sat it down on the dresser and</li>
            <li> I bought two of these mirrors less than a year ago and now both have broken.  </li>
            <li> Label on the mirror glass tears when peeling, making it impossible to remove, and leaves adhesive residue when you finally get done tearing little pieces of label off.  </li>
            <li> not worth the hassle to return !!!</li>
            <li> The neighborhood sucker.</li>
            <li> If you drop it even one time that sucker will shatter.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Super cheap plastic.  Feels like it is going to break when I hold it.  I guess I should have read the reviews - I was in a hurry.  The mirror is a great size, but I can&#x27;t get it clean.  It took three times to get the hazy film and streaks off, and it still isn&#x27;t super clean.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> wide enough to see back of head, use it to trim my own hair.</li>
            <li> The mirror produces a decent reflection but the handle is a tad flimsy. I would not suggest tossing it around or grabbing it rapidly. For the price it&#x27;s not bad and it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Nice big view of everything. I use this to trim/shave my but hair. Typically I&#x27;d have someone else do it but occasionally when I&#x27;m not lazy I&#x27;ll do it myself.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle for the mirror was not durable enough, when you hold it in your hand the mirror will actually bend backwards slightly from the weight of the glass.  The glass is also very thin and brittle when you touch it.  I put the mirror in the plastic bubblewrap casing it comes with and put it in a plastic bag to carry around.  By the time I got to my destination the glass had shattered inside the bubblewrap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money, nothing about this product is good.</li>
            <li> Both the handle and bottom edge of the mirror are very fragile</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror because my old one broke and I was looking for an upgrade. The reason I was really interested by this mirror was its large size. It actually is pretty big for a handheld mirror, its a really great feature. But, I have to stay, I was really disappointed by the quality of the handlebar. It&#x27;s so flimsy! I swear I&#x27;ll probably break it by the end of the month, and i just got the mirror today. Normally, you&#x27;d expect a handlebar on a mirror to be firm and strong, but this is the opposite! The mirror handle and the back of the mirror are just a cheap piece of plastic that encase the mirror. I have to say, I&#x27;m pretty disappointed. I would have much better preferred to have paid a few extra dollars for a better quality handle. I guess what they say is true, you get what you pay for...</li>
            <li> No, this isn&#x27;t the best mirror money can buy.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is the best mirror I could hope for at $7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is clear and a good size. I use it for seeing the back of my head while I cut my hair.</li>
            <li> Large, fairly lightweight, easy to handle, with a good, flat mirror; not particularly sturdy but entirely adequate for normal use.</li>
            <li> It is ok for the price but does feel a little cheaply made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap and large mirror. It&#x27;s a tiny bit flimsy but it gets the job done. Try not to drop it and you will forever be able to see yourself without cracked glass.</li>
            <li> Nice product and well made.</li>
            <li> This mirror is not a bad deal economically. But I&#x27;d pay a few dollars more to have a real handle. It&#x27;s frustrating to hold because it bends, and you have to brace your thumb against the backside when using it.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly large mirror and I liked it a lot.  However, I returned it for a refund because it felt too cheap.  When holding the mirror by the handle, you are definitely aware that the handle is inadequate - too thin and flexible.  Feels like the mirror is going to wobble around.</li>
            <li> Not clear, and the handle is flimsy.</li>
            <li> I needed a mirror that was light weight and portable. This mirror fit both bills, and was a good price to boot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was because of the flimsiness of the mirror or the poor packaging, but the mirror arrived broken. If you&#x27;re looking for a hand mirror I would suggest looking elsewhere. The plastic handle is not sturdy and the mirror is extremely fragile. A completely different spot of the mirror cracked when trying to piece back together. Has the quality of something you would buy for a dollar at a dollar store.</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror to hang in a shower because it was inexpensive.  It seems to work as well as the shower mirror I&#x27;d purchased many years ago.</li>
            <li> Piece of overpriced crap. Do not buy. Broke on the second day. If it were priced at $3 then it would be worth it. You could buy one every time it broke.</li>
            <li> great little mirror i have been using it for years and i still own and use it. Good size and made with good materials.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is very clear and the size makes it easy to see while still being a light weight mirror meaning you don&#x27;t feel like you are carrying a lump weight while using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one down side is that the handle is a little bit too flexible. If the handle was sturdy then it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I shave my head myself, and use this mirror to see the back of my head. It works, but it&#x27;s cheap. It fogs up and it gets really dirty. I have to clean it a lot. Otherwise, it is the right shape, size, and price. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I am a home barber and I cut my own hair. This mirror is just the thing I needed to see what I am doing with the clippers. It is a good size and it is real clear. I really like it and wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one when I need it.</li>
            <li> Low quality mirror.. the handle bends when you hold it up.  It seems like it is going to break with too much handling.  Have to be very gentle.</li>
            <li> This mirror came up in a search for Goody mirrors.  It is not a Goody mirror and is of inferior quality.  The mirror is loose and rattles in the plastic frame, which itself is pretty flimsy.  I thought this was a Goody mirror (Amazon sells the real thing in a three-pack and I thought this was just the single version) and was majorly disappointed when it arrived.  I would not order this again.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I would have is for the manufacturer.  The handle is pretty thin and will bend slightly when you move the mirror.  I purchased another handle mirror at the same time by Floxite that has two sides to it and it is built more solidly.  While this mirror would be fine for many, for me I just felt like eventually the handle will crack if moved too suddenly since it was so top heavy and by the handle swaying and bending when moving it.  I didn&#x27;t want that while I was trying to trim the hair on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> This mirror was exactly what I was searching for as I had broken mine the week before and wondered if I would be able to find its replacement. I like that the handle provides a way to hang the mirror from my shower rod to see and style the back of my hair.  So happy to find this one even though I may now have seven years of bad luck after breaking mine!  Thank you Amazon and your Seller for providing this item.</li>
            <li> The mirror is nice and big but the plastic is thin and  is flimsy so the image is never still. Not good to shave with.</li>
            <li> Label on the mirror glass tears when peeling, making it impossible to remove, and leaves adhesive residue when you finally get done tearing little pieces of label off.  While trying to remove the adhesive the mirror broke because of its incredibly flimsy construction.  Forget seven years of bad luck, save yourself any bad luck at all and move on to another option.</li>
            <li> Disappointed about the handle, very weak construction for $15.00. The handle will break off first and then I&#x27;ll have to buy another.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror in pieces, i was so upset. I didn&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning. Just know you could go to your local Walmart or Sally&#x27;s hair store and grab you one of these, without the pain of waiting 4-7 days, receiving the thing, and it&#x27;s in a mess. Boo!</li>
            <li> very weak handle and for some stupid reason they decided to put a sticker that is hard to get off on the front. Otherwise, its a mirror and it reflects things... so it does its job.</li>
            <li> This mirror was packed incredibly well and got to me in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;The mirror though is just so so. Nice size and a clear, smooth reflection but the handle and frame are a little on the flimsy side.&lt;br /&gt;Not the worst I&#x27;ve seen but not the best either.</li>
            <li> It is the required size but the handle is flimsy. I believe if I wiggle it too much it will break off easily. The mirror part is very robust: no cracks noted as I looked at my reflection.</li>
            <li> This Mirror came a bit foggy looking and cheap. Worse, I sat it down on the dresser and it cracked-- I didn&#x27;t throw it, drop it, or step on it.. I just put it down in a normal fashion. Very thin glass and cheaply constructed. Avoid this overpriced junk mirror.</li>
            <li> When I received this item the box was smashed, 3/4 open and taped back to together. I get it, its not their fault it was treated like this during shipping. However, the mirror was placed on the bottom of the box (with no padding, that was placed on top of it) with the mirror facing down. Before I opened the box I could hear the glass moving around inside. When I finaly opened it for inspection I noticed the glue placed between the mirror and back didn&#x27;t even hold the broken pieces in, which might have been usable in my situation. Almost every shard was in the bag that was wrapped around it. I thought this would have been a good purchase because I cut my own hair but I&#x27;m currently deployed and don&#x27;t feel like dealing with trying to send it back and waiting again. Maybe I can use one of the larger shards as a hand mirror.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine, but has a very flimsy handle that I anticipate will break very soon. Otherwise it does the job.</li>
            <li> I realize its a cheap mirror but really fogs up easy and the geniuses who either sell it or make it placed the bar code sticker on the mirror surface instead of the back plastic. It still has remnants of the tag. Also feels like its going to fall apart at any moment</li>
            <li> This mirror is not very sturdy as mentioned, and mine also broke in shipment.  Had no problem returning it. It was larger than I expected, but very light weight (feels cheap), and apparently does break too easily.</li>
            <li> This mirror is getting a bad rap in the reviews. Perhaps the handle isn&#x27;t the sturdiest in the world, but it&#x27;s not as if the mirror waves back and forth when you hold it. I wouldn&#x27;t sit on it, but to hang up and use occasionally it seems to be all one could want. When the price drops down below $5, it&#x27;s quite a deal. If you want to open a hair salon and use this 50 times a day, then maybe pay a few more bucks for something industrial strength. Otherwise, it fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Handle is flimsy. Seems like it could break easily.</li>
            <li> If you do your own hair like me this is an absolute must have. I have ear length hair that is cut into a short bob so I must maintain the curls in the back. My old cheapie mirror was a waste I would have to contort my body to even get a good look at the back of my hair. This mirror is wide enough for the job and since having it I have never been able to see the whole back of my hair. Now that I can I don&#x27;t have to make blind judgement calls. I love it!</li>
            <li> A bit cheap, but you get what you pay for. I got this mirror so I could see the back of my head and it&#x27;s fine for that.</li>
            <li> I cut my own hair and wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it without this mirror. Although it isn&#x27;t the sturdiest hand mirror, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The handle is a bit flimsy,  it bends slightly when you hold it level, will probably break someday without much stress. But it&#x27;s still fairly good.</li>
            <li> When I picked up the USPS box, I could immediately hear something rattling around inside.  When I opened the shipping box, the box inside had already been opened.  When I opened the already once-opened box.  The mirror was in pieces.  I had to assemble it, but most of the two sided tape (for the back of the mirror) was missing.  Also, the mirror was dirty.  I had to clean what was supposed to be a brand new mirror.  Also, the plastic on the handle was terribly scuffed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the quality control for this mirror is atrocious and/or I got a mirror that somebody else had already returned.</li>
            <li> It is a mirror that reflects and you can hold it with your hand. Honestly, I am not sure how to review this mirror, it is plastic, hand held, and I can see my bald spot getting bigger.  Glad I bought it, works perfect.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember but I think this mirror broke the second week I had it. The plastic around the mirror is weak and cheap. Look somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Mirror was packed well &amp; in good shape considering the distance it came to get here. It&#x27;s a mirror, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> This mirror is ok. I was looking for something bigger. But this will do. It is clear and works ok for me. I use it when relaxing my hair at home and to check the back of my hair.</li>
            <li> I found a mirror slightly smaller at a discount beauty store for about 5 bucks less, without including shipping.  However, I got nail polish remover on that cheap mirror and destroyed it.  Which is why I bought this one.  I&#x27;m not putting nail polish remover on this mirror to find out if it&#x27;s actually worth the money or not.  Nor am I going to research the products put into the plastic to find out if it&#x27;s going to withstand daily mishaps.  I&#x27;m going to simply give this mirror 4 stars, if you end up getting nail polish remover on this mirror and it melts then you should make a product review stating this mirror isn&#x27;t any better than a 2 dollar mirror a discount beauty store.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mirror as an add-on item alongside a few other items and have to say that I am surprisingly impressed with the quality for such a low price. It is large but lightweight, great to pack travel with, easy to clean and affordable!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.People were saying you could actually see your reflection in the mirror, so I bought it and they were right you can actually see your self in the mirror WOW.</li>
            <li> Light weight, large mirror. Helps me cut my hair for that professional look. Anti fogging really works after a hot bath</li>
            <li> The mirror is big and heavy but the handle is thin and flimsy.  It feels like it would break as you move it around.  Cheap!</li>
            <li> Obviously these people do not know where to place their stickers. Had a hard time removing it and even after soaping the mirror down, I still have sticky residue on the center.</li>
            <li> I wanted a larger frame mirror to trim the back of my neckline between haircuts.  This unit does the job well.  The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the handle is not sufficient for the weight of the frame and mirror and sways a little bit during use.  I expect it will crack and break with time.  I bought it for occasional use only, so my expectations were met.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a million pieces, and I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth the cost of shipping to return it.  I assume this has to nothing to do with the merchant, but the shipping company.  I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The plastic is thin and the actual piece of mirrored glass is not securely attached, so it can wobble around. It does not fall out, but it does scare you a bit. So far no accidents and I&#x27;ve had it for 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s a nice big mirror, perfect for seeing the back of your head.</li>
            <li> The handle/case was made of flimsy plastic that barely held the mirror&#x27;s weight, and the mirror itself looked like it wanted to pop out of its frame. I can&#x27;t justify paying $14.00 for something this flimsy. You&#x27;d probably be better served getting a Goody brand mirror for far cheaper.</li>
            <li> Shipping was very fast and the box was intact so I&#x27;m figuring mirror was damaged before they boxed it up. The crack is in the lower right hand corner of mirror so I guess it&#x27;s still somewhat usable. I would send it back but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s even worth the hassle seeing as though it was only $9.45. Hopefully they&#x27;ll send me a replacement without any issues. We shall see.</li>
            <li> I Ordered one of these a while back, and it was ok, but very flimsy. The handle was weak and the glass cracked pretty quickly; the brand was \\&quot;Luxor Pro.\\&quot; It&#x27;s a inexpensive mirror, I didn&#x27;t expect too much. But now I ordered a replacement, and the quality seems much better. The handle says \\&quot;Brittny Professional\\&quot; and is much sturdier: the glass seems better, too. Overall its just a much better mirror. It&#x27;s nice and large for your viewing needs. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It is large but very flimsy. Thin cheap plastic around mirror. You must be careful so you don&#x27;t break the mirror.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister for Christmas. Now she can&#x27;t stop staring at herself and I miss her.</li>
            <li> this product is something that ought to be pulled from the market--the handle is about 1/16&amp;#34; thick--plastic--and holding the mirror is akin to holding a wilting flower--shame on the seller for foisting this product on the market!!  They really need to work on the quality of the mirror before they offer it for sale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mirror; pretty big. Nice and clear; well made. What more can you say about a mirror?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mirror! It isn&#x27;t very sturdy, but it&#x27;s a plastic mirror. It does what I need. No complaints, but don&#x27;t expect some super high quality hard plastic mirror for the price.</li>
            <li> Large mirror is nice but not supported well on handle</li>
            <li> need to see how the back of me looks as I am giving myself a haircut. This mirror is ultra lite.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mirror. Seriously if you can&#x27;t make one of these right then you shouldn&#x27;t be in business. I use it when I cut my hair and it works well.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I expected, though that&#x27;s my fault for being unable to visualize dimensions. Otherwise fine.</li>
            <li> As advertised, good product.</li>
            <li> A bit flimsy. The handle or frame is light and seems it might break with only one trip in the suitcase, though I have not yet travelled with it.</li>
            <li> superior value................. this one is all about the price....dont expect alot,  it&#x27;s just a mirror that works in a cheap design</li>
            <li> confirmed by this handy dandy hand mirror.  i can also use it to make sure i&#x27;m still breathing and the same can be said for friends and family. all for a price lower than what i would have paid in the beauty supply store! win!</li>
            <li> The casing and handle is flimsy and weak. The weight of the low quality short and weak handle causes the handle to bend when you hold it by the handle alone.Was overpriced when I bought it. The price has dropped from 8 to 6 dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dollar store quality. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Very flimsy and who thought to put the sticker that is almost impossible to remove in the middle of the mirror?&lt;br /&gt;Will see how long it lasts.  Should have gone to the store and bought a decent one for the same money.</li>
            <li> This mirror does its job.  It is a bit flimsy but it is sturdy enough, especially for the price.  I have not dropped it yet so I cannot tell you how it holds up to trauma.  I use it to cut my own hair.  Messed it up last time and had to shave my head.  This was no fault of the mirror.  I told everyone at work my wife messed my hair up so things worked out.</li>
            <li> Lasted a couple of weeks before the mirror broke.  I don&#x27;t even remember that it dropped; just picked it up one day and the glass was cracked in half.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price. The mirror is clear and a good size. The handle is not very sturdy, but should be fine if the user is careful.</li>
            <li> The mirror is very inexpensive and the only real flaw it has is the plastic is a little flimsy. Perfect for what I need it for though.</li>
            <li> Great size,  great price.  I bought 3 (two for bathrooms one for a bedroom).  I was at the barber shop a few days ago and they use the same type of mirror.</li>
            <li> needed to be able to see the back of his head when he cut his hair. I bought two in case one broke, he likes it. I haven&#x27;t used it.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Nice big size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Do not seem well made.  I bought two of these mirrors less than a year ago and now both have broken.  On one, the glass broke when I set down a small hair dryer on the back of the mirror (the mirror was face down on a flat counter and the hair dryer was not set down roughly).  The second one just cracked through the middle for unknown reasons.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a mirror that I could use to see the back of my head when I do my hair (I have very long hair) and this was the perfect solution. It&#x27;s just big enough and fits nicely in my hand, but can be tucked sideways in a bin under my bathroom vanity. Great price, great product, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Cheap and flimsy.  It will brake for sure in a few days.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken, and as far as I can tell, no options for returning or replacing, next time I will just run to the store for a mirror :(</li>
            <li> The mirror distorts the image, you feel like you are in a funny house looking at yourself. It it also very flimsy and feels like the mirror will come out of the casing..Final conclusion: I bought it at $6, and it felt like it. Now that the price is up to $14, it&#x27;s just an even more expensive piece of Chinese trash.</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I found this while scrolling through Amazon.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a large mirror to hang on the bathroom wall across from the vanity mirror.  Now I can see the back of my hair without twisting around and angling to see.  it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy but does the trick.</li>
            <li> you get what you pay for.  Feels very flimsy.  Will probably break some day.  And leave me with 7 years of bad luck.  All because i didnt spend a few more dollars.</li>
            <li> It worked but I broke it the second day I had it.  That was two mirrors broken in two weeks, so I&#x27;m looking at 14 years of bad luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con was it was a little bit flimsy.</li>
            <li> Very large for a hand mirror, perfect for my needs. Enormous size makes seeing my back from a wall mounted mirror very easy.</li>
            <li> For the size and weight of the mirror, the handle should have been thicker and stronger.  I can see that someday, it will break at that point.</li>
            <li> This mirror arrived cracked with the outer plastic pealing apart.  Don&#x27;t waste your $ on this mirror, I&#x27;m sure there are much better on amazon!</li>
            <li> This thing&#x27;s made of cheap material. The plastic handle will bend back and forth when it&#x27;s held upright because of the weight of big piece of glass mirror. I can picture it break easily if some pressure is applied.</li>
            <li> Just call me Joe Tucker. The neighborhood sucker. I&#x27;m becoming too addicted to online shopping, proven by the fact that I paid $10 for a $2 hand mirror. I thought the mirror was bigger, but that&#x27;s my fault for not paying close enough attention to the specs. This is a make-up mirror and not a hair mirror. You can find it cheaper at any local beauty supply, dollar store, or if you must buy online SEARCH HAND MIRROR ON GOOGLE IMAGES &amp; FIND THE EXACT MIRROR CHEAPER ON EVERY OTHER SITE..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as for the quality... Well... What can I say. Its a plastic mirror. The handle is no more fragile than any other part of it. I don&#x27;t think it will break from normal use. However, its totally overpriced. I usually only purchase Amazon items that I have cross referenced locally &amp; online for price &amp; quality. This is my first &amp; last time swaying from that formula. I have learned my lesson. Gave it 2 stars because its advertised correctly. Its a hand mirror &amp; its black.</li>
            <li> We had a very similar (if not identical) mirror that I had for years.  Recently my husband dropped it and the mirror shattered, so I was in the market for a new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This looked very similar to what I had and the price was right so I gave it a try.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it was the exact mirror I replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always been happy with it.  I don&#x27;t use it too often but when I do need it I&#x27;m glad I have it.  I haven&#x27;t had it that long to comment on the durability but for a few bucks, I&#x27;m currently completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> The plastic is so flimsy that the mirror wiggles when you pick it up.  I do not expect it to last long.  Needless to say, it is very disappointing and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Arrived cracked. Didnt even bother to return</li>
            <li> mirror so large i can easily see the back of my head without turning around. i was worried about the build quality because one of the reviewers mentioned that the handle is weak at the junction point with the mirror frame. mine doesnt feel that way. instead the mirror is moving about inside the frame that holds it. but it still works so i am happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Flimsy. The glass part feels like it weighs more than the plastic. I&#x27;m sure this vendor is making a killing, selling this cheap product at such a ridiculous price. You can probably find this at the dollar store. Totally not worth the price. Go to Target and get the exact same style (Conair brand), but with sturdy plastic, for half the price.</li>
            <li> Title says it all.  Nice wide mirror, but the handle is a little flimsy and has trouble holding the mirror part up.  But for the cost, it does the job</li>
            <li> Mirror arrived broken.  Wasn&#x27;t even packaged with anything protective.  If you need a mirror like this, listen to other reviewers and save your money.... buy one at a beauty supply store as this was a waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> I am totally happy with this mirror.  It could easily sell for over twice the price in a store and it would still be a good mirror.  Nice and large with a good clear mirror.  I might buy another to keep at each home.</li>
            <li> opened the package and cracked -- my fault for thinking I could have a mirror shipped to me. Either that or it breaks easily. Not worth sending back.</li>
            <li> I ordered 6 of these mirrors in both the black and burgandy and use them for jewelry shows. These are nice and light when women are trying on different necklaces and earrings.</li>
            <li> I like the large size of the mirror.  My only concern is that the handle seems very flimsy and could break very easily.</li>
            <li> a little flimsy but gets the job done, as long as your not violent with it you&#x27;ll do just fine.</li>
            <li> A mirror is a mirror, and if you are in need in a large mirror, then go click the &#x27;purchase&#x27; button.</li>
            <li> While unwrapping this mirror, it fell onto the floor from a height of about 1.5 feet, and smashed into a dozen pieces.  :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned a similar mirror from Goody that I&#x27;ve had for many years, and that one has never broken, despite falling numerous times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> nothing wrong with the mirror, but the casing is made of very flimsy plastic, where it literally rocks back and forth when you hold it by the handle.  The likely hood of this product standing the test of time is low.  I&#x27;m pretty sure the handle will eventually break off the bottom of the mirror where it is weakest.  I personally would not buy again, or recommend to any friends.</li>
            <li> Was just as reviewed by others.  Weak handle but large mirror is what I was after. Attach a paint stick to stiffen the back side and it work great.</li>
            <li> The plastic handle is way too thin for the size of the mirror. Every time I pick it up, I feel like it is about to snap. I hasn&#x27;t so far, but I know that it&#x27;s just a matter of time before it does. The mirror is also of a poor quality. It seems that the image seen in it is slightly distorted and somehow smaller than it should be. I don&#x27;t use it that often - just to occasionally check out the back of my hairdo if I have curled my hair that day. When I bought it, it was just $5.47 and it barely felt worth that price, If I had paid the almost $13 price that it&#x27;s currently listed at, I would have returned it immediately.</li>
            <li> This is a very basic hand mirror, with a rather flimsy plastic frame and handle.  The handle snapped off after a couple months of light use, so I can&#x27;t recommend it. It wasn&#x27;t expensive, but I don&#x27;t feel it is worth even $8.98 for a couple months use.</li>
            <li> The quality of this mirror is one that I would have found at the $ store. Very Disapointed in the quality for the price.  The handle is cheap plastic, and the mirror its self is not magnified nor a good quality, plus the mirrow was so cheap it was broke, so this item was a total wast of money.</li>
            <li> This mirror should sell for 50c not $5.  It feels totally cheap and tacky.  The plastic is not rigid at all.  Avoid!</li>
            <li> I am makeup artist and always need to have mirrors with me. This is the perfect size. I recommend it,</li>
            <li> simply cheaply made. I added &#x27;crazy&#x27;  glue to make it usaeble. probably better to spend more on one better made for safety and quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good handheld mirror.  It does it job and does it well.  It&#x27;s not too heavy and great for self haircuts.</li>
            <li> This mirror works for the job that it was designed to do but it is very cheap. Feels like a Dollar store item</li>
            <li> Cheap flimsy mirror.  I should have gone to the drugstore for something this inexpensive and basic.  NOT Amazon quality.  I&#x27;m more disappointed in Amazon for carrying this junk and myself for falling for it than I am with the guys who produced it.</li>
            <li> was too good a price to pass, its one of amazons specials.  so im happy as i had low expectations.  the handle is a little flimsy and not solid like it looks in picture.</li>
            <li> arrived broken. seems like others have experienced the same. now i need to waste time doing returns, dropping it off, waiting for refund. buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a great mirror.  The plastic case isn&#x27;t so wonderful, but it serves the purpose.  It is large enough to check the back of your head in another mirror and light enough that it doesn&#x27;t tire you out lifting it.</li>
            <li> Light in weight &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li> Mirror, Mirror, On Da Wall, Whos Da Fairest, Of Dem All?</li>
            <li> The mirror is as the descriptions says.  It works good, but is not of the highest quality.  The plastic is a little cheap and the handle of the mirror is a little flimsy.  But hey, it works.</li>
            <li> I got this mirror because I wanted a larger one to use when cutting my hair with my new clippers.  Unlike some here, my mirror arrived without being broken or cracked, so I didn&#x27;t have to lower the rating because of that.  It seems fine to me for use when cutting my hair but perhaps the people who use it everyday find it more flimsy than I do.  The mirror itself doesn&#x27;t have any imperfections in it, so I am satisfied with it for my use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a mirror, what more do you want?  It&#x27;s a great mirror and works great for what I need it for!</li>
            <li> A couple months in, so far so good. Seems a bit flimsy in terms of manufacturing quality, but it has held up to date.</li>
            <li> Started cutting my own hair. Was in need of a hand mirror for trimming the back of my neck. This works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like how the handle, doesn&#x27;t really hold the mirror well, but will work for what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t even last in the mail. It broke in transit.Very dissappointed. Will be looking for another mirror that will last.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for one thing only, cutting hair, cutting my hair to be exact. This mirror is big enough for me to easily see the back of my head. The mirror is very clear, the frame is sturdy but the handle is very flimsy so be careful with the handle. Overall this is a great purchase for the price listed.</li>
            <li> This is the kind they use in barber shops and beauty parlors. I didn&#x27;t know I could own one until recently. What good fortune to get one.</li>
            <li> Quite a big mirror, just be careful, the handle is very flimsy and seems very prone to breaking if not held correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it gets the job done perfectly!</li>
            <li> Works great for me! Have a great size and good resolution! and very durable if you used right! good product!</li>
            <li> i feel like the handle will break the minute i pick it up. it was poorly made. the mirror part is way too heavy for the handle.</li>
            <li> We used this type of mirror in beauty school. They are great for seeing the sides and back of your head while in front of a larger mirror. Also a great makeup mirror if you dont need magnification. Great price and good size.</li>
            <li> not once but twice, broken the first time the re shipped it. broken a second time. all I can say is, they broke it, their severn years bad luck.</li>
            <li> I like to look at the back of my head before I go out. This mirror helps me do that.</li>
            <li> I like this - have had it for a couple of months now.  It is big, and lightweight, but the plastic in thin, flexes and will break if I am not careful with it.  I will try to get it to last and MIGHT buy another (if I can&#x27;t find anything better) It would be much better with a thicker frame.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need anything else to help with my morning duties; my hair looks good with the use of this mirror.</li>
            <li> When I look at it shows an identical image of me.  Sometimes I like what I see and other times, I do not.</li>
            <li> no image distortion, big enough to style my hair and the things are still together. the plastic base is flimsy and could break with slightest pressure</li>
            <li> I actually bought two of these. One after the other got broke. I know, 7 years. The construction of the mirror isn&#x27;t very durable. The plastic is very thin, and the handle is pretty flimsy. When I pick it up I make sure I get a couple of fingers under the mirror itself to brace the handle a little. It has a nice large mirror area and the quality of the reflection is good. But the main problem with it is the glass of the mirror is very thin. If you drop it even one time that sucker will shatter. I know because I dropped both of mine and that was all she wrote. Yes I can add, 14 years.</li>
            <li> Nice size. No distortion and very light weight. I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Jim A.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and easy to grab.  I love it.</li>
            <li> How does one review a mirror anyways?  I held it up to my face and it showed how I looked.</li>
            <li> the mirror itself is very thin.  The handle is so thin and flexible it doesn&#x27;t support the (meager) weight of the mirror.  Yes.  That&#x27;s right.  If you hold the mirror upright by the handle, it flops forward or backward and does not stand straight up.  Imagine there is a hinge where the handle connects to the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they put a sticker on the glass that is impossible to remove without leaving residue</li>
            <li> The mirror is great. The plastic is made of very cheap material. I would invest another dollar or two and get something more solid.</li>
            <li> The mirror arrived broken and there was no option for returning or exchanging it (other than paying $4.95 for postage -- hardly worth it), so the brand new mirror, shipping box and all went straight to the trash. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> The mirror is clear and large, and does what it needs to.  It is, however, made very cheaply.  The plastic handle wobbles from the weight of the mirror when picked up, the mirror itself shifts within the frame, and, frankly, I expect it to break down the road if I&#x27;m not extremely careful when moving it around.  This is definitely not the quality I was hoping for, but it does what it needs to, and it only cost 5 bucks.</li>
            <li> The mirror is fine. The handle is wobbly so it&#x27;s not a good choice for professional use but it does the job I needed it for.</li>
            <li> Its a mirror...It does its job and the only thing wrong with it that I can think of is that the glass mirror itself slides around inside the plastic frame which could lead to the mirror breaking.</li>
            <li> It is what it is and works great. A day after ordering this I found a store that sells it for a dollar more. Seams this one was built just a little bit better though. Im happy with it.</li>
            <li> Everything is perfect! Thank you very much! That is what I wanted! I will definitely enjoy using this item and I hope it is very useful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little blurry and scratched (as it came).  It&#x27;s also pretty flimsy.  It does a good enough job for as little as I use it, but don&#x27;t expect anything great.</li>
            <li> The very best hand mirror ever.  Flexible handle, large surface and just excellent feel.</li>
            <li> Good quality mirror. Great sturdy handle balance, and big size. You get what you pay for, a good buy... stay away from the knockoff Levi jeans!</li>
            <li> The mirror was fairly poor quality, which was fine by me based on the price. What I didn&#x27;t count on was not being able to remove the sticker on the front of the mirror. Tried Goo Be Gone with no luck so the mirror is useless.</li>
            <li> This mirror is nice, big, and very clear. It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the handle is too flimsy for the weight of the mirror. Granted, it&#x27;s a cheap hand mirror, but since the handle is so weak it makes it a bit floppy, which makes the reflection blurry. I have to hold it with part of my hand behind the mirror part if I want to keep it still. If the handle were sturdier it would be a 5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> Handle is too thin, weak to support the mirror, will let it flop over. Bought a similar, heavy duty frame in different colors from WalMart for less than $3.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror. To me it&#x27;s not flimsy at all and provides a great view of all angles in terms of the back of your head and sides.  In fact, I broke one (my fault) and lost one so I&#x27;m on my 3rd because I purchased the same product because I luv it. Fits great in travel bags, very flexible that way.</li>
            <li> The title says it all!  I would not feel comfortable using this product on a daily basis for fear of the handle breaking near where it attaches to the mirror.  I sent mine back &amp; of course amazon.com was completely pleasant to deal with in terms of processing the return (I called the day the package arrived).</li>
            <li> Cheap, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I am repulsed by my looks but am strangely drawn to my image.  I Constantly pick this up and stare at my hideousness and then I hear the voices.  It wasn&#x27;t always like this.  It has been a slow change over the months and I shattered many of these against the wall.  Good thing they are cheap and an add-on item.  Sometimes they don&#x27;t break and I save some money.  When I looked at myself a minute ago I wasn&#x27;t so repulsed.  That&#x27;s strange isn&#x27;t it?  I kind of like my greyish-green hue and my pearlish white belly.  I&#x27;m not so sure I like scales or  my bulging eyes.  Maybe it&#x27;s not so bad.  Is that you Loreli?  You want me to swim with you?  Maybe tomorrow.  I have to look at myself again.</li>
            <li> Mostly just using it for hair cutting and checking back side.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sturdy enough within reason so I&#x27;m not sure what the other comments about it being fragile was all about. Unless you like to toss things around and expect them to not break. But doing that to any glass object is kind of strange in the first place.</li>
            <li> It was broken in the box it came in ..... not worth the hassle to return !!!</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect for my hairdressing business as it is large enough for the customers to see the back of their heads and the price is very good too. I have dropped these before from about 5 ft and they were durable so added bonus.</li>
            <li> Large and nice for makeup.</li>
            <li> Yes, as others have said - it is cheaply made and flimsy.  But, look at the price you are paying - it is a cheap product - don&#x27;t expect expert craftsmanship, expect cheap, utilitarian.  And, that it is -it works, it actually reflects (a nice feature for a mirror) and it doesn&#x27;t disolve in your hand.  If you need an economical hand mirror - here it is.</li>
            <li> Very large and gives a good viewing angle.  Plastic is a bit thin for the weight, but it will work fine.  Just need to be careful using it and storing it properly to prevent damage to it.</li>
            <li> This mirror is great. A wonderful size and you can see in the large viewing area. Well work the money.</li>
            <li> Mirror is ok but not sturdy...poor design on handle, but it works as well as any mirror could.  This was simply an &amp;#34;add on&amp;#34; to meet the free shipping requirement of our order.</li>
            <li> Nice large hand mirror. Works very well. :)</li>
            <li> The mirror part is fine. Clear. Large. Reflects accurately w/o distortion.&lt;br /&gt;Would certainly be a great buy for some purposes as other reviews indicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beef is with the handle. It is too flimsy for the weight of the mirror. The picture shows what appeared to me to be a &#x27;3D&#x27; handle ... that had some thickness to it. In fact the handle is an extension of the back - a &#x27;rubbery&#x27; feeling soft kind of plastic. It is about 1/8\\&quot; thick with a 1/4\\&quot; thick ridge that runs around the edge for reinforcement. Not enough. When I pick up the mirror, I can feel it flexing like a hand fan. If I wiggle it a bit in my hand it flexes about 6 inches back and forth. If I simply hold it still horizontally, the top of the mirror flexes a full 1\\&quot; out of line with the handle under its own weight. For some, this may not be a problem. I prefer something more sturdy. Also, the mirror has a 1/4\\&quot; border of white that surrounds the face of the mirror. Makes no functional difference, but demonstrates for certain that what one gets is NOT what is pictured. So, +2 points for the mirror half being decent. And minus 2 points for the handle half being flimsy. And 1 point off for not being as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m returning the two I ordered.</li>
            <li> The mirror itself is nice and large, but the handle/casing is the problem. It&#x27;s very flimsy and floppy. It feels like a glass flyswatter. Granted, you&#x27;re not going to be fighting your way out of a bar with a hand mirror, but it does feel poorly made, so I took off one star....but it&#x27;s really cheap and does the job. It does have a really cool repeating pattern on the back that&#x27;s molded into the plastic. If you get one, flip it over and take a look.</li>
            <li> Light, and solid enough to use for my biweekly self-haircut. Works.</li>
            <li> Works great for giving myself haircuts. Large enough to see around me entire head.</li>
            <li> This mirror is definitely the size of a Salon mirror.  The biggest problem I have is the fact it is not made as a professional Salon Mirror.  The frame surrounding the mirror is too fragile, to the point when you are picking it up you can fill the weight of the mirror wobble.  My opinion is that the frame and handle should be strengthen and then it would be an excellent large mirror for home use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Link:  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00027YZKM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;JDS</li>
            <li> Not very good quality. It&#x27;s very flimsy and cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a big hand-held mirror.  I am glad that it is lightweight and you have a very good field of vision with it.  It was a great buy.</li>
            <li> This mirror is huge, but feels flimsy, as though it might fall out of the plastic covering if I shake it too much. It&#x27;s good for the price, but I wouldn&#x27;t use this as my only mirror.</li>
