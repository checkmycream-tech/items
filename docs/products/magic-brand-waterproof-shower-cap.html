            <li>win, Maya Beauty!</li>
            <li>love it thank u just what i was looking for perfect.</li>
            <li>My granny is thrilled!</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>BETTER TO BUY ONE IN PERSON AND BE ABLE TO RETURN IT WITHOUT ALL</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to put my hair in a clip and/or a pony tail</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d cost me more than that to return it.</li>
            <li>In return, I&#x27;ll be sure never to do business with you again, and will advise others here on Amazon to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyways, I gave it three stars since it protects my hair from water, though the fit could have been better.</li>
            <li>so I thought it might break easily but still going strong.</li>
            <li>This is a nice shower cap and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>The photo of the cap looks as though it will fit and can stretch to accomodate</li>
            <li>cheap piece of plastic.  </li>
            <li>let alone the original purchase price, so</li>
            <li>refund policy is:  it will cost you more to get a refund than the item cost in the first place.  </li>
            <li>This would be great for women with long hair, since this large size accommodates those with lots of hair.</li>
            <li>i needed to get a new shower cap because i got my hair braided in full length micro individuals and well....</li>
            <li>I ordered a magic water proof shower cap with elastic band extra large.  </li>
            <li>FUSS.[[ASIN:B002LOVYMQ Magic Water Proof Shower Cap with Elastic Band Large Hot Pink]]</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not even large.</li>
            <li>I use this shower cap to protect my wrapped up hair, and it certainly does the trick.</li>
            <li>this very help ful.</li>
            <li>The picture on the cap is very misleading.  </li>
            <li>Thanks  Peace</li>
            <li>I have long dreads and I cannot fit my hair under this cap.</li>
            <li>Anyways, it&#x27;s large and protects all of my natural hair from any water.</li>
            <li>I was able to get my medium long locs and had plenty of space left</li>
            <li>my hair is super long.</li>
            <li>If you have big hair, medium - large locs or braids...</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is not too soft as some out there.</li>
            <li>co. surprised amazon would do business with them</li>
            <li>I saw the picture of a large, PINK shower cap - and needed a large, PINK shower cap - so ordered it.</li>
            <li>No reason to throw good money after bad.</li>

            <li> just the rightn size.. wanted pink, but got white instead, but not that big a deal for me...</li>
            <li> This shower cap is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> You also get a white cap instead of the pink one shown in the package.  </li>
            <li> I expected this shower cap to be much larger than it was.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s certainly not made for black women that wear there hair naturally.</li>
            <li> It came and it was black and not all that big.  </li>
            <li> and my hair was dry after swimming!!</li>
            <li> Not only is it a truly poor quality product, but I received a different color than I ordered.</li>
            <li> I ordered a pink one and got a black one</li>
            <li> Although it states jumbo, it the bonnet could be a little bigger, the elastic is a little tight.  </li>
            <li> not worth 2 cents.  </li>

            <li> but it is not true.  </li>
            <li> dosent get wet when showering!!!</li>
            <li> A little thin</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s made of thick, durable plastic and does its job.</li>
            <li> rip-off</li>
            <li> What is very disappointing is that the cap does not fit.  </li>
            <li> You can keep my measly $2 ($4, with shipping.)</li>

            <li> love it thank u just what i was looking for perfect. i needed someting keep my hiar up after i was it my hair is super long. this very help ful.</li>
            <li> This shower cap is a complete waste of money. It&#x27;s not even large. There&#x27;s a black face on the front... well, it&#x27;s certainly not made for black women that wear there hair naturally. I have long dreads and I cannot fit my hair under this cap. The world just completely skips over black women who do not straighten their hair...</li>
            <li> This shower cap was very disappointing.  The picture on the cap is very misleading.  You also get a white cap instead of the pink one shown in the package.  What is very disappointing is that the cap does not fit.  The photo of the cap looks as though it will fit and can stretch to accomodate but it is not true.  Rather than return it and pay for shipping once again, I THREW IT AWAY.  I WILL NEVER BUY A SHOWER CAP ON LINE AGAIN.  BETTER TO BUY ONE IN PERSON AND BE ABLE TO RETURN IT WITHOUT ALL THE FUSS.[[ASIN:B002LOVYMQ Magic Water Proof Shower Cap with Elastic Band Large Hot Pink]]</li>
            <li> A little thin so I thought it might break easily but still going strong. I&#x27;m able to put my hair in a clip and/or a pony tail and it all fits. Good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice shower cap and it works pretty well. I like the fact that it is not too soft as some out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok-but really not very big if you have a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also the elastic doesn&#x27;t hold up.</li>
            <li> If you have big hair, medium - large locs or braids... This is the cap for you!! I was able to get my medium long locs and had plenty of space left and my hair was dry after swimming!!</li>
            <li> I ordered a magic water proof shower cap with elastic band extra large.  It came and it was black and not all that big.  I couldn&#x27;t get it on with curlers underneath.  Not what I ordered!</li>
            <li> Although it states jumbo, it the bonnet could be a little bigger, the elastic is a little tight.  Thanks  Peace</li>
            <li> So I probably could have used a smaller size shower cap but I decided not to try to exchange it for a smaller size or buy one of a smaller size. Anyways, it&#x27;s large and protects all of my natural hair from any water. I don&#x27;t like how the fringe from the band covers/blocks my eyes whenever I use it. I use this shower cap to protect my wrapped up hair, and it certainly does the trick. I gave it three stars since I don&#x27;t like how the front fits since it blocks/covers my eyes whenever I wear it. I do like the size of the cap which can allow several scarves underneath. This cap does not protect my hair when I use a larger scarf since the cloth around the edges of my face get wet and aren&#x27;t protected by the shower cap, however I can just not use this larger scarves to protect my natural hair. Anyways, I gave it three stars since it protects my hair from water, though the fit could have been better. This would be great for women with long hair, since this large size accommodates those with lots of hair.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.. just the rightn size.. wanted pink, but got white instead, but not that big a deal for me...</li>
            <li> I expected this shower cap to be much larger than it was. That said, it&#x27;s made of thick, durable plastic and does its job.</li>
            <li> I saw the picture of a large, PINK shower cap - and needed a large, PINK shower cap - so ordered it. When it arrived, I saw that I had been sent a BLACK shower cap. Going back online, I noticed that this cap comes in different colors - and there was no opportunity to choose the color. Disappointed with the color, I haven&#x27;t taken it out of the container it arrived in.</li>
            <li> Terrible product! Not only is it a truly poor quality product, but I received a different color than I ordered. After being given the runaround for a week by Maya Beautyâ€”for a $1.99 item, mind you!â€” they finally agreed to the return the wrong item, but only if I pay for the return. All this for a $2 item! It&#x27;d cost me more than that to return it. No reason to throw good money after bad. I have no confidence they would ever refund the return shipping, let alone the original purchase price, so I&#x27;m not going to bother with the return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You win, Maya Beauty! You can keep my measly $2 ($4, with shipping.) In return, I&#x27;ll be sure never to do business with you again, and will advise others here on Amazon to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor. Buy a different product, from a different seller.&lt;br /&gt;I have now purchased the Spa Sister Bouffant Shower Cap from Beauty Encounter. It arrived promptly, and was as described. My granny is thrilled!</li>
            <li> i needed to get a new shower cap because i got my hair braided in full length micro individuals and well.... thats alot of hair. hold it all up there and its made from a durable material. would recommend</li>
            <li> I ordered a pink one and got a black one</li>
            <li> did not meet expectations.  cheap piece of plastic.  not worth 2 cents.  refund policy is:  it will cost you more to get a refund than the item cost in the first place.  rip-off co. surprised amazon would do business with them</li>
            <li> I like this shower cap its big enuff for my head and vig enuff for when I have rollers in my hair and my hair dosent get wet when showering!!!</li>
