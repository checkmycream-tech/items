            <li>Delivered early, safely packaged and it&#x27;s honestly the best perfume i&#x27;ve ever had!</li>
            <li>I saw another review that said to make sure you look for &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; in the name, because some bottles don&#x27;t say &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; and aren&#x27;t quite up to par.  </li>
            <li>It is one of my favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>Perfume light and fragrant!  </li>
            <li>im thinking of getting more of this pairs Hilton perfume.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>Favorite perfume couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>An exquisite and lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love alos the price</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE HOW IT SMELLS WITH MY BODY CHEMISTRY.</li>
            <li>This scent is absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>This Paris Hilton Women Eau De Toilette Spray was for a gift for my wife, and she love it.</li>
            <li>I still love this scent...</li>
            <li>but she has lovely fragrances</li>
            <li>and this is probably one of my most favorite perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve searched many sites, but can&#x27;t find detailed and reliable information on the formula, but I&#x27;m going to suggest that the pheromones are indeed missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, it&#x27;s brand new and authentic :)</li>
            <li>She raved about it--said it was, so far, her most favorite perfume ever!  </li>
            <li>Medium to light fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I bought it for the first time about 10 years ago and am glad I purchased it again.</li>
            <li>as I&#x27;ve wearing the original since it was launched I could immediately spot the difference between the two fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>know that the original&#x27;s formula contains synthetic pheromones</li>
            <li>Quick tip, make sure when you buy this you get the right one.  </li>
            <li>The original is good too, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to Sheer in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>most of all it was original and the fraganze stays on for the whole day</li>
            <li>and I am going to buy another one right now!</li>
            <li>thanks all correct and estimated time buenisimo continue this way I hope to continue in this way for us to be satisfied</li>
            <li>Arrived early and nice size bottle</li>
            <li>HILTON SHEER is very versatile and is refreshing in warmer weather, yet also warm and comforting in cooler weather, so it&#x27;s great to wear all year round and for any occasion.</li>
            <li>apple is noticable right off the bat here; it&#x27;s much more apparent then in the original.</li>
            <li>It is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Worth the price though</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that fresh scent I was expecting.</li>
            <li>do love the original and will go back to it when this becomes unavailable</li>
            <li>do love the original and will go back to it when this becomes unavailable</li>
            <li>I was more than excited when I found this sized bottle at such a discounted price.</li>
            <li>other then that its good</li>
            <li>And such a great price, much better than paying 45$ at other stores!!</li>
            <li>My wife loves it very much.</li>
            <li>That pleases me very much.</li>
            <li>So, I made sure this one said sheer.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume, wish I had gotten a larger bottle.</li>
            <li>i didnt rate it a 5 because i didnt get it the first time</li>
            <li>Ahh, the memories flood in from my teen years, and yet I still love it.</li>
            <li>i love the paris hilton sheer for women ..</li>
            <li>only paris hilton I love to buy</li>
            <li>Shipping was supper fast!</li>
            <li>THE RIGHT CONTAINER IS A HIGH QUALITY PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>The jasmine in particular is more toned down, so this fragrance isn&#x27;t as sweet as the original.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I previously owned the Paris Hilton mist in this same design bottle and t smelled really great</li>
            <li>i get very exited when i got this product</li>
            <li>It came the day i expected it to come, i love this perfume, and</li>
            <li>br /&gt;excellent item and fast shipping</li>
            <li>it got here really fast</li>
            <li>Smooth smell, light not strong my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>Ive bought this perfume countless times and I love the way it smells, but this particular one smells old.</li>
            <li>My daughter is an adult and very choosy, and I mailed her this perfume based on the 5-star rating.  </li>
            <li>I love it last long for me.</li>
            <li>not sure how you make muguet sparkle, but I am reminded of sparkling spring water in the way that the floral notes are much milder, but still lively and energetic.</li>
            <li>The Sheer version is very similar to the original.  </li>
            <li>I actually tried purchasing Sheer in a department store and wound up getting the original.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love this, I would definitely purchase this scent again.</li>
            <li>The musk is another key scent note that has been stripped right down, so it is only a light</li>
            <li>and it was too much, and definitely lasted all day.  </li>
            <li>I have worn this perfume since my early 20s (10 years).</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t last the whole day.</li>
            <li>PARIS HILTON SHEER was created using the same key scent notes as the original, but the concentration of the ingredients has been altered.</li>
            <li>The lighter musk and florals allow the other scent notes to fully develop, making it richer and more complex.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Scent notes: Apple, Wet Ozone, Sparkling Muguet, Freesia, Mimosa, Jasmine, Skin Musk, Sandalwood and Ylang Ylang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> excellent product I recommend</li>
            <li> My daughter is an adult and very choosy, and I mailed her this perfume based on the 5-star rating.  She raved about it--said it was, so far, her most favorite perfume ever!  (And she usually doesn&#x27;t wear inexpensive perfume.) She said she applied 2-3 squirts and it was too much, and definitely lasted all day.  She said in the future, she would just spray it once. I saw another review that said to make sure you look for &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; in the name, because some bottles don&#x27;t say &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; and aren&#x27;t quite up to par.  So, I made sure this one said sheer.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume, wish I had gotten a larger bottle.</li>
            <li> Gift for my daughter. She loved it.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent and received fast!!</li>
            <li> I love this scent! I bought it for the first time about 10 years ago and am glad I purchased it again.</li>
            <li> i get very exited when i got this product but after i open and try i was very disappointed it just smell very bad like the perfum was out of date, both of then ..!!!!</li>
            <li> Not a very good size for the money</li>
            <li> My daughter glamor this fragrance. It really is very happy.</li>
            <li> PARIS HILTON SHEER was created using the same key scent notes as the original, but the concentration of the ingredients has been altered. If you&#x27;re a casual wearer of the original I doubt you&#x27;ll notice the difference, but as I&#x27;ve wearing the original since it was launched I could immediately spot the difference between the two fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The apple is noticable right off the bat here; it&#x27;s much more apparent then in the original. The fragrance also seems charged - like the smell in the air just before a thunderstorm. I can&#x27;t describe the scent, but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the ozone accord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how you make muguet sparkle, but I am reminded of sparkling spring water in the way that the floral notes are much milder, but still lively and energetic. The jasmine in particular is more toned down, so this fragrance isn&#x27;t as sweet as the original.&lt;br /&gt;The base is quite close to the skin, so I can only detect a slight hint of sandalwood and musk. The musk is another key scent note that has been stripped right down, so it is only a light hint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that the original&#x27;s formula contains synthetic pheromones, so I&#x27;m wondering if they&#x27;ve been left out of the SHEER edition, since this formula is a lot lighter. I&#x27;ve searched many sites, but can&#x27;t find detailed and reliable information on the formula, but I&#x27;m going to suggest that the pheromones are indeed missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent notes: Apple, Wet Ozone, Sparkling Muguet, Freesia, Mimosa, Jasmine, Skin Musk, Sandalwood and Ylang Ylang.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARIS HILTON SHEER is very versatile and is refreshing in warmer weather, yet also warm and comforting in cooler weather, so it&#x27;s great to wear all year round and for any occasion. The musk in the original can cause headaches in hotter weather, but I&#x27;ve never experienced any problems with this one. Even though this is a deliberately lighter edition, you&#x27;ll set get 5/6 wear out of it, it just goes close to the skin after around 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the original and will go back to it when this becomes unavailable [it&#x27;s a limited edition], but whilst I can pick between the 2 I&#x27;d go for this. The lighter musk and florals allow the other scent notes to fully develop, making it richer and more complex. Some people are automatically put of by the Paris Hilton name on the bottle - but, hey; if it smells nice, then who cares?around 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do love the original and will go back to it when this becomes unavailable [it&#x27;s a limited edition], but whilst I can pick between the 2 I&#x27;d go for this.

            <li> This smells wonderful.  I love it!  It is one of my favorite perfumes.  Quick tip, make sure when you buy this you get the right one.  The Sheer version is very similar to the original.  I actually tried purchasing Sheer in a department store and wound up getting the original.  The original is good too, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to Sheer in my opinion.  The packaging is the same too, so be careful when trying to purchase Sheer.</li>
            <li> Perfume light and fragrant!  And speedy delivery!</li>

            <li> Ive bought this perfume countless times and I love the way it smells, but this particular one smells old. It doesn&#x27;t have that fresh scent I was expecting. It&#x27;s a little disappointing.</li>

            <li> all thoroughly recommend</li>
            <li> I could never figure out how someone can wear the same perfume for years but after using this i totally understand bc this is an amazing scent and i get tons of compliments. I like most of her perfumes!!</li>
            <li> Excellent, would recommend</li>
            <li> excellent item and good seller</li>
            <li> LOVVVVE THIS PERFUME ONE OF MY FAVORITES</li>
            <li> I previously owned the Paris Hilton mist in this same design bottle and t smelled really great so I decided to get this as well. Though it was listed as Prime, there were issues and it took a few extra days to arrive (but amazon explained to me). This scent is absolutely adorable. I have trouble with ,y sinus and I can tolerate this so it&#x27;s not very strong either. I did not notice however, that I was getting such a small thing! I was disappointed when I saw the size, its a little thing. Other than that I love this, I would definitely purchase this scent again. I will update my  review as to whether or not the scent is lasting etc.</li>
            <li> â™¥ it was a great buy i love the paris hilton sheer for women ..it smell wonderfull it got here really fast</li>

            <li> I still love this scent...i Cant stand Paris hilton but she has lovely fragrances and this is probably one of my most favorite perfumes.  It smells great for being so cheap.  It doesn&#x27;t last long on your skin, I usually spray my clothes anyway and you can smell it the next day.</li>
            <li> I love it last long for me. And reminds me of my mom</li>
            <li> It is not what expected. I will not wear or use it.</li>
