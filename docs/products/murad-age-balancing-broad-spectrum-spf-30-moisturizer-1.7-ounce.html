            <li> Been using Murad for 30+ years and love the product. I don&#x27;t look my age at 72, No lines or wrinkles. I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon. Living in the desert, my skincare was very important. The savings at Amazon allows me to get additional treatments.</li>
            <li> this product has a SPF30. This is wonderful. Good for sensitive skin. Dr. recommended it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works well for winter time skin. I am in my sixties and this makes my skin supple and soft.&lt;br /&gt;Besides it was 45 dollars cheaper than Sephora..</li>
            <li> I was used to purchasing the Murad Resurgence  Sheer Lustre Day Moisturizer but sadly the item has been discontinued (according to Ulta). So I purchased this instead. I like it. It is a thicker consistency than the sheer lustre but still creamy and it seems to soak into the skin better. It is lightweight and the SPF is higher.</li>

I have good genes, but I swear by these products.</li>
