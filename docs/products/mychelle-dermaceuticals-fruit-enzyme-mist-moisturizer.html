            <li>Best moisturizing fruit enzyme mist on the market.</li>
            <li>I got this because of the great reviews on what a wonderful glow</li>
            <li>All MyChelle products are excellent but this mist is a perfect and refreshing finish before the moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>I use a regimen of mychelle products and im happy with the result.</li>
            <li>am loving this skin care line!</li>
            <li>Anyway, my point is that this toner has neat moisturizing properties in addition to smelling incredible, so I&#x27;ve been able to somewhat break my moisturizer at night routine and my skin feels great in the morning.</li>
            <li>Good to know no chemicals.</li>
            <li>Like a child&#x27;s skin, or the way a celebrities skin shines, in the good way.  </li>
            <li>But Mychelle Fruit enzyme mist is good for us  </li>
            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>Smells great, feels so refreshing.</li>
            <li>This is a good toner, but I ended up making my own from spring or mineral water (4oz.)</li>
            <li>I really love how this stuff smells!</li>
            <li>a healthy, bright look to skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tropical skin smoother exfoliates nicely if your skin is on the dryer side and the cranberry mud mask works well for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Mychelle has been great for my skin and is worth the expense!</li>
            <li>Good at hydrating and Easy to use   pump</li>
            <li>Also great as a spritzer on hot, sweaty days.</li>
            <li>This mist is cool on the face and feels good.</li>
            <li>I love this company.</li>
            <li>This spray is so soothing and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>Also use on no make up days to give that refreshing hydrated skin feeling, and look.</li>
            <li>recently purchased the MyChelle Sampler and im like a child on Christmas morning trying out all these wonderful, soothing creams and cleansers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They feel so healthy and</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this; it works well to leave my skin hydrated and smells</li>
            <li>many of them contain Parabens and petrochemicals...</li>
            <li>I love the Fruit Enzyme Mist.  </li>
            <li>This is the favorite mist to us (me &amp; my huuby)  </li>
            <li>I suppose there&#x27;s more nutrients in this</li>
            <li>but my face feels better with the Mario Badescu spray.  </li>
            <li>I still feel more moisturized after using this than before.</li>
            <li>It feels very refreshing on my skin and gives it a pretty glow!</li>
            <li>I attribute acne clearing up primarily to the serums, but this mist gives a really nice glow, great facial moisture after drying cleansers and serums, some cleansing/tightening of pores, and calming/fading of hyperpigmentation/</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to spritz some on my face on a hot day.</li>
            <li>It is great to use alone any time, but I like mixing it with a moisturizer because it makes one step out of two as well as thinning the moisturizers just enough so that they glide on smoothly and evenly.  </li>
            <li>, I stay fresh faced all throughout &#x27;most&#x27; flights.  </li>
            <li>Here at amazon you can get it at 22% discount and free shipping as well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I will even spritz it lightly over makeup just to refresh my skin.  </li>
            <li>instructions say that you should mist your face while holding the pump 12&amp;#34; from your face, but I instead use this like a traditional toner--applying it to a cotton pad, and I&#x27;m always amazed at how much is removed from &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; skin after I&#x27;ve washed with the Mychelle fruit enzyme scrub (which is delightful, btw), or whatever face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This one is better than average but doesn&#x27;t surpass my favorite Mario Badescu rose water spray.  </li>
            <li>This left a bit of sticky residue on my face and seemed like a needed a good bit of it to fully tone my face.  </li>
            <li>I also used it on sunburn recently with good results.</li>
            <li>Love the whole</li>
            <li>I use this stuff every day, it makes my face feel so fresh and clean and helps close up my pores after washing.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying samples of MyChelle to make sure its compatible with your skin type.  </li>
            <li>Like this one very much!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel that it was particularly moisturizing; I honestly don&#x27;t think it is doing much.</li>
            <li>I also occasionally use the fruit fiesta peel (with lactic acid to support youthful collagen, the label says) or the incredible pumpkin peel (enzymatic ally rich therapy for deep stimulation &amp; detoxification, for combination skin, the label says).</li>
            <li>This is  my new favorite beauty company.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try an all natural animal friendly product, and MyChelle fit the description.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin look dewy and fresh in even the coldest, driest weather and has never irritated my super-sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have many allergies and my hubby has really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This stuff is especially good spritzed over powdered mineral makeup, which can look a little dry and settle into fine lines.    </li>
            <li>The mist was too strong so rather than getting an even spray over the entire face, I&#x27;d get strong mists on concentrated areas of where i hold the spray from.</li>
            <li>Spritz it right on your face every morning after using a Mychelle serum.</li>
            <li>I have used daily after washing my face but have also used it after a sunburn to sooth and cool my skin and my favorite use is after a acid peel.</li>
            <li>of works like a super gentle toner plus moisturizer&lt;br</li>
            <li>So much cheaper, and works just as well!</li>
            <li>I purchased the sample box before unloading a larger investment, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using the products, I noticed a change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have quit using the products after the first warning signs.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to look for and purchase the smaller 2.1oz bottle if you intend to use it as I do for air travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and when I finally started researching ingredients in most of todays drugstore and even highend skincare lines-</li>
            <li>Also, the spray is pretty explosive</li>
            <li>I had been using a glycolic spray for years and was able to mist my entire face, which of course, inevitably includes the lips, and it was fine, even on my lips.</li>
            <li>I think this might work much better for someone with dry skin, but for those with oily skin this might exacerbate your problems.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is equally refreshing in dry and humid weather.  </li>
            <li>This toner, in combination with the other Mychelle products, has left my skin beautiful, clear, and youthful.</li>
            <li>I only use toners in mist form because a cotton pad or ball is so incredibly wasteful and not nearly as effective an application.</li>
            <li>It became more rough and itchy.  </li>
            <li>Oh yea, I bought it for $12.69 at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>I like knowing that the Fruit Enzymes are gently exfoliating during the days I go makeup</li>
            <li>and they all work very well for my skin.</li>
            <li>I found this product at the Whole Foods store.</li>
            <li>so we had many troubles with other brands  </li>
            <li>It really helps in applying other products (e.g., sunbock) and in keeping my skin from becoming irritated by the climate.</li>
            <li>Staying hydrated by drinking water (instead of adult beverages ;) in flight will also help some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay, not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>nice!&lt;br /&gt;-awesome scent - citrus, slightly sweet, not too overpowering (especially for something that goes on your face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this spray, I use a few products from this line and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is really refreshing to spray on your skin in any climate, but almost an essential product if you live in a dry climate like CO.  </li>
            <li>After rinsing off the peel from my face my skin feels raw and burned and after I spray this on it feels SO much better.</li>
            <li>I have been using My Chelle for 9 months and already see a difference in my 56 yr old face!</li>
            <li>I am a natural products junkie, trying almost everything for my super sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I just thought it was my skin needing time to get use to the new product, so I gave it a full week and a half.  </li>
            <li>Just a company created out of concern and determination to make a quality all natural product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for natural products to help my oily skin with acne.</li>
            <li>I got some samples of Mychelle at my natural foods market and am hooked.</li>
            <li>I wanted to switch to natural products, anyway.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive and acne prone skin - this product has not caused me to break out.  </li>
            <li>I have dealt with skin care issues (adult acne) for years</li>
            <li>I use the whole MyChelle cleansing regime and have been for several years.</li>
            <li>Very hydrating facial mist.  </li>
            <li>Was having a major problem with adult acne flare-ups, but I also have very sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li>Then later, my face broke out in many small pimples, I&#x27;m assuming it must have clogged my pores.</li>
            <li>By the end of a flight any makeup I&#x27;ve previously applied looks crepey, pores look huge and my skin looks oily and ashy at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I use this after the fruit enzyme cleanser and before the deep repair cream and have noticed significant improvements in moisture and less breakouts.</li>
            <li>My face feels so dry after a gentle wash and just a couple spritzes will give it all the hydration it needs.  </li>
            <li>This spray mist is very soothing after cleansing and for when my face feels dry or irritated.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and lasts a long time because you just spray a little and it works.</li>
            <li>I use this in conjunction with the White Cranberry Cleanser, Clear Skin Serum, and Oil-Free Grapefruit Moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Side effects are present even in all natural products.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up just a bit of bare minerals to even out skin tone.   </li>
            <li>I was very disappointed that my local Whole Foods is carrying a new formula of the Fruit enzyme mist and am very pleased to see that Amazon seems to have the old formula in stock here.  </li>
            <li>I found that the important part is misting regularly and long &#x27;before&#x27; you reach &#x27;icky flight skin&#x27; status.  </li>
            <li>The clear skin serum has saved my skin from breakouts and the clear skin spot treatment takes care of little blemishes.</li>

            <li> I have dealt with skin care issues (adult acne) for years</li>
            <li> I use the whole MyChelle cleansing regime and have been for several years.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating facial mist.  </li>
            <li> Was having a major problem with adult acne flare-ups, but I also have very sensitive skin and eczema.</li>
            <li> Then later, my face broke out in many small pimples, I&#x27;m assuming it must have clogged my pores.</li>
            <li> By the end of a flight any makeup I&#x27;ve previously applied looks crepey, pores look huge and my skin looks oily and ashy at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I use this after the fruit enzyme cleanser and before the deep repair cream and have noticed significant improvements in moisture and less breakouts.</li>
            <li> My face feels so dry after a gentle wash and just a couple spritzes will give it all the hydration it needs.  </li>
            <li> This spray mist is very soothing after cleansing and for when my face feels dry or irritated.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and lasts a long time because you just spray a little and it works.</li>
            <li> I use this in conjunction with the White Cranberry Cleanser, Clear Skin Serum, and Oil-Free Grapefruit Moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Side effects are present even in all natural products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up just a bit of bare minerals to even out skin tone.   </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed that my local Whole Foods is carrying a new formula of the Fruit enzyme mist and am very pleased to see that Amazon seems to have the old formula in stock here.  </li>
            <li> I found that the important part is misting regularly and long &#x27;before&#x27; you reach &#x27;icky flight skin&#x27; status.  </li>
            <li> The clear skin serum has saved my skin from breakouts and the clear skin spot treatment takes care of little blemishes.</li>
            <li> They obviously take skin care very seriously and make fine products.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing MyChelle products again, as well as other natural beauty</li>
            <li> Plus you can save a little money by using less since it is actually going on your face and not on your clothes and in your hair. ; )</li>
            <li> Not natural at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t really spray on &#x27;sticky&#x27; as another reviewer described but &#x27;thick&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just plain water mists in the past without much success, with MyChelle</li>
            <li> This stuff tastes gross - very bitter.  </li>
            <li> I switched to Mychelle when my 30-some combination skin could no longer tolerate Proactive, and became excessively dry.</li>
            <li> I know longer have dry patches of skin.</li>
            <li> Humidity is low where I live and wind and sunshine are common, so this mist is a godsend!  </li>
            <li> so you have to use a light hand or you will be blasted and dripping with product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Btw - close your eyes when spraying and careful not to lick your lips afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I now have small, red, itchy bumps all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I tried two other MyChelle mists and didn&#x27;t like them.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and other MyChelle products for years.</li>
            <li> but in truth it never absorbed.</li>
            <li> I carry a small container in my purse when traveling on airplanes along side my toothbrush and the two keep me going on long hauls.</li>
            <li> I figured it would go away in a few days after I stopped using the products, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Once it dries completely, you will not feel as if there was anything on your face (no film or weird tack).  </li>
            <li> I like that they are not a huge cosmetic company with all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> You can use this over your makeup or on plain skin.  </li>
            <li> This suggestion was extremely hard for me because I&#x27;m addicted to face cream (like its the one thing that I would take with me if I was left on a deserted island kinda thing).</li>
            <li> I use this at least twice a day after washing my face.  </li>
            <li> The smell and taste of this product, if it gets on your lips, is not good</li>
            <li> and I just hate what dry airplane air does to my skin.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the awful taste, it leaves my skin soft and is not sticky or tacky - a must for mineral makeup application - so for that I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> This was just a bad product for me all around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Every product in the sampler that I have tried has not clogged my pores, irritated my skin, or had any bad effects.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I buy products from mychelle, I am charged, but until now not sent this products and never reply to my emails and facebook messages, too bad, I will never buy mychelle products again.</li>
            <li> bad</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this mist tastes just awful when it gets on the lips, which it will</li>
            <li> I was shocked to find out what was in them!</li>
            <li> something about this made my skin itch terribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this because of the great reviews on what a wonderful glow this gives your face. Well, the glow didn&#x27;t work for me at all. The mist was too strong so rather than getting an even spray over the entire face, I&#x27;d get strong mists on concentrated areas of where i hold the spray from. Afterwards, it&#x27;s like my face turns into a flashlight- waaaaayyyyyyyyyyy too glowy. Not natural at all. I always end up putting lots of powder over.</li>
            <li> This left a bit of sticky residue on my face and seemed like a needed a good bit of it to fully tone my face.  I&#x27;m not sold.</li>
            <li> I love this company. They obviously take skin care very seriously and make fine products. I like that they are not a huge cosmetic company with all the bells and whistles. Just a company created out of concern and determination to make a quality all natural product.</li>
            <li> This is a good toner, but I ended up making my own from spring or mineral water (4oz.) and 5 drops of organic lavender essential oil. So much cheaper, and works just as well! But if you want ready-made toner, this mist is great!</li>
            <li> Since I found Mychelle&#x27;s products it is all I use.  All the products work well.  Good to know no chemicals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for natural products to help my oily skin with acne. This mist came with the trial kit for oily/blemish control MyChelle products. Immediately after using this mist, my face felt sticky. I thought maybe this would go away but in truth it never absorbed. Then later, my face broke out in many small pimples, I&#x27;m assuming it must have clogged my pores. Not only that, but something about this made my skin itch terribly. This was just a bad product for me all around. I think this might work much better for someone with dry skin, but for those with oily skin this might exacerbate your problems.</li>
            <li> After washing my face I spray this stuff on.  Oh my goodness, my face DRINKS this stuff in - I didn&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s so thirsty! This spray is so soothing and refreshing.  My face feels so dry after a gentle wash and just a couple spritzes will give it all the hydration it needs.  After the spray, I moisturize with Mychelle&#x27;s supreme polypeptide cream and I&#x27;m out the door!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try an all natural animal friendly product, and MyChelle fit the description.  I purchased the sample box before unloading a larger investment, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  When I first started using the products, I noticed a change in my skin.  It became more rough and itchy.  I just thought it was my skin needing time to get use to the new product, so I gave it a full week and a half.  I wish I would have quit using the products after the first warning signs.  My face broke out in what appeared to be a rash covering my cheeks, chin, and neck.  I figured it would go away in a few days after I stopped using the products, but it didn&#x27;t.  I now have small, red, itchy bumps all over my face.  I have never had acne, but I now know what it feels like.  I highly recommend trying samples of MyChelle to make sure its compatible with your skin type.  I&#x27;m not going to discredit the brand by saying don&#x27;t buy it, but you should definitely be warned that these products are not for everyone.  Side effects are present even in all natural products.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up just a bit of bare minerals to even out skin tone.   I spray this on after and it gives my skin a glowing dewy effect. Like a child&#x27;s skin, or the way a celebrities skin shines, in the good way.  Also use on no make up days to give that refreshing hydrated skin feeling, and look. Amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this spray, I use a few products from this line and this is by far my favorite. I have used daily after washing my face but have also used it after a sunburn to sooth and cool my skin and my favorite use is after a acid peel. After rinsing off the peel from my face my skin feels raw and burned and after I spray this on it feels SO much better.</li>
            <li> If you havent tried MyChelles products, you MUST.&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased the MyChelle Sampler and im like a child on Christmas morning trying out all these wonderful, soothing creams and cleansers.&lt;br /&gt;Every product in the sampler that I have tried has not clogged my pores, irritated my skin, or had any bad effects.&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this skin care line! I will be purchasing MyChelle products again, as well as other natural beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin and NONE of Mychelles cleansers, toners, masks, etc have bothered my skin. They feel so healthy and so wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these to everyone! I feel great about putting this stuff on my skin!</li>
            <li> I am a natural products junkie, trying almost everything for my super sensitive, dry skin. I got some samples of Mychelle at my natural foods market and am hooked. This spray mist is very soothing after cleansing and for when my face feels dry or irritated. I also used it on sunburn recently with good results.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I recently read that you should give your face \\&quot;a rest\\&quot; at night and not use lotion. It suggested just using an eye cream and toner. This suggestion was extremely hard for me because I&#x27;m addicted to face cream (like its the one thing that I would take with me if I was left on a deserted island kinda thing). Anyway, my point is that this toner has neat moisturizing properties in addition to smelling incredible, so I&#x27;ve been able to somewhat break my moisturizer at night routine and my skin feels great in the morning. Oh yea, I bought it for $12.69 at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I switched to Mychelle when my 30-some combination skin could no longer tolerate Proactive, and became excessively dry. I wanted to switch to natural products, anyway. This toner, in combination with the other Mychelle products, has left my skin beautiful, clear, and youthful. I am pleased with this; it works well to leave my skin hydrated and smells delightful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say that you should mist your face while holding the pump 12&amp;#34; from your face, but I instead use this like a traditional toner--applying it to a cotton pad, and I&#x27;m always amazed at how much is removed from &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; skin after I&#x27;ve washed with the Mychelle fruit enzyme scrub (which is delightful, btw), or whatever face wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tropical skin smoother exfoliates nicely if your skin is on the dryer side and the cranberry mud mask works well for oily skin. I also occasionally use the fruit fiesta peel (with lactic acid to support youthful collagen, the label says) or the incredible pumpkin peel (enzymatic ally rich therapy for deep stimulation &amp; detoxification, for combination skin, the label says). The clear skin serum has saved my skin from breakouts and the clear skin spot treatment takes care of little blemishes. Mychelle has been great for my skin and is worth the expense!</li>
            <li> I adore this product.  It makes my skin look dewy and fresh in even the coldest, driest weather and has never irritated my super-sensitive skin.  This stuff is especially good spritzed over powdered mineral makeup, which can look a little dry and settle into fine lines.    I was very disappointed that my local Whole Foods is carrying a new formula of the Fruit enzyme mist and am very pleased to see that Amazon seems to have the old formula in stock here.  I almost cried when I thought I couldn&#x27;t get it anymore.</li>
            <li> **Note**  Didn&#x27;t realize I wrote this review for the 4.4oz bottle.  Be sure to look for and purchase the smaller 2.1oz bottle if you intend to use it as I do for air travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel a lot and I just hate what dry airplane air does to my skin.  By the end of a flight any makeup I&#x27;ve previously applied looks crepey, pores look huge and my skin looks oily and ashy at the same time.  Blotting does nothing and powdering just makes you look cakey.  Yuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried just plain water mists in the past without much success, with MyChelle, I stay fresh faced all throughout &#x27;most&#x27; flights.  I found that the important part is misting regularly and long &#x27;before&#x27; you reach &#x27;icky flight skin&#x27; status.  Staying hydrated by drinking water (instead of adult beverages ;) in flight will also help some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t really spray on &#x27;sticky&#x27; as another reviewer described but &#x27;thick&#x27;.  I think it has something to do with how they treat the water.  It supposidly has a slower evaporation rate and so it sits longer on your face.  Once it dries completely, you will not feel as if there was anything on your face (no film or weird tack).  I have sensitive and acne prone skin - this product has not caused me to break out.  You can use this over your makeup or on plain skin.  I like knowing that the Fruit Enzymes are gently exfoliating during the days I go makeup free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw - close your eyes when spraying and careful not to lick your lips afterwards.  This stuff tastes gross - very bitter.  I almost always follow up with chapstick to dilute it off my lips and keep it outta my mouth.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with skin care issues (adult acne) for years and when I finally started researching ingredients in most of todays drugstore and even highend skincare lines- I was shocked to find out what was in them! Do the research yourself- then look at the so called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products you are using now- many of them contain Parabens and petrochemicals...I found Mychelle line on the internet and have been using them faithfully for a couple of years now- Love the whole line- especially the pumkin renew cream, Vitamin C serum, and the fruit enzyme spray, oh yeah and try the cranberry cleanser as well! Great line- great company- I&#x27;m sold! Here at amazon you can get it at 22% discount and free shipping as well.</li>
            <li> I also wrote a review for the cranberry cleanser.  I love the Fruit Enzyme Mist.  It is really refreshing to spray on your skin in any climate, but almost an essential product if you live in a dry climate like CO.  For my morning and evening routine I like to mix it with a MyChelle moisturizer after cleansing.  It is great to use alone any time, but I like mixing it with a moisturizer because it makes one step out of two as well as thinning the moisturizers just enough so that they glide on smoothly and evenly.  Plus you can save a little money by using less since it is actually going on your face and not on your clothes and in your hair. ; )</li>
            <li> This is the favorite mist to us (me &amp; my huuby)  I have many allergies and my hubby has really sensitive skin so we had many troubles with other brands  But Mychelle Fruit enzyme mist is good for us  Good at hydrating and Easy to use   pump is well-made mist evenly</li>
            <li> I have been using My Chelle for 9 months and already see a difference in my 56 yr old face!</li>
            <li> I had been using a glycolic spray for years and was able to mist my entire face, which of course, inevitably includes the lips, and it was fine, even on my lips. I like the MyChelle cleanser and scrub in this line so I thought I would try the mist as well. I only use toners in mist form because a cotton pad or ball is so incredibly wasteful and not nearly as effective an application. Unfortunately, this mist tastes just awful when it gets on the lips, which it will - it&#x27;s a spray. Also, the spray is pretty explosive so you have to use a light hand or you will be blasted and dripping with product. Aside from the awful taste, it leaves my skin soft and is not sticky or tacky - a must for mineral makeup application - so for that I gave it three stars. I don&#x27;t feel that it was particularly moisturizing; I honestly don&#x27;t think it is doing much. It&#x27;s just okay, not worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> I use the whole MyChelle cleansing regime and have been for several years. This compliments the products I use on a daily basis and they all work very well for my skin. I use this in conjunction with the White Cranberry Cleanser, Clear Skin Serum, and Oil-Free Grapefruit Moisturizer. Works well for me! It&#x27;s also nice to spritz some on my face on a hot day.</li>
            <li> Best moisturizing fruit enzyme mist on the market. Spritz it right on your face every morning after using a Mychelle serum. Smells great, feels so refreshing. Never need toner again!</li>
            <li> The product is good. I use a regimen of mychelle products and im happy with the result. I know longer have dry patches of skin. I use their cleanser toner and moisturizer.  The smell and taste of this product, if it gets on your lips, is not good but I just pull in my lips when I spray it.</li>
            <li> I buy products from mychelle, I am charged, but until now not sent this products and never reply to my emails and facebook messages, too bad, I will never buy mychelle products again.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff every day, it makes my face feel so fresh and clean and helps close up my pores after washing.  Also great as a spritzer on hot, sweaty days.</li>
            <li> I found this product at the Whole Foods store. I purchased it as part of a 5 step skin care regime but I would purchase it on its own.&lt;br /&gt;It is equally refreshing in dry and humid weather.  I carry a small container in my purse when traveling on airplanes along side my toothbrush and the two keep me going on long hauls.</li>
            <li> I use this at least twice a day after washing my face.  Sometimes, I will even spritz it lightly over makeup just to refresh my skin.  I use this after the fruit enzyme cleanser and before the deep repair cream and have noticed significant improvements in moisture and less breakouts.</li>
            <li> Humidity is low where I live and wind and sunshine are common, so this mist is a godsend!  It really helps in applying other products (e.g., sunbock) and in keeping my skin from becoming irritated by the climate.</li>
            <li> I tried two other MyChelle mists and didn&#x27;t like them. This one is better than average but doesn&#x27;t surpass my favorite Mario Badescu rose water spray.  I suppose there&#x27;s more nutrients in this but my face feels better with the Mario Badescu spray.  I still feel more moisturized after using this than before.</li>
            <li> All MyChelle products are excellent but this mist is a perfect and refreshing finish before the moisturizer. It is easy to use and lasts a long time because you just spray a little and it works.</li>
            <li> I really love how this stuff smells! It feels very refreshing on my skin and gives it a pretty glow!</li>
            <li> I started using this along with the Vitamin A plus serum (for combination skin) and spot treatment from Mychelle. This is  my new favorite beauty company. Was having a major problem with adult acne flare-ups, but I also have very sensitive skin and eczema. I attribute acne clearing up primarily to the serums, but this mist gives a really nice glow, great facial moisture after drying cleansers and serums, some cleansing/tightening of pores, and calming/fading of hyperpigmentation/scarring.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Kind of works like a super gentle toner plus moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;-Very hydrating. Sometimes I use only this for hydrating my skin at night (I forget about putting on night cream)&lt;br /&gt;-Sprays on - no tugging of skin or use of fingers/things that can put gunk back on your face&lt;br /&gt;-Gives a healthy, bright look to skin&lt;br /&gt;-Natural ingredients, no animal testing, no toxic junk&lt;br /&gt;-Just makes your skin FEEL nice!&lt;br /&gt;-awesome scent - citrus, slightly sweet, not too overpowering (especially for something that goes on your face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-SLIGHT tacky feel for a short while--but I use at night or in tandem with moisturizer in the day (as the &amp;#34;steps&amp;#34;/mychelle&#x27;s directions suggest)&lt;br /&gt;-Tastes bad if you get it on your lips--just pull them in when spraying, or spray on your fingers to spread on.</li>
            <li> Very hydrating facial mist.  Like this one very much!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and other MyChelle products for years. This mist is cool on the face and feels good.</li>
