            <li>Just love my Conair 1-Inch curling iron!!</li>
            <li>looked like a very nice quality product.  </li>
            <li>It straighten and curl my hair very nicely.</li>
            <li>amazing!</li>
            <li>For the most part, I am very happy with product...</li>
            <li>I thought I would never be able to replace the quality but the Conair is just perfect.</li>
            <li>Without reaching the successful just stepped out of the salon w</li>
            <li>I applaud Conair for coming up with hair tools that women of color can use successfully.</li>
            <li>I would really love it if they would go to a heated barrel as this the perfect size</li>
            <li>Wonderful for my hair and so easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works good</li>
            <li>And the brush keeps a good grip on my thich, shoulder length hairstyle.</li>
            <li>does good job, wish there was a lower setting.  </li>
            <li>Basically, just use it like the demonstrations you&#x27;ve seen of The Perfecter, and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li>I have loved the one I have been using for years.</li>
            <li>Another great feature I liked was a plastic piece attached that acted like a mini stand</li>
            <li>I used the Perfector for a couple of years and loved it</li>
            <li>i read all the reviews on this curling iron, and they were mostly good</li>
            <li>good price&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s good for the price, but</li>
            <li>Good hair appliance.</li>
            <li>Good value for the money</li>
            <li>Loved this item....could not</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it&#x27;s oviouslly a good quality &amp;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li>It has a swivel cord that works great and a nice loooooooooong cord, which provides me with multi-functions as i curl my hair I can turn around the corner and talk to people or watch t.v.</li>
            <li>Good product....</li>
            <li>Good quality for this unit.</li>
            <li>I have been using the brush for about 4 months now and it is one of the best purchases I have made and the price is right!  </li>
            <li>Makes a perfect curl  and its quick.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and is the perfect size for me</li>
            <li>The reason I don&#x27;t give it zero stars is that I like how it has adjustable heat settings and a quick heat up plus the perfect barrel size.</li>
            <li>Best hot brush out there!  </li>
            <li>CHEAP PRICES FOR VERY GOOD</li>

            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>

            <li>I am truly impressed with this hot brush by Conair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;For any like me who haver never mastered the curling iron, the hot brush is great!</li>

            <li>My daughter&#x27;s love it!</li>
            <li>Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li>This is a very effective hot iron/brush and is at an attractive price.  </li>
            <li>the shine it brings to your hair is amazing.</li>
            <li>Did you see an infomercial for the amazing but pricey Perfecter?  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t do hair either-so blow drying for a style is not an option; I have tried many times and I can&#x27;t ever get it to look good.</li>
            <li>I am kind of wishing I had just bought the Perfector instead.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>I already own one and have had it for years.  </li>
            <li>This product enabled me to do a fairly good job putting a style in my hair which made me feel lots better.  </li>
            <li>If you want a warm brush you should keep looking</li>
            <li>I really liked this</li>
            <li>If you are not too handy with hair tools, do not purchase this iron.  </li>
            <li>Thought maybe this idea of some of the combs heating was a good idea, and on most curling irons it probably would be</li>
            <li>and I have to say I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li>and it handles it nicely.</li>
            <li>I will update if my opinion changes but for now I am thrilled.</li>
            <li>Good curls, body, and ok straightening for straightish to kinda wavy hair, it smooths rather than straightens.  </li>
            <li>This styling brush heats up fast and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li>Love that it has heat settings and that this brush heats my hair more consistently...leaving great body and curl.  </li>
            <li>The Conair, Infiniti arrived quickly and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li>This is my first review but thought I should comment since so many of the reviews on this product were not the best.</li>
            <li>I found it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are very easy to accidentally turn off.</li>
            <li>I love this product and might get one more to just have on hand in case they stop making it!  </li>
            <li>I thought I had found the perfect curling brush in the perfect size, but this thing gets entirely too hot.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT investment at a reasonable cost!!</li>
            <li>It heats up very fast and makes beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot and helps style my hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I had to replace teeth with the ones from my old curling iron, then I was happy!!</li>
            <li>Love this curling brush--lightweight, gives a nice long-lasting curl.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and this brush smooths out any frizz leaving it</li>
            <li>Love love love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very disheartening, I loved this brush!</li>
            <li>Pros:  multiple heat settings, great size, works great for my hairstyle,</li>
            <li>Not only is the price perfect but this curling brush is AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy that I found this ConAir Infiniti hot brush here.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this, it was great.  </li>
            <li>This hot brush is just that-takes seconds to heat up and the performance is great.</li>
            <li>This is a great hot brush.</li>
            <li>This is a great HOT curling iron.  </li>
            <li>am using it fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
            <li>and you need to watch your hands, but you get good with it quickly.  </li>
            <li>It sounded interesting</li>
            <li>may by Okay for some people,</li>
            <li>I could not even finish curling the top of my hair with this iron.  </li>
            <li>Love it..  </li>
            <li>Will keep this product, but it could be better.    </li>
            <li>The heated bristles, while requiring some extra care to use, are perfect for smoothing out frizzy hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s top to bottom, NOT bottom to top.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember how many years ago I bought it, but it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;chugging&amp;#34; away.</li>
            <li>and it is safe to use.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this curling brush.  </li>
            <li>So I save time, and even better, I can see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>It is in better condition/</li>
            <li>I just purchased two more.  </li>
            <li>Love this iron.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE having no 1st degree burns on my hands.</li>
            <li>This does the trick, I love it.</li>
            <li>Okay, just like Goldilocks, I tried so many.  </li>
            <li>But, I will agree with you all, that the sensitivity of this on/off button makes its location even more of a hassle.  </li>
            <li>Again, though, I am trainable and am learning not to turn it off and to check it to make sure I haven&#x27;t turned it off while I am using it.  </li>
            <li>Okay, so I give it 4 stars because it does what it should</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>I really love the concept of this curling brush.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews about numerous types of curling iron/brush products that were in this lower price range, I chose this and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I bought this iron.</li>
            <li>QUALITY.I HAVE MOST CONAIR IRON</li>

            <li>love it</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This is the closest that I&#x27;ve come to my favorite cutler that is no longer in production.  </li>
            <li>They need to put twice as many rows of teeth in so that you don&#x27;t burn your scalp.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this product, it provides a lasting curl.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s somewhat ok.  </li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been burnt many times.</li>
            <li>I waited about a month before reviewing just to make sure.  </li>
            <li>This one is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>Because of this, I am able to better control the temperature.      </li>
            <li>Buy it I am satisfied and sets my hair well.</li>
            <li>Love it, take It with me when I get my hair cut.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I look more polished.  </li>
            <li>I always laid a comb on the scalp and the curling iron barrel on top of the comb.</li>
            <li>Great size, heats fast.  </li>
            <li>I use it more on ethnic hair.</li>

            <li>It is also amazing for a quick refresh of your style between shampoos.  </li>
            <li>quick heat-up and nice range of temperatures.</li>
            <li>The Conair hot brush has good heat and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I searched Amazon before buying though because this Conair product does the trick just fine.  </li>
            <li>Conair has developed a great product, try it, you will like it.</li>
            <li>The smaller diameter of the curler and the design of the teeth is really ideal for her hair because it doesnt get tangled.  </li>
            <li>I love this ceramic brush for the smooth finish</li>
            <li>The first one that I bought I have used for many many many years</li>
            <li>Grips hair well for quick, easy curls!</li>
            <li>It keeps getting turned off while using it, other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>The brush heats up fast and eliminates frizz and adds a nice healthy shine.</li>
            <li>The handle is easy to hang on to and I like the teeth on the curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Just received this product, but so far works very well, and adjustable heat settings are the best part of this curler.</li>
            <li>It is extremely hot based on higher settings, which is great for stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and the button position has been improved.  </li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, and did just what I wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to burn fingers until you learn to work around that.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>This one by Conair should also have a rotating brush head for easy removal from the hair.  </li>
            <li>but it should NOT be so easy to switch the temps.  </li>
            <li>Heats up in a flash as promised and easy to use as the cord swivels.  </li>
            <li>this has made it so easy to get out the door in no time at all.</li>
            <li>The downside is the on/off switch is located on the handle in a place where it is easily turned off during use.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I wanted the 1inch, which, for some reason, is not that easy to find.</li>
            <li>I love these because they are so hot that they can put curl into my very fine stick-straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I have fine/wavy/color treated hair and this hot brush make its easy to have a nice finished/polished look.  </li>
            <li>hot brush while waiting for my order and the difference was amazing.</li>
            <li>so I love how hot this curling brush gets and the bristles are pretty good, too.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice, hot iron.</li>
            <li>I also have a problem with my right arm and this is very easy for me to use.</li>
            <li>Would be an awesome product if it came in smaller size (3/4&amp;#34;) and the on-off button were recessed/toggled instead so easy to turn off while using the brush.</li>
            <li>and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, but don&#x27;t let it touch your scalp.</li>
            <li>I have medium length fine, but somewhat curly hair.  </li>
            <li>The best part is, I received two for the same price I paid for the first one I bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li>My hair is finely textured and I find that this brush does the job for me.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair (which is why I&#x27;m using a curling brush) and it won&#x27;t grip or hold on to my hair unless I&#x27;m all but holding my hair on it.  </li>
            <li>I baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>just in case...as I do not want to be without this tremendous product...yelps and all!</li>
            <li>I am able to do my hair rather quickly, I&#x27;d say within 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Because of the heat I can get my hair done more quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for hair like mine, thick but very fine.</li>
            <li>This brush is great for coarse or curly hair, Amazing ceramic heat source that&#x27;s gentle on my hair!</li>
            <li>It works great, leaves my hair super soft n</li>
            <li>it gets very hot!</li>
            <li>I really love this hot brush!  </li>
            <li>This hot brush does the job for a fraction of the price!:)</li>
            <li>I have short fine hair and it works great.  </li>
            <li>I am African-American, and I use a blow dryer with a comb attatchment to straighten my hair, then I smooth it out/</li>
            <li>I like the selection of temperatures and the fast warm up.</li>
            <li>Heats fast and gives your hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li>BUT my hair was still smooth, shiny, and frizz-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair smooth for a while</li>
            <li>cause honestly I avoid using this one as much as I can.</li>
            <li>The digital temperature setting is a great feature and the heated bristles are a plus.</li>
            <li>liked so much replaced it with duplcate.</li>
            <li>Would be good for professional stylists, but not practical for home use, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>But I love it so much that I ordered two more,</li>
            <li>OK, burns my head if not held just right.</li>
            <li>tried making it work but burned fingers and flat hair do make for a happy girl.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought other hot brushes and curling irons, but this one does the best job on my fine, but varied textured hair.  </li>
            <li>I also loke how hot it gets because it really set my hair good.</li>
            <li>I really like it and its very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The first day of use I was able to make a curl-</li>
            <li>and this is the first product that has been able to do that for me.  </li>
            <li>Was excited to find it when I decided to look for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed in the workmanship of this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many hot brushes, but they have never done the job.  </li>
            <li>I got a hot air brush instead by John Frieda, and it works much better, plus you can hold onto it.</li>
            <li>I love how fast it heats up and the quality of the curl is awsome!</li>
            <li>and I love how hot it gets.</li>
            <li>I have used many styling brushes and have never had one that was so burning hot as this one.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot brush, i grow up with one.</li>
            <li>so I was excited to find this one.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot brush.  </li>
            <li>Is it ever more HOT, I BURN MY head.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot (which my fine hair needs to attempt to hold a curl etc.).</li>
            <li>Wow, the greatest hair curling brush I&#x27;ve ever had and it lasted only 3 months.</li>
            <li>Good size and does a good curling job on my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great hair tool, both for straightening and for loose curls.</li>
            <li>Make sure you clean the barrel off using 99% alcohol on a towel, cleans up really well.</li>
            <li>so I was super excited.</li>
            <li>I have always used hot brushes, but I was really impressed a few days ago when a friend loaned this iron to me for an emergency touch-up.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend that much.</li>
            <li>Would probably be good for fixing bed head if you needed to be somewhere in a hurry, but I&#x27;d rather just take the time to shower and fix it properly.  </li>
            <li>The top setting it too much.  </li>
            <li>but it gives me nice soft volume waves and my hair</li>
            <li>but I use the highest and have never burned myself because of the bristles that stay cool.</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m back to searching for a good quality curling iron that I can travel with.</li>
            <li>Just as pictured and just like the one I used and loved daily  for 6 years</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my new hot brush.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine with little body (except for th gray strands) and works great.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use this hot brush.</li>
            <li>However, I have managed to be able to work it without getting burned &amp; can now get ready for work pretty quickly since holding the curl for 3 seconds is all you need!</li>
            <li>Gets really hot, does the job, doesn&#x27;t get caught or knotted in your hair and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Be aware when purchasing that the metal teeth get very hot so you can burn yourself quite easily.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, first iron that puts the curl in to stay.  </li>
            <li>It may be too hot if you have fine hair</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li>durable - heats up quick..  </li>
            <li>THIS heated curler quickly does the job.</li>
            <li>it works super.</li>
            <li>Heats up as well and quickly as they say.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly and does not tangle in hair.  </li>
            <li>I would have to agree with most other reviews that this is a pretty good curling iron.  </li>
            <li>That one, too, was designed by the same genius who thought putting the on/off button on the handles right where you grip with your fingers was a good idea.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is easy to burn yuor scalp if you are not careful, but I like the heated bristles for better styling.</li>
            <li>There are not even any warnings on the box regarding the very hot bristles.  </li>
            <li>It gets VERY hot</li>
            <li>, it does get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Beware, it can get very hot</li>
            <li>It does get very hot</li>
            <li>The settings are very hot.  </li>
            <li>This heating brush is very, very hot, even on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>I am an X cosmologist and I am use to using a Marcel curling iron and they get very hot.</li>
            <li>tip gets very hot so that you can&#x27;t handle it ...</li>
            <li>It gets VERY hot -even without increasing the heat.  </li>
            <li>Gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>There is a cheaper hot iron available on Amazon</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gone though 3 of them because they are just cheaply made hot irons.</li>
            <li>I used the lowest setting for the first week until I was comfortable using the tool.</li>
            <li>This is a great curling brush if you want something quick, easy and to tame the frizzies!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and I set it on the second to high heat setting, and it does great.  </li>
            <li>It gets SUPER hot!</li>
            <li>I can imagine the issues someone would have if trying to curl their hair with this (the burned scalp/ears/fingers mentioned in other reviews), but if you&#x27;re simply loooking to smooth out frizz and finish your ends, this tool is PERFECT!</li>
            <li>Because of the hot bristles it grabs the hair and really creates a lovely effect.  </li>
            <li>It heats up vey fast, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>This iron gets VERY hot, but if you are careful to protect your finger tips, it does a good curl job QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>so hot it burned my hair off!</li>
            <li>The heated bristles are HOT!  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast though!!</li>
            <li>This one gets HOT!  </li>
            <li>As soon as I read the review on it; that it was too hot!</li>
            <li>a curling iron brush that gets hot!  </li>
            <li>It works great and never got too hot like some of the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have fine, stubbornly straight hair</li>
            <li>I love the temperature settings and it works like a professional hot brush!</li>
            <li>Personally, I think it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li>thanks to Amazon for making the process stress free.</li>
            <li>I wish I had found this product earlier when traveling a lot for business as I could have had this in my handy computer bag on the road.</li>
            <li>love this tool many thanks once again to Amazon for making it possible</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>this is the second one I bought, I found one in a retail store and liked it</li>
            <li>but they never get warm enough and they take forever to heat up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid forties and have used every kind of curling iron under the sun since I was 13.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I kept my old one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true it gets hot</li>
            <li>and it does tend to burn fingers more than my old one did.</li>
            <li>was well worth the satisfaction</li>
            <li>This baby is Hot Hot Hot!!  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>The only problem with it is that the ends of the bristles are very hot and it is very easy to burn yourself.</li>
            <li>Sturdy, weighty...heats up quickly and gets really hot .  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It gets super hot.</li>
            <li>THIS HOT BRUSH HEATS UP QUICKLY AND GIVES YOUR HAIR LOTS OF CURLS OR BODY...</li>
            <li>This is a fine product, except for one huge design flaw - the on/off &amp; temperature setting are right on the handle, and you barely have to touch the button to turn it off.  </li>
            <li>but it does have a learning curve to use as it gets very hot and you will burn your fingers at first</li>
            <li>First of all, it does get very hot.</li>
            <li>Also the on/off button is right where you put your hand to use it</li>
            <li>This iron does the job, and end result holds well along with the right styling products.  </li>
            <li>Also, the control buttons are right where I put my thumb.  </li>
            <li>The on/off button is right where your fingers hit when trying to use on your hair resulting in you</li>
            <li>I went onto Amazon and found this one right away.  </li>
            <li>just right</li>
            <li>I pretty much solved that problem by going to Sally&#x27;s and buying a cheap hot-glove.  </li>
            <li>No other line or brand of curling iron has ever been able to do that before.  </li>
            <li>but since I found it again for such a good price got a new one</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair, this curling iron is ideal relaxing curls for a less frizzy look.  </li>
            <li>This item  works great with hard to curl hair because it can become very hot.</li>
            <li>The cord is nice and long and it swivels .</li>
            <li>Works really fast and well on my straight, fine hair without getting stuck or burning ends.</li>
            <li>I think it takes away the frizz, so that is nice, but I don&#x27;t feel like the curl lasts very long.  </li>
            <li>I drive an hour to work and wanted something that heated up fast and did the job quickly.</li>
            <li>as with the more expensive Protector Fusion, the ion technology of the InfinitiPro gives curly hair a great smoothness and shine.</li>
            <li>This product looses heat very fast while curling hair and the on/off switch is located in a place where it is easily bumped, thus often turning the iron completely off while in use.</li>
            <li>I really do not believe their is a better comb like curling iron than this!</li>
            <li>It does get very hot which works very well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li>Be cautious and you will be fine, do not allow kids near it.  </li>
            <li>These are hard to find and they are great.  </li>
            <li>Adds body and leaves a soft end curl I want that often lasts all day under most conditions, even though my hair has been the oily type that can go flat easily.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t wrap your hair around it without touching the heated red brissles.</li>
            <li>I almost burned myself with this hot brush, they&#x27;re not kidding when they say HOT BRUSH.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t need anything this hot to wave your hair......</li>
            <li>Count me in with those who say it is too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li>This product, Infiniti by Conair, BC2, curling iron brush, was way too hot, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>This unit gets really hot, even at its lowest setting (there are four settings).  </li>
            <li>turn the ends under with a hot brush.</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it burned my scalp, neck and fingers.  </li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>It does the job that I wanted it to do in place of using hot curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked well the first couple of times I used it, but now it seems to have no effect on my hair.</li>
            <li>It also had three exact heating temperatures and the cord is made not to tangle when in use.</li>
            <li>The bristles heat up and get extremely hot</li>
            <li>the tip does not get hot, either.</li>
            <li>This curling brush has burned me many times, gotten stuck in my hair on several occasions, and turned off every time I have used it.</li>
            <li>This unit gets so hot it singes hair.  </li>
            <li>This brush iron is too hot.  </li>
            <li>it does get hot.</li>
            <li>but evidently they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li>The bristles (which are not flexible) heat up really hot.  </li>
            <li>If you want a Hot brush this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li>It was too hot.</li>
            <li>The longer bristles work much better for curling hair than short bristles.  </li>
            <li>The brush gets really hot</li>
            <li>Not any hotter than a hot iron gets</li>
            <li>GETS TO HOT.</li>
            <li>First thing, I burned my finger, even after experimenting with the curler not turned on.</li>
            <li>Wish I could find this exact one in a 3/4\\&quot; barrel.</li>
            <li>Practice will help so you don&#x27;t touch any of the hot comb tips.  </li>
            <li>And this is my first review ever.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my hot brush for approx.</li>
            <li>As top hair is thinning so only have on 330 setting.  </li>
            <li>I have NEVER had a curling iron that got so hot (on the lowest &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34;--- just &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;) and burned like this one.</li>
            <li>BUT this units heats up so HOT</li>
            <li>I did give it 4 stars but only because I love these types of curling irons because they don&#x27;t flatten your hair</li>
            <li>I have purchased RENAC irons and they also get hot</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for this hot brush.  </li>
            <li>I will give it another try, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this type of hot brush.</li>
            <li>The wand is heavier than my Helen of Troy plastic hot air brush http://amzn.to/1Mkmgyl (which I reviewed as a &amp;#34;warm air brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot, but you can regulate your heat preference.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too hot and can burn fingertips.</li>
            <li>It can damage your hair if you raise it any higher.</li>
            <li>Too hot even at lowest setting.</li>
            <li>, as everyone is saying, it does, indeed, get so hot</li>
            <li>This thing really heats up!  </li>
            <li>I have had no issues with tangling and it gets hot Fast!  </li>
            <li>I also love the different heat settings option.  </li>
            <li>Nice, butbe careful picks get HOT</li>
            <li>The controls are push buttons located on the handle, so if you don&#x27;t hold it in exactly the correct position, the buttons are bumped and the iron is turned off.  </li>
            <li>If your life has enough petty annoyances without adding more, avoid this styling brush like the plague.  </li>
            <li>It helps calm the frizz and relax her hair into gentle wavy curls.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll more than likely get burned a couple of times before you figure out how to hold this.  </li>
            <li>I love the multiple heating options on this.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron, this is my third one that I have purchased already.</li>
            <li>However, if you have short hair and are used to using a curling brush that touches the scalp, it will burn you.&lt;br /&gt;Would be great for long hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I burned my fingers and my neck.  </li>
            <li>First one lasted 5 months.</li>
            <li>It still does work, but doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li>Overall I prefer this hot tool over many others.</li>
            <li>You can just see the hot steam coming from it.  </li>
            <li>I returned it because every row gets hot and it burned me.  </li>
            <li>I wanted the 1/2 hot brush</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking but could not find in the stores</li>
            <li>I had to get used to the hot bristles</li>
            <li>It does exactly what my wife wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>I must admit that at first couple of times of using it, I did accidentally touch my ears with the hot brush</li>
            <li>You will eventually notice you hair not curly so well and will have to reheat hot brush and start that section over again.</li>
            <li>Not a brush with traditional brissels, but rather more like teeth.  </li>
            <li>Be sure t only hold it by the handle and tip</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like it too hot, and burns your fingers regardless of thermal gloves</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any problems with it being too hot.  </li>
            <li>Maybe because lots of my hair that I lose once and while coats the brush so that it&#x27;s not as hot.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember it being that hot</li>
            <li>when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>she spent that kind of money when she saw my hair..</li>
            <li>I tried several times to make my longish hair into the ringlets everyone wears, and I started at the top like it said in the reviews.</li>
            <li>I had a Conair hot brush , it lasted for</li>
            <li>It heats almost immediately, the little \\&quot;nubs\\&quot; are a plus as I have baby fine hair and have always gotten tangled hairs as I&#x27;ve tried to keep the hair wrapped around the more inferior brands, this one grips it</li>
            <li>and it can be easily handled with bare hands.</li>
            <li>This works more like a flat iron and straightens.</li>
            <li>Although I have suffered some small burns figuring out how to use this type of iron the results are awesome and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li>The problem with this hot brush it that it is much too hot to use when on even at the lowest temperature setting.  </li>
            <li>i was really hoping to be able to curl my hair back and out of my face.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for thick coarse hair..</li>
            <li>Good hot brush, it does the same as a flat iron.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and at the high heat it gets very hot.</li>
            <li>My only problem with this hot brush is that when wrapping your hair around it, its fairly easy to burn your fingertips.</li>
            <li>No hair tangles, super hot, makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>You do get used to where and how to use it - after getting burned a couple of times, it didn&#x27;t take long to learn...:)    </li>
            <li>straight so in order to curl it as well as give it body, I need something that gets fairly hot.  </li>
            <li>I really dislike it because it is so hot</li>
            <li>Gets very hot and have to be careful with it - it will burn you quite easily.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quickly and gets very hot,  If you are careful.</li>
            <li>Wow!  gets hot!  </li>
            <li>Heats nearly instantly -- very long cord -- many heat settings.  </li>
            <li>teeth on the iron are too short and you easily burn your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li>I have to grab a lock, wrap the hair around the rod, smooth it out, then go on to the next section, always avoiding the hot prongs.  </li>
            <li>It curls my straight thin hair beautifully...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not as good for short hair as it is for long.</li>
            <li>After being curled previously with regular iron, the brush works great</li>
            <li>I have been using this brush daily for about six months, and I have medium length, straight-ish, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li>have fine hair, and just a couple of second combing it</li>
            <li>I have fine, short hair and the 1&amp;#34; curling brush was what I kept searching for since the 1&amp;#34; Belson is no longer made.  </li>
            <li>This certainly does the job and has made my morning much simpler.</li>
            <li>This tool is great for very thick course hair types.</li>
            <li>next time I think I will spend a little more to get a better one.</li>
            <li>My hair is very frizzy after blow drying.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t plan on getting too much curl</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It works very well and the results are satisfactory.</li>
            <li>It is a shame because it is otherwise very well made.</li>
            <li>But I have curly hair &amp; it really controls it well.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed because even on the lowest setting it can burn your scalp.</li>
            <li>It also heats up so much faster than I am accustomed to--within 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li>what \\&quot;Tourmaline Ceramic Hot...\\&quot; really means, you may not be ready for theconcept of this brush.  </li>
            <li>I keep it away from my scalp and hold on to the very tip of it with my fingers when curling.</li>
            <li>I really recommend not purchasing this.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and need the brush tines to help pull out the curl to help straighten it.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to purchase another one.</li>
            <li>I manage with it, but VERY gingerly.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Love this one, turns off by itself on the occasion of being forgetful</li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>Next, I&#x27;m trying the cheap Revlon RV454.</li>
            <li>So - treat it gently and pack bubble wrap around it in your suitcase.</li>
            <li>Use every day at home and light and sturdy enough to tote to gym .</li>
            <li>But for some reason, this thing really works.</li>
            <li>I liked the fact that you can clean the black and red prongs as they do get coated with hair product over time just beware to use the correct screwdriver to avoid stripping the screw end.  </li>
            <li>It is a fast way to pouf my hair</li>
            <li>The range of heat settings really make this curling iron flexible.  </li>
            <li>It makes curling my hair much easier than using a blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li>Tons of curl in a fast time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, because otherwise it works really well.  </li>
            <li>If you donâ€™t work as fast as I do put it on a lower setting, here is a trick you can do</li>
            <li>it is very unsatisfactory</li>
            <li>Infiniti pro works really well.</li>
            <li>I like the various setting choices available and</li>
            <li>This is made very well.  </li>
            <li>We have spent many days looking for this type of product.  </li>
            <li>it arrived fast</li>
            <li>the only thing it does is straighten all the frizzies out nicely, and give a tiny flip at the ends.  </li>
            <li>You do have to take some care when putting it near your face since the alternate rows of red bristles do get hot, and the rounded tip also gets pretty warm.  </li>
            <li>I gave it 2 stars because it did curl my hair nicely the few times</li>
            <li>Does not get hot enough and the brush spikes are not long enough to really get a good grip on the hair</li>
            <li>HOWEVER, the red bristles get SUPER HOT as they are heated, not just the ceramic.</li>
            <li>other than that, i have not been able to do real curls.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a seam right at the bottom of the barrel that will rip your hair right out if it gets in there - even if you are saavy enough to not get your hair tangled in the bristles to begin with.  </li>
            <li>Also, I use it on the lowest heat as it&#x27;s hot enough for my fine hair and don&#x27;t hold it too long unless you want a super curly do.  </li>
            <li>I love using this nano brush so much, when my last one wore out I bought another one exactly the same.</li>
            <li>way better than any other curling iron.  </li>
            <li>If you have struggled day after day to do your hair with the old Helen of Troy tool, you&#x27;ll know when you are ready for something that is HOT and fast.  </li>
            <li>I remember when the electric ceramic flat iron became available and revolutionized the industry.</li>
            <li>Read the other reviews which give some interesting tips.</li>
            <li>Other brushes are meant for people that have more hair.</li>
            <li>my best friend is so mad..</li>
            <li>Nice product, well made, sturdy, maybe a little large and heavy for someone who is more frail.  </li>
            <li>Most other curling brush iron&#x27;s little brush pieces come off so quickly, and seem so cheap.  </li>
            <li>The glove I purchased has tiny holes that the teeth on this just love to go through, therefore I still have to be careful, but the glove helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li>I also love the slightly bigger barrel-most of the irons available are 3/4\\&quot;, not a full inch.</li>
            <li>I have a high end straightener and this curling brush is really impressing me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bristles get too hot to be so near the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 60&#x27;s and have no problem using this nor any problems with it being too hot or burning my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised that this hot brush is allowed on the market.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed for my naturally curly ethnic hair.</li>
            <li>I would recommend starting out at the lowest setting to start and touching only the very end/tip when wrapping your hair around it.</li>
            <li>It does get really hot though, and that is the problem with most other curling brushes - they don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, limp hair, and this curling brush is the answer to my prayers.</li>
            <li>But because so, it curls so quickly that I only hold the curl for about two or three seconds.  </li>
            <li>I thought, mom is getting older, maybe its just her.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m clever like that.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s HOT, but sometime you just need HOT to do the job properly.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this hot brush if you need one that gets hot.  </li>
            <li>It gets too hot and there is no reason for the red bristles to be hot.  </li>
            <li>It does get hot, and the red bristles get hot,</li>
            <li>I recently purchase the, &amp;#34;Tourmaline Ceramic Hot Brush by Conair,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>The hot brush is exactly what I wanted and need for my current hair style.  </li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings.</li>
            <li>I tried using it again two more times and finally just put it back in the box and returned</li>
            <li>super &#x3D;-short</li>
            <li>I did not get a tight enough curl to use it on freshly  shamooed hair, but I have very  fine hair and this may be the reason.  </li>
            <li>It was VERY hot and after burning myself several times, i gave up.</li>
            <li>and I used only the very first setting.  </li>
            <li>It took me a while to get the hang of using it without burning myself as it does get very very hot but the curls really last!</li>
            <li>I think that length of hair is too long for this, because you can&#x27;t really just brush through your hair with it and then quickly curl it, unless you want to get your hair all tangled up in it.  </li>
            <li>Five stars...recommend highly.</li>
            <li>This is replacing a Conair Infiniti I bought MANY years ago and have been looking locally for several years to replace as my old one got so much use and wear and tear that the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; had started to break off.</li>
            <li>This is a high quality curler</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this, and I plan on buying a &#x27;spare&#x27; one soon, just</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recomend.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use this on anyone other than yourself, it can burn too easily, without you knowing it, when using on someone else.</li>
            <li>The wand is not bulky like other curling tools, which makes it easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Although I love hot brushes, this one is hard to use.</li>
            <li>Too bad because if it weren&#x27;t for that it might have been the perfect curling brush.</li>
            <li>It may be okay for some but its too narrow for me.</li>
            <li>I read most of the negative reviews about this styling brush and every one I read had to do with the iron/brush getting too hot.  </li>
            <li>When I first tried this one, I did burn the tip of my fingers and when it would actually barely touch my scalp, you&#x27;d hear a yelp out of me.  </li>
            <li>I get a much better result just spraying them with water and blow drying with a round brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that the short red bristles get hot.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ve used other hot brushes, they did not heat up as fast &amp; hot as this can.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you can get the hair on the brush, I expect it works all right, but I don&#x27;t have enough fingers to continue experimenting.  </li>
            <li>Some Einstein put this button in the middle of the handle, right where you hold onto it.  </li>
            <li>And the controls are easy to accidentally turn off as you are using the curling iron (I average about four times per use).  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use, heats up quickly and only takes a few minutes to style my hair.  </li>
            <li>the long cord.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes stay warm, not hot, while in use</li>
            <li>With my older one, only the rod was hot, not the brush tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I actually gave myself a headache for hours from touching my scalp a few times during the first use.  </li>
            <li>I will need a new one soon.</li>
            <li>I hope the designers will develop a new handle.  </li>
            <li>I retired from the cosmetology business decades ago but still keep up with new equipment.</li>
            <li>I saw no place to order new teeth for maintenance.   </li>
            <li>I wanted to try the new ceramic style brush</li>
            <li>The reason I had to buy a new is because the teeth on the curling iron break off and I can&#x27;t replace them.</li>
            <li>Replacing this one with a  new one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a good curling iron with the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; and various heat settings.</li>
            <li>As being short there is not much hair between iron and scalp to buffer the heat on scalp so is top &#x27;just&#x27; before the iron touches scalp.  </li>
            <li>A very classy, well-made appliance.</li>
            <li>Also, the on/ off button is on the handle and it is very sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly short, fine, and somewhat thin on top</li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase even though reviews of the larger barrel model were not positive.</li>
            <li>It grows forward on 1 side which has less hair and straight down growth on the other with more hair, the top grows forward.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>As with any hot tool, it should be handled with care as the red prongs heat up.</li>
            <li>I recently purchase the Infiniti by Conair BC2 1\\&quot; Tourmaline Ceramic Hot Brush.  </li>
            <li>I simply diffuse it and then use the hot brush to style it....</li>
            <li>hot almost instantly</li>
            <li>But I was a nervous wreck trying to avoid getting burned by the red hot combing teeth.</li>
            <li>It gets hot almost instantly.</li>
            <li>And was hot enough for me just turning it on.</li>
            <li>It gets incredibly hot, even on low, and that worried me.  </li>
            <li>Also, then end tip gets really hot and mine fell off after about a year or two of constant use.</li>
            <li>As everyone else has said, the red plastic brushes get WAY too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li>Yes, this curling iron gets hot enough to burn you and yes the on/off button will cut off while using it</li>
            <li>This gets hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>I have actually both a couple infiniti hot brush for my friends.</li>
            <li>The others I have tried just do not get hot enough.    </li>
            <li>I agree that the red tines are hot, so users must take care in use.  </li>
            <li>I can remember getting some gloves to use this curling iron when I first got it years back.  </li>
            <li>Various heat settings &amp; use with care as it does get quite hot</li>
            <li>So, I purchased this for $25 at our local Ultra, having seen it on display there for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Except for this unit being hot, it works the same way, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>When and if any thing happens to this one I will buy the exact same one over and over again!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It gets extremely hot even on the low setting.</li>
            <li>The problem is that it is so hot that I cannot use it, even on the low setting.</li>
            <li>For years I have looked for products that can be used on my hair, none of them where hot enough until I tried this one.</li>
            <li>Because you can use this as a flat iron to smooth out your hair, you can also curl it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, the over-all effect of the curls was just not as pretty as I get by using a regular 1 1/4\\&quot; barrel clamp</li>
            <li>This gets hot enough to curl and straighten  my hair.  </li>
            <li>which is why I gave it two stars instead of one), but it gets insanely HOT; burned my scalp in several places.  </li>
            <li>Just turn it on and it gets hot enough without adjusting the heat settings.  </li>
            <li>the hot and cold brushes works good during curling</li>
            <li>Even on the lowest setting it is very hot, be careful not to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li>Careful as it gets very hot, but does the job.</li>
            <li>Look at the picture - the red bristles get hot, the black ones stay cool.  </li>
            <li>There is definitely a learning curve involved in using this brush as the red brushes are what heat up and they get very hot....</li>
            <li>and I have always wanted to smooth it out a little yet leaving some lofty curls at the end of my hair</li>
            <li>I was having a hard time finding this in the stores, so was so glad to see it online.  </li>
            <li>It was actually hard for me to find many others</li>
            <li>I started learning to use curing iron couple weeks ago and found this was the only one that was easy for me to handle curling my hair due to the design of the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Clearly, this was designed by a man.</li>
            <li>I thought i would be able to learn how to use it without burning myself at least once during each session but not so far.  </li>
            <li>Gave it 4 stars because the on/off button is sensitive (turns off) during styling.</li>
            <li>So far, no tangling.  </li>
            <li>is soft to the touch and has shine.  </li>
            <li>My old one just fell apart after years of use.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have to add that I was using a curing brush that was about 7 years old</li>
            <li>I kept my old one because you can take the end off and replace them.</li>
            <li>Only got two stars because it was delivered in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li>Professional opinion, and salon owner.</li>
            <li>the curls so soft as well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like it, the red part burns my fingers</li>
            <li>I like that there are choices for heat settings which my old model didn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li>Considering the old rod curling irons that used to burn people&#x27;s foreheads, scalp, and necks, this is nothing.  </li>
            <li>the teeth are too far apart</li>
            <li>With my old brush my hair was burned and frizzy looking after using it.</li>
            <li>I was wearing my hair in a ponytail everyday because I don&#x27;t like to straighten it which causes more frizz the next day from the damage.</li>
            <li>Since I am not handy with the traditional kind</li>
            <li>The older styles had the black bristles all around so that rarely happened.</li>
            <li>:) There are similar high priced professional hot brushes, but save your money, seriously!</li>
            <li>Even on the lowest setting, it gets WAY hotter than other hot brushes, so beware!</li>
            <li>Well, this is my first curling iron in a very long time</li>
            <li>The tool gets hot fast so be careful not to touch the red bristles or the gray iron part.</li>
            <li>Works fantastic on very straight, thin hair.  </li>
            <li>When wet, it forms  lovely waves, which dry into frizz,  the John Frieda brush smooths it out, but the barrel is too big and takes out the curl.  </li>
            <li>Then I use the hot brush and in about 5 minutes of simply brushing it through my hair (back lifting to get some shape)</li>
            <li>If that isn&#x27;t hot enough, THEN you can crank it up to the next level (which is 310).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The red hot teeth on this actually burned my scalp!</li>
            <li>This is the only curling brush where the bristles actually get hot as well as the barrel.</li>
            <li>Recently my Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush stopped working</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to the Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be for them to drop the hot red spikes.</li>
            <li>I have very thick, straight, fairly fine hair</li>
            <li>It also has a long cord which works really well.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER after going back to the normal non-heated bristle type of iron</li>
            <li>You have to be careful because the red brushes get VERY hot.</li>
            <li>yes its HOT, so be careful.</li>
            <li>Gets very very HOT, so be careful not to touch the red bristles.</li>
            <li>I have fine, limp hair in a short cut</li>
            <li>The little info pamphlet suggested heat settings for different types of hair which was helpful and accurate for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Be careful the red combs are hot!</li>
            <li>End gets very hot, so you have to twirl your hair onto it one-handed, which is a little tricky.</li>
            <li>The new one is simply a back up!</li>
            <li>However, even using it clumsily with my left hand, I did not burn myself and was able to make my hair presentable.  </li>
            <li>Wish had smaller size as I have short hair and really need the 1/2 barrel.  </li>
            <li>So I checked out similar products on Amazon and found this very modestly priced alternative.  </li>
            <li>And some dimwit decided to make every other row of bristles get hot too, so guess what?</li>
            <li>does the job quickly due to the fact that it is hot.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers, I agree that it&#x27;s extremely hot even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>It does get really hot as other reviews reported</li>
            <li>Burn myself every time I use due to hot bristles.  </li>
            <li>But the other problem with it, is that if you cannot get right up to the scalp without fear of burns, then that definitely does not work for creating volume at the roots or getting rid of cowlicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stylists generally can&#x27;t do anything acceptable (to me) with it.  </li>
            <li>Not too curly, but, since the 80s are over it is still too curly to be left completely alone.  </li>
            <li>Just bought my second one of these - still have my old one</li>
            <li>Teeth too short and too far apart, so burned my head.  </li>
            <li>I regret having spent this much money for it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you have natural volume at the roots already and really short hair - maybe then it would work for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say if you have natural volume at the roots already and really short hair - maybe then it would work for you.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife as one of her Christmas present to replace an old one from the 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>and you can scald your scalp if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>The plug is made of such soft rubber the prongs don&#x27;t stay in the outlet, bending them does not help.  </li>
            <li>After using Conair curling brushes for years I recently bought this one when my old one quit working.</li>
            <li>And when you set this down on the bathroom sink, make sure the countertop cannot be damaged by the heat because the red bristles are going to touch (I realized that when I set it down and heard a sizzle - some water I had splashed when washing hands was evaporating where the brush touched).  </li>
            <li>I feel for the first time with Conair that they have let me down and the curling iron now resides unused in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>As others have pointed out, it I can do my hair in half the time of my old Helen of Troy \\&quot;only the barrel gets hot, not the thingys\\&quot; type of brush curling iron.  </li>
            <li>All I know is it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used on my fine, thin hair, and I am disappointed to not see it sold in any of the basic stores in my area, but I see amazon has it, so I will definitely buy it from here!&lt;br</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long the new one lasts.</li>
            <li>Well, not a problem if you use the longer black bristles against your head first (like a comb).</li>
            <li>the black bristles do not get hot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this hot brush for less than 1 year.  </li>
            <li>it can&#x27;t work like other curling brushes because along with the barrel the red teeth get hot too.  </li>
            <li>i should have listened to the other reviews - REALLY hot - burned myself several times&lt;</li>
            <li>It does make hair very shiny and soft, but didn&#x27;t give a whole lot of volume to my short, thick hair.  </li>
            <li>The lowest will burn you if not very careful.</li>
            <li>I was a little surprised that the one on amazon was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Learned so much from the other reviewers  </li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that is a little past my collar bones, so maybe the length of my hair was the main problem for me, trying to use this.  </li>
            <li>The Infiniti Pro smooths out the frizz, makes my hair feel like satin instead of burlap, and gives me deep waves and soft curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li>Because it heats so fast, it&#x27;s turning out not to be as big a headache as I expected.  </li>
            <li>The handle on the tip of the brush does get a little hot, I just always remember not to hold it too close to the iron.  </li>
            <li>they weren&#x27;t sharp enough to grab my short course hair, so I used some bristles from another hot roller.</li>
            <li>I find it gets a little to hot even on&amp;#34; just on&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It has a little stand so the hot wand does not sit on the counter.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful though, it will burn your skin when the temperature is up high and you press it against your skin.</li>
            <li>The red bristles are extremely hot, while the black are not.  </li>
            <li>But it works very well to tame my natural curl/frizz, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>I have long hair which can get a bit wild when exposed to humidity or wind.  </li>
            <li>The little red bristles get superrrr hot, and you can&#x27;t hold on to it without getting burned.</li>
            <li>the cord is not very long....</li>
            <li>I searched and purchased several hot brushes for a long time but was unable to get one that would be hot enough for my very curly and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>(the old one would dry my hair) .</li>
            <li>Gets very hot and is hard to use...</li>
            <li>This curling brush gets very hot and hard to keep away from my scalp as I have short hair.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t know why they made the red brushes heat up when their other brushes heat the barrel as is normally the case.  </li>
            <li>Feel it was a much needed update, just takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>As other people comment, the red dots are hot, so you won&#x27;t want to touch it to your scalp, but it&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li>I have thin and fine short hair.</li>
            <li>If it had too many more thingys, I&#x27;m afraid it would get tangled in my mane of hair and that would be bad because, as we&#x27;ve all established the red thingy&#x27;s get really HOT!  </li>

            <li> Without reaching the successful just stepped out of the salon w</li>
            <li> I applaud Conair for coming up with hair tools that women of color can use successfully.</li>
            <li> I would really love it if they would go to a heated barrel as this the perfect size</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my hair and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works good</li>
            <li> And the brush keeps a good grip on my thich, shoulder length hairstyle.</li>
            <li> does good job, wish there was a lower setting.  </li>
            <li> Basically, just use it like the demonstrations you&#x27;ve seen of The Perfecter, and you&#x27;ll be good to go.</li>
            <li> I have loved the one I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> Another great feature I liked was a plastic piece attached that acted like a mini stand</li>
            <li> I used the Perfector for a couple of years and loved it</li>
            <li> i read all the reviews on this curling iron, and they were mostly good</li>
            <li> good price&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing</li>
            <li> It has a swivel cord that works great and a nice loooooooooong cord, which provides me with multi-functions as i curl my hair I can turn around the corner and talk to people or watch t.v.</li>
            <li> Good product....</li>
            <li> Good quality for this unit.</li>
            <li> I have been using the brush for about 4 months now and it is one of the best purchases I have made and the price is right!  </li>
            <li> Makes a perfect curl  and its quick.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and is the perfect size for me</li>
            <li> The reason I don&#x27;t give it zero stars is that I like how it has adjustable heat settings and a quick heat up plus the perfect barrel size.</li>
            <li> Best hot brush out there!  </li>
            <li> CHEAP PRICES FOR VERY GOOD</li>

            <li> the shine it brings to your hair is amazing.</li>
            <li> Did you see an infomercial for the amazing but pricey Perfecter?  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do hair either-so blow drying for a style is not an option; I have tried many times and I can&#x27;t ever get it to look good.</li>
            <li> I am kind of wishing I had just bought the Perfector instead.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> I already own one and have had it for years.  </li>
            <li> This product enabled me to do a fairly good job putting a style in my hair which made me feel lots better.  </li>
            <li> If you want a warm brush you should keep looking</li>
            <li> I really liked this</li>
            <li> If you are not too handy with hair tools, do not purchase this iron.  </li>
            <li> Thought maybe this idea of some of the combs heating was a good idea, and on most curling irons it probably would be</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> and it handles it nicely.</li>
            <li> I will update if my opinion changes but for now I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> Good curls, body, and ok straightening for straightish to kinda wavy hair, it smooths rather than straightens.  </li>
            <li> This styling brush heats up fast and does a wonderful job.  </li>
            <li> Love that it has heat settings and that this brush heats my hair more consistently...leaving great body and curl.  </li>
            <li> The Conair, Infiniti arrived quickly and works beautifully.  </li>
            <li> This is my first review but thought I should comment since so many of the reviews on this product were not the best.</li>
            <li> I found it very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are very easy to accidentally turn off.</li>
            <li> I love this product and might get one more to just have on hand in case they stop making it!  </li>
            <li> I thought I had found the perfect curling brush in the perfect size, but this thing gets entirely too hot.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT investment at a reasonable cost!!</li>
            <li> It heats up very fast and makes beautiful curls.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot and helps style my hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li> I had to replace teeth with the ones from my old curling iron, then I was happy!!</li>
            <li> Love this curling brush--lightweight, gives a nice long-lasting curl.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and this brush smooths out any frizz leaving it</li>
            <li> Love love love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very disheartening, I loved this brush!</li>
            <li> Pros:  multiple heat settings, great size, works great for my hairstyle,</li>
            <li> Not only is the price perfect but this curling brush is AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I found this ConAir Infiniti hot brush here.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this, it was great.  </li>
            <li> This hot brush is just that-takes seconds to heat up and the performance is great.</li>
            <li> This is a great hot brush.</li>
            <li> This is a great HOT curling iron.  </li>
            <li> am using it fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
            <li> and you need to watch your hands, but you get good with it quickly.  </li>
            <li> It sounded interesting</li>
            <li> may by Okay for some people,</li>
            <li> I could not even finish curling the top of my hair with this iron.  </li>
            <li> Love it..  </li>
            <li> Will keep this product, but it could be better.    </li>
            <li> The heated bristles, while requiring some extra care to use, are perfect for smoothing out frizzy hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s top to bottom, NOT bottom to top.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember how many years ago I bought it, but it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;chugging&amp;#34; away.</li>
            <li> and it is safe to use.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling brush.  </li>
            <li> So I save time, and even better, I can see a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It is in better condition/</li>
            <li> I just purchased two more.  </li>
            <li> Love this iron.</li>
            <li> I also LOVE having no 1st degree burns on my hands.</li>
            <li> This does the trick, I love it.</li>
            <li> Okay, just like Goldilocks, I tried so many.  </li>
            <li> But, I will agree with you all, that the sensitivity of this on/off button makes its location even more of a hassle.  </li>
            <li> Again, though, I am trainable and am learning not to turn it off and to check it to make sure I haven&#x27;t turned it off while I am using it.  </li>
            <li> Okay, so I give it 4 stars because it does what it should</li>
            <li> and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I really love the concept of this curling brush.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews about numerous types of curling iron/brush products that were in this lower price range, I chose this and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I bought this iron.</li>
            <li> QUALITY.I HAVE MOST CONAIR IRON</li>
            <li> Glad I got this on sale.</li>
            <li> It was OK</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Infiniti by Conair is perfect for my short, permed hair.</li>
            <li> Brush doesn&#x27;t appear to burn my hair which I love even more.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the closest that I&#x27;ve come to my favorite cutler that is no longer in production.  </li>
            <li> They need to put twice as many rows of teeth in so that you don&#x27;t burn your scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product, it provides a lasting curl.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat ok.  </li>
            <li> love this styler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love Conair products as a rule.  </li>
            <li> Love the brush-like feature that makes it easier to manage and style.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been burnt many times.</li>
            <li> I waited about a month before reviewing just to make sure.  </li>
            <li> This one is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> Because of this, I am able to better control the temperature.      </li>
            <li> Buy it I am satisfied and sets my hair well.</li>
            <li> Love it, take It with me when I get my hair cut.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I look more polished.  </li>
            <li> I always laid a comb on the scalp and the curling iron barrel on top of the comb.</li>
            <li> Great size, heats fast.  </li>
            <li> I use it more on ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I have used my styling brush 3 times this week and I love it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous Product!  </li>
            <li> I am able to do a number of styles with my hair.  </li>
            <li> LOVE THIS DEVICE.............</li>
            <li> would not dream of a better product.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Heats fast and works great.</li>
            <li> I also love the design of the switch - unlike many&lt;br /&gt;other curling irons in the market, I could use this brush to curl my hair without worrying I touch the switch/button and shut off accidental.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> What more could you ask for?  </li>
            <li> and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has lasted me a couple years or more.  </li>
            <li> i used both on my hair and this worked even better..</li>
            <li> and i never got so many compliments after i used this,</li>
            <li> and i love my hair..</li>
            <li> To keep my hair texture straight a great buy</li>
            <li> I love this curling brush.</li>
            <li> I got so many repeated hugs and thank yous for their Christmas bushes.  </li>
            <li> This iron gets HOT!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> This hot brush is a good size.  </li>
            <li> It is great for making flips at the ends and rolling the top to make big nice curls.</li>
            <li> It is also amazing for a quick refresh of your style between shampoos.  </li>
            <li> quick heat-up and nice range of temperatures.</li>
            <li> The Conair hot brush has good heat and is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I searched Amazon before buying though because this Conair product does the trick just fine.  </li>
            <li> Conair has developed a great product, try it, you will like it.</li>
            <li> The smaller diameter of the curler and the design of the teeth is really ideal for her hair because it doesnt get tangled.  </li>
            <li> I love this ceramic brush for the smooth finish</li>
            <li> The first one that I bought I have used for many many many years</li>
            <li> Grips hair well for quick, easy curls!</li>
            <li> It keeps getting turned off while using it, other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> The brush heats up fast and eliminates frizz and adds a nice healthy shine.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hang on to and I like the teeth on the curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Just received this product, but so far works very well, and adjustable heat settings are the best part of this curler.</li>
            <li> It is extremely hot based on higher settings, which is great for stubborn hair.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and the button position has been improved.  </li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, and did just what I wanted it to do.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to burn fingers until you learn to work around that.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use.</li>
            <li> This one by Conair should also have a rotating brush head for easy removal from the hair.  </li>
            <li> but it should NOT be so easy to switch the temps.  </li>
            <li> Heats up in a flash as promised and easy to use as the cord swivels.  </li>
            <li> this has made it so easy to get out the door in no time at all.</li>
            <li> The downside is the on/off switch is located on the handle in a place where it is easily turned off during use.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I wanted the 1inch, which, for some reason, is not that easy to find.</li>
            <li> I love these because they are so hot that they can put curl into my very fine stick-straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I have fine/wavy/color treated hair and this hot brush make its easy to have a nice finished/polished look.  </li>
            <li> hot brush while waiting for my order and the difference was amazing.</li>
            <li> so I love how hot this curling brush gets and the bristles are pretty good, too.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice, hot iron.</li>
            <li> I also have a problem with my right arm and this is very easy for me to use.</li>
            <li> Would be an awesome product if it came in smaller size (3/4&amp;#34;) and the on-off button were recessed/toggled instead so easy to turn off while using the brush.</li>
            <li> and it works fine.  </li>
            <li> Works fine, but don&#x27;t let it touch your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have medium length fine, but somewhat curly hair.  </li>
            <li> The best part is, I received two for the same price I paid for the first one I bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li> My hair is finely textured and I find that this brush does the job for me.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair (which is why I&#x27;m using a curling brush) and it won&#x27;t grip or hold on to my hair unless I&#x27;m all but holding my hair on it.  </li>
            <li> I baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> just in case...as I do not want to be without this tremendous product...yelps and all!</li>
            <li> I am able to do my hair rather quickly, I&#x27;d say within 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Because of the heat I can get my hair done more quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for hair like mine, thick but very fine.</li>
            <li> This brush is great for coarse or curly hair, Amazing ceramic heat source that&#x27;s gentle on my hair!</li>
            <li> It works great, leaves my hair super soft n</li>
            <li> it gets very hot!</li>
            <li> I really love this hot brush!  </li>
            <li> This hot brush does the job for a fraction of the price!:)</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair and it works great.  </li>
            <li> I am African-American, and I use a blow dryer with a comb attatchment to straighten my hair, then I smooth it out/</li>
            <li> I like the selection of temperatures and the fast warm up.</li>
            <li> Heats fast and gives your hair a nice shine.</li>
            <li> BUT my hair was still smooth, shiny, and frizz-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves the hair smooth for a while</li>
            <li> cause honestly I avoid using this one as much as I can.</li>
            <li> The digital temperature setting is a great feature and the heated bristles are a plus.</li>
            <li> liked so much replaced it with duplcate.</li>
            <li> Would be good for professional stylists, but not practical for home use, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> But I love it so much that I ordered two more,</li>
            <li> OK, burns my head if not held just right.</li>
            <li> tried making it work but burned fingers and flat hair do make for a happy girl.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other hot brushes and curling irons, but this one does the best job on my fine, but varied textured hair.  </li>
            <li> I also loke how hot it gets because it really set my hair good.</li>
            <li> I really like it and its very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The first day of use I was able to make a curl-</li>
            <li> and this is the first product that has been able to do that for me.  </li>
            <li> Was excited to find it when I decided to look for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed in the workmanship of this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many hot brushes, but they have never done the job.  </li>
            <li> I got a hot air brush instead by John Frieda, and it works much better, plus you can hold onto it.</li>
            <li> I love how fast it heats up and the quality of the curl is awsome!</li>
            <li> and I love how hot it gets.</li>
            <li> I have used many styling brushes and have never had one that was so burning hot as this one.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot brush, i grow up with one.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to find this one.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot brush.  </li>
            <li> Is it ever more HOT, I BURN MY head.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot (which my fine hair needs to attempt to hold a curl etc.).</li>
            <li> Wow, the greatest hair curling brush I&#x27;ve ever had and it lasted only 3 months.</li>
            <li> Good size and does a good curling job on my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair tool, both for straightening and for loose curls.</li>
            <li> Make sure you clean the barrel off using 99% alcohol on a towel, cleans up really well.</li>
            <li> so I was super excited.</li>
            <li> I have always used hot brushes, but I was really impressed a few days ago when a friend loaned this iron to me for an emergency touch-up.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend that much.</li>
            <li> Would probably be good for fixing bed head if you needed to be somewhere in a hurry, but I&#x27;d rather just take the time to shower and fix it properly.  </li>
            <li> The top setting it too much.  </li>
            <li> but it gives me nice soft volume waves and my hair</li>
            <li> but I use the highest and have never burned myself because of the bristles that stay cool.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m back to searching for a good quality curling iron that I can travel with.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured and just like the one I used and loved daily  for 6 years</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my new hot brush.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine with little body (except for th gray strands) and works great.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use this hot brush.</li>
            <li> However, I have managed to be able to work it without getting burned &amp; can now get ready for work pretty quickly since holding the curl for 3 seconds is all you need!</li>
            <li> Gets really hot, does the job, doesn&#x27;t get caught or knotted in your hair and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Be aware when purchasing that the metal teeth get very hot so you can burn yourself quite easily.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, first iron that puts the curl in to stay.  </li>
            <li> It may be too hot if you have fine hair</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.  </li>
            <li> durable - heats up quick..  </li>
            <li> THIS heated curler quickly does the job.</li>
            <li> it works super.</li>
            <li> Heats up as well and quickly as they say.  </li>
            <li> It heats quickly and does not tangle in hair.  </li>
            <li> I would have to agree with most other reviews that this is a pretty good curling iron.  </li>
            <li> That one, too, was designed by the same genius who thought putting the on/off button on the handles right where you grip with your fingers was a good idea.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is easy to burn yuor scalp if you are not careful, but I like the heated bristles for better styling.</li>
            <li> There are not even any warnings on the box regarding the very hot bristles.  </li>
            <li> It gets VERY hot</li>
            <li> , it does get very hot.  </li>
            <li> Beware, it can get very hot</li>
            <li> It does get very hot</li>
            <li> The settings are very hot.  </li>
            <li> This heating brush is very, very hot, even on the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> I am an X cosmologist and I am use to using a Marcel curling iron and they get very hot.</li>
            <li> tip gets very hot so that you can&#x27;t handle it ...</li>
            <li> It gets VERY hot -even without increasing the heat.  </li>
            <li> Gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> There is a cheaper hot iron available on Amazon</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gone though 3 of them because they are just cheaply made hot irons.</li>
            <li> I used the lowest setting for the first week until I was comfortable using the tool.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling brush if you want something quick, easy and to tame the frizzies!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and I set it on the second to high heat setting, and it does great.  </li>
            <li> It gets SUPER hot!</li>
            <li> I can imagine the issues someone would have if trying to curl their hair with this (the burned scalp/ears/fingers mentioned in other reviews), but if you&#x27;re simply loooking to smooth out frizz and finish your ends, this tool is PERFECT!</li>
            <li> Because of the hot bristles it grabs the hair and really creates a lovely effect.  </li>
            <li> It heats up vey fast, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This iron gets VERY hot, but if you are careful to protect your finger tips, it does a good curl job QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> so hot it burned my hair off!</li>
            <li> The heated bristles are HOT!  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast though!!</li>
            <li> This one gets HOT!  </li>
            <li> As soon as I read the review on it; that it was too hot!</li>
            <li> a curling iron brush that gets hot!  </li>
            <li> It works great and never got too hot like some of the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have fine, stubbornly straight hair</li>
            <li> I love the temperature settings and it works like a professional hot brush!</li>
            <li> Personally, I think it&#x27;s an amazing product.</li>
            <li> thanks to Amazon for making the process stress free.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this product earlier when traveling a lot for business as I could have had this in my handy computer bag on the road.</li>
            <li> love this tool many thanks once again to Amazon for making it possible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> this is the second one I bought, I found one in a retail store and liked it</li>
            <li> but they never get warm enough and they take forever to heat up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid forties and have used every kind of curling iron under the sun since I was 13.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I kept my old one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true it gets hot</li>
            <li> and it does tend to burn fingers more than my old one did.</li>
            <li> was well worth the satisfaction</li>
            <li> This baby is Hot Hot Hot!!  </li>
            <li> Luckily, it heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is that the ends of the bristles are very hot and it is very easy to burn yourself.</li>
            <li> Sturdy, weighty...heats up quickly and gets really hot .  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> It gets super hot.</li>
            <li> THIS HOT BRUSH HEATS UP QUICKLY AND GIVES YOUR HAIR LOTS OF CURLS OR BODY...</li>
            <li> This is a fine product, except for one huge design flaw - the on/off &amp; temperature setting are right on the handle, and you barely have to touch the button to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> but it does have a learning curve to use as it gets very hot and you will burn your fingers at first</li>
            <li> First of all, it does get very hot.</li>
            <li> Also the on/off button is right where you put your hand to use it</li>
            <li> This iron does the job, and end result holds well along with the right styling products.  </li>
            <li> Also, the control buttons are right where I put my thumb.  </li>
            <li> The on/off button is right where your fingers hit when trying to use on your hair resulting in you</li>
            <li> I went onto Amazon and found this one right away.  </li>
            <li> just right</li>
            <li> I pretty much solved that problem by going to Sally&#x27;s and buying a cheap hot-glove.  </li>
            <li> No other line or brand of curling iron has ever been able to do that before.  </li>
            <li> but since I found it again for such a good price got a new one</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, this curling iron is ideal relaxing curls for a less frizzy look.  </li>
            <li> This item  works great with hard to curl hair because it can become very hot.</li>
            <li> The cord is nice and long and it swivels .</li>
            <li> Works really fast and well on my straight, fine hair without getting stuck or burning ends.</li>
            <li> I think it takes away the frizz, so that is nice, but I don&#x27;t feel like the curl lasts very long.  </li>
            <li> I drive an hour to work and wanted something that heated up fast and did the job quickly.</li>
            <li> as with the more expensive Protector Fusion, the ion technology of the InfinitiPro gives curly hair a great smoothness and shine.</li>
            <li> This product looses heat very fast while curling hair and the on/off switch is located in a place where it is easily bumped, thus often turning the iron completely off while in use.</li>
            <li> I really do not believe their is a better comb like curling iron than this!</li>
            <li> It does get very hot which works very well for my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Be cautious and you will be fine, do not allow kids near it.  </li>
            <li> These are hard to find and they are great.  </li>
            <li> Adds body and leaves a soft end curl I want that often lasts all day under most conditions, even though my hair has been the oily type that can go flat easily.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t wrap your hair around it without touching the heated red brissles.</li>
            <li> I almost burned myself with this hot brush, they&#x27;re not kidding when they say HOT BRUSH.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t need anything this hot to wave your hair......</li>
            <li> Count me in with those who say it is too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li> This product, Infiniti by Conair, BC2, curling iron brush, was way too hot, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> This unit gets really hot, even at its lowest setting (there are four settings).  </li>
            <li> turn the ends under with a hot brush.</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it burned my scalp, neck and fingers.  </li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> It does the job that I wanted it to do in place of using hot curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked well the first couple of times I used it, but now it seems to have no effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> It also had three exact heating temperatures and the cord is made not to tangle when in use.</li>
            <li> The bristles heat up and get extremely hot</li>
            <li> the tip does not get hot, either.</li>
            <li> This curling brush has burned me many times, gotten stuck in my hair on several occasions, and turned off every time I have used it.</li>
            <li> This unit gets so hot it singes hair.  </li>
            <li> This brush iron is too hot.  </li>
            <li> it does get hot.</li>
            <li> but evidently they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li> The bristles (which are not flexible) heat up really hot.  </li>
            <li> If you want a Hot brush this is the one for you.  </li>
            <li> It was too hot.</li>
            <li> The longer bristles work much better for curling hair than short bristles.  </li>
            <li> The brush gets really hot</li>
            <li> Not any hotter than a hot iron gets</li>
            <li> GETS TO HOT.</li>
            <li> First thing, I burned my finger, even after experimenting with the curler not turned on.</li>
            <li> Wish I could find this exact one in a 3/4\\&quot; barrel.</li>
            <li> Practice will help so you don&#x27;t touch any of the hot comb tips.  </li>
            <li> And this is my first review ever.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my hot brush for approx.</li>
            <li> As top hair is thinning so only have on 330 setting.  </li>
            <li> I have NEVER had a curling iron that got so hot (on the lowest &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34;--- just &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;) and burned like this one.</li>
            <li> BUT this units heats up so HOT</li>
            <li> I did give it 4 stars but only because I love these types of curling irons because they don&#x27;t flatten your hair</li>
            <li> I have purchased RENAC irons and they also get hot</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this hot brush.  </li>
            <li> I will give it another try, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this type of hot brush.</li>
            <li> The wand is heavier than my Helen of Troy plastic hot air brush http://amzn.to/1Mkmgyl (which I reviewed as a &amp;#34;warm air brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot, but you can regulate your heat preference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hot and can burn fingertips.</li>
            <li> It can damage your hair if you raise it any higher.</li>
            <li> Too hot even at lowest setting.</li>
            <li> , as everyone is saying, it does, indeed, get so hot</li>
            <li> This thing really heats up!  </li>
            <li> I have had no issues with tangling and it gets hot Fast!  </li>
            <li> I also love the different heat settings option.  </li>
            <li> Nice, butbe careful picks get HOT</li>
            <li> The controls are push buttons located on the handle, so if you don&#x27;t hold it in exactly the correct position, the buttons are bumped and the iron is turned off.  </li>
            <li> If your life has enough petty annoyances without adding more, avoid this styling brush like the plague.  </li>
            <li> It helps calm the frizz and relax her hair into gentle wavy curls.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll more than likely get burned a couple of times before you figure out how to hold this.  </li>
            <li> I love the multiple heating options on this.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, this is my third one that I have purchased already.</li>
            <li> However, if you have short hair and are used to using a curling brush that touches the scalp, it will burn you.&lt;br /&gt;Would be great for long hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried it I burned my fingers and my neck.  </li>
            <li> First one lasted 5 months.</li>
            <li> It still does work, but doesn&#x27;t get as hot.</li>
            <li> Overall I prefer this hot tool over many others.</li>
            <li> You can just see the hot steam coming from it.  </li>
            <li> I returned it because every row gets hot and it burned me.  </li>
            <li> I wanted the 1/2 hot brush</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking but could not find in the stores</li>
            <li> I had to get used to the hot bristles</li>
            <li> It does exactly what my wife wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> I must admit that at first couple of times of using it, I did accidentally touch my ears with the hot brush</li>
            <li> You will eventually notice you hair not curly so well and will have to reheat hot brush and start that section over again.</li>
            <li> Not a brush with traditional brissels, but rather more like teeth.  </li>
            <li> Be sure t only hold it by the handle and tip</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it too hot, and burns your fingers regardless of thermal gloves</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any problems with it being too hot.  </li>
            <li> Maybe because lots of my hair that I lose once and while coats the brush so that it&#x27;s not as hot.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember it being that hot</li>
            <li> when I first got it.  </li>
            <li> she spent that kind of money when she saw my hair..</li>
            <li> I tried several times to make my longish hair into the ringlets everyone wears, and I started at the top like it said in the reviews.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair hot brush , it lasted for</li>
            <li> It heats almost immediately, the little \\&quot;nubs\\&quot; are a plus as I have baby fine hair and have always gotten tangled hairs as I&#x27;ve tried to keep the hair wrapped around the more inferior brands, this one grips it</li>
            <li> and it can be easily handled with bare hands.</li>
            <li> This works more like a flat iron and straightens.</li>
            <li> Although I have suffered some small burns figuring out how to use this type of iron the results are awesome and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Keep</li>
            <li> The problem with this hot brush it that it is much too hot to use when on even at the lowest temperature setting.  </li>
            <li> i was really hoping to be able to curl my hair back and out of my face.  </li>
            <li> Excellent for thick coarse hair..</li>
            <li> Good hot brush, it does the same as a flat iron.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and at the high heat it gets very hot.</li>
            <li> My only problem with this hot brush is that when wrapping your hair around it, its fairly easy to burn your fingertips.</li>
            <li> No hair tangles, super hot, makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> You do get used to where and how to use it - after getting burned a couple of times, it didn&#x27;t take long to learn...:)    </li>
            <li> straight so in order to curl it as well as give it body, I need something that gets fairly hot.  </li>
            <li> I really dislike it because it is so hot</li>
            <li> Gets very hot and have to be careful with it - it will burn you quite easily.</li>
            <li> Heats up very quickly and gets very hot,  If you are careful.</li>
            <li> Wow!  gets hot!  </li>
            <li> Heats nearly instantly -- very long cord -- many heat settings.  </li>
            <li> teeth on the iron are too short and you easily burn your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> I have to grab a lock, wrap the hair around the rod, smooth it out, then go on to the next section, always avoiding the hot prongs.  </li>
            <li> It curls my straight thin hair beautifully...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not as good for short hair as it is for long.</li>
            <li> After being curled previously with regular iron, the brush works great</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush daily for about six months, and I have medium length, straight-ish, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li> have fine hair, and just a couple of second combing it</li>
            <li> I have fine, short hair and the 1&amp;#34; curling brush was what I kept searching for since the 1&amp;#34; Belson is no longer made.  </li>
            <li> This certainly does the job and has made my morning much simpler.</li>
            <li> This tool is great for very thick course hair types.</li>
            <li> next time I think I will spend a little more to get a better one.</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy after blow drying.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t plan on getting too much curl</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It works very well and the results are satisfactory.</li>
            <li> It is a shame because it is otherwise very well made.</li>
            <li> But I have curly hair &amp; it really controls it well.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed because even on the lowest setting it can burn your scalp.</li>
            <li> It also heats up so much faster than I am accustomed to--within 60 seconds.  </li>
            <li> what \\&quot;Tourmaline Ceramic Hot...\\&quot; really means, you may not be ready for theconcept of this brush.  </li>
            <li> I keep it away from my scalp and hold on to the very tip of it with my fingers when curling.</li>
            <li> I really recommend not purchasing this.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and need the brush tines to help pull out the curl to help straighten it.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I manage with it, but VERY gingerly.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Love this one, turns off by itself on the occasion of being forgetful</li>
            <li> Really like this.</li>
            <li> Next, I&#x27;m trying the cheap Revlon RV454.</li>
            <li> So - treat it gently and pack bubble wrap around it in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> Use every day at home and light and sturdy enough to tote to gym .</li>
            <li> But for some reason, this thing really works.</li>
            <li> I liked the fact that you can clean the black and red prongs as they do get coated with hair product over time just beware to use the correct screwdriver to avoid stripping the screw end.  </li>
            <li> It is a fast way to pouf my hair</li>
            <li> The range of heat settings really make this curling iron flexible.  </li>
            <li> It makes curling my hair much easier than using a blow dryer and brush.</li>
            <li> Tons of curl in a fast time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because otherwise it works really well.  </li>
            <li> If you donâ€™t work as fast as I do put it on a lower setting, here is a trick you can do</li>
            <li> it is very unsatisfactory</li>
            <li> Infiniti pro works really well.</li>
            <li> I like the various setting choices available and</li>
            <li> This is made very well.  </li>
            <li> We have spent many days looking for this type of product.  </li>
            <li> it arrived fast</li>
            <li> the only thing it does is straighten all the frizzies out nicely, and give a tiny flip at the ends.  </li>
            <li> You do have to take some care when putting it near your face since the alternate rows of red bristles do get hot, and the rounded tip also gets pretty warm.  </li>
            <li> I gave it 2 stars because it did curl my hair nicely the few times</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough and the brush spikes are not long enough to really get a good grip on the hair</li>
            <li> HOWEVER, the red bristles get SUPER HOT as they are heated, not just the ceramic.</li>
            <li> other than that, i have not been able to do real curls.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a seam right at the bottom of the barrel that will rip your hair right out if it gets in there - even if you are saavy enough to not get your hair tangled in the bristles to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Also, I use it on the lowest heat as it&#x27;s hot enough for my fine hair and don&#x27;t hold it too long unless you want a super curly do.  </li>
            <li> I love using this nano brush so much, when my last one wore out I bought another one exactly the same.</li>
            <li> way better than any other curling iron.  </li>
            <li> If you have struggled day after day to do your hair with the old Helen of Troy tool, you&#x27;ll know when you are ready for something that is HOT and fast.  </li>
            <li> I remember when the electric ceramic flat iron became available and revolutionized the industry.</li>
            <li> Read the other reviews which give some interesting tips.</li>
            <li> Other brushes are meant for people that have more hair.</li>
            <li> my best friend is so mad..</li>
            <li> Nice product, well made, sturdy, maybe a little large and heavy for someone who is more frail.  </li>
            <li> Most other curling brush iron&#x27;s little brush pieces come off so quickly, and seem so cheap.  </li>
            <li> The glove I purchased has tiny holes that the teeth on this just love to go through, therefore I still have to be careful, but the glove helps tremendously.  </li>
            <li> I also love the slightly bigger barrel-most of the irons available are 3/4\\&quot;, not a full inch.</li>
            <li> I have a high end straightener and this curling brush is really impressing me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bristles get too hot to be so near the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 60&#x27;s and have no problem using this nor any problems with it being too hot or burning my skin.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised that this hot brush is allowed on the market.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I needed for my naturally curly ethnic hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend starting out at the lowest setting to start and touching only the very end/tip when wrapping your hair around it.</li>
            <li> It does get really hot though, and that is the problem with most other curling brushes - they don&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I have very fine, limp hair, and this curling brush is the answer to my prayers.</li>
            <li> But because so, it curls so quickly that I only hold the curl for about two or three seconds.  </li>
            <li> I thought, mom is getting older, maybe its just her.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m clever like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s HOT, but sometime you just need HOT to do the job properly.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this hot brush if you need one that gets hot.  </li>
            <li> It gets too hot and there is no reason for the red bristles to be hot.  </li>
            <li> It does get hot, and the red bristles get hot,</li>
            <li> I recently purchase the, &amp;#34;Tourmaline Ceramic Hot Brush by Conair,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> The hot brush is exactly what I wanted and need for my current hair style.  </li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings.</li>
            <li> I tried using it again two more times and finally just put it back in the box and returned</li>
            <li> super &#x3D;-short</li>
            <li> I did not get a tight enough curl to use it on freshly  shamooed hair, but I have very  fine hair and this may be the reason.  </li>
            <li> It was VERY hot and after burning myself several times, i gave up.</li>
            <li> and I used only the very first setting.  </li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the hang of using it without burning myself as it does get very very hot but the curls really last!</li>
            <li> I think that length of hair is too long for this, because you can&#x27;t really just brush through your hair with it and then quickly curl it, unless you want to get your hair all tangled up in it.  </li>
            <li> Five stars...recommend highly.</li>
            <li> This is replacing a Conair Infiniti I bought MANY years ago and have been looking locally for several years to replace as my old one got so much use and wear and tear that the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; had started to break off.</li>
            <li> This is a high quality curler</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, and I plan on buying a &#x27;spare&#x27; one soon, just</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t use this on anyone other than yourself, it can burn too easily, without you knowing it, when using on someone else.</li>
            <li> The wand is not bulky like other curling tools, which makes it easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Although I love hot brushes, this one is hard to use.</li>
            <li> Too bad because if it weren&#x27;t for that it might have been the perfect curling brush.</li>
            <li> It may be okay for some but its too narrow for me.</li>
            <li> I read most of the negative reviews about this styling brush and every one I read had to do with the iron/brush getting too hot.  </li>
            <li> When I first tried this one, I did burn the tip of my fingers and when it would actually barely touch my scalp, you&#x27;d hear a yelp out of me.  </li>
            <li> I get a much better result just spraying them with water and blow drying with a round brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that the short red bristles get hot.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve used other hot brushes, they did not heat up as fast &amp; hot as this can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you can get the hair on the brush, I expect it works all right, but I don&#x27;t have enough fingers to continue experimenting.  </li>
            <li> Some Einstein put this button in the middle of the handle, right where you hold onto it.  </li>
            <li> And the controls are easy to accidentally turn off as you are using the curling iron (I average about four times per use).  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use, heats up quickly and only takes a few minutes to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> the long cord.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes stay warm, not hot, while in use</li>
            <li> With my older one, only the rod was hot, not the brush tips.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I actually gave myself a headache for hours from touching my scalp a few times during the first use.  </li>
            <li> I will need a new one soon.</li>
            <li> I hope the designers will develop a new handle.  </li>
            <li> I retired from the cosmetology business decades ago but still keep up with new equipment.</li>
            <li> I saw no place to order new teeth for maintenance.   </li>
            <li> I wanted to try the new ceramic style brush</li>
            <li> The reason I had to buy a new is because the teeth on the curling iron break off and I can&#x27;t replace them.</li>
            <li> Replacing this one with a  new one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good curling iron with the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; and various heat settings.</li>
            <li> As being short there is not much hair between iron and scalp to buffer the heat on scalp so is top &#x27;just&#x27; before the iron touches scalp.  </li>
            <li> A very classy, well-made appliance.</li>
            <li> Also, the on/ off button is on the handle and it is very sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly short, fine, and somewhat thin on top</li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase even though reviews of the larger barrel model were not positive.</li>
            <li> It grows forward on 1 side which has less hair and straight down growth on the other with more hair, the top grows forward.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> As with any hot tool, it should be handled with care as the red prongs heat up.</li>
            <li> I recently purchase the Infiniti by Conair BC2 1\\&quot; Tourmaline Ceramic Hot Brush.  </li>
            <li> I simply diffuse it and then use the hot brush to style it....</li>
            <li> hot almost instantly</li>
            <li> But I was a nervous wreck trying to avoid getting burned by the red hot combing teeth.</li>
            <li> It gets hot almost instantly.</li>
            <li> And was hot enough for me just turning it on.</li>
            <li> It gets incredibly hot, even on low, and that worried me.  </li>
            <li> Also, then end tip gets really hot and mine fell off after about a year or two of constant use.</li>
            <li> As everyone else has said, the red plastic brushes get WAY too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li> Yes, this curling iron gets hot enough to burn you and yes the on/off button will cut off while using it</li>
            <li> This gets hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have actually both a couple infiniti hot brush for my friends.</li>
            <li> The others I have tried just do not get hot enough.    </li>
            <li> I agree that the red tines are hot, so users must take care in use.  </li>
            <li> I can remember getting some gloves to use this curling iron when I first got it years back.  </li>
            <li> Various heat settings &amp; use with care as it does get quite hot</li>
            <li> So, I purchased this for $25 at our local Ultra, having seen it on display there for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Except for this unit being hot, it works the same way, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> When and if any thing happens to this one I will buy the exact same one over and over again!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It gets extremely hot even on the low setting.</li>
            <li> The problem is that it is so hot that I cannot use it, even on the low setting.</li>
            <li> For years I have looked for products that can be used on my hair, none of them where hot enough until I tried this one.</li>
            <li> Because you can use this as a flat iron to smooth out your hair, you can also curl it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the over-all effect of the curls was just not as pretty as I get by using a regular 1 1/4\\&quot; barrel clamp</li>
            <li> This gets hot enough to curl and straighten  my hair.  </li>
            <li> which is why I gave it two stars instead of one), but it gets insanely HOT; burned my scalp in several places.  </li>
            <li> Just turn it on and it gets hot enough without adjusting the heat settings.  </li>
            <li> the hot and cold brushes works good during curling</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest setting it is very hot, be careful not to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> Careful as it gets very hot, but does the job.</li>
            <li> Look at the picture - the red bristles get hot, the black ones stay cool.  </li>
            <li> There is definitely a learning curve involved in using this brush as the red brushes are what heat up and they get very hot....</li>
            <li> and I have always wanted to smooth it out a little yet leaving some lofty curls at the end of my hair</li>
            <li> I was having a hard time finding this in the stores, so was so glad to see it online.  </li>
            <li> It was actually hard for me to find many others</li>
            <li> I started learning to use curing iron couple weeks ago and found this was the only one that was easy for me to handle curling my hair due to the design of the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Clearly, this was designed by a man.</li>
            <li> I thought i would be able to learn how to use it without burning myself at least once during each session but not so far.  </li>
            <li> Gave it 4 stars because the on/off button is sensitive (turns off) during styling.</li>
            <li> So far, no tangling.  </li>
            <li> is soft to the touch and has shine.  </li>
            <li> My old one just fell apart after years of use.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have to add that I was using a curing brush that was about 7 years old</li>
            <li> I kept my old one because you can take the end off and replace them.</li>
            <li> Only got two stars because it was delivered in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> Professional opinion, and salon owner.</li>
            <li> the curls so soft as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it, the red part burns my fingers</li>
            <li> I like that there are choices for heat settings which my old model didn&#x27;t have.  </li>
            <li> Considering the old rod curling irons that used to burn people&#x27;s foreheads, scalp, and necks, this is nothing.  </li>
            <li> the teeth are too far apart</li>
            <li> With my old brush my hair was burned and frizzy looking after using it.</li>
            <li> I was wearing my hair in a ponytail everyday because I don&#x27;t like to straighten it which causes more frizz the next day from the damage.</li>
            <li> Since I am not handy with the traditional kind</li>
            <li> The older styles had the black bristles all around so that rarely happened.</li>
            <li> :) There are similar high priced professional hot brushes, but save your money, seriously!</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest setting, it gets WAY hotter than other hot brushes, so beware!</li>
            <li> Well, this is my first curling iron in a very long time</li>
            <li> The tool gets hot fast so be careful not to touch the red bristles or the gray iron part.</li>
            <li> Works fantastic on very straight, thin hair.  </li>
            <li> When wet, it forms  lovely waves, which dry into frizz,  the John Frieda brush smooths it out, but the barrel is too big and takes out the curl.  </li>
            <li> Then I use the hot brush and in about 5 minutes of simply brushing it through my hair (back lifting to get some shape)</li>
            <li> If that isn&#x27;t hot enough, THEN you can crank it up to the next level (which is 310).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The red hot teeth on this actually burned my scalp!</li>
            <li> This is the only curling brush where the bristles actually get hot as well as the barrel.</li>
            <li> Recently my Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush stopped working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to the Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be for them to drop the hot red spikes.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, straight, fairly fine hair</li>
            <li> It also has a long cord which works really well.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER after going back to the normal non-heated bristle type of iron</li>
            <li> You have to be careful because the red brushes get VERY hot.</li>
            <li> yes its HOT, so be careful.</li>
            <li> Gets very very HOT, so be careful not to touch the red bristles.</li>
            <li> I have fine, limp hair in a short cut</li>
            <li> The little info pamphlet suggested heat settings for different types of hair which was helpful and accurate for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Be careful the red combs are hot!</li>
            <li> End gets very hot, so you have to twirl your hair onto it one-handed, which is a little tricky.</li>
            <li> The new one is simply a back up!</li>
            <li> However, even using it clumsily with my left hand, I did not burn myself and was able to make my hair presentable.  </li>
            <li> Wish had smaller size as I have short hair and really need the 1/2 barrel.  </li>
            <li> So I checked out similar products on Amazon and found this very modestly priced alternative.  </li>
            <li> And some dimwit decided to make every other row of bristles get hot too, so guess what?</li>
            <li> does the job quickly due to the fact that it is hot.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers, I agree that it&#x27;s extremely hot even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> It does get really hot as other reviews reported</li>
            <li> Burn myself every time I use due to hot bristles.  </li>
            <li> But the other problem with it, is that if you cannot get right up to the scalp without fear of burns, then that definitely does not work for creating volume at the roots or getting rid of cowlicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stylists generally can&#x27;t do anything acceptable (to me) with it.  </li>
            <li> Not too curly, but, since the 80s are over it is still too curly to be left completely alone.  </li>
            <li> Just bought my second one of these - still have my old one</li>
            <li> Teeth too short and too far apart, so burned my head.  </li>
            <li> I regret having spent this much money for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you have natural volume at the roots already and really short hair - maybe then it would work for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say if you have natural volume at the roots already and really short hair - maybe then it would work for you.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as one of her Christmas present to replace an old one from the 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and you can scald your scalp if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> The plug is made of such soft rubber the prongs don&#x27;t stay in the outlet, bending them does not help.  </li>
            <li> After using Conair curling brushes for years I recently bought this one when my old one quit working.</li>
            <li> And when you set this down on the bathroom sink, make sure the countertop cannot be damaged by the heat because the red bristles are going to touch (I realized that when I set it down and heard a sizzle - some water I had splashed when washing hands was evaporating where the brush touched).  </li>
            <li> I feel for the first time with Conair that they have let me down and the curling iron now resides unused in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, it I can do my hair in half the time of my old Helen of Troy \\&quot;only the barrel gets hot, not the thingys\\&quot; type of brush curling iron.  </li>
            <li> All I know is it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used on my fine, thin hair, and I am disappointed to not see it sold in any of the basic stores in my area, but I see amazon has it, so I will definitely buy it from here!&lt;br</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the new one lasts.</li>
            <li> Well, not a problem if you use the longer black bristles against your head first (like a comb).</li>
            <li> the black bristles do not get hot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hot brush for less than 1 year.  </li>
            <li> it can&#x27;t work like other curling brushes because along with the barrel the red teeth get hot too.  </li>
            <li> i should have listened to the other reviews - REALLY hot - burned myself several times&lt;</li>
            <li> It does make hair very shiny and soft, but didn&#x27;t give a whole lot of volume to my short, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> The lowest will burn you if not very careful.</li>
            <li> I was a little surprised that the one on amazon was so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Learned so much from the other reviewers  </li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that is a little past my collar bones, so maybe the length of my hair was the main problem for me, trying to use this.  </li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro smooths out the frizz, makes my hair feel like satin instead of burlap, and gives me deep waves and soft curls that last all day.  </li>
            <li> Because it heats so fast, it&#x27;s turning out not to be as big a headache as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The handle on the tip of the brush does get a little hot, I just always remember not to hold it too close to the iron.  </li>
            <li> they weren&#x27;t sharp enough to grab my short course hair, so I used some bristles from another hot roller.</li>
            <li> I find it gets a little to hot even on&amp;#34; just on&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It has a little stand so the hot wand does not sit on the counter.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful though, it will burn your skin when the temperature is up high and you press it against your skin.</li>
            <li> The red bristles are extremely hot, while the black are not.  </li>
            <li> But it works very well to tame my natural curl/frizz, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> I have long hair which can get a bit wild when exposed to humidity or wind.  </li>
            <li> The little red bristles get superrrr hot, and you can&#x27;t hold on to it without getting burned.</li>
            <li> the cord is not very long....</li>
            <li> I searched and purchased several hot brushes for a long time but was unable to get one that would be hot enough for my very curly and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> (the old one would dry my hair) .</li>
            <li> Gets very hot and is hard to use...</li>
            <li> This curling brush gets very hot and hard to keep away from my scalp as I have short hair.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t know why they made the red brushes heat up when their other brushes heat the barrel as is normally the case.  </li>
            <li> Feel it was a much needed update, just takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> As other people comment, the red dots are hot, so you won&#x27;t want to touch it to your scalp, but it&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li> I have thin and fine short hair.</li>
            <li> If it had too many more thingys, I&#x27;m afraid it would get tangled in my mane of hair and that would be bad because, as we&#x27;ve all established the red thingy&#x27;s get really HOT!  </li>
            <li> only the red ones get hot, and they are shorter so it is harder to get your fingers down in there.  </li>
            <li> and though I like the extra body from it - sometimes I really need to tame it.</li>
            <li> However,the WAY short red bristles cause it to lay flat next to your scalp and burn you.</li>
            <li> The barrel is a little to large to curl my natural, but thinner and less curl with age, curly/wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have a slight amount of curl, wave, frizz in my hair and this brush smooths it right down</li>
            <li> I saw a late night TV show selling a MUCH more expensive version of a hot ion brush.  </li>
            <li> A flat iron is the only thing that will work.  </li>
            <li> I believe at least once if not twice, but not very badly.  </li>
            <li> but it was all during my learning how to use it right, but, it really could be avoided if I did it slowly with small amount of hair each time.</li>
            <li> Some were too hot, some were too cold, but this was was JUST RIGHT for my hair.  </li>
            <li> For very long thick curly hair, this actually does not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> it gets really hot, because half the time it&#x27;s cooling down because the heat is off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a lot of curling irons and hot brushes over the years, and have yet to get one that I didn&#x27;t accidentally burn myself at least once with them, but that&#x27;s why they all come with the WARNING labels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much these do</li>
            <li> It does get hot and you have to be careful not to touch the red rods but does not seem to have anymore of an adverse effect on my hair than others I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> Yes, the short red bristles heat up, but if you are careful when working with your short strands, you shouldn&#x27;t get burned.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For me flat irons don&#x27;t work for my hair.</li>
            <li> That was long enough to create a curl, but some of them would have the bottoms of the curls looking crimpy-like</li>
            <li> The on and off switch is a real problem, like so many other hot curling products I have tried, they put them in the worst possible place--right where you hold the brush in your hand--leading to accidentally turning it off numerous times during the curling process.</li>
            <li> The higher heat means I can style my hair faster, instead of SLOWLY \\&quot;cooking\\&quot; my hair into place.    </li>
            <li> The buttons on the handle are ridiculous, you cannot use this without hitting them and turning it off while you style, and the red bristles that heat are way too hot.</li>
            <li> Finally a real hot brush that can tame even my thick African American hair.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I have very thick &amp; course hair</li>
            <li> This one did not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I thought it couldnt be that bad, but it really isnt comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> and I will save this old one to replace any of the teeth rows that might go missing next time!</li>
            <li> At this point it is a wildly wavey frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> Usually I  blow out my wet hair and smooth it with a round brush and then curl it.</li>
            <li> It seems a little heavier than other brushes I&#x27;ve used but the weigh is well balanced and gives the brush a very solid/well built feel.</li>
            <li> Yes, the red thingys get got, but they are shorter than the black thingys which is generally all that touches my head.  </li>
            <li> even tried my bangs with it, which are only about 3\\&quot; long, but that also gave a very poor result that was just too curly, even with only the lowest heat setting and quickly curling the hair with it, vs. holding it there.</li>
            <li> It made my hair crazy shiny, which I LOVE (</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find one of these.</li>
            <li> The next time I used it I tried to be really careful</li>
            <li> I can do my hair in about 8 - 10 minutes because you don&#x27;t have to hold it for long.</li>
            <li> Be careful as the bristles are short</li>
            <li> But for long hair, the burning problems everyone talks about are not an issue.</li>
            <li> Never before have I had curl hold for so long.  </li>
            <li> Now, for some unknown reason, it will only heat up one notch.  </li>
            <li> be careful of the red teeth, they heats up</li>
            <li> I also like that it has a long cord.  </li>
            <li> After using this several times and getting burnt, I finally broke down and bought The Perfecter.</li>
            <li> Only lasted a year because black (longer) bristles are fragile and break off .  </li>
            <li> Now for the problem:  you cannot wrap your hair all the way to the scalp because if the red bristles touch your scalp you get burned so you can&#x27;t get the lift you might want by applying heat at the base of the hair, and the spacing of the red and black bristles are enough that it easily happens - because of the spacing, the longer black ones do not protect you from the shorter hot ones.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how well it would work on long hair, but I have short-ish hair, just below my ears, and this iron allows me to let it dry naturally and then run this iron through it in just a few minutes and look like I spent a long time fixing it.</li>
            <li> I bought this model for other people who have different hair types and they like it also.</li>
            <li> The highest setting keeps my hair locked into place all day long!  </li>
            <li> My other heated curling brushes only heat the barrel</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have to be held in the hair very long.</li>
            <li> The second time I tried being very careful and was still burned on my neck and ears.  </li>
            <li> Now I just let my hair air dry after washing it.  </li>
            <li> But I found I can air dry</li>
            <li> I use it every day after I have blown dry my hair to basically smooth&lt;br /&gt;it out.</li>
            <li> My main complaint is the position of the buttons on the handle.</li>
            <li> 2nd time I had to replace cuz the little teeth starting falling off and leaving several rows of the black teeth gone...still useable</li>
            <li> Other reviews mentioned burning, but you would really have to work hard to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> By the end of the day, the curls were admittedly not quite as loose as they had been</li>
            <li> After a short time I can use it until it cools down.  </li>
            <li> I came here to find it online since mine is finally breaking down.  </li>
            <li> Circumference is a little bigger than my ancient model, but it&#x27;s working as long as I don&#x27;t get my hair cut any shorter.  </li>
            <li> I live in a dry climate, but the lack of humidity doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t still have frizzies.</li>
            <li> The red ones are shorter than the black ones.  </li>
            <li> Her previous one lasted for years (different brand).  </li>
            <li> I recently had several small surgeries on my right hand which made it impossible for me to style my hair as usual with a blow dryer/brush since I&#x27;m right handed.  </li>
            <li> My hair slides right through the combs on the brush and it is pretty worthless for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> But then again, with hair like that, wouldn&#x27;t it just be way easier to spray it with water and blow dry with a round brush, or actually, with hair like that</li>
            <li> But then again, with hair like that, wouldn&#x27;t it just be way easier to spray it with water and blow dry with a round brush, or actually, with hair like that</li>
            <li> I have thin, fine hard to style hair but not a lot of it.  </li>
            <li> Other brushes just do not get hot enough to curl my difficult, fuzzy hair, so i&#x27;m giving this one a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Additionally, when trying to wrap your hair onto the brush, you can burn your hand if it touches the red bristles (and its hard not to even with an open palm being used to hold the hair against the brush as you wind).  </li>
            <li> You have to be extremely careful when using it</li>
            <li> I also find when I wrap my hair around the iron and only for 4 seconds, my hair is stuck causing me to panic and pull my hair out a few strands at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it is very difficult to find a curling iron that gets hot enough to reach all parts of my hair without parting it into tiny sections that take forever..  </li>
            <li> Like everyone else has stated, you have to be careful where you put your fingers and also not hold it too close to your head either.</li>
            <li> I am careful not to get too close to my scalp now.  </li>
            <li> , they fluff it up.   </li>
            <li> Carefully hold the tip at the end of the curling wand.</li>
            <li> so be careful its not too close to the scalp.</li>
            <li> &amp; if I&#x27;m patient &amp; careful I just might not burn myself.</li>
            <li> I could not use it on my hair because everytime I would try and curl a hair strand round it, I would accidently touch the red teeth combs and burn my hand.  </li>
            <li> and I just hold the curl for a few seconds before moving onto the next section.</li>
            <li> At the second setting, I tried to wrap my hair around this curling brush,and the red bristles were so hot, it was impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to describe what I mean, but since the black bristles are longer, if you pick up a piece of hair and place the brush next to your scalp with a row of black bristles touching your scalp, and then slowly comb up and out, you get a lot of lift &amp; volume without getting burned.</li>
            <li> Even worse, there were tiny sections not curled at all, because it&#x27;s hard to lift complete sections when you&#x27;re having to use a glove vs. your bare hands.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, especially when it is humid I have to tame this mane.  </li>
            <li> as the other reviewers mentioned, so be careful.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, coarse Caucasian hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of The Perfecter based on the reviews I read here and on other websites.  </li>
            <li> will say that it took me a while to get used to using it without turning it \\&quot;OFF\\&quot; while using it due to the location of the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; \\&quot;OFF\\&quot; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will put all my other irons in a box and save for emergencies.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews, I have had no issues with the power on/off button on the handle or with the heating elements.  </li>
            <li> not like the other curling irons where the barrel heats up.  </li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is  the every other row of heated bristles.  </li>
            <li> Plus, I prefer my hair to be loosely curled rather than tightly curled.</li>
            <li> Be very careful.  </li>
            <li> You have to be very careful not to burn yourself.  </li>
            <li> I say that if you buy it, please try to be very careful that you don&#x27;t get burned.  </li>
            <li> Even just to wrap the ends of your hair around the rod, you have to be very careful</li>
            <li> , I blow my hair dry and throw in a few curls, takes five minutes</li>
            <li> , I guess that even if you had really short hair and tried to use this, it would still give poor results since you can&#x27;t lift your hair close enough to the scalp to get volume.  </li>
            <li> This thing is not fun.</li>
            <li> I turned it back on at least 5 times while trying to culr my hair.  </li>
            <li> Just not worth the worry.</li>
            <li> If you touch your scalp for a mere second, you WILL KNOW IT, touch your bare skin</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and stick straight, so I usually need a lot of heat to get it to curl.</li>
            <li> It works wether my hair is freshly relaxed or in desperate need of relaxing.</li>
            <li> the extra long cord is really annoying, the tip of the barrel gets to hot touch.</li>
            <li> The 1st one I had to replace was due to the screw end getting stripped and would not stay tight.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various curling brushes for years, and even after reading the other reviews, figured it couldn&#x27;t be that &#x27;difficult&#x27; with the red bristles being heated.  </li>
            <li> If you typically rest the combing teeth on your scalp this curling brush will not work for you.</li>
            <li> less fried on the ends.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother (retired cosmetologist) who told me her previous 1 inch curling brush died that morning.  </li>
            <li> Also, half of the rows of teeth are</li>
            <li> Used less than a month</li>
            <li> I need it hot for my crazy curly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Oh by the way, I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> an my hair comes out with lift, shine and as much or as little curl as I want.  </li>
            <li> Just turn it on and don&#x27;t bother with the little</li>
            <li> However, if Conair is listening (which I doubt) they will put a little plastic door type cover over the on/off button</li>
            <li> Do not get it if you have little kids around.</li>
            <li> You will end up literally screaming in frustration over this one little thing.  </li>
            <li> This is a nifty little device if you can get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Do not need to hold heat on your hair for very long, at least no fine to medium hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very useful, but gotta be careful using it or burns bad!</li>
            <li> but alas the barrels are either too big or too little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve gotten a few burn marks on my forehead until I was used to it,</li>
            <li> It came within a few days.</li>
            <li> Tried it once, got a few blisters and packed it away.</li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> It has a few heat setting I keep it on 395, works like a dream .</li>
            <li> Waste of time.</li>
            <li> I gave it away as I could not fine the box it came in</li>
            <li> This brush works well to tame it.  </li>
            <li> I burned myself badly the first time I tried to use it</li>
            <li> But I learned to go under my hair and the brush holds on as I slowly pull the brush down through my hair straightening it and rolling the brush under or over for some curl at the end.  </li>
            <li> The least bit of tension slips the plug out of the socket and shuts the thing down.  </li>
            <li> If you are not sure</li>
            <li> it was difficult to use as the red bristles burn if you touch your scalp or fingers to them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry it has to go back;</li>
            <li> :/  sigh</li>
            <li> I am anxious for summer to see how it handles the frizzies.  </li>
            <li> When styling in the morning, I pulled my hair a bit straighter than I usually do at home.</li>
            <li> I usually have my hair done in 15 to 20 minute and that is from the time I blow it out and curl it.</li>
            <li> and sometimes I burn my scalp where small teeth are</li>
            <li> Not sure how anyone could use the hottest setting and not have their hair burn off or end up in the ER.</li>
            <li> &quot; ladies, waste of $!</li>
            <li> The teeth are hard plastic and scratch my scalp and not very effective curling my hair.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money and dangerous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good with clamp curling irons</li>
            <li> I have thin hair that tends to always be slightly frizzy and wavy.</li>
            <li> It is hard not to burn yourself with this.  </li>
            <li> but, it is hard to hold onto it and try and twirl your hair into the bristles.  </li>
            <li> How hard would that be?  </li>
            <li> Maybe I am too hard on it??</li>
            <li> They are hard to find.</li>
            <li> My hair is hard to curl.</li>
            <li> Hard to control heat</li>
            <li> I have hard to curl hair</li>
            <li> The heated red bristles are dangerous in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is a very difficult curling brush to use because those red bristles will burn your ear, scalp, etc.  </li>
            <li> At first I hated this iron.  </li>
            <li> I have dropped it (cold) from counter to carpet (not far) and shoved it in a suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Not a good design.</li>
            <li> and I can hardly wait for it to arrive!</li>
            <li> i will have to stick to my regular curling iron. :-(</li>
            <li> VERY hard to find in the stores now.</li>
            <li> Overall, it is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have med-long hair that is very thick.</li>
            <li> Not happy with it at all.</li>
            <li> but it got damaged during travel and lots of the metal &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; got broken.  </li>
            <li> 8 of the teeth have broken off and it will no longer &#x27;glide&#x27; through my hair.  </li>
            <li> The one thing that I don&#x27;t get is how you change the plastic teeh when they get broken, which they will.  </li>
            <li> This is frustrating, which is why I will toss this out as soon as I find another product.  </li>
            <li> This is annoying as it happens to me numerous times every time I use the brush.</li>
            <li> Poor concept IMO.</li>
            <li> This will seriously burn the heck out of your fingers!</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> I had my credit card out, and I was alllllllmost about to order the outrageously overpriced Perfecter, but at the last minute I thought &amp;#34;Hey</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I missed the 30 day return window opportunity</li>
            <li> Sorry I got it, but did not see anything else in that size.  </li>
            <li> So disappointed in Conair, their name usually means quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using brush curling irons for 30+ years, so I could practically use them blind folded.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s scary.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Was looking at the Perfecter, but it was ridiculously expensive.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an unfortunate design flaw;</li>
            <li> buy, you wont be sorry..</li>
            <li> This product is very poorly designed and unsafe.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron is very poorly designed.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating if you are in a hurry.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m seriously terrified of the stupid thing.</li>
            <li> In addition, the design is so flawed that it is impossible to use it without repeatedly turning it off.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid that the one I have is on</li>
            <li> This brush is dangerous, I put it in the give-away box.  </li>
            <li> With all the warnings about heat I was afraid to order.</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest heat setting, it is dangerous.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I had a very expensive curling brush that I had purchased from my hair dresser years ago and it quit working.</li>
            <li> It is almost impossible to use it without getting burned.</li>
            <li> Also, it is nearly impossible to use it without pressing the power button which turns it off.  </li>
            <li> Too bad they no longer make them.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> If you hate  your hair and want to see it burn - purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to use without burning yourself!  </li>
            <li> Nearly impossible to use this curling iron without burning your fingers!</li>
            <li> bad on this one!</li>
            <li> i am very disappointed that it did not work out for me.  </li>
            <li> Very dangerous!  </li>
            <li> Really annoying when you&#x27;re trying to get out the door in time for work!</li>
            <li> This is the worst heat styling tool i&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Horrible and unsafe.  </li>
            <li> Terrible design!  </li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> The design is awful.</li>
            <li> Worst I ever bought and would not recommend to anyone.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a curling brush for longer hair.  It&#x27;s bristles get too hot to be so near the scalp.  I burned myself constantly.  Not for short hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of The Perfecter based on the reviews I read here and on other websites.  I have fine, limp hair in a short cut and I just can&#x27;t use this without burning my hands.  I even tried using a &amp;#34;curling iron glove&amp;#34; and still burnt my hand even while using it on the lowest setting.  Maybe if I had longer hair this would work for me.  After using this several times and getting burnt, I finally broke down and bought The Perfecter.</li>
            <li> It may be okay for some but its too narrow for me.</li>
            <li> so hot it burned my hair off!</li>
            <li> Works good but I constantly burn myself with it.</li>
            <li> Although I love hot brushes, this one is hard to use. It is almost impossible to use it without getting burned. You can&#x27;t wrap your hair around it without touching the heated red brissles. I am also continuously turning it off because of the where the on/off button is.</li>
            <li> I saw a late night TV show selling a MUCH more expensive version of a hot ion brush.  It sounded interesting but I wasn&#x27;t going to pay anything like the $100 they wanted for it.  So I checked out similar products on Amazon and found this very modestly priced alternative.  It is well made.  Heats up quickly.  Is lightweight.  I have long hair which can get a bit wild when exposed to humidity or wind.  Now I just let my hair air dry after washing it.  At this point it is a wildly wavey frizzy mess.  Then I use the hot brush and in about 5 minutes of simply brushing it through my hair (back lifting to get some shape) an my hair comes out with lift, shine and as much or as little curl as I want.  It is also amazing for a quick refresh of your style between shampoos.  I wish I had found this product earlier when traveling a lot for business as I could have had this in my handy computer bag on the road.</li>
            <li> awesome curling brush great for medium</li>
            <li> I almost burned myself with this hot brush, they&#x27;re not kidding when they say HOT BRUSH.  It is hard not to burn yourself with this.  It should not be sold.  Don&#x27;t need anything this hot to wave your hair......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may by Okay for some people, but I think it&#x27;s an accident waiting to happen.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUCH!</li>
            <li> I could not even finish curling the top of my hair with this iron.  If it just touches your scalp it burns you even on low heat setting.  I am returning it.  It is a shame because everything else about the iron is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had. Heats super-fast too. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service.</li>
            <li> If you want to tear your hair out or break a bunch of it every time you use this, then go for it.  There&#x27;s a seam right at the bottom of the barrel that will rip your hair right out if it gets in there - even if you are saavy enough to not get your hair tangled in the bristles to begin with.  This thing is not fun.</li>
            <li> Does not get hot enough and the brush spikes are not long enough to really get a good grip on the hair</li>
            <li> At the second setting, I tried to wrap my hair around this curling brush,and the red bristles were so hot, it was impossible to use.  I returned it the next day.</li>
            <li> This is a fine product, except for one huge design flaw - the on/off &amp; temperature setting are right on the handle, and you barely have to touch the button to turn it off.  Every morning it&#x27;s: do a curl, turn it on again, make another curl, turn it on again.  Really annoying when you&#x27;re trying to get out the door in time for work!</li>
            <li> Count me in with those who say it is too hot to handle.  I hadn&#x27;t read the reviews before I bought it.  I too burned my fingers, head and neck.  Too bad because if it weren&#x27;t for that it might have been the perfect curling brush. I got mine at Walmart and returned it with no problem. Maybe they will correct the problem in the future.</li>
            <li> This product, Infiniti by Conair, BC2, curling iron brush, was way too hot, even on the lowest setting. Would be good for professional stylists, but not practical for home use, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This might be the one that ends my quest for the perfect  styler.  I have long, thick, coarse Caucasian hair. When wet, it forms  lovely waves, which dry into frizz,  the John Frieda brush smooths it out, but the barrel is too big and takes out the curl.  The Infiniti Pro smooths out the frizz, makes my hair feel like satin instead of burlap, and gives me deep waves and soft curls that last all day.  Love this!</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest temperature, it is easy to burn your head!!!  It does curl though.</li>
            <li> This unit gets really hot, even at its lowest setting (there are four settings).  Not only do you have to turn the power on, but you then have to press a separate button multiple times to set the heat level.  And the controls are easy to accidentally turn off as you are using the curling iron (I average about four times per use).  But the really big problem is the design of the unit.  Look at the picture - the red bristles get hot, the black ones stay cool.  The red ones are shorter than the black ones.  Now for the problem:  you cannot wrap your hair all the way to the scalp because if the red bristles touch your scalp you get burned so you can&#x27;t get the lift you might want by applying heat at the base of the hair, and the spacing of the red and black bristles are enough that it easily happens - because of the spacing, the longer black ones do not protect you from the shorter hot ones.  Additionally, when trying to wrap your hair onto the brush, you can burn your hand if it touches the red bristles (and its hard not to even with an open palm being used to hold the hair against the brush as you wind).  And when you set this down on the bathroom sink, make sure the countertop cannot be damaged by the heat because the red bristles are going to touch (I realized that when I set it down and heard a sizzle - some water I had splashed when washing hands was evaporating where the brush touched).  I do like the size (1\\&quot;) because it gives a looser curl than the 3/4\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  Love it..  durable - heats up quick..  like the heat level selector</li>
            <li> My hair is very frizzy after blow drying.  This brush works well to tame it.  it can&#x27;t work like other curling brushes because along with the barrel the red teeth get hot too.  I&#x27;ve burned myself a few times.  But I learned to go under my hair and the brush holds on as I slowly pull the brush down through my hair straightening it and rolling the brush under or over for some curl at the end.  I don&#x27;t plan on getting too much curl and it works fine.  So far so good!  You just have to concentrate not to touch it to your scalp or face.</li>
            <li> This hot brush is a good size.  Should only be used on the lowest setting, which is simply \\&quot;on.\\&quot;  The red teeth heat up, which is not necessary.  I think it would be safer to have none of the teeth heated - do away with the red ones - I kept burning myself.  Will keep this product, but it could be better.    Thanks</li>
            <li> I am African-American, and I use a blow dryer with a comb attatchment to straighten my hair, then I smooth it out/turn the ends under with a hot brush. I have always used hot brushes, but I was really impressed a few days ago when a friend loaned this iron to me for an emergency touch-up. WOW! The heated bristles, while requiring some extra care to use, are perfect for smoothing out frizzy hair! And the brush keeps a good grip on my thich, shoulder length hairstyle. I also love the slightly bigger barrel-most of the irons available are 3/4\\&quot;, not a full inch. The higher heat means I can style my hair faster, instead of SLOWLY \\&quot;cooking\\&quot; my hair into place.    I can imagine the issues someone would have if trying to curl their hair with this (the burned scalp/ears/fingers mentioned in other reviews), but if you&#x27;re simply loooking to smooth out frizz and finish your ends, this tool is PERFECT! I ordered one on the spot and I can hardly wait for it to arrive! I&#x27;m chucking my current brush as soon as I find that package on my doorstep!</li>
            <li> Great product. Soon I will buy one of 3/4 &amp;#34;of the brand. It exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> These styling wands are excellent for curling your hair. They also hold up. My  sisters borrowed mine on vacation and they both switched to using them .</li>
            <li> I have burned my fingers when I try to use it....the bristles could be longer&lt;br /&gt;I have another Conair 1 !/2&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t burn my fingers on that one. The only problem with the 1 !/2&amp;#34; one&lt;br /&gt;(that I ordered at the same time I ordered this) the cord is not very long....the cord on the 1&amp;#34; one is perfect in&lt;br /&gt;length&lt;br /&gt;Thank u</li>
            <li> love this tool many thanks once again to Amazon for making it possible</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> This really works! I have thin hair that tends to always be slightly frizzy and wavy. I was wearing my hair in a ponytail everyday because I don&#x27;t like to straighten it which causes more frizz the next day from the damage. I can&#x27;t do hair either-so blow drying for a style is not an option; I have tried many times and I can&#x27;t ever get it to look good. Thought I would give this a try and its perfect. I had almost bought a competitors product that cost a hundred dollars and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t spend that much. The brush heats up fast and eliminates frizz and adds a nice healthy shine. The first day of use I was able to make a curl-so I was super excited. If I can use this styling brush anyone can!!! Very happy with purchase! Can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find one of these.</li>
            <li> It works very well and the results are satisfactory. As with any hot tool, it should be handled with care as the red prongs heat up. Once you know this, exercise caution in using it. Wish I could find it in 3/4&amp;#34; barrel.</li>
            <li> does good job, wish there was a lower setting.  The lowest will burn you if not very careful.</li>
            <li> This product looses heat very fast while curling hair and the on/off switch is located in a place where it is easily bumped, thus often turning the iron completely off while in use. Also, the assembly joints catch and pull out hair.  Overall, it is very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I recently purchase the Infiniti by Conair BC2 1\\&quot; Tourmaline Ceramic Hot Brush.  The first time I used it, it burned my scalp, neck and fingers.  The next time I used it I tried to be really careful and I still burned my head and fingers.  My head burned for several hours later. The bristles that heat up are like a branding iron!  Also, it is nearly impossible to use it without pressing the power button which turns it off.  I turned it back on at least 5 times while trying to culr my hair.  What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had my credit card out, and I was alllllllmost about to order the outrageously overpriced Perfecter, but at the last minute I thought &amp;#34;Hey, maybe I should check Amazon and see if they have anything like this&amp;#34;. And this is it! Now, I know several people here are having issues with the heat, but I&#x27;m thinking that maybe they don&#x27;t understand that the lowest setting is simply ON. Just turn it on and don&#x27;t bother with the little +/- temp buttons. If that isn&#x27;t hot enough, THEN you can crank it up to the next level (which is 310).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about the heated red bristles, you ask? Well, not a problem if you use the longer black bristles against your head first (like a comb). It&#x27;s hard to describe what I mean, but since the black bristles are longer, if you pick up a piece of hair and place the brush next to your scalp with a row of black bristles touching your scalp, and then slowly comb up and out, you get a lot of lift &amp; volume without getting burned. You&#x27;re not supposed to use this like a standard curling iron (eg. rolling hair up from the ends to the very top of your scalp). It&#x27;s top to bottom, NOT bottom to top. ;)  Basically, just use it like the demonstrations you&#x27;ve seen of The Perfecter, and you&#x27;ll be good to go. I have very fine, limp hair, and this curling brush is the answer to my prayers.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and use it everyday. It does the job that I wanted it to do in place of using hot curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it took me a while to get used to using it without turning it \\&quot;OFF\\&quot; while using it due to the location of the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; \\&quot;OFF\\&quot; button.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using it fine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product!</li>
            <li> It worked well the first couple of times I used it, but now it seems to have no effect on my hair. I am kind of wishing I had just bought the Perfector instead.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. I bought it to replace one that I&#x27;ve used for years. I am afraid that the one I have is on it&#x27;s last legs, so I will need a new one soon. I have loved the one I have been using for years. I have short curly hair that needs some help with styling and this does the trick. I don&#x27;t remember how many years ago I bought it, but it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;chugging&amp;#34; away. The new one is simply a back up! It&#x27;s perfect for my hair. I simply diffuse it and then use the hot brush to style it....amazing!</li>
            <li> Although I have suffered some small burns figuring out how to use this type of iron the results are awesome and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Keep it on the lowest setting and learn not to touch the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hot almost instantly so you don&#x27;t have to worry about forgetting its on.</li>
            <li> The handle is easy to hang on to and I like the teeth on the curling iron.  It works well.</li>
            <li> If you typically rest the combing teeth on your scalp this curling brush will not work for you. It will burn your scalp. I considered it for awhile thinking I could adjust and learn to use it. But I was a nervous wreck trying to avoid getting burned by the red hot combing teeth. It is a shame because it is otherwise very well made. It gets hot almost instantly. And was hot enough for me just turning it on. It also had three exact heating temperatures and the cord is made not to tangle when in use. Another great feature I liked was a plastic piece attached that acted like a mini stand so it doesn&#x27;t roll off the table. It may work if you use it to style another person&#x27;s hair. But then again, you&#x27;d probably worry that you might burn them or their ears etc. Just not worth the worry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various curling brushes for years, and even after reading the other reviews, figured it couldn&#x27;t be that &#x27;difficult&#x27; with the red bristles being heated.  Didn&#x27;t go beyond the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; position at 285 degrees.  Well, I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.  This is a very difficult curling brush to use because those red bristles will burn your ear, scalp, etc.  I didn&#x27;t return it, but have not been using it.</li>
            <li> The problem with this hot brush it that it is much too hot to use when on even at the lowest temperature setting.  I like the size and how it works in my hair but the only way I can use it is to heat it for 30 seconds as directed and then turn it off.  After a short time I can use it until it cools down.  I have no idea why Conair designed it to be this way.</li>
            <li> The red bristles are extremely hot, while the black are not.  You have to be extremely careful when using it or you could burn your scalp or face.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but don&#x27;t let it touch your scalp. Ouch!!!</li>
            <li> bought as a gift so haven&#x27;t used.  looked like a very nice quality product.  would recommend purchase</li>
            <li> Great- you have to watch the heat level though- it gets very hot! But I have curly hair &amp; it really controls it well.</li>
            <li> This brush is dangerous, I put it in the give-away box.  I burned myself badly the first time I tried to use it and I&#x27;ve been using styling brushes for 25 years.  The bristles heat up and get extremely hot (I only had it on the 2nd setting when I was burned).  This product is very poorly designed and unsafe.  There are not even any warnings on the box regarding the very hot bristles.  One reviewer compared it to the Perfector, but there is no comparison.  I used the Perfector for a couple of years and loved it and it is safe to use.  Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
            <li> This iron gets HOT!!! But it also has lower settings for the wimps...haha. I can do my hair in about 8 - 10 minutes because you don&#x27;t have to hold it for long. Five stars...recommend highly.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed because even on the lowest setting it can burn your scalp. I also find when I wrap my hair around the iron and only for 4 seconds, my hair is stuck causing me to panic and pull my hair out a few strands at a time.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend or buy this item again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this curling brush.  I have used curling irons or brushes for over 30 years, and this is the best one I have tried.  It gets incredibly hot, even on low, and that worried me.  But because so, it curls so quickly that I only hold the curl for about two or three seconds.  So I save time, and even better, I can see a difference in my hair. It is in better condition/less fried on the ends.  It also heats up so much faster than I am accustomed to--within 60 seconds.  I have been using this brush daily for about six months, and I have medium length, straight-ish, fine hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great curling brush if you want something quick, easy and to tame the frizzies! It gets VERY hot so I&#x27;ve gotten a few burn marks on my forehead until I was used to it, but I like the way the heat tames my hair. Also, then end tip gets really hot and mine fell off after about a year or two of constant use. But I love it so much that I ordered two more, just in case they stop making it!</li>
            <li> i read all the reviews on this curling iron, and they were mostly good so i thought i would try it. well, the biggest problem i am having is trying to get my hair to curl.  the brush does not hold my hair in it - it keeps falling out when i try and twist it.  the only thing it does is straighten all the frizzies out nicely, and give a tiny flip at the ends.  other than that, i have not been able to do real curls.  i was really hoping to be able to curl my hair back and out of my face.  some said that they were getting burned by it. i did not have that problem.  the black bristles do not get hot. only the red ones get hot, and they are shorter so it is harder to get your fingers down in there.  the tip does not get hot, either. it is made of plastic.  but, it is hard to hold onto it and try and twirl your hair into the bristles.  you need to use your hands to try and wind the hair in there, and that is where i think others were getting burned. i am very disappointed that it did not work out for me.  maybe i need coarser hair . . . i don&#x27;t know.  i will have to stick to my regular curling iron. :-(</li>
            <li> This is the worst heat styling tool i&#x27;ve ever owned. The buttons on the handle are ridiculous, you cannot use this without hitting them and turning it off while you style, and the red bristles that heat are way too hot. This curling brush has burned me many times, gotten stuck in my hair on several occasions, and turned off every time I have used it. Rotten item, do not buy.</li>
            <li> Great price and works well for my purposes.  I have very short hair with a mind of it&#x27;s own.  On days when my hair does not cooperate, I use this brush to create curls/waves where I want them.</li>
            <li> The shot brissel  burn your scalp.Not happy with it at all. Should have returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy that I found this ConAir Infiniti hot brush here.  I really love this hot brush!  I already own one and have had it for years.  I&#x27;ve searched for a replacement just in case this one breaks.  I&#x27;ve bought other hot brushes and curling irons, but this one does the best job on my fine, but varied textured hair.  I just purchased two more.  One for the house and one to keep in my travel bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does get very hot.  Yes, I have accidentally burned myself with it, and yes, I have accidentally turned it off before.  After some practice, I got used to how to hold it to keep this from happening.  I&#x27;ve owned a lot of curling irons and hot brushes over the years, and have yet to get one that I didn&#x27;t accidentally burn myself at least once with them, but that&#x27;s why they all come with the WARNING labels.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for my hair and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> At first I hated this iron.  The heated bristles are HOT!  When you touch the iron to your scalp, neck or ears there is a yelp!  HOWEVER after going back to the normal non-heated bristle type of iron I realize the madness of this design!  It curls my straight thin hair beautifully...way better than any other curling iron.  Because of the hot bristles it grabs the hair and really creates a lovely effect.  So, now I am ordering a back-up iron...just in case...as I do not want to be without this tremendous product...yelps and all!</li>
            <li> Love this iron. The bristles keep me from having to fight to keep my hair on the iron. I also LOVE having no 1st degree burns on my hands. This removes the frizzies.</li>
            <li> I read most of the negative reviews about this styling brush and every one I read had to do with the iron/brush getting too hot.  These comments convinced me to buy it!  I have very thick, straight, fairly fine hair and it is very difficult to find a curling iron that gets hot enough to reach all parts of my hair without parting it into tiny sections that take forever..  This does the trick, I love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I broke my arm and needed something that would work like my curling iron. This straightens and curls where I need it--with one hand! Yes, it is easy to burn yuor scalp if you are not careful, but I like the heated bristles for better styling. Gave it 4 stars because the on/off button is sensitive (turns off) during styling.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my mother (retired cosmetologist) who told me her previous 1 inch curling brush died that morning.  Her previous one lasted for years (different brand).  I gave it to her and she tried it twice.  This unit gets so hot it singes hair.  Even on the lowest setting.  I thought, mom is getting older, maybe its just her.  Asked my sister if she wanted it - she tried it and on the lowest setting it burned the hair.  Unfortunately I missed the 30 day return window opportunity so I am stuck with &amp;#34;firestarter.&amp;#34;  If you hate  your hair and want to see it burn - purchase this product.  (I mention the retied cosmetologist because she has used these devices for years on herself and hundreds of others - she knows how to use the product)</li>
            <li> Just received this product, but so far works very well, and adjustable heat settings are the best part of this curler.</li>
            <li> Okay, just like Goldilocks, I tried so many.  Some were too hot, some were too cold, but this was was JUST RIGHT for my hair.  I have medium length fine, but somewhat curly hair.  Not too curly, but, since the 80s are over it is still too curly to be left completely alone.  (if your hair is like that you&#x27;ll understand.  If you lived through the 80s, you&#x27;ll definitely understand...otherwise you never will...sorry)  Anyway, especially when it is humid I have to tame this mane.  This product does that!  Yes, the red thingys get got, but they are shorter than the black thingys which is generally all that touches my head.  My fingers sometimes touch the red thingys, but, instinctively I am learning NOT TO TOUCH THE RED THINGYS!  I&#x27;m clever like that. If it had too many more thingys, I&#x27;m afraid it would get tangled in my mane of hair and that would be bad because, as we&#x27;ve all established the red thingy&#x27;s get really HOT!  So far, no tangling.  As others have pointed out, it I can do my hair in half the time of my old Helen of Troy \\&quot;only the barrel gets hot, not the thingys\\&quot; type of brush curling iron.  That one, too, was designed by the same genius who thought putting the on/off button on the handles right where you grip with your fingers was a good idea.  But, I will agree with you all, that the sensitivity of this on/off button makes its location even more of a hassle.  Again, though, I am trainable and am learning not to turn it off and to check it to make sure I haven&#x27;t turned it off while I am using it.  Because it heats so fast, it&#x27;s turning out not to be as big a headache as I expected.  However, if Conair is listening (which I doubt) they will put a little plastic door type cover over the on/off button so we don&#x27;t have this problem.  Sheesh! How hard would that be?  Okay, so I give it 4 stars because it does what it should and I took one away for the button placement.  If you are not sure what \\&quot;Tourmaline Ceramic Hot...\\&quot; really means, you may not be ready for theconcept of this brush.  It&#x27;s HOT, but sometime you just need HOT to do the job properly.  When you need it, you need it.  If you don&#x27;t, then use another tool.  If you have struggled day after day to do your hair with the old Helen of Troy tool, you&#x27;ll know when you are ready for something that is HOT and fast.  Then you&#x27;ll go buy this.</li>
            <li> It does curl your hair. However,the WAY short red bristles cause it to lay flat next to your scalp and burn you. I would recommend Ove Gloves it you plan to purchase this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Believe all the reveiws!  This brush iron is too hot.  I thought it couldnt be that bad, but it really isnt comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent \\&quot;HOT\\&quot; curling brush or you can even straighten your hair with it.  I have moderately curly hair and I have always wanted to smooth it out a little yet leaving some lofty curls at the end of my hair and this is the first product that has been able to do that for me.  I have tried straighteners and they feel and smell like they are scorching my hair.  Conair has developed a great product, try it, you will like it.</li>
            <li> As everyone else has said, the red plastic brushes get WAY too hot to handle.  Also the on/off button is right where you put your hand to use it and it can get shut off without you knowing it.  Luckily, it heats up very fast.</li>
            <li> Love it! Best curling brush I have EVER owned! Looooong cord w/1&amp;#34; barrel. Was excited to find it when I decided to look for it on Amazon. Gets very hot (which my fine hair needs to attempt to hold a curl etc.). Its temp settings what the temp setting is at (up to 395 degrees) rather than giving you a rotating dial of 1-30. This is replacing a Conair Infiniti I bought MANY years ago and have been looking locally for several years to replace as my old one got so much use and wear and tear that the plastic &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; had started to break off. Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> With all the warnings about heat I was afraid to order. But let me say I recently got a perm on my hair - and though I like the extra body from it - sometimes I really need to tame it. THIS heated curler quickly does the job. I do not run the curler through my hair close to my scalp. I keep it away from my scalp and hold on to the very tip of it with my fingers when curling. This is a high quality curler and I just love it.</li>
            <li> I really love the concept of this curling brush.  It is extremely hot based on higher settings, which is great for stubborn hair.  I did find for my short hair it was difficult to use as the red bristles burn if you touch your scalp or fingers to them.  The on and off switch is a real problem, like so many other hot curling products I have tried, they put them in the worst possible place--right where you hold the brush in your hand--leading to accidentally turning it off numerous times during the curling process. Would be an awesome product if it came in smaller size (3/4&amp;#34;) and the on-off button were recessed/toggled instead so easy to turn off while using the brush.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot and is hard to use...I keep burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> it does get hot. I would like the three quarter inch size but evidently they don&#x27;t make it anymore.</li>
            <li> I would have to agree with most other reviews that this is a pretty good curling iron.  It does get hot and you have to be careful not to touch the red rods but does not seem to have anymore of an adverse effect on my hair than others I have used in the past.  It heats up very quickly and the button position has been improved.  No issues with it turning off.  I am able to do my hair rather quickly, I&#x27;d say within 5 minutes.  Do not need to hold heat on your hair for very long, at least no fine to medium hair.  For the most part, I am very happy with product...</li>
            <li> This is a very effective hot iron/brush and is at an attractive price.  I recently had several small surgeries on my right hand which made it impossible for me to style my hair as usual with a blow dryer/brush since I&#x27;m right handed.  My hair is fairly short, fine, and somewhat thin on top so I needed to have some way to style my hair but with only my left hand.  After reading reviews about numerous types of curling iron/brush products that were in this lower price range, I chose this and am very happy with it.  The little info pamphlet suggested heat settings for different types of hair which was helpful and accurate for my hair.  This product enabled me to do a fairly good job putting a style in my hair which made me feel lots better.  It heats up very quickly, and did just what I wanted it to do.  You do have to take some care when putting it near your face since the alternate rows of red bristles do get hot, and the rounded tip also gets pretty warm.  However, even using it clumsily with my left hand, I did not burn myself and was able to make my hair presentable.  Very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> it is just what I have been looking for!</li>
            <li> Iron heats up within 30 seconds, heats and curls without blowing air.  Be careful as the bristles are short and it&#x27;s easy to burn fingers until you learn to work around that.  Also, I use it on the lowest heat as it&#x27;s hot enough for my fine hair and don&#x27;t hold it too long unless you want a super curly do.  I&#x27;m happy with curling iron for the price, but if it breaks and I need to replace, would try another brand.</li>
            <li> Horrible and unsafe.  The bristles (which are not flexible) heat up really hot.  If it touches your ear or scalp it burns. I really recommend not purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Finally a real hot brush that can tame even my thick African American hair.  Love it!  If you want a Hot brush this is the one for you.  If you want a warm brush you should keep looking</li>
            <li> So easy to use. Temperature control and on/off controls are well placed and do not switch accidentally while being used. Does not burn hands or scalp. Glad I made the purchase even though reviews of the larger barrel model were not positive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I bought this iron. If I had, I might not have bought it. Yes, this curling iron gets hot enough to burn you and yes the on/off button will cut off while using it BUT guess what, if you buy this iron knowing those are potential issues you can train yourself to work around them. It&#x27;s DOABLE! Personally, I think it&#x27;s an amazing product. I have very curly hair and need the brush tines to help pull out the curl to help straighten it. I found this at Ulta and they have a 30day return policy! After one use I was sold! Not returning this gem! Hope this review is helpful!</li>
            <li> I really liked this but I would like to see it in a smaller size. This gets hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> I love using this nano brush so much, when my last one wore out I bought another one exactly the same. Getting ready to purchase another one. Best curl brush ever!</li>
            <li> Even on the lowest setting the tips of the bristles cannot be touched to scalp or any skin.  Sorry I got it, but did not see anything else in that size.  I manage with it, but VERY gingerly.</li>
            <li> It was too hot. My money was refunded. Thank you!</li>
            <li> CONAIR THE BEST OF THE WORLD OF HAIR!!!!! CHEAP PRICES FOR VERY GOOD QUALITY.I HAVE MOST CONAIR IRON AND I NEVE BEEN DECEIVED</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t curl the way I thought it would. I think if my hair were shorter it would work better! Heats up fast though!! Like that about it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t really what I was looking for.  It does make hair very shiny and soft, but didn&#x27;t give a whole lot of volume to my short, thick hair.  Would probably be good for fixing bed head if you needed to be somewhere in a hurry, but I&#x27;d rather just take the time to shower and fix it properly.  Glad I got this on sale.</li>
            <li> it works super. I really like it and its very easy to use. the shine it brings to your hair is amazing. I have actually both a couple infiniti hot brush for my friends.</li>
            <li> The longer bristles work much better for curling hair than short bristles.  I was having a hard time finding this in the stores, so was so glad to see it online.  I just ordered a second one to keep at my vacation home.  This curling brush is just perfect for me.</li>
            <li> The brush gets really hot so I keep it on low.  I hope the designers will develop a new handle.  My finger constantly turns the thing off! Not a good design. This brush is great for coarse or curly hair, Amazing ceramic heat source that&#x27;s gentle on my hair!</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron because I had used the same model when my sister visited me several months ago. I have no idea how well it would work on long hair, but I have short-ish hair, just below my ears, and this iron allows me to let it dry naturally and then run this iron through it in just a few minutes and look like I spent a long time fixing it. I drive an hour to work and wanted something that heated up fast and did the job quickly. This iron gets VERY hot, but if you are careful to protect your finger tips, it does a good curl job QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> Love this one, turns off by itself on the occasion of being forgetful&lt;br /&gt;Good temperature settings and great results</li>
            <li> For very long thick curly hair, this actually does not get hot enough.  A flat iron is the only thing that will work.  But for long hair, the burning problems everyone talks about are not an issue.</li>
            <li> Really like this. Gives my hair lots of body.  Would give 5 stars but the bristles that heat up burn your head if you get them too close.  Should have made the non-heated bristles longer to keep this from happening.</li>
            <li> This is what I wanted.  It came within a few days.</li>
            <li> It was OK but it wasn&#x27;t for me.  Gave it away after I got it.  It was VERY hot and after burning myself several times, i gave up.</li>
            <li> Like everyone else has stated, you have to be careful where you put your fingers and also not hold it too close to your head either. But it works very well to tame my natural curl/frizz, even on the lowest setting. I especially like the recessed on/off and temp buttons. Your fingers don&#x27;t bump them and turn off the brush or change the settings like domed buttons do. It seems a little heavier than other brushes I&#x27;ve used but the weigh is well balanced and gives the brush a very solid/well built feel.</li>
            <li> Not any hotter than a hot iron gets and I like the brushes to make softer curls.</li>
            <li> Did you see an infomercial for the amazing but pricey Perfecter?  Since I don&#x27;t do much to fix up my hair, I was sold on the simplicity of styling in just a few minutes.  I&#x27;m glad I searched Amazon before buying though because this Conair product does the trick just fine.  As other people comment, the red dots are hot, so you won&#x27;t want to touch it to your scalp, but it&#x27;s not really a problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent for thick coarse hair..the adjustable heat is a terrific feature.</li>
            <li> GETS TO HOT. BURNED MY FINGER.</li>
            <li> Criminy! Some beta testing would have helped Conair here. First thing, I burned my finger, even after experimenting with the curler not turned on. Second thing, I burned my finger. If you can get the hair on the brush, I expect it works all right, but I don&#x27;t have enough fingers to continue experimenting.  I&#x27;m so sorry it has to go back; thanks to Amazon for making the process stress free. Next, I&#x27;m trying the cheap Revlon RV454.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product. The best part is, I received two for the same price I paid for the first one I bought at Walmart. Wish I could find this exact one in a 3/4\\&quot; barrel.</li>
            <li> Like it, and am ordering my 2nd one.  Only lasted a year because black (longer) bristles are fragile and break off .  Maybe I am too hard on it?? I have dropped it (cold) from counter to carpet (not far) and shoved it in a suitcase.  So - treat it gently and pack bubble wrap around it in your suitcase.</li>
            <li> this is the second one I bought, I found one in a retail store and liked it so well I went on Amazon to see if I could send one to a friend. I was a little surprised that the one on amazon was so much cheaper. now we are both happy.</li>
            <li> Works really fast and well on my straight, fine hair without getting stuck or burning ends. Adds body and leaves a soft end curl I want that often lasts all day under most conditions, even though my hair has been the oily type that can go flat easily. Use every day at home and light and sturdy enough to tote to gym .</li>
            <li> Never before have I had curl hold for so long.  But for some reason, this thing really works. The curl held thru the night and only needed touch up on the second day. Now I hope for this model to come out in a 2 inch barrel also.  I will put all my other irons in a box and save for emergencies.  This is the only one in my drawer now.  Beware, it can get very hot and I used only the very first setting.  It doesn&#x27;t have to be held in the hair very long. Practice will help so you don&#x27;t touch any of the hot comb tips.  It&#x27;s a winner.  And this is my first review ever.  Thank you, Conair.  This is perfect for hair like mine, thick but very fine.</li>
            <li> Just bought my second one of these - still have my old one but it got damaged during travel and lots of the metal &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; got broken.  This is a GREAT investment at a reasonable cost!!</li>
            <li> Pros:  multiple heat settings, great size, works great for my hairstyle, good price&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  some of the bristles are heated so I burn my hand sometimes when trying to guide my hair around it &amp; no auto shut-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good for the price, but next time I think I will spend a little more to get a better one.</li>
            <li> This is my second one that I have bought.  The first one that I bought I have used for many many many years and I wanted to try to get another one and keep one on hand for traveling.  I am not disappointed in the workmanship of this product.</li>
            <li> Some of the bristles heat up and it&#x27;s impossible to use without burning yourself!  It gets SUPER hot!</li>
            <li> the extra long cord is really annoying, the tip of the barrel gets to hot touch. the hot and cold brushes works good during curling</li>
            <li> SEE UPDATE AT BOTTOM!    I&#x27;ve had my hot brush for approx. 2 months.  Absolutely love it.  I&#x27;ve had many hot brushes, but they have never done the job.  This one gets HOT!  I have some-what coarse hair with no definition and this one actually puts definition into my hair.  The others I have tried just do not get hot enough.    When I first tried this one, I did burn the tip of my fingers and when it would actually barely touch my scalp, you&#x27;d hear a yelp out of me.  I pretty much solved that problem by going to Sally&#x27;s and buying a cheap hot-glove.  The glove I purchased has tiny holes that the teeth on this just love to go through, therefore I still have to be careful, but the glove helps tremendously.  The handle on the tip of the brush does get a little hot, I just always remember not to hold it too close to the iron.  You do get used to where and how to use it - after getting burned a couple of times, it didn&#x27;t take long to learn...:)    I would definitely recommend this hot brush if you need one that gets hot.  It does it&#x27;s job!  If it works for my coarse hair, it should work for you.    UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve had this hot brush for less than 1 year.  I can no longer use it..):  8 of the teeth have broken off and it will no longer &#x27;glide&#x27; through my hair.  Loss of the teeth cause it to tug and pull my hair.  I DO NOT use it daily - only 1-2 times a week.    It&#x27;s very disheartening, I loved this brush!</li>
            <li> This will seriously burn the heck out of your fingers! Do not get it if you have little kids around. Even on the lowest setting, it gets WAY hotter than other hot brushes, so beware! And some dimwit decided to make every other row of bristles get hot too, so guess what? As you are rolling your hair around it, you get burnt. If you have short hair (I have bangs that I use it for), you literally can not get it to grab hold of your hair without those red bristles burning your fingers as you do it.</li>
            <li> It works really great. I am happy with this purchase ðŸ˜ƒ</li>
            <li> This baby is Hot Hot Hot!!  Be very careful.  If you are not too handy with hair tools, do not purchase this iron.  I use it on the 3rd setting which takes to around 350 degrees. (I think)  The top setting it too much.  I have thin, fine hard to style hair but not a lot of it.  It grows forward on 1 side which has less hair and straight down growth on the other with more hair, the top grows forward.  Stylists generally can&#x27;t do anything acceptable (to me) with it.  This iron does the job, and end result holds well along with the right styling products.  If you touch your scalp for a mere second, you WILL KNOW IT, touch your bare skin you will feel it for days.  I actually gave myself a headache for hours from touching my scalp a few times during the first use.  Headache lasted for hours, burn on shoulder lasted days.  I am careful not to get too close to my scalp now.  Be cautious and you will be fine, do not allow kids near it.  I have 2 teenage daughters that I have told &amp;#34;you are not to touch this iron for any reason, especially for your friends.&amp;#34;  I love it, I hope it lasts forever, price was great.</li>
            <li> I am truly impressed with this hot brush by Conair. I like the selection of temperatures and the fast warm up. I retired from the cosmetology business decades ago but still keep up with new equipment. I remember when the electric ceramic flat iron became available and revolutionized the industry. Although I&#x27;ve used other hot brushes, they did not heat up as fast &amp; hot as this can.&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti by Conair is perfect for my short, permed hair. When I done styling my hair, it looks like a bonafide shampoo set from&lt;br /&gt;the salon.</li>
            <li> I always buy this brand because I can&#x27;t find this barrel size in a curing brush, only curling irons. Well, actually I have found others online but they never get warm enough and they take forever to heat up. There&#x27;s a combination of metal and plastic teeth on this iron. Be aware when purchasing that the metal teeth get very hot so you can burn yourself quite easily. Despite this I like the iron as I&#x27;ve probably purchased 4 of them in a row after they eventually wear out.</li>
            <li> It works great and never got too hot like some of the other reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced the &amp;#34;perfecter&amp;#34; with this and saved over $50!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible design!  It gets too hot and there is no reason for the red bristles to be hot.  The barrel is doing the work.  Also, the control buttons are right where I put my thumb.  So I accidentally turn it off while I&#x27;m using it!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair tool, both for straightening and for loose curls. My hair is fine with little body (except for th gray strands) and works great.  I agree that the red tines are hot, so users must take care in use.  I will probably buy a second one for my vacation home.</li>
            <li> I burn myself all the time, seems to be no place to hold on the brush part, when curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Wish had smaller size as I have short hair and really need the 1/2 barrel.  That being said it works well for me.  As top hair is thinning so only have on 330 setting.  As being short there is not much hair between iron and scalp to buffer the heat on scalp so is top &#x27;just&#x27; before the iron touches scalp.  The barrel is a little to large to curl my natural, but thinner and less curl with age, curly/wavy hair but it gives me nice soft volume waves and my hair is soft to the touch and has shine.  If only they would also make a smaller size.  :/  sigh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For any like me who haver never mastered the curling iron, the hot brush is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid forties and have used every kind of curling iron under the sun since I was 13. I have NEVER had a curling iron that got so hot (on the lowest &amp;#34;setting&amp;#34;--- just &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;) and burned like this one. Horrible product. So disappointed in Conair, their name usually means quality. Not this time!</li>
            <li> Returned this item, if I were you I would NOT order.  Thought maybe this idea of some of the combs heating was a good idea, and on most curling irons it probably would be BUT this units heats up so HOT it can&#x27;t even be used.  I put it on the lowest setting and I still felt like I was going to burn my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have fine/wavy/color treated hair and this hot brush make its easy to have a nice finished/polished look.  Brush doesn&#x27;t appear to burn my hair which I love even more.  Definitely recommend anyone to purchase</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. I do not use the highest setting and it works great. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third one in 5 years....love it but it does have a learning curve to use as it gets very hot and you will burn your fingers at first but you learn to use it without burning your fingers eventually.  I can remember getting some gloves to use this curling iron when I first got it years back.  I was so happy to see they were still making this item because it does an excellent job for curling.  Here is what I have learned.  The 1st one I had to replace was due to the screw end getting stripped and would not stay tight.  I liked the fact that you can clean the black and red prongs as they do get coated with hair product over time just beware to use the correct screwdriver to avoid stripping the screw end.  2nd time I had to replace cuz the little teeth starting falling off and leaving several rows of the black teeth gone...still useable but since I found it again for such a good price got a new one and I will save this old one to replace any of the teeth rows that might go missing next time! But it might have been me cuz something I bang it on the door when I&#x27;m doing my hair in the morning. I&#x27;m planning on just heating it to the 2nd highest heat setting to prevent this from happening...maybe??  I love this product and might get one more to just have on hand in case they stop making it!  Love that it turns off on its own if not used for 10 minutes or so!</li>
            <li> This is my first review but thought I should comment since so many of the reviews on this product were not the best. I almost didn&#x27;t buy this after reading some of the reviews, but figured \\&quot;what the heck\\&quot;, I could always return it, but I love it! I have been using the brush for about 4 months now and it is one of the best purchases I have made and the price is right!  It is easy to use, heats up quickly and only takes a few minutes to style my hair.  I have a slight amount of curl, wave, frizz in my hair and this brush smooths it right down and my hair stays that way!  I am anxious for summer to see how it handles the frizzies.  I am in my early 60&#x27;s and have no problem using this nor any problems with it being too hot or burning my skin.  Just don&#x27;t touch the heated area!  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had a very expensive curling brush that I had purchased from my hair dresser years ago and it quit working. I thought I would never be able to replace the quality but the Conair is just perfect. It heats up fast and at the high heat it gets very hot. There are 5 settings but I use the highest and have never burned myself because of the bristles that stay cool. The only problem is that I sometimes touch the switch and turn it off accidentally but I have gotten used to a different way to hold it so that does not happen. It is a fast way to pouf my hair and I love it.</li>
            <li> Great curling and smoothing.  Heats fast and gives your hair a nice shine. Would like a larger barrel to switch with depending on the wave desired.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair, this curling iron is ideal relaxing curls for a less frizzy look.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and stick straight, so I usually need a lot of heat to get it to curl. This was the hottest I could find. The little red bristles get superrrr hot, and you can&#x27;t hold on to it without getting burned. After getting burned a bunch of times and still not getting a curl, I decided to return it. I got a hot air brush instead by John Frieda, and it works much better, plus you can hold onto it.</li>
            <li> My old one just fell apart after years of use. This one gets hotter, but it is also heavier and the barrel is too bid for my short hair</li>
            <li> This is the closest that I&#x27;ve come to my favorite cutler that is no longer in production.  RAYKO made the best curling iron.  This one by Conair should take a tip from RAYKO.  They need to put twice as many rows of teeth in so that you don&#x27;t burn your scalp.  Rayko has 8 rows of plastic and eight rows of metal teeth therefore they are so close that there&#x27;s no gaps to touch your scalp.   This one by Conair should also have a rotating brush head for easy removal from the hair.  I like the heat choices but it should NOT be so easy to switch the temps.  Every time you move your hand on the handle you tend to move the setting.    I did give it 4 stars but only because I love these types of curling irons because they don&#x27;t flatten your hair, they fluff it up.   The one thing that I don&#x27;t get is how you change the plastic teeh when they get broken, which they will.  I saw no place to order new teeth for maintenance.   hope you don&#x27;t have to send it away somewhere for &#x27;&#x27;repairs&#x27;&#x27;.  What do you use in the meantime?  Oh, I get it .... you have to buy another one for a spare!!!  I have purchased RENAC irons and they also get hot but they have no plastic teeth to keep it away from the scalp - but then neither do the regular curling irons.  I was always going to work with burned scalp, forehead and fingers from them.  But with RAYKO I never had the problem. Too bad they no longer make them.  Hopefully Conair will do an upgrade on this product and I will but 50 of them... never to be caught without it again.</li>
            <li> OK, burns my head if not held just right.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for this hot brush.  My hair slides right through the combs on the brush and it is pretty worthless for my purposes.  I will give it another try, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this type of hot brush.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Learned so much from the other reviewers  Thank you!!  I found it very easy to use.  Read the other reviews which give some interesting tips.</li>
            <li> Heats up under a minute. Various heat settings &amp; use with care as it does get quite hot but that is why I purchased it.Carefully hold the tip at the end of the curling wand. I am very happy with this product, it provides a lasting curl. I do not find my neck length hair getting tangled. The wand is heavier than my Helen of Troy plastic hot air brush http://amzn.to/1Mkmgyl (which I reviewed as a &amp;#34;warm air brush&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Heats up in a flash as promised and easy to use as the cord swivels.  The red bristles do burn if they touch your scalp.  Good hair appliance.</li>
            <li> Good value for the money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s somewhat ok.  It does get hot, and the red bristles get hot, as the other reviewers mentioned, so be careful.  I think it takes away the frizz, so that is nice, but I don&#x27;t feel like the curl lasts very long.  I travel a lot for work and it is only for 120, not 120/240 so now I can&#x27;t take it traveling.  So now I&#x27;m back to searching for a good quality curling iron that I can travel with.</li>
            <li> I did not realize that the red teeth heat up.  So I have burnt my scalp numerous time.  Other than that I love this hot brush.</li>
            <li> I searched and purchased several hot brushes for a long time but was unable to get one that would be hot enough for my very curly and coarse hair.  I recently purchase the, &amp;#34;Tourmaline Ceramic Hot Brush by Conair,&amp;#34; it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for.  It gets really hot and helps style my hair beautifully.  It gets really hot, but you can regulate your heat preference. I purchased one in every size.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The range of heat settings really make this curling iron flexible.  Styles my hair quite well. Has held up over time.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair. I live in a dry climate, but the lack of humidity doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t still have frizzies. Plus, I prefer my hair to be loosely curled rather than tightly curled. So, I purchased this for $25 at our local Ultra, having seen it on display there for the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this styler!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as with the more expensive Protector Fusion, the ion technology of the InfinitiPro gives curly hair a great smoothness and shine. Yes, the short red bristles heat up, but if you are careful when working with your short strands, you shouldn&#x27;t get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acid test came when I visited a humid area of the country about a month after purchasing this InfinitiPro. When styling in the morning, I pulled my hair a bit straighter than I usually do at home. By the end of the day, the curls were admittedly not quite as loose as they had been BUT my hair was still smooth, shiny, and frizz-free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are wondering how to use this item, watch the videos for the Protector Fusion. Except for this unit being hot, it works the same way, at a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> I love the temperature settings and it works like a professional hot brush! It does get very hot so be careful its not too close to the scalp. Very pleased with the price as well as the product!:) There are similar high priced professional hot brushes, but save your money, seriously! This hot brush does the job for a fraction of the price!:)</li>
            <li> It is easy to use this hot brush. It makes curling my hair much easier than using a blow dryer and brush. My hair is finely textured and I find that this brush does the job for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too hot and can burn fingertips. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Sturdy, weighty...heats up quickly and gets really hot .  The cord is nice and long and it swivels .</li>
            <li> I bought this because for my hair I need a 1 INCH curling brush. They are hard to find. So I bought this as a last resort. I like some curl at the tips of my hair. This works more like a flat iron and straightens. It leaves the hair smooth for a while but for me, it didn&#x27;t last throughout the day. I recommend it&#x27;s left on the 1st or 2nd level. It can damage your hair if you raise it any higher. I use a glove and I haven&#x27;t gotten burned once nor has it burned my scalp. It&#x27;s just a matter of how you use it.</li>
            <li> Used this on the lowest setting. Burned my scalp and ears several times. Too hot even at lowest setting. Red teeth also heat up compounding the problem. It looked like a quality curling iron, but I cannot use it. Back it goes!</li>
            <li> This tool is great for very thick course hair types.</li>
            <li> I love Conair products as a rule.  However, this Infiniti BC2 curling iron just gets \\&quot;way too hot\\&quot;.  No matter how low the temperature.  I have burned my fingers too often after receiving it.  I feel for the first time with Conair that they have let me down and the curling iron now resides unused in my cabinet. I will never use this curling iron again. What a shame....</li>
            <li> This is the Best curling Iron I have ever owned</li>
            <li> The design is awful. I bought mine at Ulta, and promptly returned it. I&#x27;ve been using brush curling irons for 30+ years, so I could practically use them blind folded. The red hot teeth on this actually burned my scalp! Ridiculous!</li>
            <li> It took me a while to get the hang of using it without burning myself as it does get very very hot but the curls really last!</li>
            <li> Well, this is my first curling iron in a very long time and I have to say I am thrilled with it.  Love the brush-like feature that makes it easier to manage and style.  Heats up as well and quickly as they say.  Contrary to other reviews, I have had no issues with the power on/off button on the handle or with the heating elements.  Love love love it!</li>
            <li> When I first started using this, it was great.  This was 6 mos. ago.  Now, for some unknown reason, it will only heat up one notch.  Instead of four, to the hottest.  I feel like I&#x27;m waiting for it to quit altogether now.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as everyone is saying, it does, indeed, get so hot I&#x27;ve been burnt many times. It&#x27;s scary.  Don&#x27;t use this on anyone other than yourself, it can burn too easily, without you knowing it, when using on someone else.</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever owned! When and if any thing happens to this one I will buy the exact same one over and over again! I love how fast it heats up and the quality of the curl is awsome!</li>
            <li> Works fantastic on very straight, thin hair.  Tons of curl in a fast time.  Really love it!</li>
            <li> Nice product, well made, sturdy, maybe a little large and heavy for someone who is more frail.  This thing really heats up!  Even on the lowest setting it is very hot, be careful not to burn yourself.  Great curling power and does the job quickly due to the fact that it is hot.  A very classy, well-made appliance.</li>
            <li> The hot brush is exactly what I wanted and need for my current hair style.  I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a good curling iron with the \\&quot;comb\\&quot; and various heat settings. I owned this curling iron for several years before I needed to replace it and did so with a Helen of Troy curling iron. I was so disappointed so I gave t away and ordered this curling iron again on Amazon. It has 4 heat settings between 310 and 395 degrees, auto off and swivel power cord. I really do not believe their is a better comb like curling iron than this!</li>
            <li> I waited about a month before reviewing just to make sure.  I love this!  I have to add that I was using a curing brush that was about 7 years old and it always tangled etc when taking it out of the curl.  This one is fantastic!  I have had no issues with tangling and it gets hot Fast!  Makes a perfect curl  and its quick.  I also love the different heat settings option.  I would recommend this product!  Oh by the way, I have long thick hair and it handles it nicely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good with clamp curling irons so I use the brush ones. This is  my second one of these and I love how hot it gets. You have to be careful because the red brushes get VERY hot. Some people don&#x27;t like that, but I&#x27;ve gotten use to it and seldom burn myself now. The only problem is that  the bristles of the brushes will break off over time. I kept my old one because you can take the end off and replace them. When I ran out of replacements, I ordered another one. I wish they made one in 3/4&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This hot brush is just that-takes seconds to heat up and the performance is great. I use it every day</li>
            <li> Hi my name is Elizabeth,&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27; ve been  using varieties of hair equipment  on my hair. Without reaching the successful just stepped out of the salon w</li>
            <li> Nearly impossible to use this curling iron without burning your fingers! Only got two stars because it was delivered in a very timely manner.</li>
            <li> First of all, it does get very hot. Which for me is perfecto!  I need it hot for my crazy curly wavy hair. It heats up very fast and makes beautiful curls. It also smoothes my hair.  It is great for making flips at the ends and rolling the top to make big nice curls. For the price and performance, this is a great beauty buy.  I have a high end straightener and this curling brush is really impressing me. I will update if my opinion changes but for now I am thrilled.</li>
            <li> I agree with all of the reviews.  The settings are very hot.  But I didn&#x27;t like the bristles...they weren&#x27;t sharp enough to grab my short course hair, so I used some bristles from another hot roller. Because of this, I am able to better control the temperature.      But the controls are another issue:  The settings are located on the handle....exactly where my hand is positioned to manage the turn of the roller.  Even with the slightest amount of pressure, my hand hits those controls and cuts off the unit.   This is frustrating, which is why I will toss this out as soon as I find another product.  Clearly, this was designed by a man.</li>
            <li> Works great, my wife&#x27;s hair looks very nice.  Goes along with the rest of her beauty.</li>
            <li> Loved this item....could not l.ocate any in the stores anywhere...</li>
            <li> This brush is not for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;It gets extremely hot even on the low setting. Luckily I have very thick &amp; course hair &amp; if I&#x27;m patient &amp; careful I just might not burn myself. I will keep it just  because I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of returning it. I gave it two stars because it&#x27;s oviouslly a good quality &amp; well built. I&#x27;m glad I kept my old one cause honestly I avoid using this one as much as I can.</li>
            <li> Nice, butbe careful picks get HOT</li>
            <li> No hair tangles, super hot, makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Teeth too short and too far apart, so burned my head.  I had to replace teeth with the ones from my old curling iron, then I was happy!!</li>
            <li> Difficult to use. Burns scalp and fingers.</li>
            <li> I have thin and fine short hair. This is probably the best curling brush I have ever purchased. I have the next size up which is 1 1/4 inch. I bought this model for other people who have different hair types and they like it also. For me flat irons don&#x27;t work for my hair. Other brushes are meant for people that have more hair. I also have a problem with my right arm and this is very easy for me to use. Great item. I wish they made a 3/4 inch.</li>
            <li> Buy it I am satisfied and sets my hair well.</li>
            <li> It is very useful, but gotta be careful using it or burns bad!</li>
            <li> This curling brush gets very hot and hard to keep away from my scalp as I have short hair.</li>
            <li> I am surprised that this hot brush is allowed on the market.  Even at the lowest setting, it burned my scalp.  It left a line of circular burns that align with the brush bristles.  In addition, the design is so flawed that it is impossible to use it without repeatedly turning it off.  The controls are push buttons located on the handle, so if you don&#x27;t hold it in exactly the correct position, the buttons are bumped and the iron is turned off.  A total waste of money and dangerous.  I gave it 2 stars because it did curl my hair nicely the few times I used it before throwing it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Heats instantly.  Can use to straighten or &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34; my hair or add some curl.  Gets very hot and have to be careful with it - it will burn you quite easily.</li>
            <li> This heating brush is very, very hot, even on the lowest setting.  I could not use it on my hair because everytime I would try and curl a hair strand round it, I would accidently touch the red teeth combs and burn my hand.  If it touched your neck, it burned it.  Very dangerous!  Also, the on/ off button is on the handle and it is very sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron!</li>
            <li> Wow!  gets hot!  Seems to work well on shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had read the reviews before I bought this item. I have used these types of brushes for 20 years. I wanted to try the new ceramic style brush so I bought this one. The problem is that it is so hot that I cannot use it, even on the low setting. I have burned my scalp, neck and ears. I regret having spent this much money for it.</li>
            <li> The Conair, Infiniti arrived quickly and works beautifully.  These are hard to find and they are great.  The teeth are short enough that hair does not tangle in them.</li>
            <li> I have fine, stubbornly straight hair so I love how hot this curling brush gets and the bristles are pretty good, too.  The biggest problem is the power button.  Some Einstein put this button in the middle of the handle, right where you hold onto it.  The button is one you just press, nothing that slides - every time your finger taps or hits it, you accidentally turn the power off.  If you move or rotate your hand on the handle, you turn it off... over and over and over again.  It&#x27;s a good thing it gets really hot, because half the time it&#x27;s cooling down because the heat is off.  You will end up literally screaming in frustration over this one little thing.  If your life has enough petty annoyances without adding more, avoid this styling brush like the plague.  It&#x27;s a shame, because otherwise it works really well.  Prime example of someone designing a product they&#x27;ve never actually used.  Can&#x27;t imagine how it passed product testing...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom who has medium length wavy/frizzy hair, and she&#x27;s happy with it.  It helps calm the frizz and relax her hair into gentle wavy curls.  The smaller diameter of the curler and the design of the teeth is really ideal for her hair because it doesnt get tangled.  It was actually hard for me to find many others this size &amp; length of teeth, so I was happy to find this one.</li>
            <li> this has made it so easy to get out the door in no time at all. Easy to use and great results.</li>
            <li> yes its HOT, so be careful. It does a great job curling my chin-length hair.&lt;br /&gt;I keep it at the lowest heat setting.&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair, and just a couple of second combing it through;&lt;br /&gt; and then flipping the brush under  makes my bob look great.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, first iron that puts the curl in to stay.  Love it, take It with me when I get my hair cut.</li>
            <li> I have fine, short hair and the 1&amp;#34; curling brush was what I kept searching for since the 1&amp;#34; Belson is no longer made.  There is definitely a learning curve involved in using this brush as the red brushes are what heat up and they get very hot....not like the other curling irons where the barrel heats up.  You&#x27;ll more than likely get burned a couple of times before you figure out how to hold this.  It heats up quickly and is the perfect size for me but I don&#x27;t know why they made the red brushes heat up when their other brushes heat the barrel as is normally the case.  I&#x27;ve used it several times now and haven&#x27;t been burning myself!</li>
            <li> I love the multiple heating options on this.  The highest setting keeps my hair locked into place all day long!  Other brushes just do not get hot enough to curl my difficult, fuzzy hair, so i&#x27;m giving this one a thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I applaud Conair for coming up with hair tools that women of color can use successfully. For years I have looked for products that can be used on my hair, none of them where hot enough until I tried this one. It works wether my hair is freshly relaxed or in desperate need of relaxing. It straightens and curls. It may be too hot if you have fine hair and they make another curling brush whose teeth do not heat, that may be the one for you. This one, however, is the one for me and is the reason why me and my girls have several of their styling implements in our bathrooms.</li>
            <li> The Conair hot brush has good heat and is easy to use.  It heats up quickly and has multiple heat settings. The downside is the on/off switch is located on the handle in a place where it is easily turned off during use.  This is annoying as it happens to me numerous times every time I use the brush.</li>
            <li> This is a nifty little device if you can get the hang of it. Like other reviewers, I agree that it&#x27;s extremely hot even on the lowest setting. However, I have managed to be able to work it without getting burned &amp; can now get ready for work pretty quickly since holding the curl for 3 seconds is all you need!</li>
            <li> I love these because they are so hot that they can put curl into my very fine stick-straight hair.  No other line or brand of curling iron has ever been able to do that before.  I like this for when my hair is shorter and I like the wand/clip ones for when it&#x27;s longer (those can make ringlets, yes, in MY hair).</li>
            <li> Great product.  It&#x27;s true it gets hot and you need to watch your hands, but you get good with it quickly.  Use a heat glove if you&#x27;re a novice.  Good curls, body, and ok straightening for straightish to kinda wavy hair, it smooths rather than straightens.  I love it, I blow my hair dry and throw in a few curls, takes five minutes and I look more polished.  I had one of these years ago and it always tangled my hair, not this one.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am an X cosmologist and I am use to using a Marcel curling iron and they get very hot. As soon as I read the review on it; that it was too hot! I had to order it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear my hair it a bob and curl at the ends also it is perm to give it volume. Usually I  blow out my wet hair and smooth it with a round brush and then curl it. But I found I can air dry or if I am in a hurry I can blow it out. If anyone ever have blown out a perm you know how fuzzy it gets. Because you can use this as a flat iron to smooth out your hair, you can also curl it at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I donâ€™t have the time to spend on my hair I usually have my hair done in 15 to 20 minute and that is from the time I blow it out and curl it. If you donâ€™t work as fast as I do put it on a lower setting, here is a trick you can do and I used it in the hair salon I always laid a comb on the scalp and the curling iron barrel on top of the comb. I never burn anybody scalp.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron, this is my third one that I have purchased already. The reason I had to buy a new is because the teeth on the curling iron break off and I can&#x27;t replace them. That is something that maybe conair should look into. I also loke how hot it gets because it really set my hair good. My hair is hard to curl. I would recommend this curling iron to others.</li>
            <li> Love it! Super fast shipping! Great price!</li>
            <li> Great size, heats fast.  Occasionally &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; myself with the heated red pins, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 3 months, then just quit working. Will not turn on.</li>
            <li> tip gets very hot so that you can&#x27;t handle it ...it is very unsatisfactory</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the Perfector but then I came across the Infiniti Pro by Conair and decided to give it a try. Not only is the price perfect but this curling brush is AMAZING. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed for my naturally curly ethnic hair. The digital temperature setting is a great feature and the heated bristles are a plus. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the only curling brush where the bristles actually get hot as well as the barrel. Heats instantly with variable heat settings. Absolutely love it! Grips hair well for quick, easy curls!</li>
            <li> This is a nice, hot iron. However, if you have short hair and are used to using a curling brush that touches the scalp, it will burn you.&lt;br /&gt;Would be great for long hair.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the other reviewers. Great idea, but on off button was oorly placec on the had grip and the heated prongs burn your fingers during working with it. Tried it once, got a few blisters and packed it away. A waste of money. It is not like this manufacturer to make something so faulty,</li>
            <li> Recently my Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush stopped working so I bought the Infiniti at my local Ulta store.  The first time I tried it I burned my fingers and my neck.  The second time I tried being very careful and was still burned on my neck and ears.  I tried using it again two more times and finally just put it back in the box and returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the being burned every time was the only issue that would be one thing but it just doesn&#x27;t work.  I have fine hair (which is why I&#x27;m using a curling brush) and it won&#x27;t grip or hold on to my hair unless I&#x27;m all but holding my hair on it.  Thus the finger burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried making it work but burned fingers and flat hair do make for a happy girl.  I&#x27;m going back to the Conair Instant Heat Hot Brush.</li>
            <li> I tried curling 1/2 my head with this just to see if I wanted to return it or not and that was all the test I needed to realize that I will return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that is a little past my collar bones, so maybe the length of my hair was the main problem for me, trying to use this.  I think that length of hair is too long for this, because you can&#x27;t really just brush through your hair with it and then quickly curl it, unless you want to get your hair all tangled up in it.  So, what I would do is just get small sections, exactly what I&#x27;d have to do with a clamp curling iron and then with the help of my heat glove, I&#x27;d help hold the hair onto it and start 1/2\\&quot; off the scalp and roll it around after I reached the tip of the hair and then I&#x27;d just hold it there for about 5 seconds.  That was long enough to create a curl, but some of them would have the bottoms of the curls looking crimpy-like and I&#x27;d have to go back over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took longer for me to curl my hair with this than it takes me to use a regular clamp curling iron. Even worse, there were tiny sections not curled at all, because it&#x27;s hard to lift complete sections when you&#x27;re having to use a glove vs. your bare hands.  Also, the over-all effect of the curls was just not as pretty as I get by using a regular 1 1/4\\&quot; barrel clamp iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried my bangs with it, which are only about 3\\&quot; long, but that also gave a very poor result that was just too curly, even with only the lowest heat setting and quickly curling the hair with it, vs. holding it there. I get a much better result just spraying them with water and blow drying with a round brush.  But the other problem with it, is that if you cannot get right up to the scalp without fear of burns, then that definitely does not work for creating volume at the roots or getting rid of cowlicks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I guess that even if you had really short hair and tried to use this, it would still give poor results since you can&#x27;t lift your hair close enough to the scalp to get volume.  I&#x27;d say if you have natural volume at the roots already and really short hair - maybe then it would work for you.  But then again, with hair like that, wouldn&#x27;t it just be way easier to spray it with water and blow dry with a round brush, or actually, with hair like that, I suppose you could probably just wash and go and never have to deal with any of this nonsense!your hair close enough to the scalp to get volume.

            <li> Cheaper than the Fusion perfecter.Great price.  Infiniti pro works really well. This one did not last very long.  Replacing this one with a  new one. We&#x27;ll see how long the new one lasts. First one lasted 5 months. I&#x27;m a stylist so I use mine a lot on the highest heat level. It still does work, but doesn&#x27;t get as hot. I use it more on ethnic hair. Make sure you clean the barrel off using 99% alcohol on a towel, cleans up really well. Overall I prefer this hot tool over many others. Professional opinion, and salon owner. (I will update again later)</li>
            <li> I have used my styling brush 3 times this week and I love it. I like the various setting choices available and the long cord.&lt;br /&gt;The brushes stay warm, not hot, while in use and it can be easily handled with bare hands. The curl stays in all day and&lt;br /&gt;I love that!</li>
            <li> It gets VERY hot -even without increasing the heat.  I&#x27;ll use it because I bought it - but wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.  I should have listened to other reviewers.</li>
            <li> Hard to control heat and it does tend to burn fingers more than my old one did. Good size and does a good curling job on my thick wavy hair.</li>
            <li> On the lowest setting it lets off a lot of steam.  You have to be very careful not to burn yourself.  I have used many styling brushes and have never had one that was so burning hot as this one.  You can just see the hot steam coming from it.  I say that if you buy it, please try to be very careful that you don&#x27;t get burned.  I bought it because I wanted the 1inch, which, for some reason, is not that easy to find.</li>
            <li> I returned it because every row gets hot and it burned me.  I could not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot.  The brushes as well as the rod.  Can&#x27;t touch the brushes.  With my older one, only the rod was hot, not the brush tips.&lt;br /&gt;Not as good for short hair as it is for long.</li>
            <li> I find it gets a little to hot even on&amp;#34; just on&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This was not what I ordered. I wanted the 1/2 hot brush and I was sent the 1 inch. I gave it away as I could not fine the box it came in so I could not return.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t use it next to your head or you will burn your scalp or ears with the heated bristles.  You can&#x27;t grip the hair around the brush because the heated bristles will burn your hand.  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my new hot brush.  It heats quickly and does not tangle in hair.  I did not get a tight enough curl to use it on freshly  shamooed hair, but I have very  fine hair and this may be the reason.  After being curled previously with regular iron, the brush works great</li>
            <li> This gets hot enough to curl and straighten  my hair.  Careful as it gets very hot, but does the job.</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush, i grow up with one. VERY hard to find in the stores now. Love it! It works great, leaves my hair super soft n the curls so soft as well. Gets very very HOT, so be careful not to touch the red bristles. It has a few heat setting I keep it on 395, works like a dream . I have no issues with the on n off switch, like some have mention. Love it!!!</li>
            <li> Fabulous Product!  Was looking at the Perfecter, but it was ridiculously expensive.  This styling brush heats up fast and does a wonderful job.  The results are beautiful and long-lasting.  Other reviews mentioned burning, but you would really have to work hard to burn yourself.  A couple of times practicing and you will master this!</li>
            <li> love this curling brush, I have infinity straightening iron and loved it, so got this&lt;br /&gt;infinity curling brush and loved it. Thank you</li>
            <li> Too big and sometimes I burn my scalp where small teeth are and I get it too close.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like it, the red part burns my fingers and I can&#x27;t get used to using it.  Should have sent it back.</li>
            <li> I had been looking at the &amp;#34;Perfecter&amp;#34; but kept being put off by the price. This certainly does the job and has made my morning much simpler. My only suggestion would be for them to drop the hot red spikes. I&#x27;m not sure how much these do and if they weren&#x27;t there I wouldn&#x27;t need to wear a heat resistant glove to operate.</li>
            <li> Have been using this type of curling iron for a while.  I am able to do a number of styles with my hair.  Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is made very well.  Be careful the red combs are hot!</li>
            <li> This is a great hot brush. Since my hair has gone gray it&#x27;s stick straight so in order to curl it as well as give it body, I need something that gets fairly hot.  My only problem with this hot brush is that when wrapping your hair around it, its fairly easy to burn your fingertips. I would recommend starting out at the lowest setting to start and touching only the very end/tip when wrapping your hair around it. Otherwise it works great and I haven&#x27;t singed my hair or my finger tips.</li>
            <li> bought 2. my wife just loves &#x27;em. 1 for here &amp;1 for there.&lt;br /&gt;merry xmas</li>
            <li> FINALLY...a curling iron brush that gets hot!  Love this!  I hope they keep selling this one.</li>
            <li> A  man designed these. When you use them you  are constantly burning your hand. I would say to Conair,back to the drawing board with this product!</li>
            <li> Good hot brush, it does the same as a flat iron. be careful of the red teeth, they heats up</li>
            <li> I recommend this is very good</li>
            <li> I have mixed feelings about this item.  It made my hair crazy shiny, which I LOVE (which is why I gave it two stars instead of one), but it gets insanely HOT; burned my scalp in several places.  I want to use it...but I&#x27;m seriously terrified of the stupid thing. It&#x27;s an unfortunate design flaw; hope they fix it.</li>
            <li> I thought I had found the perfect curling brush in the perfect size, but this thing gets entirely too hot. Even on the lowest heat setting, it is dangerous. Am still trying to use, but will probably end up on shelf in the hair styling tools graveyard. Worst I ever bought and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife as one of her Christmas present to replace an old one from the 1980&#x27;s.  She has no complaints. It gets the job done . . . curling her hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great HOT curling iron.  I have hard to curl hair and it does it in seconds.  I love this product!!</li>
            <li> This product is exactly what I wanted.  Take caution to leave it on a lower setting than you think you need.  It gets super hot.</li>
            <li> THIS HOT BRUSH HEATS UP QUICKLY AND GIVES YOUR HAIR LOTS OF CURLS OR BODY...DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU WANT. LOVE THIS DEVICE.............I.HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL!</li>
            <li> I baby fine hair. This curlers gives me the curls that last. Love it ! would not dream of a better product.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very poorly designed. The on/off button is right where your fingers hit when trying to use on your hair resulting in you pushing the off button.&lt;br /&gt;The teeth on the iron are too short and you easily burn your scalp!&lt;br /&gt;Too bad on this one!</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.  It&#x27;s the best one I&#x27;ve had in years.  Just turn it on and it gets hot enough without adjusting the heat settings.  It&#x27;s true that the short red bristles get hot.  Just don&#x27;t get it too close to your scalp, as with any curling iron.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking but could not find in the stores</li>
            <li> quick heat-up and nice range of temperatures.</li>
            <li> i should have listened to the other reviews - REALLY hot - burned myself several times&lt;br /&gt;i think the bristles are too short</li>
            <li> I would give this curling iron 5 stars if it had the heated barrel as opposed to heated bristles. Yes, this iron burns my head every time I use it, so I&#x27;ve gotten very good at not letting it touch my scalp. I also use the smallest heat setting and get plenty of curl. Not sure how anyone could use the hottest setting and not have their hair burn off or end up in the ER. I would really love it if they would go to a heated barrel as this the perfect size and I like the auto shut off if I forget to turn it off. There is a cheaper hot iron available on Amazon and I&#x27;ve gone though 3 of them because they are just cheaply made hot irons. This is a quality iron with a definite drawback.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful. It heats almost immediately, the little \\&quot;nubs\\&quot; are a plus as I have baby fine hair and have always gotten tangled hairs as I&#x27;ve tried to keep the hair wrapped around the more inferior brands, this one grips it and I just hold the curl for a few seconds before moving onto the next section. It has a swivel cord that works great and a nice loooooooooong cord, which provides me with multi-functions as i curl my hair I can turn around the corner and talk to people or watch t.v. lol...I highly recommend this, and I plan on buying a &#x27;spare&#x27; one soon, just so I know I have a replacement if/when needed.3/23/13 UPDATE PLEASE READ~~!!!The curling brush will no longer heats up, nothing! Wow, the greatest hair curling brush I&#x27;ve ever had and it lasted only 3 months. WON&#x27;T be ordering that \\&quot;spare\\&quot; ladies, waste of $!</li>
            <li> Rocks! love it!! it makes my hair behave! I had to get used to the hot bristles but once I did it made my hair do what I wanted!</li>
            <li> We have spent many days looking for this type of product.  It does exactly what my wife wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> Works great!  I like the various heat settings.</li>
            <li> End gets very hot, so you have to twirl your hair onto it one-handed, which is a little tricky. Also, half of the rows of teeth are super &#x3D;-short and you can scald your scalp if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> Replacement.  Only con is where the on/off button is.  It keeps getting turned off while using it, other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Good product....but watch the temperature so you don&#x27;t burn your hair.</li>
            <li> Just love my Conair 1-Inch curling iron!! Wish it was also in 3/4&amp;#34;. Heats fast and works great. Since I am not handy with the traditional kind I love the brush type and it makes great volume and curl.  Hope they continue to make these. I should get a back up one for in the future.</li>
            <li> I started learning to use curing iron couple weeks ago and found this was the only one that was easy for me to handle curling my hair due to the design of the &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34;.  I must admit that at first couple of times of using it, I did accidentally touch my ears with the hot brush but it was all during my learning how to use it right, but, it really could be avoided if I did it slowly with small amount of hair each time. I have very fine hair so I set the temperature at 310 or 330 and it works greatly.  I also love the design of the switch - unlike many&lt;br /&gt;other curling irons in the market, I could use this brush to curl my hair without worrying I touch the switch/button and shut off accidental.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> Circumference is a little bigger than my ancient model, but it&#x27;s working as long as I don&#x27;t get my hair cut any shorter.  I like that there are choices for heat settings which my old model didn&#x27;t have.  Feel it was a much needed update, just takes a little getting used to.</li>
            <li> 2nd one of these. wore out one and decided to buy another.  liked so much replaced it with duplcate. works great.</li>
            <li> I looked all over my area to find a 1 inch curling iron.  It seems no one is carrying them.  I went onto Amazon and found this one right away.  It does get really hot as other reviews reported but as I got used to it, it was not a problem.  It has a little stand so the hot wand does not sit on the counter.  It also has a long cord which works really well.  Because of the heat I can get my hair done more quickly.  I like it and would order it again.</li>
            <li> This item  works great with hard to curl hair because it can become very hot. Watch you fingers. The tip could be longer to help prevent finger burn. I have owned one of these for several years. They do last.  My main complaint is the position of the buttons on the handle. They are very easy to accidentally turn off. You will eventually notice you hair not curly so well and will have to reheat hot brush and start that section over again. Very frustrating if you are in a hurry. For this reason I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> got as xmas gift for my friend it arrived fast n was great buy item well exceeded my expectations. was well worth the satisfaction</li>
            <li> Not a brush with traditional brissels, but rather more like teeth.  Heats nearly instantly -- very long cord -- many heat settings.  have purchased one for each home because the iron does what it is designed to do -- turn and curve the hair -- or make it curley without curling iron marks!  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Conair is my go to brand for hair appliances but if I can find another 1 &amp;#34; barrel heated curling brush I&#x27;m ditching this one.  The biggest problem is  the every other row of heated bristles.  I thought i would be able to learn how to use it without burning myself at least once during each session but not so far.  I don&#x27;t know why they had to make it with heated bristles as well a heated barrel.  My other heated curling brushes only heat the barrel but alas the barrels are either too big or too little so I was excited to find this one.  The reason I don&#x27;t give it zero stars is that I like how it has adjustable heat settings and a quick heat up plus the perfect barrel size.</li>
            <li> I have short fine hair and it works great.  Be sure t only hold it by the handle and tip or you will burn your fingers.</li>
            <li> I love this hot brush.  Heats up very quickly and gets very hot,  If you are careful. you will not get burned. I have almost&lt;br /&gt;shoulder-length hair and I have had no tangling issues.  I use it every day after I have blown dry my hair to basically smooth&lt;br /&gt;it out. I also like that it has a long cord.  Great brush!!</li>
            <li> Good quality for this unit.</li>
            <li> Just as pictured and just like the one I used and loved daily  for 6 years</li>
            <li> The teeth are hard plastic and scratch my scalp and not very effective curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Best hot brush out there!  Gets really hot, does the job, doesn&#x27;t get caught or knotted in your hair and easy to use.  What more could you ask for?  Just be careful though, it will burn your skin when the temperature is up high and you press it against your skin.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it too hot, and burns your fingers regardless of thermal gloves</li>
            <li> The only problem with it is that the ends of the bristles are very hot and it is very easy to burn yourself. Even just to wrap the ends of your hair around the rod, you have to be very careful and if you touch the bristle ends to your head, it burns.</li>
            <li> Curler does a great job in curling my hair in traditionalist curls or ringlests. Been using this product for two weeks and I LOVE it. The wand is not bulky like other curling tools, which makes it easy to work with. The tool gets hot fast so be careful not to touch the red bristles or the gray iron part. I used the lowest setting for the first week until I was comfortable using the tool. Now I can turn the heat up if needed to get the job done faster. I have med-long hair that is very thick. This product works great for me!</li>
            <li> The plug is made of such soft rubber the prongs don&#x27;t stay in the outlet, bending them does not help.  The least bit of tension slips the plug out of the socket and shuts the thing down.  Also, the bristles are so short they don&#x27;t catch the hair.  I have to grab a lock, wrap the hair around the rod, smooth it out, then go on to the next section, always avoiding the hot prongs.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I came here to find it online since mine is finally breaking down.  Most other curling brush iron&#x27;s little brush pieces come off so quickly, and seem so cheap.  This curling iron has lasted me a couple years or more.  It heats up quickly and I set it on the second to high heat setting, and it does great.  I have read people&#x27;s remarks on burning themselves.  I have I believe at least once if not twice, but not very badly.  Considering the old rod curling irons that used to burn people&#x27;s foreheads, scalp, and necks, this is nothing.  I don&#x27;t have any problems with it being too hot.  Maybe because lots of my hair that I lose once and while coats the brush so that it&#x27;s not as hot.  I don&#x27;t know.  I don&#x27;t remember it being that hot when I first got it.  All I know is it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used on my fine, thin hair, and I am disappointed to not see it sold in any of the basic stores in my area, but I see amazon has it, so I will definitely buy it from here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job!</li>
            <li> Very unhappy with this curling iron.  Used less than a month and it fell apart. Would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> Love that it has heat settings and that this brush heats my hair more consistently...leaving great body and curl.  I have very fine hair and this brush smooths out any frizz leaving it look great!</li>
            <li> Love this curling brush--lightweight, gives a nice long-lasting curl.</li>
            <li> forget the perfector for $100, save your money girls..this  works..my best friend bought a perfecter and i bought this..well lets just say, i saved alot of money..this works great..i used both on my hair and this worked even better..i have shoulder length, frizzy curly hair and i never got so many compliments after i used this, its great and i love my hair..buy, you wont be sorry..my best friend is so mad..lol..she spent that kind of money when she saw my hair..</li>
            <li> This curling brush works great. HOWEVER, the red bristles get SUPER HOT as they are heated, not just the ceramic. You have to get used to it, or you could burn your scalp like I keep doing! It has multiple heat settings as well as an auto shut off.  It is well made.</li>
            <li> I love it! Highly recommend it. It does get very hot which works very well for my curly hair. It straighten and curl my hair very nicely.</li>
            <li> I sent it back. I tried several times to make my longish hair into the ringlets everyone wears, and I started at the top like it said in the reviews. I even went online to watch the instructions for the Perfector. I could get the curls, but over and over, the curls were gone in 20 minutes. Waste of time. But Amazon gave me my money back, even the shipping. Love Amazon!</li>
            <li> Is it ever more HOT, I BURN MY head. I had a Conair hot brush , it lasted for&lt;br /&gt;years. (the old one would dry my hair) . Its not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Very good product, good service and price.</li>
            <li> After using Conair curling brushes for years I recently bought this one when my old one quit working. I really dislike it because it is so hot and I burn my fingers, head, and ears. The older styles had the black bristles all around so that rarely happened. The heated red bristles are dangerous in my opinion. I don&#x27;t know how this curler passed testing.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron To keep my hair texture straight a great buy</li>
            <li> I love this curling brush. Hope it never goes out of style because this is the only one I can use. I bought 2. One for home and one for camp</li>
            <li> This styling brush is great. It heats up vey fast, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great quality...not so great an idea, so 3 stars.  Burn myself every time I use due to hot bristles.  Poor concept IMO.</li>
            <li> This works like a dream for my hair.  You just have to position it just right so that you don&#x27;t burn your scalp.  It only takes me minutes to fix my shoulder length hair and it is shinier now for some reason.  Highly recomend.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s love it! I got so many repeated hugs and thank yous for their Christmas bushes.  Received one that I need to exchange and getting my daughter to give it to me to box and return is like pulling teeth.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> this brush is ok, but it&#x27;s not perfect. the teeth are too far apart so they don&#x27;t grip the hair well enough. It also means that you burn your fingers often because there aren&#x27;t enough teeth in the way to protect your fingers. It does get really hot though, and that is the problem with most other curling brushes - they don&#x27;t get hot enough. The size of the barrel is perfect for just the right amount of curl. I will keep this, but am still on the lookout for the perfect one. I wih there was a corder version of the Braun butane curling brush - it&#x27;s perfect in every way (although I think it&#x27;s not being sold anywhere)</li>
            <li> I love this ceramic brush for the smooth finish it gives my hair. I had to use my &amp;#34;old-fashion&amp;#34; hot brush while waiting for my order and the difference was amazing. With my old brush my hair was burned and frizzy looking after using it.</li>
