            <li>I am using Murad&#x27;s Resurgence kit and it&#x27;s still working great for me, so I wanted another Murad product - one at a time, just in case, and I decided to go with this primer.</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>

            <li>The shipping was quick and I am happy with the service.</li>
            <li>I love this make up sooooo much!!!!!  </li>

            <li>I like this one better because it is a shine and acne control.</li>
            <li>My favorite product ever.</li>
            <li>I used to buy it at Ulta for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>This product has, for the most part, taken care of this.  </li>
            <li>all day &amp; I&#x27;m a dog groomer, I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>Of course that on hot days as I don&#x27;t sweat as much, thus, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>All the murad products are reasonably priced &amp; have amazing results!  </li>
            <li>Best daily facial product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your face looking and feeling beautiful.</li>
            <li>Love how it also evens the skin tone like a light layer of foundation.</li>
            <li>The product glides on easily creating a uniform canvas on the face.</li>
            <li>Easy to blend and can be used without foundation.  </li>
            <li>It works just fine for me</li>
            <li>This is one of my absolute favorite products!</li>
            <li>I looked like I used cheap self tanner.  </li>
            <li>and it still gives a nice light natural coverage that does not even need a powder over the top.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, even tones,  controls breakouts, with an SPF.  </li>
            <li>MURAD is light weight, does not clog my pores,&lt;br /&gt;lasts</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous and does just what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stink, it goes on smoothly, and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>My new favorite primer!</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try this product, but it makes me look like I have dirt on my face.</li>
            <li>This &#x27;tinted primer&#x27; went on more like a creme foundation than a primer, which is exactly what i DON&#x27;T want on my face.</li>
            <li>Super natural look, love it!</li>
            <li>and they work great together to keep my shine down.</li>
            <li>, provides enough coverage on most days, and does what I need it to do!</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin with some light acne issues.</li>
            <li>It is bigger than it appears in the picture which was a nice surprise.  </li>
            <li>in laugh lines</li>
            <li>it does not make me break out, which is phenomenal, since I have really sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to pair with Clean and Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets throughout the day to touch up.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend tarte&#x27;s silicone free primer.</li>
            <li>Nice matte finish that lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s much lighter, but your skin still looks super even in color, and texture.</li>
            <li>I am an aesthetician and this product certainly does exactly what it&#x27;s promised!</li>
            <li>I love it because it doesn&#x27;t break me out (actually helps)</li>
            <li>I use alone sometimes when it is too hot to put a lot of make-up on</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break me out, I use the same makeup and when I have used this, I don&#x27;t have to retouch/re-powder more than once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is to be expected when using products with acne medication,  but this was far more extreme than anything I&#x27;ve experienced.  </li>
            <li>It is AMAZING on my highly problematic skin (oily, dry, and breakout prone).</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice primer with a little tint that might be enough coverage for many women.  </li>
            <li>use it regularly by itself to keep my skin from drying out or becoming too oily.</li>
            <li>My skin is super oily, and sensitive.</li>
            <li>Sadly, this product is not meant for people with very fair skin tones.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product...</li>
            <li>but it turned really orange-ish.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t use too much or rub it too much, or it will start to flake.</li>
            <li>Did it help much with the oil control?</li>
            <li>I used to use like 3 absorbing sheets a day, but not anymore.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin that is shinny and acne prone, lucky me at 31 years old!</li>
            <li>only word of advice is just that if you&#x27;re super fair like me, make sure you don&#x27;t go crazy on the amount you use.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have had mixed success using it on my eyelids, but it works like a champ everywhere else, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday use, but it does not completely hide big imperfections.</li>
            <li>I live at the beach</li>
            <li>I live in Texas</li>
            <li>I wear this product everyday and when I am going out or to a wedding I will layer a mineral powder make-up over it for more complete coverage.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and any new products</li>
            <li>I can go all day and just have a slight oil sheen on my face which is huge for me.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if maybe what I got was old or what,</li>
            <li>and I think it helps control my acne breakouts with the acid, but doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of your shine.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 47 years old &amp; make that I was using OTC cover girl/ maybelline,</li>
            <li>I use the complete Murad line for acne prone skin and have noticed no breakouts or blemishes as a result of using the Acne and Shine control.</li>
            <li>However,  I didn&#x27;t give it five stars only because it dried my skin out tremendously when I first started using it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any long term positive effects.  </li>

            <li> Totally recommend for people with dry skin!</li>
            <li> but the price is ridiculus and should be at least twice as much then is offered.</li>
            <li> Has kept the make-up related acne down.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look/feel oily or greasy, and it works well with my other products.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s with typically aging skin issues and I am not going to say that this is a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly, no strong odor, doesn&#x27;t give me a darker or lighter color.</li>
            <li> I came to Amazon to order this after I was unable to find it at my local Ulta which is where I previously purchased it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it has the acne clearing benefits it claims.</li>
            <li> I like this primer for the summer when I&#x27;m prone to sweating and looking like an oil slick.</li>
            <li> The control shine works for at least 6 hours before you need to blot.</li>
            <li> Expensive lesson.</li>
            <li> My skin will not shine at all, it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> (Very sad.)</li>
            <li> but I hated it.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product...but it turned really orange-ish.  I looked like I used cheap self tanner.  Ick.  I don&#x27;t know if maybe what I got was old or what, but I hated it.  AND it didn&#x27;t control oil like it said.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Great primer that also evens the skin tone. Has kept the make-up related acne down. Nice matte finish that lasts a long time. Doesn&#x27;t quite last all day though. Does need some refreshing to keep the shine down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it regularly by itself to keep my skin from drying out or becoming too oily. Love how it also evens the skin tone like a light layer of foundation.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this product is not meant for people with very fair skin tones.  I was so excited to try this product, but it makes me look like I have dirt on my face. (Very sad.)</li>
            <li> This product is great!  VERY good for shine control.  It is bigger than it appears in the picture which was a nice surprise.  It is cheaper on Amazon that in stores.  It took a bit longer than I thought for it to arrive but overall I would buy again from this same dealer.</li>
            <li> I personally do not use it as a primer. I wear it by itself and it kind of does alright with coverage on its own. I definitely see a difference. It doesn&#x27;t look/feel oily or greasy, and it works well with my other products. You can&#x27;t use too much or rub it too much, or it will start to flake. I love it because it doesn&#x27;t break me out (actually helps), provides enough coverage on most days, and does what I need it to do! I have repurchased it already and will continue to keep it handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only word of advice is just that if you&#x27;re super fair like me, make sure you don&#x27;t go crazy on the amount you use. It&#x27;s better suited to summer color skin and I&#x27;ll be using it more then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple weeks now and I think it helps control my acne breakouts with the acid, but doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of your shine.  Make sure to pair with Clean and Clear Oil Absorbing Sheets throughout the day to touch up.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! It does not overdry my skin it has great almost perfect pigmentation. It was perfect for my skin type which is combination skin. Totally recommend for people with dry skin!</li>
            <li> It works great. Has controlled my shine and my breakouts. However,  I didn&#x27;t give it five stars only because it dried my skin out tremendously when I first started using it. This is to be expected when using products with acne medication,  but this was far more extreme than anything I&#x27;ve experienced.  After the about 2 week adjustment period,  my skin looks great.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before, but the matte finish. I like this one better because it is a shine and acne control. This really is a great primer. I use alone sometimes when it is too hot to put a lot of make-up on and it still gives a nice light natural coverage that does not even need a powder over the top.</li>
            <li> Best daily facial product on the market.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves your face looking and feeling beautiful. It&#x27;s light weight, even tones,  controls breakouts, with an SPF.  I have been using it for years. I live at the beach and it&#x27;s all I use. My favorite product ever.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I used to buy it at Ulta for a lot more money. Thank you Amazon! I wear this over Murad&#x27;s oil control mattifying lotion with spf 15 and they work great together to keep my shine down. I live in Texas so make up tends to melt off in the summer, but these two products have saved me from this fate. I have very sensitive skin that is shinny and acne prone, lucky me at 31 years old! Murad products have solved all my skin issues. I wear this product everyday and when I am going out or to a wedding I will layer a mineral powder make-up over it for more complete coverage. The shipping was quick and I am happy with the service. [[ASIN:B001LNTNGC Murad Oil-Control Mattifier SPF 15 1.7 oz]]</li>
            <li> This is one of my absolute favorite products! I am an aesthetician and this product certainly does exactly what it&#x27;s promised!</li>
            <li> This &#x27;tinted primer&#x27; went on more like a creme foundation than a primer, which is exactly what i DON&#x27;T want on my face. It looked cake-y and gross on my freckled skin. I would not consider recommending it. save your money, it&#x27;s not a quality product... unless you want a foundation like primer. Expensive lesson. I highly recommend tarte&#x27;s silicone free primer. It is AMAZING on my highly problematic skin (oily, dry, and breakout prone). Check that one out if your skin is like mine, i&#x27;ll never try another product again after this experience.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have very oily skin and makeup never stays on for longer than a few hours.  This product has, for the most part, taken care of this.  I have had mixed success using it on my eyelids, but it works like a champ everywhere else, and it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.</li>
            <li> I love this make up sooooo much!!!!!  I&#x27;m 47 years old &amp; make that I was using OTC cover girl/ maybelline, etc&lt;br /&gt;cakes in laugh lines &amp; it discolors after like 6 hours....YUCK!  MURAD is light weight, does not clog my pores,&lt;br /&gt;lasts all day &amp; I&#x27;m a dog groomer, I love this stuff...it does not make me break out, which is phenomenal, since I have really sensitive skin.  All the murad products are reasonably priced &amp; have amazing results!  LOVE MURAD!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wish they didn&#x27;t discontinue this product!!! I love it!</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s with typically aging skin issues and I am not going to say that this is a &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; product but it&#x27;s a nice primer with a little tint that might be enough coverage for many women.  I have just started using it so I don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s any long term positive effects.  Product arrived on time with no issues of quality in packaging.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous and does just what it says it will do. The product glides on easily creating a uniform canvas on the face. I can go all day and just have a slight oil sheen on my face which is huge for me. I use the complete Murad line for acne prone skin and have noticed no breakouts or blemishes as a result of using the Acne and Shine control. I&#x27;m sold!!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a primer that does not make my skin feel oily. Have used this for several years.</li>
            <li> I am using Murad&#x27;s Resurgence kit and it&#x27;s still working great for me, so I wanted another Murad product - one at a time, just in case, and I decided to go with this primer. It doesn&#x27;t break me out, I use the same makeup and when I have used this, I don&#x27;t have to retouch/re-powder more than once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have oily skin and this worked for me, hopefully for you, too. It goes on smoothly, no strong odor, doesn&#x27;t give me a darker or lighter color. My new favorite primer!</li>
            <li> Easy to blend and can be used without foundation.  The control shine works for at least 6 hours before you need to blot.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin with some light acne issues. Did it help much with the oil control? Sometimes. It depends on the weather. Of course that on hot days as I don&#x27;t sweat as much, thus, it is perfect. When it is warmer, then it doesn&#x27;t work as well. I eventually got Mac&#x27;s blotting powder to go with it. The two work well together. If it were only Mac&#x27;s blotting powder, then it would be the weather experience all over again. Gotta use both together.</li>
            <li> I am not sure it has the acne clearing benefits it claims. It works just fine for me but my skin is the same as it was before I started using it a couple of months ago.</li>
            <li> I came to Amazon to order this after I was unable to find it at my local Ulta which is where I previously purchased it. I have sensitive skin and any new products cause me to break out. I like this primer for the summer when I&#x27;m prone to sweating and looking like an oil slick. It doesn&#x27;t stink, it goes on smoothly, and it lasts all day. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> its only but doesn&#x27;t hold make up all day.</li>
            <li> I have to say I&#x27;m beyond impressed. My skin is super oily, and sensitive. Everything breaks me out, but this. It doesn&#x27;t go on as make up it&#x27;s much lighter, but your skin still looks super even in color, and texture. My skin will not shine at all, it&#x27;s crazy. I used to use like 3 absorbing sheets a day, but not anymore. It&#x27;s great for everyday use, but it does not completely hide big imperfections. Super natural look, love it!</li>
            <li> This product does what it says it will but the price is ridiculus and should be at least twice as much then is offered.</li>
