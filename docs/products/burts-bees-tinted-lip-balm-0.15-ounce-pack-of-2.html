    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great for women with olive tanned skin like mine!</li>
            <li>The color is perfect!</li>
            <li>Works great on winter lips!  </li>
            <li>So this is perfect!</li>
            <li>I think that Burt&#x27;s Bees just makes very good products.</li>
            <li>Color, smell, very good moist.</li>
            <li>It is great.</li>
            <li>The color of this tint is perfect for most.  </li>
            <li>I do my best to keep it on during the summer, too, because my lips are easily sunburned as well.</li>
            <li>It just feels really good on my lips.</li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s the good &amp; the bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great feeling and nice</li>
            <li>It gives a good color</li>
            <li>The fact that it keeps my lips soft and smooth while having the perfect amount of color is a win, win.</li>
            <li>Lip balm works well, is moisturizing, and has a nice tint to it.</li>
            <li>packaging.&lt;br /&gt;the color is nice and not too bright.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product would have been perfect except for one flaw, and it is major for me.  </li>
            <li>: This goes on smoothly &amp; easily, which was nice.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s very light, more moist than color</li>
            <li>but if you want smoother healthy lips..don&#x27;t,</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using Burt&#x27;s Bees products for years.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of it</li>
            <li>and i love the fact that there is no peppermint in it like most of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many compliments whenever i wear it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been rather pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Color-wise it resembles more of a lip tint or gloss, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this lip balm as a more affordable option versus the Sugar brand.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the application.</li>
            <li>Either way its better than lipstick itself.</li>
            <li>I have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s been okay.  </li>
            <li>I still love its texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Recently I was burned on the mouth and lips and was able to use my lip balm even with the burn and it felt very good and healing on my burned lips.</li>
            <li>(I wasn&#x27;t sure how the darker colors would appear or how strong the colors would be, after all.)</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and smooth.</li>
            <li>I purchased these tinted lip balms in every shade available and I just love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, very moist - good hydration&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the original Burt bees lip balm.</li>
            <li>I think maybe the balm had melted and reformed at one point, with the top of stick not having as much color as the rest.</li>
            <li>Has a mild sweet scent but once applied the smell goes away.</li>
            <li>hibiscus shade is more of a ruddy pink-brown than I usually like, but it looks good when applied sparingly.</li>
            <li>After some hemming &amp; hawing over the tints, I finally settled on hibiscus since it was the most neutral rose tint without it being completely identical to my lip color.</li>
            <li>The outter packaging is nice and leads you to believe the size of the lip balm would be larger.</li>
            <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees seems well worth the cost</li>
            <li>I use regular Burt&#x27;s Bees all the time, so I thought it would be nice to have some that was tinted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>for Hibiscus color, I like the color all right.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel crisp and clean the way that the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees does; it feels more like lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lightweight, fairly moisturizing lip balm that doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out, but it doesn&#x27;t really heal chapped lips either.</li>
            <li>People don&#x27;t automatically look at you and think you have on a big old pile of lipstick which I think is a good thing.</li>
            <li>About the formulation, I cant really say that is the most moisturizing lip balm that I have tried, but it does gives you soft lips.</li>
            <li>I got this the other day and the color was so natural and made my lips feel great.</li>
            <li>I am one of those people that constantly am applying chapstick, and then lipstick on top.</li>
            <li>and I get more solid color, without the fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I still have to wear regular chap stick and then use this on top for color.</li>
            <li>When I removed the lip balm from the upscale packaging, I was thinking Burt&#x27;s Bees had really gotten it right.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really look like lipstick--it&#x27;s kind of light, so it just makes your lips look a little more pink, in</li>
            <li>B004XAY036 Fresh Sugar Honey Tinted Lip Treatment SPF 15]] that I use for subtle color and decided to give this a try since I love the original Burt bees lip balm.   </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The color does show up but doesn&#x27;t show up as much as you would see with lipsticks.</li>
            <li>so this wasn&#x27;t really a deal breaker for</li>
            <li>I really like Burts Bee&#x27;s lip balm.</li>
            <li>Although I love the feel and smell of this lip balm, I was EXTREMELY upset about the deceptive and wasteful packaging for this product.</li>
            <li>For $7.00, I certainly would have expected something a little more than a chapstick!!</li>
            <li>This wore off faster than the chapstick products normally did, so I had to reapply more often than I would with some of the other products.</li>
            <li>as a balm and work the Burts Bees magic to make my lips soft while at the same time adding a natural looking tint that goes well with every look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells sweet, like the lipglosses that my sister and I used to buy back when we were in high</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes in a pretty and sturdy box, which I like, but the packaging of the product feels a little cheap</li>
            <li>Yeah, I think I would, considering that I really like the shade and its all natural.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a pretty decent product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, BUT ever since the original Burt&#x27;s Bees company sold out to CLOROX, I no longer trust the ethics of this company.</li>
            <li>I want to try the light pink next.</li>
            <li>Coming from a natural company like Burt&#x27;s Bees, this came as quite a surprise.  </li>
            <li>Also they are natural.</li>
            <li>The lip balm looks natural on your lips.</li>
            <li>keeps your lips soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;nice way to keep lips soft</li>
            <li>In fact, when you open the \\&quot;box,\\&quot; it has a piece of tape over the opening so that you really cannot see how small the product truely is.</li>
            <li>The color is also far too sheer on my naturally nudish-pink lips to be an acceptable substitute for my chemical-ladden lip glosses and lipsticks.</li>
            <li>a natural way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is kind of weird.  </li>
            <li>It is robust enough to truly look like a very natural tint.</li>
            <li>I love &#x27;hibiscus&#x27;, is a peachy deep color very flattering on the lips, but subtle enough for daily use.</li>
            <li>I suggest using the regular burts bees and if you want natural color use this</li>
            <li>It not only colors your lips, but leaves your lips feeling hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it doesnt feel totally light while you are wearing it, and it can be a little heavy if you dont warm the wax enough (going over the lips a couple of times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this is a decent product &amp; now that I know the tints aren&#x27;t as dark as I was thinking they might be, I&#x27;m going to try the darker shades next.</li>

            <li> It just honestly feels like a lipstick and feels very weird on my lips...</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this Burt&#x27;s bees tinted lip balm a four star instead of a five star is that it is more expensive on Amazon than some other places that sell Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> This product keeps your lips from being dry but doesn&#x27;t give enough color for my taste.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I do not like about it is that it tends to dry out my lips.</li>
            <li> It has a strange scent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the other tinted products by BB &amp; overall</li>
            <li> One thing I would recommend is that you do a little price comparing since the cost here on amazon is a little on the high side.</li>
            <li> It has really no comparison in terms of the color palette and the moisture/texture.</li>
            <li> It comes in a wide round cardboard \\&quot;box\\&quot; that led me to believe that the product was WAY larger than it is.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m used to this from other brands</li>
            <li> &amp; I might try other products by them.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited to give this product a try since I did like their other lip balm but hated that it was so small.</li>
            <li> This seems to me like a pretty obvious ploy to get people to pay an outrageous price for their new product.</li>
            <li> : The balm is pretty thin in comparison to how thick some of the previous products have been from BB, so if you&#x27;re looking for something with the consistency of their chapstick</li>
            <li> and it still down.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my lips moisurized, and this balm provides that with a little tinge of color.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got an artificial, candy-like scent surprisingly similar to Twizzler&#x27;s red licorice.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to switch to all eco-and-body-friendly, green products, including my beauty products, so I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm.</li>
            <li> not good!&amp;#34;  Am not sure why others here on Amazon have reviewed the scent favorably.  </li>
            <li> Plus, unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past, there is not a sample display for it in the drugstores.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot and especially in the winter when it is so cold</li>
            <li> the lips at all, even applied thickly.  </li>
            <li> Given how pricey this product and how it fails to color my lips at all, Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm is a pass for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Thats was disappointing for me.</li>
            <li> You just cant go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>

            <li> When I removed the lip balm from the upscale packaging, I was thinking Burt&#x27;s Bees had really gotten it right.  Then I took the cap off, and it turned into a dimestore &amp;#34;Bonne Bell&amp;#34; nightmare.  This product would have been perfect except for one flaw, and it is major for me.  It&#x27;s got an artificial, candy-like scent surprisingly similar to Twizzler&#x27;s red licorice.  Coming from a natural company like Burt&#x27;s Bees, this came as quite a surprise.  I had bought two colors, but after trying each just once, I had had enough.  I returned it to the store of purchase.  The customer service person there smelled it as well and said, &amp;#34;whew! not good!&amp;#34;  Am not sure why others here on Amazon have reviewed the scent favorably.  Hoping the company changes the formula.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the original Burt bees lip balm. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to[[ASIN:B004XAY036 Fresh Sugar Honey Tinted Lip Treatment SPF 15]] that I use for subtle color and decided to give this a try since I love the original Burt bees lip balm.   Overall this is a pretty decent product. Has a mild sweet scent but once applied the smell goes away. The outter packaging is nice and leads you to believe the size of the lip balm would be larger. In actuality the size is the same size as the regular Burt bees lip balm. Basically you are paying for the outter package. Lip balm works well, is moisturizing, and has a nice tint to it.</li>
            <li> It just honestly feels like a lipstick and feels very weird on my lips...I suggest using the regular burts bees and if you want natural color use this but if you want smoother healthy lips..don&#x27;t,</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving this Burt&#x27;s bees tinted lip balm a four star instead of a five star is that it is more expensive on Amazon than some other places that sell Burt&#x27;s Bees products. As for the actual lip balm - pardon the play on words but it is the bomb! It is great. I like it a lot and especially in the winter when it is so cold and my lips get chapped. It prevents chapping if you remember to keep it on - which is another problem that I won&#x27;t discuss at this point. It is refreshing and smooth. It just feels really good on my lips. I do my best to keep it on during the summer, too, because my lips are easily sunburned as well. I have enjoyed using Burt&#x27;s Bees products for years. I like their ingredients and I like the fact that they are not animal tested. Also they are natural. The lip balm looks natural on your lips. People don&#x27;t automatically look at you and think you have on a big old pile of lipstick which I think is a good thing. Recently I was burned on the mouth and lips and was able to use my lip balm even with the burn and it felt very good and healing on my burned lips. I think that Burt&#x27;s Bees just makes very good products.</li>
            <li> The color of this tint is perfect for most.  It is robust enough to truly look like a very natural tint. The fact that it keeps my lips soft and smooth while having the perfect amount of color is a win, win.</li>
            <li> I got this the other day and the color was so natural and made my lips feel great. I love the smell of it and i love the fact that there is no peppermint in it like most of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products. I have gotten so many compliments whenever i wear it. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried some of the other tinted products by BB &amp; overall I&#x27;ve been rather pleased with them. I was pretty excited to give this product a try since I did like their other lip balm but hated that it was so small. Having a larger tip meant that it would be faster to apply. After some hemming &amp; hawing over the tints, I finally settled on hibiscus since it was the most neutral rose tint without it being completely identical to my lip color. (I wasn&#x27;t sure how the darker colors would appear or how strong the colors would be, after all.) So here&#x27;s the good &amp; the bad:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good: This goes on smoothly &amp; easily, which was nice. The color does show up but doesn&#x27;t show up as much as you would see with lipsticks. Color-wise it resembles more of a lip tint or gloss, to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad: The balm is pretty thin in comparison to how thick some of the previous products have been from BB, so if you&#x27;re looking for something with the consistency of their chapstick then you&#x27;ll be disappointed. This wore off faster than the chapstick products normally did, so I had to reapply more often than I would with some of the other products. However, I&#x27;m used to this from other brands so this wasn&#x27;t really a deal breaker for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this is a decent product &amp; now that I know the tints aren&#x27;t as dark as I was thinking they might be, I&#x27;m going to try the darker shades next. One thing I would recommend is that you do a little price comparing since the cost here on amazon is a little on the high side.</li>
            <li> I really like Burts Bee&#x27;s lip balm. It not only colors your lips, but leaves your lips feeling hydrated and soft. Will buy this again. I made this purchase on Amazon.com</li>
            <li> Although I love the feel and smell of this lip balm, I was EXTREMELY upset about the deceptive and wasteful packaging for this product. It comes in a wide round cardboard \\&quot;box\\&quot; that led me to believe that the product was WAY larger than it is. For $7.00, I certainly would have expected something a little more than a chapstick!! Plus, unlike Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past, there is not a sample display for it in the drugstores. In fact, when you open the \\&quot;box,\\&quot; it has a piece of tape over the opening so that you really cannot see how small the product truely is. This seems to me like a pretty obvious ploy to get people to pay an outrageous price for their new product. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products, BUT ever since the original Burt&#x27;s Bees company sold out to CLOROX, I no longer trust the ethics of this company.</li>
            <li> Great for women with olive tanned skin like mine!</li>
            <li> I ordered hibiscus for that &amp;#34;smooch of color&amp;#34; they advertise , and this brings not a whit of color&lt;br /&gt;to the lips at all, even applied thickly.  might as well use chapstick.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> keeps your lips soft and moisturized.  Great feeling and nice packaging.&lt;br /&gt;the color is nice and not too bright.&lt;br /&gt;nice way to keep lips soft</li>
            <li> This product keeps your lips from being dry but doesn&#x27;t give enough color for my taste.  It may be just enough for you...</li>
            <li> I bought this lip balm as a more affordable option versus the Sugar brand. It has really no comparison in terms of the color palette and the moisture/texture. If you can afford it, go with Sugar Lip Treatment. You will see the difference.</li>
            <li> I am one of those people that constantly am applying chapstick, and then lipstick on top. This item does both for me. The color is perfect!</li>
            <li> I love the color and the application. The only thing I do not like about it is that it tends to dry out my lips. I dont use it musch and it still down. Thats was disappointing for me. Either way its better than lipstick itself.</li>
            <li> Like the color of this product.  Works great on winter lips!  Burt&#x27;s Bees seems well worth the cost &amp; I might try other products by them.</li>
            <li> I bought this lip balm as a gift for someone and have no complaints with the product. I do not use this myself.</li>
            <li> Burt Bees stuff is quality!&lt;br /&gt;Love it, very moist - good hydration&lt;br /&gt;Only - it&#x27;s very light, more moist than color</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like lipstick, but I like the color. So this is perfect! It gives me the color with out the stickiness of the lipstick. I have fallen in love with it.</li>
            <li> I like this balm for days when I don&#x27;t want to wear lipstick. I like to keep my lips moisurized, and this balm provides that with a little tinge of color.</li>
            <li> I love &#x27;hibiscus&#x27;, is a peachy deep color very flattering on the lips, but subtle enough for daily use. About the formulation, I cant really say that is the most moisturizing lip balm that I have tried, but it does gives you soft lips. My only complaint is that it doesnt feel totally light while you are wearing it, and it can be a little heavy if you dont warm the wax enough (going over the lips a couple of times).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a pretty and sturdy box, which I like, but the packaging of the product feels a little cheap, I thought it was going to be thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy tis again? Yeah, I think I would, considering that I really like the shade and its all natural.</li>
            <li> It is a product to be used always. Color, smell, very good moist.</li>
            <li> I use regular Burt&#x27;s Bees all the time, so I thought it would be nice to have some that was tinted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for Hibiscus color, I like the color all right.  It doesn&#x27;t really look like lipstick--it&#x27;s kind of light, so it just makes your lips look a little more pink, in a natural way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is kind of weird.  It doesn&#x27;t feel crisp and clean the way that the regular Burt&#x27;s Bees does; it feels more like lipstick.  It has a strange scent.  It smells sweet, like the lipglosses that my sister and I used to buy back when we were in high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s been okay.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again, because it doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel moisturized the same way that regular Burt&#x27;s Bees chapstick does.  What I used to do was apply regular Burt&#x27;s Bees and then put lipstick on afterward. I will probably go back to doing that, because then my lips feel moisturized and I get more solid color, without the fruity scent.</li>
            <li> I purchased these tinted lip balms in every shade available and I just love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work as a balm and work the Burts Bees magic to make my lips soft while at the same time adding a natural looking tint that goes well with every look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear this to parties, dinners, work and to the mall! You just cant go wrong with these!</li>
            <li> It gives a good color but I wouldn&#x27;t call it lip balm since it does nothing to help my lips feel chapped. I still have to wear regular chap stick and then use this on top for color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to switch to all eco-and-body-friendly, green products, including my beauty products, so I decided to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm. It&#x27;s a lightweight, fairly moisturizing lip balm that doesn&#x27;t dry my lips out, but it doesn&#x27;t really heal chapped lips either. The color is also far too sheer on my naturally nudish-pink lips to be an acceptable substitute for my chemical-ladden lip glosses and lipsticks. Given how pricey this product and how it fails to color my lips at all, Burt&#x27;s Bees Tinted Lip Balm is a pass for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 3.19.13:&lt;br /&gt;Adding two stars. Once I used the lip balm several times, the color seemed to get deeper. I think maybe the balm had melted and reformed at one point, with the top of stick not having as much color as the rest. I still love its texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hibiscus shade is more of a ruddy pink-brown than I usually like, but it looks good when applied sparingly. I want to try the light pink next.</li>
