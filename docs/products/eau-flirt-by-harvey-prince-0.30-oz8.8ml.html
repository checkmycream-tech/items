            <li>** good.  </li>
            <li>It did not provoke any good responses as seen on TV.</li>

            <li>Love it, my husband always think I smell good when I wear it, I saw on Dr Oz that it attracted men.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells kind of fruity and musky.</li>
            <li>nice purse perfume for when on the go</li>
            <li>Each scent mixes with each persons own body chemistry</li>
            <li>smell not that nice</li>
            <li>It works, but I prefer sprays and it would be nice if Harvey Prince gave an option for the kind of application the customer would prefer.</li>
            <li>I would say it would be perfect for 16 year old girl.</li>
            <li>Love it.....</li>
            <li>I collect perfumes...too many.  </li>
            <li>This is really a love potion.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have noticed it on me and had to comment on it</li>
            <li>Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry, or maybe the scent is just better for women in their 30s</li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally though, I absolutely love this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>But I still love it.</li>
            <li>not quite sure if anyone who smells me likes this, but I do.  </li>
            <li>I like the spray bottles more though.</li>
            <li>You will love the smell...</li>
            <li>love love love this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it was al most used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really, really love this perfume.  </li>
            <li>There I have discovered that this company has many more quite enticing scents.</li>
            <li>In all honesty I have to say that I have better smelling scents in my collection.</li>
            <li>ok all pie.</li>
            <li>Lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love lavender, pumpkin pie, cinnamon, jasmine.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it really is a love potion or not, but I always receive compliments when I wear it on dates.</li>
            <li>And when you think of it as a love potion, you&#x27;ll find that the product has a way of boosting your confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was very excited to find this perfume.</li>
            <li>This perfume smelled great and I highly reccomend it to you lady&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, smells fantastic.....</li>
            <li>The roller ball allows for easy application on the wrist which makes reapplying inconspicuously easy when out and about.</li>
            <li>When I put this perfume on I could really smell it (maybe because it was the roll on kind), but then when i went out everyone else could smell it</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve purchased this one and \\&quot;Coupling\\&quot; and received free sample of \\&quot;yogini\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I think its a really fun product!</li>
            <li>Now I know why it&#x27;s worth it!  </li>
            <li>always makes me feel special.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t think there was anything special about the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Kind of musky and soft.  </li>
            <li>, it makes me feel sexy, and that&#x27;s really what it&#x27;s all about anyhow.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this stuff got such good reviews.</li>
            <li>but it definitely smells nice.  </li>
            <li>Seeing them asking passers by on the street was fun.</li>
            <li>and another said \\&quot;wearing no perfume is far better than that stuff - go wash it off</li>
            <li>This perfume has just the right amount of sweetness and strength when applied modestly, so I found that I, too, love the scent.</li>
            <li>I wear a different one every day and NEVER has my husband commented more than when I wore this one.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly draws the male attention so right on. :-)</li>
            <li>so glad I only got a sample of this.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t exactly have anyone else to try it out on, though, so this is by no means scientific.  </li>
            <li>I applied it directly to my wrist and neck, and it still smelled fantastic at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells a little too sweet for my taste, none of the guys that I know liked it much at all.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the scent is very nice, quite light and fruity actually, but wouldn&#x27;t be my favorite.</li>
            <li>This stuff lasts forEVER, because you really don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very floral and overpowering, with no pumpkin pie or cinnamon at all.</li>
            <li>After hearing so much about the appeal of this fragrance, I tried it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, according to my husband, it&#x27;s no different from any other perfume I own.  </li>
            <li>Doctors\\&quot; Doesnt last on my as long as other good perfumes.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>was pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>not my favorite scent does not last long very pricey for what you get small container roll on goes on eay .</li>
            <li>with every other perfume, however, be aware that every woman&#x27;s skin will wear the scent</li>
            <li>Compared to other perfumes that I currently have is my collection, it could be used for a bedtime fresh scent.</li>

            <li> I was a little discouraged at first when I saw that it was a rollerball instead of a spray, because I usually spray my perfume on my clothing (my skin tends to &#x27;turn&#x27; the scent of everything I apply to it).  </li>

            <li> Not one single person cared for the eAu fLirt</li>
            <li> but I barely smell it on me and when I do, it smells heavy.</li>
            <li> and it is small enough to throw in your makeup bag</li>
            <li> I bought this small 8 ml roll-on and at first thought it was rather expensive for such a small amount.  </li>
            <li> a little differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even then I think it was a waste of $12</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy or musky and added another dimension to what could have ended up as just another girly floral perfume.</li>
            <li> Opinions were universally negative for the perfume on me and on other girlfriends, as well as in the bottle itself.</li>
            <li> I have the small roller ball sample of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no Love Potion</li>
            <li> /&gt;i payed alot for small item</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about the lavender part but Uncle J  loves Pumpkin Pie...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It loses a star for the roll-on application.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i hate it and the price is too high</li>
            <li> Impossible to find tho. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it.....always makes me feel special.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying that it works 100% but I will say that I have noticed a difference in my Fiance when I wear eAu fLirt!  The product arrived ahead of schedule and I think its a really fun product!</li>
            <li> I am a \\&quot;perfumista\\&quot;...I collect perfumes...too many.  I wear a different one every day and NEVER has my husband commented more than when I wore this one.  I bought this small 8 ml roll-on and at first thought it was rather expensive for such a small amount.  Now I know why it&#x27;s worth it!  One tiny swipe on my neck in the morning lasts all day long...and my husband wouldn&#x27;t shut up about it.  He kept saying I don&#x27;t know what it is, but you smell soooo d*** good.  Doesn&#x27;t smell like pumpkin or lavender to me but it definitely smells nice.  Kind of musky and soft.  I like it and it certainly draws the male attention so right on. :-)</li>
            <li> This is really a love potion.  I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have noticed it on me and had to comment on it</li>
            <li> Love it, my husband always think I smell good when I wear it, I saw on Dr Oz that it attracted men.</li>
            <li> I like the scent quite a lot, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I suppose I could just be acclimating to the scent and that&#x27;s why I can no longer smell it after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I have the small roller ball sample of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells kind of fruity and musky. The website describes it as lavender and pumpkin pie but I don&#x27;t smell it at all. It also claims to get men to notice you but I barely smell it on me and when I do, it smells heavy. Maybe it doesn&#x27;t work well with my body chemistry, or maybe the scent is just better for women in their 30s +.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad I only got a sample of this. Even then I think it was a waste of $12</li>
            <li> After hearing so much about the appeal of this fragrance, I tried it for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, according to my husband, it&#x27;s no different from any other perfume I own.  He didn&#x27;t think there was anything special about the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t exactly have anyone else to try it out on, though, so this is by no means scientific.  I haven&#x27;t had any strangers ask about it (yet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally though, I absolutely love this fragrance.  I was a little discouraged at first when I saw that it was a rollerball instead of a spray, because I usually spray my perfume on my clothing (my skin tends to &#x27;turn&#x27; the scent of everything I apply to it).  I was pleasantly surprised.  I applied it directly to my wrist and neck, and it still smelled fantastic at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So despite my husband&#x27;s lukewarm response, I will continue to wear Eau Flirt.  I love it, it makes me feel sexy, and that&#x27;s really what it&#x27;s all about anyhow. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/29/12:  Four months later and my little bottle is still not empty.  This stuff lasts forEVER, because you really don&#x27;t need much.  Still no strangers stopping me on the street to ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing... It&#x27;s no Love Potion no. 9.  But I still love it.</li>
            <li> not quite sure if anyone who smells me likes this, but I do.  nice purse perfume for when on the go</li>
            <li> The actually Harvey Prince site has the same size bottle for only $12! I like the spray bottles more though. When I put this perfume on I could really smell it (maybe because it was the roll on kind), but then when i went out everyone else could smell it and i got tons of comments on how amazing I smelled</li>
            <li> You will love the smell...buy it&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised and it is small enough to throw in your makeup bag</li>
            <li> Smells a little too sweet for my taste, none of the guys that I know liked it much at all. It did not provoke any good responses as seen on TV. This was also used on my daughter in law and she got the same reviews as I did. Not an offensive smell just not anything anyone around here cared for. Each scent mixes with each persons own body chemistry so it might work for some people however I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> love love love this. the smell is wonderful. I get a lot of complements on this</li>
            <li> i didnot now that the bottle is smaller than my pinky&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i payed alot for small item&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the smell not that nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it was al most used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i hate it and the price is too high</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, smells fantastic.....have gotten a lot of compliments, just wish it was in a bigger bottle...very good size however for travel and to keep in your purse!</li>
            <li> I really, really love this perfume.  It smells awesome and I get compliments on it all the time.  You have got to buy this!!</li>
            <li> I was intrigued when I saw this scent being covered on Doctors. Seeing them asking passers by on the street was fun. Not sure if it all was in scenario but all of them gave it thumbs up. So I decided what the heck, I must have it too. I am a perfume collector anyway. Amazon didn&#x27;t have it, so I had to scout the net. Located it on the manufacturer&#x27;s site. There I have discovered that this company has many more quite enticing scents. So I&#x27;ve purchased this one and \\&quot;Coupling\\&quot; and received free sample of \\&quot;yogini\\&quot;. In all honesty I have to say that I have better smelling scents in my collection. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the scent is very nice, quite light and fruity actually, but wouldn&#x27;t be my favorite. I would say it would be perfect for 16 year old girl. I rather prefer \\&quot;Yogini\\&quot; actually.</li>
            <li> Our neice came to visit last month and was wearing this perfume. She sat beside me on the sofa and gave me a hug. I smelled it! I asked her about the fragrance she was wearing and she told me all about Harvey Prince. Seems it&#x27;s made to atract the male with Pumpkin pie and lavender. I&#x27;m not sure about the lavender part but Uncle J  loves Pumpkin Pie...ok all pie. This perfume smelled great and I highly reccomend it to you lady&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. The descriptions says it includes pumpkin which I don&#x27;t pick up on, but it does appeal to men as described. Regardless of the attraction rate, the fragrance is multi-tonal and mysterious. It&#x27;s not too heavy or musky and added another dimension to what could have ended up as just another girly floral perfume. The roller ball allows for easy application on the wrist which makes reapplying inconspicuously easy when out and about. I will defiantly be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Not as amazing at they made out on the program \\&quot;The Doctors\\&quot; Doesnt last on my as long as other good perfumes.</li>
            <li> not my favorite scent does not last long very pricey for what you get small container roll on goes on eay .</li>
            <li> Love it!! Impossible to find tho. :(</li>
            <li> I was very excited to find this perfume. It sounded great - I love lavender, pumpkin pie, cinnamon, jasmine. The perfume smells nothing like that. It&#x27;s very floral and overpowering, with no pumpkin pie or cinnamon at all. I did \\&quot;smell tests\\&quot; of this with several male friends and also female friends. Not one single person cared for the eAu fLirt AT ALL. In fact, one of my guy friends said \\&quot;do not wear that - it&#x27;s awful\\&quot; and another said \\&quot;wearing no perfume is far better than that stuff - go wash it off now\\&quot;. Opinions were universally negative for the perfume on me and on other girlfriends, as well as in the bottle itself. I don&#x27;t know how this stuff got such good reviews. I&#x27;m donating it to Good Will. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it really is a love potion or not, but I always receive compliments when I wear it on dates. This perfume has just the right amount of sweetness and strength when applied modestly, so I found that I, too, love the scent. And when you think of it as a love potion, you&#x27;ll find that the product has a way of boosting your confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like with every other perfume, however, be aware that every woman&#x27;s skin will wear the scent a little differently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It loses a star for the roll-on application. It works, but I prefer sprays and it would be nice if Harvey Prince gave an option for the kind of application the customer would prefer. The bigger bottles are sprays, but those start at $55.00!</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasant, but it doesn&#x27;t last. The scent fades after a short period of time.  Compared to other perfumes that I currently have is my collection, it could be used for a bedtime fresh scent.</li>
