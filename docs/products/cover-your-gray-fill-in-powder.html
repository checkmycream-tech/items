            <li>This product is great</li>
            <li>This stuff&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>This powder is great for root touch-ups.  </li>
            <li>This product is great for in-between coloring.  </li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Well I had one of these products before and it was great.</li>
            <li>this product makes me feel GREAT</li>

            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product because the Joan Rivers&#x27; Great Hair Day product was out of stock with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It looks kind of grayish in the container, but goes on with a perfect color for her.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>and it is a great match.</li>
            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>nice price!</li>
            <li>That just seems remarkable to me.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure the color would work because the powder looked like a charcoal grey/brown  and my hair is medium brown, but it conceals perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Works swell, handy size and fair price!</li>
            <li>This is not just great for covering roots and/or greys, it is a AMAZING, AWESOME, FANTASTIC cover for thinning hair as well.  </li>
            <li>This is not as good as Joan Rivers fill in powder.</li>
            <li>She couldn&#x27;t believe how good this worked.  </li>
            <li>She didn&#x60;t look good in the color</li>
            <li>Its good for touch ups on roots.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Not as good as Joam Rivers, but will do for now.</li>
            <li>Great coverage, no weird smell, blends in perfectly.</li>
            <li>i  have ordered  a lot of this stuff, and all I can say is it  works fine  for me....!!  </li>
            <li>You will be very pleased.</li>
            <li>best &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; product for the price, good service and fast shipping</li>
            <li>but it is still very full and works great.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product !</li>
            <li>I use this all the time Love it!</li>
            <li>This was such a find - great price - superb cover for the much-needed color touch-ups - easy to apply and long-lasting!  </li>
            <li>It did a fine job and made me look good.</li>
            <li>All in all, a great product, quite worth the investment.</li>
            <li>Perfect, the price is great compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for other products!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li>It was stuck to the powder and when I took it off a huge chunk of the powder broke off and went flying!</li>
            <li>I have medium brown hair, but the &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; matches better than the medium brown color.</li>
            <li>Love this item.  </li>
            <li>In-between salon appointments, I am now able to wear my ponytail and it looks Great..  TY so much for all women looking for a better product, that won&#x27;t wash off or smear...  </li>
            <li>and I love the packaging (&amp;brush).</li>
            <li>Love it.....  </li>
            <li>She felt much better when looking in the mirror at the front of her hairline.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product before and find it to be better than most fill-in products.</li>
            <li>, Love it, works for me, will buy again and recomend, to friends and anemies too, why not , I am neutral.</li>
            <li>I like the spray hair color better than powder.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would do the trick</li>
            <li>think she will love it.</li>
            <li>This product helps cover the gray at hairline around my face and makes it look like I have more hair and thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>I also use this on set for photos, movies, and tv, just to make sure there is no shine off the scalp in thinner areas.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>The powder consistency was okay</li>
            <li>and I love it too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>And people can&#x27;t help but stare at the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>but I will try to find a better brush to use.</li>
            <li>My mother has suffered from thinning hair on top for years now.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a paper towel or something covering the surface that you sit it on, when applying.</li>
            <li>Because it is a powder, I do end up getting some in my sink, but that is more my fault than the product.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I just love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I will order it again when I need More.</li>
            <li>This is OK</li>
            <li>but Xfusion Hair Fibers work better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>My self esteem sky rocketed after the first use!!!</li>
            <li>Product works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Perfect for minor root touch-up.  </li>
            <li>It makes a pretty good eyeliner though.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty good</li>
            <li>Every single pack came in perfect condition</li>
            <li>Getting right to the point, I love this product!  </li>
            <li>MY IS VERY FULL.  </li>
            <li>Great at hairline near forehead.</li>
            <li>I am going to try a cottonball as one reviewer said this works better, but I don&#x27;t honestly expect a positive result.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>Stays on all day and washes out easily.</li>
            <li>The compact is 2\\&quot; x 2\\&quot; and has a mirror, so it is easy to carry in your purse or in a make up bag on a trip.  </li>
            <li>I have  brown hair and ordered the dark brown powder, the powder at best turned my gray hair</li>
            <li>The dark brown is a perfect match for her.</li>
            <li>The applicator brush works fine</li>
            <li>My hair has always been baby fine</li>
            <li>The order came quick and Im a really satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Two stars for this matching my hair color (very dark ash blonde-very light ash brown) perfectly.</li>
            <li>It has made a huge difference for her.</li>
            <li>Too light.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for filling in a few spots and covering a bit of Gray in between salon visits.</li>
            <li>My mom has a medium brown hair color with light sprinkles of gray.</li>
            <li>they give two options -  medium brown or light brown/blond.</li>
            <li>The look, as I said, is excellent, but so much doesn&#x27;t go on initially</li>
            <li>have that special glow you would expect  </li>
            <li>This product is not the total solution, but is a good addition when using Gray Away Root Concealer spray.  </li>
            <li>True it doesn&#x27;t run bit</li>
            <li>I have asked some long time friends to be honest with me (and they will!)</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, my husband&#x27;s hair has thinned tremendously on top, much to his chagrin.</li>
            <li>This item is just as good as the Joan Rivers &amp;#34;GREAT HAIR DAY&amp;#34;  Only thing is, you can never get this color in stock from Rivers!</li>
            <li>The brush hairs fall out quickly.</li>
            <li>am going to order this super product for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Got this quickly too</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t have a gross pillow and my hair felt perfect the next morning.</li>
            <li>It has made a tremendous difference in my mom&#x27;s self esteem and confidence.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair often so, I needed something quick.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend : )</li>
            <li>I was worried that it would be too dark and would need a med. brown, but it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I ordered dark brown and it matches great.  </li>
            <li>My sister has used it also and likes it very much!</li>
            <li>Really does the job - quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Love this powder -- hides the new gray growth too.  </li>
            <li>It really does the job and is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The color is a bit too light, and it&#x27;s not as much product in the compact, so you&#x27;ll use it up quickly.</li>
            <li>Goes on pretty easy and the color matches pretty well.  </li>
            <li>So, that alone would be worth it.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This is the only one I&#x27;ve tried of its kind.</li>
            <li>the color was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>Was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Did not work as good as expected</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super hot here</li>
            <li>This product is super easy to apply, using the soft brush included.</li>
            <li>This is as good as any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>right away, and there is powder all over my vanity sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just brush it on, and it blends right in.  </li>
            <li>You think you can exchange, right?</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does nto rub off or run when you are in the rain or sweating (I live in Dallas</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to anyone !  </li>
            <li>No mess, easy use..</li>
            <li>and I appreciate the very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product and the shipping was very fast...</li>
            <li>Next time I will pay more and stick with the Joan Rivers.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Joan Rivers similar hair product !  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product because it solves the problem, helps me feel refreshed,  and buys me more time until I can color my hair properly.</li>
            <li>But what I really love is, this stuff stays on your hair until you next wash it.  </li>
            <li>It would be better to seal the product with a sticker on the OUTSIDE of the packaging</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty noticeable and my temples still look thin/balding with this product in.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of things, including my most recent fiasco: hair fibers.</li>
            <li>Its light so frequent touch up is needed.</li>
            <li>It really works well!  </li>
            <li>I tried this the first day it arrived and use it just about every time I go out.  </li>
            <li>Having seen others at much higher prices and wanting to try something to camouflage my thinning hair I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li>This product helps me make those last seven days with more confidence</li>
            <li>She is extremely sensitive and self conscious about it, as most women would be.  </li>
            <li>Like the small size of the compact and brush is a good size.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, and totally covers even the smallest root areas...  </li>
            <li>I like this product as far as covering, but I ran out of it very quickly, which surprised me.</li>
            <li>Nice little box and brush t travel with  you</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks AAA+++</li>
            <li>Price was great but product was poor.</li>
            <li>Your hair gets very curly n</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so noticeable and does not look real</li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>It works very well -</li>
            <li>The price was incredibly reasonable.</li>
            <li>and much cheaper than the Joan Rivers hair powder.</li>
            <li>much like the Joan Rivers product, but a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li>I would order again though as I really like the coverage,</li>
            <li>The look is very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When my gray starts to come out and really shows my thinning hair, I use this stuff.</li>
            <li>Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li>This product has really changed my life.  </li>
            <li>This product does cover gray and you really can&#x27;t tell you put it on until you scratch your head.  </li>
            <li>I love that it stays on through rain, sweat and wet.  </li>
            <li>y brush sheds to much</li>
            <li>About three weeks into my color, my roots start showing because my hair grows fast.</li>
            <li>With my thinning hair problem I was embarrassed to part my hair, but thanks to this fill in powder I can style my hair as desired.</li>
            <li>The brush is trash because it loses bristles way too fast, but gives you a good idea how the product works.  </li>
            <li>(I have tried many other products)</li>
            <li>It stayed put and didn&#x27;t even look like &amp;#34;dirty scalp&amp;#34;, like most other products of this type will</li>
            <li>It slightly dries out my hair, but I&#x27;m SO glad I found this.</li>
            <li>Product came in quickly thats the only reason why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>It takes time and effort to effectively target grey hair strands with this, but it can improve the appearance of grey.</li>
            <li>I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR A TEMPORARY ROOT FIX.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>so I was leaning more to medium brown that actually is very dark brown.</li>
            <li>It really works, as far as fooling the eye.</li>
            <li>I am a woman with thinning hair and this is so much better than the messy spray on filler.  </li>
            <li>It does take a while to get enough on the scalp to hide any spots but it is worth the work.</li>
            <li>Works great, but powder is a little messy, and it would be easier if the brush was in a container with the powder--have to store it separately in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Her hair is so thin on top and it covers her scalp beautifully in all of the thin areas.</li>
            <li>This was a new one for me.</li>
            <li>My fiance has an alopecia spot on his scalp, and he originally just wanted something to color it in so that it was not so noticeable, but this product actually made the hair start growing back.</li>
            <li>Application made a light brownish smudge- could not get a darker coverage and what was applied bled down onto my forehead.</li>
            <li>I had previously been using a brown eye shadow, which actually worked better.  </li>
            <li>When I received it there was a clear sticker covering the product.</li>
            <li>The coverage is not as complete as Joan Rivers, however, I don&#x27;t want to spend all that time to get such intense coverage anyway.  </li>
            <li>I did not find that the brush works nearly as well as a cotton ball to apply the powder.  </li>
            <li>43 yr old woman who inherited severe thinning hair.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll report back if that one is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>No Mess</li>
            <li>It covers my gray and bald spots better and is much cheaper than the other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>Full, dark hair!</li>
            <li>There is no quick and easy grey cover up that I can find.</li>
            <li>Works great for in between colorings, very subtle for even dark hair -</li>
            <li>It is a little messy (the powder is very flakey) and the brush &amp;#34;sheds&amp;#34; but overall a worthwhile product for me.  </li>
            <li>This should last a long time, but when it runs out, I will certainly purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Not a fan of this, the color match with my hair, but if not careful this could get on clothes and stain them.</li>
            <li>The dark brown matches my hair color pretty well, but</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SIMPLE TO USE AND COVERS MY GRAY HAIR COMPLETELY.  </li>
            <li>The brush is kind of useless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s truly a quick fix for those times we need a little something!</li>
            <li>The loose powder was spilling out of the sides because apparently there&#x27;s a gap large enough to do so, but you can&#x27;t tell by looking at it.</li>
            <li>I was truly looking forward to using this product but there was barely any left since it was all in the bubble wrap .</li>
            <li>/&gt;This will not make your hair thick or full.</li>
            <li>we all know how difficult it is to choose a right color of the internet screen , right?</li>
            <li>Def go true to your hair color, i went dark brown but have black hair.still does job</li>
            <li>It can be a little bit messy in the application process, not terribly, the expected amount.</li>

            <li> I decided to try this after using Joan Rivers Great Gair Day and was not at all impressed.</li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> Help greatly after chemo treatments.</li>
            <li> This product does a great job covering that up.  </li>
            <li> Great for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product for people dealing with gray hair.  </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is great</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> This powder is great for root touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> This product is great for in-between coloring.  </li>
            <li> Works great.</li>
            <li> Well I had one of these products before and it was great.</li>
            <li> this product makes me feel GREAT</li>
            <li> Great product to fill in eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Great product for thinning hair line.</li>
            <li> Works great to cover gray so I can go longer between root touch ups.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this product because the Joan Rivers&#x27; Great Hair Day product was out of stock with Amazon.  </li>
            <li> It looks kind of grayish in the container, but goes on with a perfect color for her.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> and it is a great match.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!</li>
            <li> nice price!</li>
            <li> That just seems remarkable to me.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure the color would work because the powder looked like a charcoal grey/brown  and my hair is medium brown, but it conceals perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Works swell, handy size and fair price!</li>
            <li> This is not just great for covering roots and/or greys, it is a AMAZING, AWESOME, FANTASTIC cover for thinning hair as well.  </li>
            <li> This is not as good as Joan Rivers fill in powder.</li>
            <li> She couldn&#x27;t believe how good this worked.  </li>
            <li> She didn&#x60;t look good in the color</li>
            <li> Its good for touch ups on roots.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Joam Rivers, but will do for now.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, no weird smell, blends in perfectly.</li>
            <li> i  have ordered  a lot of this stuff, and all I can say is it  works fine  for me....!!  </li>
            <li> You will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> best &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; product for the price, good service and fast shipping</li>
            <li> but it is still very full and works great.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product !</li>
            <li> I use this all the time Love it!</li>
            <li> This was such a find - great price - superb cover for the much-needed color touch-ups - easy to apply and long-lasting!  </li>
            <li> It did a fine job and made me look good.</li>
            <li> All in all, a great product, quite worth the investment.</li>
            <li> Perfect, the price is great compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for other products!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it!  </li>
            <li> It was stuck to the powder and when I took it off a huge chunk of the powder broke off and went flying!</li>
            <li> I have medium brown hair, but the &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; matches better than the medium brown color.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  </li>
            <li> In-between salon appointments, I am now able to wear my ponytail and it looks Great..  TY so much for all women looking for a better product, that won&#x27;t wash off or smear...  </li>
            <li> and I love the packaging (&amp;brush).</li>
            <li> Love it.....  </li>
            <li> She felt much better when looking in the mirror at the front of her hairline.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product before and find it to be better than most fill-in products.</li>
            <li> , Love it, works for me, will buy again and recomend, to friends and anemies too, why not , I am neutral.</li>
            <li> I like the spray hair color better than powder.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would do the trick</li>
            <li> think she will love it.</li>
            <li> This product helps cover the gray at hairline around my face and makes it look like I have more hair and thicker hair.  </li>
            <li> I also use this on set for photos, movies, and tv, just to make sure there is no shine off the scalp in thinner areas.</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> The powder consistency was okay</li>
            <li> and I love it too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> And people can&#x27;t help but stare at the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> but I will try to find a better brush to use.</li>
            <li> My mother has suffered from thinning hair on top for years now.</li>
            <li> Make sure you have a paper towel or something covering the surface that you sit it on, when applying.</li>
            <li> Because it is a powder, I do end up getting some in my sink, but that is more my fault than the product.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I just love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> I will order it again when I need More.</li>
            <li> This is OK</li>
            <li> but Xfusion Hair Fibers work better.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> My self esteem sky rocketed after the first use!!!</li>
            <li> Product works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Perfect for minor root touch-up.  </li>
            <li> It makes a pretty good eyeliner though.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty good</li>
            <li> Every single pack came in perfect condition</li>
            <li> Getting right to the point, I love this product!  </li>
            <li> MY IS VERY FULL.  </li>
            <li> Great at hairline near forehead.</li>
            <li> I am going to try a cottonball as one reviewer said this works better, but I don&#x27;t honestly expect a positive result.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> Stays on all day and washes out easily.</li>
            <li> The compact is 2\\&quot; x 2\\&quot; and has a mirror, so it is easy to carry in your purse or in a make up bag on a trip.  </li>
            <li> I have  brown hair and ordered the dark brown powder, the powder at best turned my gray hair</li>
            <li> The dark brown is a perfect match for her.</li>
            <li> The applicator brush works fine</li>
            <li> My hair has always been baby fine</li>
            <li> The order came quick and Im a really satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Two stars for this matching my hair color (very dark ash blonde-very light ash brown) perfectly.</li>
            <li> It has made a huge difference for her.</li>
            <li> Too light.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for filling in a few spots and covering a bit of Gray in between salon visits.</li>
            <li> My mom has a medium brown hair color with light sprinkles of gray.</li>
            <li> they give two options -  medium brown or light brown/blond.</li>
            <li> The look, as I said, is excellent, but so much doesn&#x27;t go on initially</li>
            <li> have that special glow you would expect  </li>
            <li> This product is not the total solution, but is a good addition when using Gray Away Root Concealer spray.  </li>
            <li> True it doesn&#x27;t run bit</li>
            <li> I have asked some long time friends to be honest with me (and they will!)</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, my husband&#x27;s hair has thinned tremendously on top, much to his chagrin.</li>
            <li> This item is just as good as the Joan Rivers &amp;#34;GREAT HAIR DAY&amp;#34;  Only thing is, you can never get this color in stock from Rivers!</li>
            <li> The brush hairs fall out quickly.</li>
            <li> am going to order this super product for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Got this quickly too</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t have a gross pillow and my hair felt perfect the next morning.</li>
            <li> It has made a tremendous difference in my mom&#x27;s self esteem and confidence.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair often so, I needed something quick.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend : )</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would be too dark and would need a med. brown, but it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I ordered dark brown and it matches great.  </li>
            <li> My sister has used it also and likes it very much!</li>
            <li> Really does the job - quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Love this powder -- hides the new gray growth too.  </li>
            <li> It really does the job and is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The color is a bit too light, and it&#x27;s not as much product in the compact, so you&#x27;ll use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> Goes on pretty easy and the color matches pretty well.  </li>
            <li> So, that alone would be worth it.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I&#x27;ve tried of its kind.</li>
            <li> the color was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> Was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Did not work as good as expected</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s super hot here</li>
            <li> This product is super easy to apply, using the soft brush included.</li>
            <li> This is as good as any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> right away, and there is powder all over my vanity sink.&lt;br</li>
            <li> just brush it on, and it blends right in.  </li>
            <li> You think you can exchange, right?</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does nto rub off or run when you are in the rain or sweating (I live in Dallas</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone !  </li>
            <li> No mess, easy use..</li>
            <li> and I appreciate the very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product and the shipping was very fast...</li>
            <li> Next time I will pay more and stick with the Joan Rivers.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Joan Rivers similar hair product !  </li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product because it solves the problem, helps me feel refreshed,  and buys me more time until I can color my hair properly.</li>
            <li> But what I really love is, this stuff stays on your hair until you next wash it.  </li>
            <li> It would be better to seal the product with a sticker on the OUTSIDE of the packaging</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty noticeable and my temples still look thin/balding with this product in.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of things, including my most recent fiasco: hair fibers.</li>
            <li> Its light so frequent touch up is needed.</li>
            <li> It really works well!  </li>
            <li> I tried this the first day it arrived and use it just about every time I go out.  </li>
            <li> Having seen others at much higher prices and wanting to try something to camouflage my thinning hair I ordered this product.  </li>
            <li> This product helps me make those last seven days with more confidence</li>
            <li> She is extremely sensitive and self conscious about it, as most women would be.  </li>
            <li> Like the small size of the compact and brush is a good size.  </li>
            <li> Easy to apply, and totally covers even the smallest root areas...  </li>
            <li> I like this product as far as covering, but I ran out of it very quickly, which surprised me.</li>
            <li> Nice little box and brush t travel with  you</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks AAA+++</li>
            <li> Price was great but product was poor.</li>
            <li> Your hair gets very curly n</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so noticeable and does not look real</li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> It works very well -</li>
            <li> The price was incredibly reasonable.</li>
            <li> and much cheaper than the Joan Rivers hair powder.</li>
            <li> much like the Joan Rivers product, but a fraction of the price.  </li>
            <li> I would order again though as I really like the coverage,</li>
            <li> The look is very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When my gray starts to come out and really shows my thinning hair, I use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product has really changed my life.  </li>
            <li> This product does cover gray and you really can&#x27;t tell you put it on until you scratch your head.  </li>
            <li> I love that it stays on through rain, sweat and wet.  </li>
            <li> y brush sheds to much</li>
            <li> About three weeks into my color, my roots start showing because my hair grows fast.</li>
            <li> With my thinning hair problem I was embarrassed to part my hair, but thanks to this fill in powder I can style my hair as desired.</li>
            <li> The brush is trash because it loses bristles way too fast, but gives you a good idea how the product works.  </li>
            <li> (I have tried many other products)</li>
            <li> It stayed put and didn&#x27;t even look like &amp;#34;dirty scalp&amp;#34;, like most other products of this type will</li>
            <li> It slightly dries out my hair, but I&#x27;m SO glad I found this.</li>
            <li> Product came in quickly thats the only reason why I gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> It takes time and effort to effectively target grey hair strands with this, but it can improve the appearance of grey.</li>
            <li> I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR A TEMPORARY ROOT FIX.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> so I was leaning more to medium brown that actually is very dark brown.</li>
            <li> It really works, as far as fooling the eye.</li>
            <li> I am a woman with thinning hair and this is so much better than the messy spray on filler.  </li>
            <li> It does take a while to get enough on the scalp to hide any spots but it is worth the work.</li>
            <li> Works great, but powder is a little messy, and it would be easier if the brush was in a container with the powder--have to store it separately in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> Her hair is so thin on top and it covers her scalp beautifully in all of the thin areas.</li>
            <li> This was a new one for me.</li>
            <li> My fiance has an alopecia spot on his scalp, and he originally just wanted something to color it in so that it was not so noticeable, but this product actually made the hair start growing back.</li>
            <li> Application made a light brownish smudge- could not get a darker coverage and what was applied bled down onto my forehead.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a brown eye shadow, which actually worked better.  </li>
            <li> When I received it there was a clear sticker covering the product.</li>
            <li> The coverage is not as complete as Joan Rivers, however, I don&#x27;t want to spend all that time to get such intense coverage anyway.  </li>
            <li> I did not find that the brush works nearly as well as a cotton ball to apply the powder.  </li>
            <li> 43 yr old woman who inherited severe thinning hair.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll report back if that one is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> No Mess</li>
            <li> It covers my gray and bald spots better and is much cheaper than the other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Full, dark hair!</li>
            <li> There is no quick and easy grey cover up that I can find.</li>
            <li> Works great for in between colorings, very subtle for even dark hair -</li>
            <li> It is a little messy (the powder is very flakey) and the brush &amp;#34;sheds&amp;#34; but overall a worthwhile product for me.  </li>
            <li> This should last a long time, but when it runs out, I will certainly purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this, the color match with my hair, but if not careful this could get on clothes and stain them.</li>
            <li> The dark brown matches my hair color pretty well, but</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SIMPLE TO USE AND COVERS MY GRAY HAIR COMPLETELY.  </li>
            <li> The brush is kind of useless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s truly a quick fix for those times we need a little something!</li>
            <li> The loose powder was spilling out of the sides because apparently there&#x27;s a gap large enough to do so, but you can&#x27;t tell by looking at it.</li>
            <li> I was truly looking forward to using this product but there was barely any left since it was all in the bubble wrap .</li>
            <li> /&gt;This will not make your hair thick or full.</li>
            <li> we all know how difficult it is to choose a right color of the internet screen , right?</li>
            <li> Def go true to your hair color, i went dark brown but have black hair.still does job</li>
            <li> It can be a little bit messy in the application process, not terribly, the expected amount.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thin on top and use this on the skin to cover up the shine of having no hair.</li>
            <li> The color payoff is not great and the brunette is a bit too light and red for my hair which surprised me because it looks very dark and almost gray in the pot.</li>
            <li> I use dark brown shade and it completely fills in the area with no telltale sign.  </li>
            <li> At least it was pretty inexpensive</li>
            <li> This product works but it doesn&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> Fills in any white areas once hair is fixed and covers grays with a little work.  </li>
            <li> This is a complete mess.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to cut back on salon visits or are sick of coloring your own hair, save some time and sanity with this powder.  </li>
            <li> Which is so white next to my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> Love product but shipping and handling was way too expensive not worth re-ordering.</li>
            <li> I look forward to using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> It take quite a bit to cover your grey.  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, my hair is very dark and my skin is very light, causing a shiny pinkish white halo of scalp gleaming through what little hair I do have.</li>
            <li> Lasts a lot longer then other products out there similar to this!!</li>
            <li> My hair color is dark brunette and now that it is starting to thin with age the white scalp really stands out in some places.  </li>
            <li> so I reapplied but still  no brown color at all, only dark gray.</li>
            <li> Dark brown hair, white roots.</li>
            <li> but the handle is a little too long making it hard to fit into a small to medium cosmetic bag.</li>
            <li> There were still lots of loose bits inside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, this makes a big mess even when I&#x27;m just sweeping the brush to pick up some color.</li>
            <li> It does conceal a little, but not enough.</li>
            <li> Wish it would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I closed the lid and put it away.</li>
            <li> I tilted the package (while closed)</li>
            <li> it was not brown at all, it was like a dark grey..</li>
            <li> weird, and doesn&#x27;t cover really good, get the darker color, because the brown one gets on your hair like a weird gray one.</li>
            <li> and it is a very natural color and does not flake off as bad as the Joan Rivers color powder (I tried that one first).  </li>
            <li> As we get older, our hair starts to thin.</li>
            <li> I would like to try other brands to cover my thinning areas.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get enough on the brush/scalp.  </li>

            <li> I use the dark brown</li>
            <li> and I ordered dark brown.</li>
            <li> I use the dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I use the dermmatch foam applicator to put it on, not the brush it came with.(using the dark brown color)</li>
            <li> Ordered dark brown.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair and purchased the dark brown color</li>
            <li> Hides embarrassing thin spots and looks natural.</li>
            <li> I found that annoying, even though pleased with the coverage.</li>
            <li> I live in the horrible hot and humid climate of the deep south.</li>
            <li> so if you are looking for dark brown, try black.</li>
            <li> I tried this product in &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; and found it to be an odd color that did not blend well and looked splotchy on the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist and I buy this for a client that has slight thinning hair at the frontal along with some grays.</li>
            <li> and I can feel a little of the grit falling from my hairline down into my eyes (ouch)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> must agree that it isn&#x27;t messy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The actual product is poor too, but that might just be the nature of these types of products.</li>
            <li> I use this product on the back of my scalp, where it can be noticed that I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powder and it can be messy like a powder.</li>
            <li> They have raised the bottom of the compact so you get less product!  </li>
            <li> and they told me the spots are completely hidden!</li>
            <li> The price is about 70% less also!</li>
            <li> and it seems to do the same thing and much less expensive</li>
            <li> When you put it on it seems&lt;br /&gt;Heavy and not very nice to touch.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit on the crown of your head and around the edges and voila!</li>
            <li> The powder was messy and hard to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s covers the gray hair but my head feels heavy and dirty few hours later.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry I wasted my money and time!</li>
            <li> The compact was in a small envelop with some bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> No more scalp showing.  </li>
            <li> Have tried it although it was very messy to use.</li>
            <li> but it is very messy and breaks apart in the case in no time.</li>
            <li> it was very poor quality compared to similar products i have used</li>
            <li> I am so upset, I opened up my order and dark brown/ black powder was EVERY WHERE!!!!</li>
            <li> I use this for a horrible back part that you can see because of my white scalp against dark brown hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair look dull and unnatural where applied; and it will get under your fingernails if you scratch your head or run your hand thru your hair.</li>
            <li> it looked cheap and awful didn&#x60;t  </li>
            <li> I had to empty all the loose stuff that broke off from that stupid sticker.</li>
            <li> I learned about this type of product, read every review and decided to give this less expensive version a try.  </li>
            <li> Not good item.  </li>
            <li> Not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> I hate wigs but am going to have to give up someday soon, so far this product has helped</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> i contacted the seller and they were very rude</li>
            <li> This came all broken, had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how does my hair feel, it gets dusty????</li>
            <li> Not a great product.</li>
            <li> saw a woman with hair balding much worse than mine, on youtube, who uses this powder underneath hair pieces.</li>
            <li> powder is not to be confused with eye brow powder, which for some reason does not work well on scalps.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and this helps fill where my scalp is visible.</li>
            <li> As soon as I removed it from the envelop, all the powder was broken and spilling out of the compact.</li>
            <li> this product arrived broken the powder was shattered inside and was all over the inside of the box</li>
            <li> but now it is thinning - not a great combination.  </li>
            <li> This was truly false advertising.  </li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money!!</li>
            <li> If you like the concept, merely get a brush that does the job without losing bristles.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> The brush is absolutely useless.</li>
            <li> It was all broken!  </li>
            <li> You are stuck with that wrong color</li>
            <li> The brush is just about useless.</li>
            <li> I have very  thin hair and there is always scalp showing through.  </li>
            <li> What a mess!!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible mess.</li>
            <li> it looks like your hair is dirty at all times .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it wears off too bad during the day.</li>
            <li> bad company</li>
            <li> I hate it.</li>
            <li> The brush however is worthless because whenever I tried to use it,  some of the bristles fell out.  </li>
            <li> , the color was horrible..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful.</li>
            <li> Horrible customer service.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I have thinning hair. This is the best fill-in product that I&#x27;ve found.  The colors seem to run a shade lighter than their names.  I have medium brown hair, but the &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; matches better than the medium brown color.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  i just need to get a lighter shade.</li>
            <li> Great coverage, no weird smell, blends in perfectly.</li>
            <li> Product gives your gray hair a highlighted effect while buying time for next coloring job.  Don&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> Great !! That&#x27;s what I want it !! Thanks AAA+++</li>
            <li> I like this, but it is a bit too powdery.</li>
            <li> Love this item.  My second time buying for touch ups!</li>
            <li> Love this powder -- hides the new gray growth too.  Also I use it for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> It covers my gray and bald spots better and is much cheaper than the other brands I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Product works pretty good. Easy to apply.  No Mess</li>
            <li> Awesome Product, works perfect!</li>
            <li> Opened package to find powder all over, totally smashed. Have tried it although it was very messy to use. Would not reorder.</li>
            <li> excellent product. Help greatly after chemo treatments. Will keep on buy it. Enrica C. Beasley</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  Easy to apply, and totally covers even the smallest root areas...  In-between salon appointments, I am now able to wear my ponytail and it looks Great..  TY so much for all women looking for a better product, that won&#x27;t wash off or smear...  [[ASIN:B005MMCAX6 Cover Your Gray Hair Care Fill in Powder w/ Procapil- Dark Brown]]</li>
            <li> My hair color is dark brunette and now that it is starting to thin with age the white scalp really stands out in some places.  This product does a great job covering that up.  I did not find that the brush works nearly as well as a cotton ball to apply the powder.  I rub the cotton ball into the powder until there is a generous amount on the cotton ball, then I rub it in real good on the scalp area I want to cover up.  Works great!</li>
            <li> This is not as good as Joan Rivers fill in powder. Next time I will pay more and stick with the Joan Rivers. The brush with the Gari powder fell apart. The powder was messy and hard to apply. Price was great but product was poor.</li>
            <li> Too light.  Doesn&#x27;t go on well.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to anyone !  I like it better than Joan Rivers similar hair product !  I was worried that it would be too dark and would need a med. brown, but it&#x27;s great and I love the packaging (&amp;brush).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this powder for about three years now.  I am a woman with thinning hair and this is so much better than the messy spray on filler.  It is easy to use and does nto rub off or run when you are in the rain or sweating (I live in Dallas and it&#x27;s super hot here and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it).  I use the dark brown and it is a very natural color and does not flake off as bad as the Joan Rivers color powder (I tried that one first).  I would tell anybody to buy this in a minute.</li>
            <li> Not good item.  Your hair gets very curly n it looks like your hair is dirty at all times .</li>
            <li> This product dave me a headache.. Ck ingredients</li>
            <li> Love it.....  fills in where hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> This was such a find - great price - superb cover for the much-needed color touch-ups - easy to apply and long-lasting!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This was truly false advertising.  Don&#x27;t waste your money it just turns your scalp brown, it does NOT cover gray hair.</li>
            <li> Great for thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Product came in quickly thats the only reason why I gave it 3 stars. Powder doesnt fill in as well as I would expect. The brush hairs fall out quickly. I dont recommend this product. it doesnt work very well.</li>
            <li> This is not just great for covering roots and/or greys, it is a AMAZING, AWESOME, FANTASTIC cover for thinning hair as well.  You no longer see my &#x27;bald&#x27; spots from 5 feet away!</li>
            <li> Every single pack came in perfect condition 🙆💕 thankssssss😊</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this, the color match with my hair, but if not careful this could get on clothes and stain them. Also, after I apply this on my hair I feel like I need to wash my hair again! Not a good feeling.</li>
            <li> Gave this to a friend that is having a problem with thinning hair.  She couldn&#x27;t believe how good this worked.  She felt much better when looking in the mirror at the front of her hairline.  Asked me to order her another one!</li>
            <li> I think this is a great product for people dealing with gray hair.  The color I chose was perfect for me!</li>
            <li> I have used this product before and find it to be better than most fill-in products.</li>
            <li> great item! nice price!</li>
            <li> They have raised the bottom of the compact so you get less product!  Just another ripoff!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews prior to ordering this product.&lt;br /&gt;Guess I received a different product.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium brown and I ordered dark brown. The product comes out white and just looks ashy white. It does absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I must agree that it isn&#x27;t messy. Maybe because there is no color pigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the brush started shedding after one application.&lt;br /&gt;Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product. Results the same as joan rivers product which is 4 times the price</li>
            <li> This product is great and I appreciate the very fast delivery.  I look forward to using it for a long time.</li>
            <li> , Love it, works for me, will buy again and recomend, to friends and anemies too, why not , I am neutral.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s covers the gray hair but my head feels heavy and dirty few hours later. I like the spray hair color better than powder.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this would do the trick but it did. It covered the areas I needed to cover.</li>
            <li> Works great, but powder is a little messy, and it would be easier if the brush was in a container with the powder--have to store it separately in a plastic bag.</li>
            <li> This product is super.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to order this super product for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;I think she will love it.</li>
            <li> I have  brown hair and ordered the dark brown powder, the powder at best turned my gray hair a charcoal gray color which did not come close to my hair color. I thought maybe I wasn&#x27;t using enough so I reapplied but still  no brown color at all, only dark gray. I even tried to moisten it a bit using a cotton ball, thinking maybe that would bring out the brown, nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I like how this powder goes on and it covers well, but it is very messy and breaks apart in the case in no time.</li>
            <li> I tried using it a couple of times to conceal/camouflage my thinning hair area but it&#x27;s so noticeable and does not look real so I just stopped using it.</li>
            <li> This came all broken, had to throw it away. Terrible mess.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product which I will keep ordering.  It works great!  I use dark brown shade and it completely fills in the area with no telltale sign.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This product helps cover the gray at hairline around my face and makes it look like I have more hair and thicker hair.  The brush is trash because it loses bristles way too fast, but gives you a good idea how the product works.  If you like the concept, merely get a brush that does the job without losing bristles.  This product is not the total solution, but is a good addition when using Gray Away Root Concealer spray.  I will continue to use this product because it solves the problem, helps me feel refreshed,  and buys me more time until I can color my hair properly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how does my hair feel, it gets dusty???? weird, and doesn&#x27;t cover really good, get the darker color, because the brown one gets on your hair like a weird gray one. I have grays already!!</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for me! Not only does it fill in the gray. But it also darkens my scalp. Which is so white next to my dark brown hair.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using a brown eye shadow, which actually worked better.  I tried this product in &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; and found it to be an odd color that did not blend well and looked splotchy on the scalp.  I tried to blend it in with my fingertips but it still didn&#x27;t blend well.  It also didn&#x27;t stay on any longer then eye shadow.  For these reasons, I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works swell, handy size and fair price!</li>
            <li> Life saver in between dye jobs.  Great at hairline near forehead.</li>
            <li> This stuff&#x27;s great.  Just as anticipated.  Fills in any white areas once hair is fixed and covers grays with a little work.  It truly stays until next shampoo.  If you&#x27;re trying to cut back on salon visits or are sick of coloring your own hair, save some time and sanity with this powder.  It&#x27;s truly a quick fix for those times we need a little something!</li>
            <li> This powder is great for root touch-ups.  I have a lot of gray that comes in at the crown.  When my hair color starts to grow out, this gives me two to three extra weeks before having to re-apply color.  So, that alone would be worth it.  But what I really love is, this stuff stays on your hair until you next wash it.  It doesn&#x27;t come off!  That just seems remarkable to me.  I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does.  Brush it on and it&#x27;s there.  I ordered dark brown and it matches great.  Love, love, love it!  Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This product is great for in-between coloring.  Perfect for minor root touch-up.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Lighter than I had thought.</li>
            <li> When I received it there was a clear sticker covering the product. It was stuck to the powder and when I took it off a huge chunk of the powder broke off and went flying! There were still lots of loose bits inside. I closed the lid and put it away. The next morning I took it out and noticed there was brown powder covering my counter and my makeup box where I stored the product. I tilted the package (while closed) a bit to the side and a bunch of powder fell out! The loose powder was spilling out of the sides because apparently there&#x27;s a gap large enough to do so, but you can&#x27;t tell by looking at it. I had to empty all the loose stuff that broke off from that stupid sticker. The packaging hasn&#x27;t given me any problems after that, but I still lost a lot of product. It would be better to seal the product with a sticker on the OUTSIDE of the packaging so it doesn&#x27;t stick on the makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual product is poor too, but that might just be the nature of these types of products. This is the only one I&#x27;ve tried of its kind. The dark brown matches my hair color pretty well, but it just looks like my scalp is stained with dye or something. It&#x27;s pretty noticeable and my temples still look thin/balding with this product in. It makes a pretty good eyeliner though.</li>
            <li> good  stuff...!!!!!!!!!!!!  i  have ordered  a lot of this stuff, and all I can say is it  works fine  for me....!!  ;)</li>
            <li> Not a great product. I decided to try this after using Joan Rivers Great Gair Day and was not at all impressed. The color is a bit too light, and it&#x27;s not as much product in the compact, so you&#x27;ll use it up quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great. My hair is very thin on top and use this on the skin to cover up the shine of having no hair. I hate wigs but am going to have to give up someday soon, so far this product has helped</li>
            <li> It takes time and effort to effectively target grey hair strands with this, but it can improve the appearance of grey. I don&#x27;t find that it wears off too bad during the day. Makes my hair look dull and unnatural where applied; and it will get under your fingernails if you scratch your head or run your hand thru your hair. There is no quick and easy grey cover up that I can find. This is as good as any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Well I had one of these products before and it was great. This was a new one for me. When you put it on it seems&lt;br /&gt;Heavy and not very nice to touch. True it doesn&#x27;t run bit the color was not as good as I expected. Will not order this&lt;br /&gt;One again</li>
            <li> not the answer.. but some might like it</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SIMPLE TO USE AND COVERS MY GRAY HAIR COMPLETELY.  I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT FOR A TEMPORARY ROOT FIX.</li>
            <li> best ever. I hope you never stop making this product. I&#x27;m bald without it ( well almost) haha  this product makes me feel GREAT</li>
            <li> It works very well - can&#x27;t tell you have it on.</li>
            <li> I use this for a horrible back part that you can see because of my white scalp against dark brown hair.  This works perfectly for that.  Goes on pretty easy and the color matches pretty well.  It does take a while to get enough on the scalp to hide any spots but it is worth the work.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetologist and I buy this for a client that has slight thinning hair at the frontal along with some grays. My distributor was out of this color so Amazon saved my bunns! This fills the thinning spot without all the potions and lotions and it hides the gray between visits. I also use this on set for photos, movies, and tv, just to make sure there is no shine off the scalp in thinner areas. I also use it for eyebrow filler as it stays put..... ;)</li>
            <li> The powder cover the gray hair but it feels sticky to the touch!!</li>
            <li> I am VERY impressed with this product. The price was incredibly reasonable. My fiance has an alopecia spot on his scalp, and he originally just wanted something to color it in so that it was not so noticeable, but this product actually made the hair start growing back. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Great product! and much cheaper than the Joan Rivers hair powder. It covers the gray well and I have 75% gray. It stays on all day. The applicator brush works fine but the handle is a little too long making it hard to fit into a small to medium cosmetic bag. I keep this product in my purse with me all the time for on the spot touch ups between hair colorings as needed. Am so happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I order this product and would not be withot it. Some times my daughter orders it for me. i love it.</li>
            <li> Works great for in between colorings, very subtle for even dark hair - I use the dark brown.  It is a little messy (the powder is very flakey) and the brush &amp;#34;sheds&amp;#34; but overall a worthwhile product for me.  I have replaced it several times already.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown in so I dont need to use on scalp. Great product to fill in eyebrows.</li>
            <li> much like the Joan Rivers product, but a fraction of the price.  Great product for thinning hair line. Got this quickly too</li>
            <li> I like this product as far as covering, but I ran out of it very quickly, which surprised me. I would order again though as I really like the coverage,</li>
            <li> My only wish that the tray would be wider. I use the dermmatch foam applicator to put it on, not the brush it came with.(using the dark brown color)</li>
            <li> This product is the best I&#x27;ve found to cover those pesky thinning areas of hair on my scalp.. The powder also makes my hair appear to be thicker and gives the body and texture of a fuller head of hair. I recommend this product and the shipping was very fast...</li>
            <li> The powder consistency was okay, the color was horrible.. it was not brown at all, it was like a dark grey.. putrid!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry I wasted my money and time! Just use brown eyeshadow...</li>
            <li> I just received this today and it has somehow pored out of the packaging all over the inside of the envelope and now all over me.  This is a complete mess.  It&#x27;s a lose powder in a none sealed case, guess you get what you pay for.  Not tried it yet as everything including the brush will need washed first so not sure I&#x27;ll bother.</li>
            <li> My daughter told me about this product. She started using it and loves it. She told me about it and I ordered it and I love it too. It really does the job and is so easy to apply. The order came quick and Im a really satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> my wife is very happy with this product !!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Hides embarrassing thin spots and looks natural. I have asked some long time friends to be honest with me (and they will!) and they told me the spots are completely hidden! I will definitely buy again (I have tried many other products) This works best for me!</li>
            <li> Ok. So...I&#x27;m a freaked out 43 yr old woman who inherited severe thinning hair. To make matters worse, my hair is very dark and my skin is very light, causing a shiny pinkish white halo of scalp gleaming through what little hair I do have. It&#x27;s awful. I hate it. And people can&#x27;t help but stare at the top of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a LOT of things, including my most recent fiasco: hair fibers. Don&#x27;t judge me, I&#x27;m desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a woman with hair balding much worse than mine, on youtube, who uses this powder underneath hair pieces. So I gave it a go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will not make your hair thick or full. It&#x27;s not a miracle. But what it DOES do is take away that hopeless, shiny scalp halo. And that&#x27;s enough for me:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This powder is not to be confused with eye brow powder, which for some reason does not work well on scalps. This product is super easy to apply, using the soft brush included. It does NOT sweat off or run either. I live in the horrible hot and humid climate of the deep south. I tested this product by applying and then gardening in August heat. It stayed put and didn&#x27;t even look like &amp;#34;dirty scalp&amp;#34;, like most other products of this type will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my story and I&#x27;m sticking to it.</li>
            <li> She didn&#x60;t look good in the color it looked cheap and awful didn&#x60;t  have that special glow you would expect  , Maybe another color another time////???</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have purchased this product.  It is covering the areas of my head.  It looks like I have hair where needed.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again.</li>
            <li> I  did not like this product.  It take quite a bit to cover your grey.  It feels quite sticky in the hair and rubs off on my pillow.</li>
            <li> Works great to cover gray so I can go longer between root touch ups.</li>
            <li> I would purchase this product again, works great for me!! Lasts a lot longer then other products out there similar to this!!</li>
            <li> Its good for touch ups on roots. Blends well with hair color. Its light so frequent touch up is needed.</li>
            <li> I use this product on the back of my scalp, where it can be noticed that I have thin hair. It really works, as far as fooling the eye.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product ! It is perfect for filling in a few spots and covering a bit of Gray in between salon visits. I would highly recommend : )</li>
            <li> Not impressed. Ordered dark brown. Application made a light brownish smudge- could not get a darker coverage and what was applied bled down onto my forehead.</li>
            <li> This product works but it doesn&#x27;t last that long, I had to keep reapplying. The powder just doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Really does the job - quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Love product but shipping and handling was way too expensive not worth re-ordering.</li>
            <li> Two stars for this matching my hair color (very dark ash blonde-very light ash brown) perfectly. The look is very natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this makes a big mess even when I&#x27;m just sweeping the brush to pick up some color. It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m grinding it in there or anything. I sweep it, stipple it on and I can feel a little of the grit falling from my hairline down into my eyes (ouch) right away, and there is powder all over my vanity sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit does stay on. The look, as I said, is excellent, but so much doesn&#x27;t go on initially and/or doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because the Joan Rivers&#x27; Great Hair Day product was out of stock with Amazon.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well, not even close to as well, so I wound up ordering the Joan Rivers&#x27; product from another source.</li>
            <li> As we get older, our hair starts to thin. When my gray starts to come out and really shows my thinning hair, I use this stuff. Oh my gosh! My self esteem sky rocketed after the first use!!! Believe it or not, I actually slept in this stuff and I didn&#x27;t have a gross pillow and my hair felt perfect the next morning. It slightly dries out my hair, but I&#x27;m SO glad I found this. Just a little bit on the crown of your head and around the edges and voila! Full, dark hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! I have thin hair and this helps fill where my scalp is visible. Stays on all day and washes out easily. No mess, easy use..</li>
            <li> I have ordered this multiple times.  The brush does shed some but it is still very full and works great.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> It really works well!  It not only covers the gray, it fills in the areas where my hair is thinning.  The brush however is worthless because whenever I tried to use it,  some of the bristles fell out.  I used a cotton ball and that worked out okay.  I will buy the product again because it covers so well but I will try to find a better brush to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get enough on the brush/scalp.  It does conceal a little, but not enough.</li>
            <li> My mother has suffered from thinning hair on top for years now. She is extremely sensitive and self conscious about it, as most women would be.  She has done everything possible using her hairstyling to cover the thinning to no avail of course.  It has affected her confidence immensely.  I learned about this type of product, read every review and decided to give this less expensive version a try.  Well, my mother (who is EXTREMELY critical) LOVES it! It has made a huge difference for her. Her hair is so thin on top and it covers her scalp beautifully in all of the thin areas. I read reviews that stated a disparity in the color for some. My mom has a medium brown hair color with light sprinkles of gray. The dark brown is a perfect match for her. It looks kind of grayish in the container, but goes on with a perfect color for her. It remained on until she washed her hair, with no transfer to clothes or bedding.  It&#x27;s a great product. It has made a tremendous difference in my mom&#x27;s self esteem and confidence. It can be a little bit messy in the application process, not terribly, the expected amount. I think I&#x27;ll use gloves when I apply it to my mom&#x27;s hair next. However, it&#x27;s not necessary, a simple hand washing will do.  Make sure you have a paper towel or something covering the surface that you sit it on, when applying. It&#x27;s a powder and it can be messy like a powder. All in all, a great product, quite worth the investment. I definitely encourage you to purchase it if you&#x27;re suffering with thinning hair like my mother. As a matter of fact, my husband&#x27;s hair has thinned tremendously on top, much to his chagrin. I&#x27;m going to suggest he use it too. Good luck!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very impressed with this stuff. The brush is absolutely useless. The color payoff is not great and the brunette is a bit too light and red for my hair which surprised me because it looks very dark and almost gray in the pot. I&#x27;ve ordered the Joan Rivers one so I&#x27;ll report back if that one is worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom and she loves it. It hides her gray hair so she doesn&#x27;t need to constantly dye her hair. Good product.</li>
            <li> It covers my thinning hair! My sister has used it also and likes it very much! I will be getting it again when I run out of the product!</li>
            <li> The color is pretty good but I feel that it&#x27;s too powdery. I would like to try other brands to cover my thinning areas.</li>
            <li> this product is great!  waterproof too.  just brush it on, and it blends right in.  Washes out with shampoo.  Nice little box and brush t travel with  you</li>
            <li> The powder worked well to fill in thinning areas. After using it I got zits in the area. I don&#x27;t know if that was consequencial or not. I do have sensitive skin. The area I used was around my hairline and sideburns.</li>
            <li> Not as good as Joam Rivers, but will do for now.</li>
            <li> Really like this stuff. It covers my thinning hair and gray. The brush is kind of useless. Goes on well with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I am so upset, I opened up my order and dark brown/ black powder was EVERY WHERE!!!! It spilled all over my carpet and my clothes. It should have been in a box. It was all broken!  What a mess!!!!!! The compact was in a small envelop with some bubble wrap. As soon as I removed it from the envelop, all the powder was broken and spilling out of the compact. It stained everything!!!! I had to get on my hands and knees and scrub the carpet, wash my clothes..... It has been a nightmare! I was truly looking forward to using this product but there was barely any left since it was all in the bubble wrap .</li>
            <li> this product arrived broken the powder was shattered inside and was all over the inside of the box i contacted the seller and they were very rude and i felt did not care at all about it made me feel like i was putting them out and lying about what had happened i ended up throwing it out ! it was very poor quality compared to similar products i have used</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t ask me to review this product if you don&#x27;t like the truth</li>
            <li> Getting right to the point, I love this product!  My hair has always been baby fine but now it is thinning - not a great combination.  I tried this the first day it arrived and use it just about every time I go out.  I wasn&#x27;t sure the color would work because the powder looked like a charcoal grey/brown  and my hair is medium brown, but it conceals perfectly.  The compact is 2\\&quot; x 2\\&quot; and has a mirror, so it is easy to carry in your purse or in a make up bag on a trip.  This product has really changed my life.  No more scalp showing.  It lasts all day  with no staining  hats.  Because it is a powder, I do end up getting some in my sink, but that is more my fault than the product.  This should last a long time, but when it runs out, I will certainly purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This product does not cover gray hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. This product did not meet my expectations and will not order it again.</li>
            <li> I was using the J. Rivers stuff but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price so got this and it seems to do the same thing and much less expensive</li>
            <li> This product does cover gray and you really can&#x27;t tell you put it on until you scratch your head.  Every time you scratch, your fingernails get the product in them. I found that annoying, even though pleased with the coverage.</li>
            <li> Will never buy from these sellers again. Horrible customer service. The product i ordered was smashed to bits, when I emailed about a replacement I was told I&#x27;d get one but that was someone blowing smoke my a** . Sorry I wasted my money!!</li>
            <li> I wash my hair often so, I needed something quick.  The coverage is not as complete as Joan Rivers, however, I don&#x27;t want to spend all that time to get such intense coverage anyway.  This is a lighter hence easier-to-blend powder.  The price is about 70% less also!</li>
            <li> Works for me.  Wish it would be a little bigger.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I have very  thin hair and there is always scalp showing through.  I brush this on and go.  I love that it stays on through rain, sweat and wet.  I just love it.  I get it once a month.</li>
            <li> The powder came crumbled.  The &amp;#34;dark brown&amp;#34; is actually medium brown so if you are looking for dark brown, try black.</li>
            <li> This is the best product for filling in thinning hair. I highly recommend it. You will be very pleased.</li>
            <li> I use this all the time Love it!</li>
            <li> Like the small size of the compact and brush is a good size.  It does cover the thinning area I have.  Was worth the price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to cover a thinning area on my scalp and couldn&#x27;t be happier. I have dark brown hair and purchased the dark brown color and it is a great match. I won&#x27;t comment on how it covers grays since that is not what I use it for but for scalp coverage from thinning hair 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this product.  Having seen others at much higher prices and wanting to try something to camouflage my thinning hair I ordered this product.  To my amazement it worked just as well as those that are double the price, I recommend it to anyone having this problem.</li>
            <li> best &amp;#34;fill in&amp;#34; product for the price, good service and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love it y brush sheds to much</li>
            <li> It did a fine job and made me look good. That is what I wanted it to do. I will order it again when I need More.</li>
            <li> This is OK but Xfusion Hair Fibers work better.</li>
            <li> we all know how difficult it is to choose a right color of the internet screen , right? they give two options -  medium brown or light brown/blond. I am not blond so I was leaning more to medium brown that actually is very dark brown. Not a biggie, you think? You think you can exchange, right? NO YOU CANNOT. You are stuck with that wrong color&lt;br /&gt;Very bad company</li>
            <li> I did not know about such product. About three weeks into my color, my roots start showing because my hair grows fast. This product helps me make those last seven days with more confidence</li>
            <li> Did not work as good as expected</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for me. Dark brown hair, white roots.</li>
            <li> Def go true to your hair color, i went dark brown but have black hair.still does job but if the person knows where to look on your head, they&#x27;ll def see difference.</li>
            <li> My title says it all. The brush is just about useless. I am going to try a cottonball as one reviewer said this works better, but I don&#x27;t honestly expect a positive result. There just is not enough pigmentation in this product to adhere to and cover the scalp. At least it was pretty inexpensive so I&#x27;m not going to bother returning it ... and maybe that&#x27;s what the maker of this product counts on. I&#x27;m going to check out the Joan Rivers brand.</li>
            <li> I love this product. With my thinning hair problem I was embarrassed to part my hair, but thanks to this fill in powder I can style my hair as desired.</li>
            <li> Makes you good to go. !!</li>
            <li> Perfect, the price is great compared to what I&#x27;ve paid for other products!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT. I HAVE ORDERED THIS FILL IN POWDER SEVERAL TIMES. IT&#x27;S AWESOME, MAKES IT LOOK LIKE MY IS VERY FULL.  THE POWDER STAYS IN UNTIL I SHAMPOO IT OUT. HOPE TO BE ABLE TO BUY IT FOREVER!!!  THANK YOU, LORI.</li>
            <li> This item is just as good as the Joan Rivers &amp;#34;GREAT HAIR DAY&amp;#34;  Only thing is, you can never get this color in stock from Rivers!</li>
