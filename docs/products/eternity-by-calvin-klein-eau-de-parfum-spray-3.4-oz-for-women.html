            <li> I REMEMBER THIS SMELL FOR YEARS BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MY MOTHER&#x27;S CHOICE OF PERFUME! IT IS ALL WAYS NICE TO HAVE A MOTHER THAT YOU CAN IMAGINE THROUG A SMELL! NO I AM NOT A MOMMIES BOY BUT I DO LOVE MY MOTHER AND THIS IS A GREAT PERFUME FOR THE LADIES!</li>
            <li> does not smell like my original department store bought eternity. the original usually stays on all day. this one does not even smell at all like the original. not happy at all.</li>
            <li> I think I have worn Eternity for an eternity.  It has become my signature and I don&#x27;t know what I would do if they ever quit making it.  It&#x27;s one of the few perfumes that doesn&#x27;t turn on me and I just love it.</li>
            <li> For months I enjoyed the smell of Eternity on a co-worker and then finally decided to buy a bottle for myself. (I&#x27;m a die-hard user of Beautiful -- or, well, I used to be!) My money was not wasted. Eternity is a mild, clean fragrance that fits the pleasant persona I want to convey. I know the ads for this fragrance are more serious and sexy than \\&quot;pleasant\\&quot; -- I&#x27;m just telling you like it is! After I squirt myself with this stuff, do friends and strangers ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing? You bet.&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to buy Eternity through my Amazon Prime account. The price was competitive, ordering was easy, shipment was fast. Best of all, I didn&#x27;t have to hunt down the right-size bottle or wait for help at the perfume counter.</li>
            <li> Good price and good size.  I really like this perfume.  I only wear it at night though.  I feel like it´s too strong for mornings</li>
            <li> Really like this fragrance, not too pricey and not to heavy.  I will use this for just about every occasion.</li>
            <li> I started wearing Eternity when it first came out and I still love it! This product is such a great buy. I was paying $75.00 at the department stores for the same bottle. It is obvious to me that it isn&#x27;t a knock off! This is the kind of perfume that you get complimented on...every time I go out someone asks me what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing!</li>
            <li> This is my friends favorite perfume, she was so happy to get it as a gift from me. She couldn&#x27;t believe how much less I paid for it then she did, when she bought some .herself.</li>
            <li> This is the fragrance of choice for my best friend who thought they may never find it on the market again. Thank you Calvin Klein and amazon. This fragrance is unique and very desirable.</li>
            <li> my wife loves this perfume she cannot get enough of this she wears it all the time and since I got it my life is a lot nicer</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Eternity\\&quot; product matched up to my (big name)-department- store -bought parfum. Perfumes are the hardest to buy online,as far as discerning the \\&quot;real deal\\&quot; from the \\&quot;knockoffs\\&quot; but I would feel comfortable ordering more \\&quot;Eternity\\&quot; from this Seller.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter - no complaints from her.</li>
            <li> I just love the fragrance of Eternity.  The parfum spray was delivered on time and in perfect condition.  I recommend this product to whomever asks me what fragrance I am wearing.  Love it!!.  Maria</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.  Eternity has been my favorite for thirty years and has become a signature,  will order again soon!</li>
            <li> Everyone asks me what I am wearing ...sooo fresh and clean no heavy perfume ...I wear it everyday ...I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this perfume since my birthday is coming up as a gift for myself. I&#x27;m not really sure if I received the wrong fragrance or it is really what&#x27;s everyone was talking about. I so much have the smell I gave to my sister.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> A great fragrance, just enough to be noticed but not overwhelming.  Get complements from all ages.  Great for work, going out or anytime you want a clean and slightly sensual fragrance to sweeten up your day.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance! I enjoy it when a woman who&#x27;s wearing it walks by... I enjoy it more however, when my wife is wearing it, and walks by. And I enjoy it even more when my wife is wearing it - and gets...closer! It&#x27;s simply one of those classic scents, that accomplishes what it was designed to do...allure men!</li>
            <li> Fiance got it and was satisfied. This is her favorite perfume. There has seem to be no problem with the product. Regarding the quality</li>
