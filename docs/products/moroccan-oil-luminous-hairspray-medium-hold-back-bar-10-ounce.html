            <li>This is my favorite hairspray ever.</li>
            <li>I was able to style even after spraying.</li>
            <li>But most products don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I love Moroccanoil products and tools.</li>
            <li>Smells great and allows natural look.  </li>
            <li>I used this through the summer and it worked good with high humidity too.</li>

            <li>It smells so wonderful, isn&#x27;t sticky or too heavy for my hair which is blonde and a bit on the finer side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very quickly and wrapped up nicely to avoid damage.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much from a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>it holds great, not stiff, and has a natural hold.  </li>
            <li>Good hold without weighing down or being so stiff that my hair breaks, which is really important to me because I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This is my very fave go to hairspray!  </li>
            <li>This product is ok but doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same formula as the salon where I purchased the first can.</li>
            <li>You can certainly find a similar or better hairspray for this product.  </li>
            <li>This keeps what little hair I need in place all day, leaves my hair soft (not stiff or sticky at all), and SMELLS GREAT (but overpowering).  </li>
            <li>and I was able to use a lid from an empty container that I had.</li>
            <li>The company&#x27;s shipping was so expedient, too and pricing reasonable.  </li>
            <li>I have straight, fine, long hair that does not need much hold in hairspray.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair stay in place while remaining touchable and soft</li>
            <li>i love this product and buying it here from amazon is about HALF the price as getting it from the salon!!!</li>
            <li>I love the medium hold hairspray because it holds up for the entire day without being hard and sticky.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much because it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticky like other hair sprays.</li>
            <li>Same product at the local hair supply but much cheaper.</li>

            <li> This is my very fave go to hairspray!  I have used it for years and tried others, but keep coming back to this one!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hairspray ever. Wonderfully fragrant, flexible hold, adds shine, washes out easily.</li>
            <li> I have straight, fine, long hair that does not need much hold in hairspray.  This keeps what little hair I need in place all day, leaves my hair soft (not stiff or sticky at all), and SMELLS GREAT (but overpowering).  This is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>

The company&#x27;s shipping was so expedient, too and pricing reasonable.  Thanks so much from a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> The medium finish doesn&#x27;t give you helmet head! It works for up-do&#x27;s if you spray enough on. Highly recommended for everyday use!</li>
            <li> This product is ok but doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same formula as the salon where I purchased the first can. I will use it but next time will go back to the salon to buy.</li>
            <li> Cheapest way to get this fantastic hairspray.</li>
            <li> You can certainly find a similar or better hairspray for this product.  I did like the fragrance and the medium hold it gave.  I was able to style even after spraying. In the long run it was too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> This is what I had been looking for. Not to heavy but keeps your hair styled. Not going to work on humid days. But most products don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccanoil products and tools. Ran out of hairspray a few weeks back and thankfully found it much cheaper here on Amazon. You realize how great a product is when you don&#x27;t have it and are stuck using a much more inferior product. I love the medium hold hairspray because it holds up for the entire day without being hard and sticky. I used this through the summer and it worked good with high humidity too.</li>
