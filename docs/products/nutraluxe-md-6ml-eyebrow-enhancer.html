            <li>Great!</li>
            <li>Even my eyebrow specialist at Lilibeth Brows was impressed.</li>
            <li>Awesome stuff.</li>
            <li>my eyebrows was really impressed!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t promise that it will work as well for anyone else, but I&#x27;m so happy I tried</li>
            <li>Great product</li>
            <li>Great product and great value for the price.  </li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>Amazing product!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck</li>
            <li>Better than any department store product, I have tried them all.</li>
            <li>this product, best I&#x27;ve found for shortage of brows, only thing is, it takes over a month or two to show a difference!</li>
            <li>I am waiting more to grow</li>
            <li>Absolutely not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>I am 61 years old, fair and have always had sparse lashes and brows, but no longer.</li>
            <li>Items must be returned in original condition and original packaging (manufacturer&#x27;s box, plastic bags, etc) accompanied by receipt or proof of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s dong pretty good so far!</li>
            <li>-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may return the item(s) to us within 30 days of your purchase for a full refund or exchange.</li>
            <li>and now I even go out to the market or to do chores without my eye makeup;) It took about 5 weeks for full results.</li>
            <li>That doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li>Ultimately though, it&#x27;s a good product for those wanting to fill in their brows naturally.</li>
            <li>At my age I deserve the small indulgence of their lash and brow products because I have never really had great lashes or brows, but nice eyes.</li>
            <li>basically, if I would have lied to them and told them that the item was unused instead of being truthful I could have gotten my money back.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>This is a real lift for me!</li>
            <li>but I really appreciate this product!</li>
            <li>First I used their product for eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I have to trim them within the first week&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li>I decided to give this product a try because there were a few good reviews on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It took a few months to get full results, okay probably 3 months</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a month straight with no results whatsoever.</li>
            <li>Thanks NUTRALUXE.</li>
            <li>They really work.</li>
            <li>Thanks Nutra Luxe</li>
            <li>Highly recommended...</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I purchased this product hoping to make my eyebrows a little thicker and more defined.</li>
            <li>However, I will say that it darkened my brows a little more than I wanted.</li>
            <li>After using it on a consistent basis (1-2 times a day for a a few weeks), I noticed a significant improvement in the look of my brows.</li>
            <li>but I did notice about 5 new strands.</li>
            <li>I finally found something that works after trying many other brands.</li>
            <li>I am fully satisfied because I had use so many brands but always got bad result.</li>
            <li>Grew back my eyebrows, really they were shaved off and this grew them back in a month.</li>
            <li>After several weeks of using NUTRALUXE, my eyebrows are dark and much thicker.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this product hoping to make my eyebrows a little thicker and more defined. It definitely lived up to its claims. After using it on a consistent basis (1-2 times a day for a a few weeks), I noticed a significant improvement in the look of my brows. However, I will say that it darkened my brows a little more than I wanted. I have auburn hair and the enhancer took them to a dark brown. Ultimately though, it&#x27;s a good product for those wanting to fill in their brows naturally.</li>
            <li> This solution definitely makes my brows darker and fuller.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month straight with no results whatsoever. I called on day 30 to initiate a return and you can not return it once it&#x27;s been used, aka &amp;#34;original condition&amp;#34;. $40 + shipping down the drain. Their return policy is here -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may return the item(s) to us within 30 days of your purchase for a full refund or exchange. Items must be returned in original condition and original packaging (manufacturer&#x27;s box, plastic bags, etc) accompanied by receipt or proof of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically, if I would have lied to them and told them that the item was unused instead of being truthful I could have gotten my money back. That doesn&#x27;t seem right.</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations as it did not perform as stated.  I would not recommend it to anyone who is trying to grow eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had extremely thin and sparse eyebrows since I was in high school. I over plucked them and they never grew back.  I decided to give this product a try because there were a few good reviews on Amazon.  I have used it once a day, every night for over a month. The results were not what I hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no major hair growth but I did notice about 5 new strands. I believe this product will vary depending on the person&#x27;s skin type but don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li> been using  a couple of weeks and already notice there is a big difference in the growth of my eyebrows</li>
            <li> This products WORKS! Great!</li>
            <li> After chemotherapy, my eyebrows grew back scant and faded.  After several weeks of using NUTRALUXE, my eyebrows are dark and much thicker.  I do not have to supplement with eyebrow powder.  Thanks NUTRALUXE.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister. In 8 weeks she has brows.The product also darkens the brow.I waited for results before I reviewed it. She uses it about 3 times a week now for maintenance. She will defineitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! It took a few months to get full results, okay probably 3 months and then my eyelashes were noticeably longer and curled!! I have always had to use an eyelash curler in the past, but no more. Also I had developed some little skin tag along the lower eyelash prior to using this product and now it is gone!! Amazing product!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  Had a few spots in my brows that were a little sparse.  After using this product for a few weeks, I noticed that the spots were filling in and that my brows looked much fuller.</li>
            <li> Before I started using this product a couple of weeks ago, my eyebrows had become virtually non-existent - they looked like faded polynoses stuck over my eyes and I panicked if my eyebrow powder wore off.  Since using this my brows have returned, and although they are still very thin, I look like I have eyebrows again.  This product is very expensive, but it&#x27;s worth it for me to have my brows back.  I just bought another tube so I won&#x27;t run out, and I hope as time goes by my brows will continue to grow fuller.  I can&#x27;t promise that it will work as well for anyone else, but I&#x27;m so happy I tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m writing this as an addendum to my review above.  I notice here that the current price for this item is $129.  I only paid $56 both times I purchased it, only a couple of days ago.  I don&#x27;t understand the jump in price, but in the future I&#x27;ll be looking for it other than on Amazon if the price isn&#x27;t lowered.</li>
            <li> used faithfully. No difference at all.</li>
            <li> I bought mine from the Nutraluxe MD site. At my age I deserve the small indulgence of their lash and brow products because I have never really had great lashes or brows, but nice eyes. I am 61 years old, fair and have always had sparse lashes and brows, but no longer. This is a real lift for me! I am not really someone who reviews a lot of things, I still work and am very busy but I really appreciate this product! I am going to copy this over to the lash and brow products, too. They really work. Better than any department store product, I have tried them all.And I like the idea of not going the prescription route for my lashes. If you already have luscious brows and lashes, maybe not for you but I don&#x27;t, and now I even go out to the market or to do chores without my eye makeup;) It took about 5 weeks for full results.</li>
            <li> I have used this product almost a month and I see my eyebrow grow longer, I cannot tell if they are thicker yet.</li>
            <li> Grew back my eyebrows, really they were shaved off and this grew them back in a month.</li>
            <li> Does help with keeping my eyelashes long and conditioned.</li>
            <li> Fast working and gave me dark, thick hair. Even my eyebrow specialist at Lilibeth Brows was impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck wth this product, best I&#x27;ve found for shortage of brows, only thing is, it takes over a month or two to show a difference!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff. Eyelashes and brows have grown exponentially.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product since 4 weeks ago and the result is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;My eyebrow keep growing thicker and longger. I am fully satisfied because I had use so many brands but always got bad result. Highly recommended...Thanks Nutra Luxe</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! I bought this after hearing from a family member that it really works, tried it and my thin eyebrows are no more! My eyebrows thickened up in about 3-4 weeks with occasional use. I would highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got an essence of eyebrow back!  This area has always been a problem for me, but, after a month of application each morning, I can see some hair and some shadowing.  I&#x27;ll take it!</li>
            <li> I am waiting more to grow but it&#x27;s dong pretty good so far! I haven&#x27;t finished using it and waiting group of hair to grow.No signal of hair yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the age when eyebrows and eyelashes become skimpy. First I used their product for eyelashes. It worked great!Then I tried their Eyebrow Enhancer. My brows are fuller and even darker. The gal who waxes and tints my eyebrows was really impressed! I use these products once daily for about 3 or four months, then continue use every 3 days for maintenance.</li>
            <li> I finally found something that works after trying many other brands. Great product</li>
            <li> Absolutely not disappointed!  Great product and great value for the price.  Everyone should try it.  My eyebrows are growing like crazy!  I have to trim them within the first week&#x27;s use.</li>
