            <li>This lotion makes my skin feel very nice.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell also.</li>
            <li>although, to be fair, it is HONEY and calendula).</li>
            <li>This is a non-greasy moisturizer that spreads on smoothly and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>I LOVED it and looked forward to staying there</li>
            <li>It really is a good lotion.</li>
            <li>Smells good.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine on the rest of my body, but doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li>Not fond of the honey smell, but it&#x27;s a nice lotion.</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful w/out being over powerful and perfumed, it&#x27;s more earthy.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin nice and mosturized.</li>
            <li>This lotion is a super great quality.  </li>
            <li>Lovely scent, affordable.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of it.</li>
            <li>and glad I did.  </li>
            <li>so I could get more.</li>
            <li>Probably needs some more oil in it&#x27;s formula.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my legs and they&#x27;re so much better when I put the lotion on.</li>
            <li>Use all the time just love it.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite moisturizer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My favorite &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for dry skin and it does not make me feel greasy.</li>
            <li>vendor had this out to me very quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, and it has been changed from a nice absorbing lotion to axle grease.  </li>
            <li>but the it smell to strong  when you use</li>
            <li>The honey in it makes it smooth and easy to absorb on your skin.</li>
            <li>This is a great longlasting lotion especially for my crocodillian-like skin.</li>
            <li>Love the fresh honey smell of this product.  </li>
            <li>This does not feel really comfortable, too.</li>
            <li>I love this brand anyway, though this particular lotion is for very dry skin and feels delicious on the skin.</li>
            <li>Again though, the product is very nice and you shouldn&#x27;t let that stop you if you like the scent of honey and calendula and especially if you plan to use as a body lotion rather than face lotion.</li>
            <li>I had originally planned to use this as face lotion, hence why the scent was a bit too pungent for my needs.</li>
            <li>Rich lotion, no residue, works miracle on my  winter affected skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a lovely scent and would be nice as an overall body lotion.</li>
            <li>The lotion is silky and absorbs quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>Non greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I will also mention, I&#x27;m not in love with the smell, because I really don&#x27;t care for the smell of honey too much, but it&#x27;s such a good moisturizer, it really doesn&#x27;t matter!</li>
            <li>It contains no parabens, phthalates or SLS and is full of healthy essential oils.</li>
            <li>though- great for dry skin, compares to a &#x27;Curel&#x27; or Eucerin type lotion, but in an all natural form.</li>
            <li>This really smells like honey!...</li>
            <li>This has helped me so much!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the larger size.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes in a big bottle with easy pump which was priced right.</li>
            <li>I love the light scent, and the fact that when I apply it it&#x27;s super thick and creamy and has to be rubbed in.</li>
            <li>Large bottle for price.</li>
            <li>is very thick,so gets some getting used to.  </li>
            <li>It is especially good during the cold winters we have in Minnesota</li>
            <li>I have been using this very inexpensive moisturizer for years on my face and people can&#x27;t get over how young I look for my age.</li>
            <li>I will mention that I do get a bit of a burning sensation after taking a really hot shower and scrubbing my face raw, but because the lotion is so good, I really don&#x27;t mind a little tingle for 3 seconds.</li>
            <li>I first tried this lotion several years ago as a complimentary hotel lotion while staying at The Standard.</li>
            <li>This is my second face moisturizer, unlike my first moisturizer, feels like my face is burning when I apply it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and helps lock in the moisture naturally for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my sensitive skin soft but not greasy.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a smaller version of this lotion at Whole Foods</li>
            <li>I give this product props for being naturally derived and cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin that is really dry, especially on my legs in the winter.</li>
            <li>This moisturizes like no other!</li>
            <li>The Whole Foods selection is a much smaller tube for about the same amount of money.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday as the first moisturizing coat under my foundation primer and foundation!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and has a nice faint smell of honey.</li>

            <li> a friend recommended it to me because of my dry skin due to the horrible weather and air we have in the Central Valley, and at first it burned my face a little when i applied it after washing my face with dove soap but after a few time it stopped now its my every evening lotion after my facewash!</li>

            <li> Too thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> Meh.  Smells good.  Probably needs some more oil in it&#x27;s formula.</li>
            <li> Not fond of the honey smell, but it&#x27;s a nice lotion. Not too greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It smells wonderful w/out being over powerful and perfumed, it&#x27;s more earthy.  It leaves my sensitive skin soft but not greasy.</li>

            <li> This a very good lotion that I used. The honey in it makes it smooth and easy to absorb on your skin.</li>
            <li> Works ok. Leaves a greasy white mess that tough to rub in.</li>
            <li> I have really dry skin in winter. This is my second face moisturizer, unlike my first moisturizer, feels like my face is burning when I apply it. This does not feel really comfortable, too. But it works. Anyway, I won&#x27;t repurchase it anymore.</li>
            <li> This lotion is a super great quality.  I love this brand anyway, though this particular lotion is for very dry skin and feels delicious on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite moisturizer I have ever used. I have pretty bad dry skin, and if I don&#x27;t keep it moisturized at all times, I break out really badly. This has helped me so much! I use it everyday as the first moisturizing coat under my foundation primer and foundation!

Best product I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;Pro: amazing moisturizer, lasts forever, perfect under makeup&lt;br /&gt;Con: may feel a little burning when applying, but not always&lt;br /&gt;Neutral: Smell</li>
            <li> Large bottle for price. Keeps hands moist.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a smaller version of this lotion at Whole Foods so I knew how the product was before I bought it. It&#x27;s one of the best lotions ever!!!! I have super sensitive skin that is really dry, especially on my legs in the winter. When  use this product, it never causes me any problems and moisturizes my skin for days.  It isn&#x27;t greasy and has a nice faint smell of honey. Just as a warning, due to the type of lotion it takes a bit to rub it in fully. This is not something you would use unless you have the time to rub it in fully, because it leaves white streaks until it&#x27;s absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor had this out to me very quickly. I absolutely love the larger size. The Whole Foods selection is a much smaller tube for about the same amount of money. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an intensive, thicker lotion.</li>
            <li> I give this product props for being naturally derived and cruelty-free. However, it doesn&#x27;t absorb well on my face, and skin feels a bit tacky after. Best for legs in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable! I have been using this very inexpensive moisturizer for years on my face and people can&#x27;t get over how young I look for my age. There is no reason to pay a lot of money for skin care. The calendula is healing and the honey seals it in. Non greasy, absorbs quickly. Awesome!</li>
            <li> My favorite &amp;#34;flavor&amp;#34;. This moisturizes like no other! Great smell too.</li>
            <li> this product is awesome. It has a wonderful silky texture and it could hydrate an alligator.  It is perfect for dry skin and it does not make me feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.  It is especially good during the cold winters we have in Minnesota</li>
            <li> This moisturizer stung my face when I put it on and made it very red. Now I&#x27;m left with a lot of unusable lotion. It&#x27;s fine on the rest of my body, but doesn&#x27;t smell great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years, and it has been changed from a nice absorbing lotion to axle grease.  Yuck!</li>
