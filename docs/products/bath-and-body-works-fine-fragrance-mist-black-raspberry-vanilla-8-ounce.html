            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance!</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents!  </li>
            <li>But after about 3 days I started to love it!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still nice.</li>
            <li>Very sweet!</li>
            <li>It smells good, but it does not smell like the original.</li>
            <li>Smells good but goes away quick</li>
            <li>love this out of stock scent</li>
            <li>Would give five stars but in all honesty it does wear off very quickly as most body sprays do.</li>
            <li>sell again love the raspberry and vanilla smell</li>
            <li>My favorite body mist.</li>
            <li>it said it would be here on the 14th or u could pay 3 dollars more and have it sooner</li>
            <li>so I paid more</li>
            <li>I can smell it on myself after school still :)</li>
            <li>Once applied the scent lasts most of the day needing to be refreshed in the evening.</li>
            <li>Thrilled with my purchase super quick!</li>
            <li>Smell good fast shipping</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t like fruity strong smells..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty strong smell, but it&#x27;s a very nice fragrance that lasts the whole day!</li>
            <li>Smells light and just like raspberry candy.</li>
            <li>it smells like some cheap spray you&#x27;d get from like a dollar store</li>
            <li>i truly enjoy this scent</li>
            <li>black rasberry is my signiture scent :) happy with this order.</li>
            <li>Smell doesn&#x27;t last all day but that&#x27;s ok, just spray some more on every now and again if you&#x27;re able to.</li>
            <li>- I cannot twist the tops off like the old ones, however, the mist itself is very lovely.  </li>
            <li>Smells exactly the way you would think that it would, and it isn&#x27;t to strong.</li>
            <li>You can smell the berries from far away :)</li>
            <li>Smells more like alcohol than the old glass bottle used to.</li>
            <li>Came very fast from seller, within 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this scent!!</li>
            <li>Bath &amp; Body Works - very bummed about that!</li>
            <li>My favorite scent and it can only be found online at the BBW website or on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>It absolutely does NOT smell like the lotion at all, but it still gives off a fruity scent.</li>
            <li>4 stars because I do not like the new bottles</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t last -- not very overpowering scent but love it so</li>
            <li>But my Significant Other seems to like this!</li>
            <li>first I didn&#x27;t like the smell much because it smelled somewhat sour...</li>
            <li>it is my favorite from bath and body works, so i bought five bottles of it, but the thing is, it&#x27;s not very strong, does not last long</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Sometimes men can&#x27;t smell or appreciate actual perfume, regardless of the price.  I used Shalimar, Chanel #5, and to no effect whatsoever.  But my Significant Other seems to like this!</li>
            <li> Smells light and just like raspberry candy. Have worn for years. Would give five stars but in all honesty it does wear off very quickly as most body sprays do.</li>

            <li> Smells amazing. Smell doesn&#x27;t last all day but that&#x27;s ok, just spray some more on every now and again if you&#x27;re able to.</li>

            <li> i truly enjoy this scent it is my favorite from bath and body works, so i bought five bottles of it, but the thing is, it&#x27;s not very strong, does not last long i have to keep applying it throughout the day, i wish they would come out with a stronger scent of this, it was disappointing</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I do not like the new bottles - I cannot twist the tops off like the old ones, however, the mist itself is very lovely.  This is the one fragrance that never makes me sick to my stomach, and it is not heavy enough to bother other people. You guys should buy it so that BBW knows to keep making it.  Then I will be happy.  So, thank you in advance for purchasing this delightful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love love love!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents!  I&#x27;m so happy someone had it available!  Very hard to find since the fragrance has been discontinued by Bath &amp; Body Works - very bummed about that!</li>
