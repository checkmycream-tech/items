            <li>lol.</li>

            <li>/&gt;Other than that, the trimmer portion works great.</li>
            <li>I just have a great experience whit this norelco.</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>charge lasts for ever, is a great device</li>
            <li>This is a great product..</li>
            <li>This is a great item.  </li>
            <li>Really happy with this purchase and product.</li>
            <li>Really great razor.</li>
            <li>Takes some time to get used to it, maybe a couple weeks, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Very nice.</li>
            <li>Great product, nice quality!</li>
            <li>Great product, very comfortable for use and excellent quality of shave!!</li>
            <li>The beard shaving attachment I have found at its longest setting to be perfect length for body hair, and the body hair a great length for more detail.</li>
            <li>The speed at which this was shipped out is amazing as well!</li>
            <li>Build quality is great, it feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li>But this Philips is awesome shave way better than any electric and as close as a manual.</li>
            <li>Three products in one, and they all work remarkably well.</li>
            <li>I tried many of these things, I think philips as a brand is the best</li>
            <li>Nice quality!</li>
            <li>This is a perfect razor to shave all most all the hair of your body parts.</li>
            <li>I love it, its the best shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li>I have had many others electric razers and this is the best one.</li>
            <li>This device is truly one of a kind !</li>
            <li>I would not say this product is remarkable.</li>
            <li>A stand would been the perfect deal closer, but as the unit is, I like it a heck of a lot and would easily recommend it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use,  shave awesome,.</li>
            <li>very good, I love it.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m good for 21/2 years</li>
            <li>At the end of the day I wish I had returned this, and just bought a good beard trimmer.    </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good starter to electric shaving, don&#x27;t get this.    </li>
            <li>I don’t do a lot of “below the neck line” shaving but figured I might start if I had a good shaver to use.</li>
            <li>and I cannot give a good shave from this thing which is surprising.</li>
            <li>and it DOES fit and work perfectly on this shaver.</li>
            <li>He loves using it in the shower and gives him a good share.</li>
            <li>He thought that someone with a heavier beard might find this a good tool.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how good the triple-blade heads were until I tried to use these single-cut blades.  </li>
            <li>Good for use at home and while traveling.  </li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>so good.</li>
            <li>This Norelco face and body shaver and beard trimmer is a good deal if you plan to use all three functions.  </li>
            <li>I loved it.</li>
            <li>Its a good shaver</li>
            <li>It was a really good price</li>
            <li>A good system.</li>
            <li>It has a good Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll just add that I loved these.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a good while.</li>
            <li>Worked good - just had to shave every morning.</li>
            <li>I used this to shave it dose not do a good job</li>
            <li>Purchased one and worked fairly well for about 3 months.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shaver is good.</li>
            <li>Did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Good buy.</li>
            <li>the money does not give a good shave</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the battery life to be quite good.</li>
            <li>Its a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li>Looks like the battery is good too.</li>
            <li>Hey, this was a good razor for the price point.</li>
            <li>Maybe still good for the teenager who has an outlet nearby tho.</li>
            <li>All in all it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Also the two attachments for beard and body hair are good.</li>
            <li>The rotary design is superior in all regards to all foil razors.  </li>
            <li>good material</li>
            <li>i recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li>He said it is a good razor.  </li>
            <li>Performance of the 2-head shave head was fairly good.</li>
            <li>It is really cheap and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is designed to go over the area to be trimmed at a tilted angle and when done correctly it can leave a good amount of hair.</li>
            <li>This is as good an electric razor as I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>does the job its meant to, good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Really a good all around razor, the two heads take a bit longer to shave my face than a 3 headed electric shaver</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go for that shaving session.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Frankly, I loved the playful  advertising for this product</li>
            <li>This seems to be a good alternative to troubles I have been going through to shave each morning.  </li>
            <li>Got this as a gift for a friend and they loved it.</li>
            <li>easy to use !!</li>
            <li>easy to charge !!</li>
            <li>The styler attachment is my favorite piece; I use it to keep my gray beard beautiful.</li>
            <li>They said it was very easy to use and it shaved very nicely.</li>
            <li>Amazon is always exceptional when it comes to customer service.</li>
            <li>Maybe the shaving unit will do better at body grooming (lol).</li>
            <li>These are much better quality and the battery life is great.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer seems to do a better job of body grooming than the body grooming tool, but otherwise this is great</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s already so many great reviews</li>
            <li>but i love it trimmer is also great</li>
            <li>Works great love the machine.</li>
            <li>It is great to be able to kill 2 birds with one stone.</li>
            <li>Trimmer is great, body trimmer is okay as well as the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li>It is totally amazing how anyone thinks this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I settled on a Remington foil type shaver with better results, but it still did not do a great job.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the shave</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the shave</li>
            <li>Now that I do, it is amazing, feels good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great shaver for more smoother hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>It feels really nice in the hand, has a really good premium finish all over.</li>
            <li>I would have loved to have a nice bag with it to keep the accessories</li>
            <li>: Good for begginners and attachments are nice.</li>
            <li>has a good shave, all the heads attach with ease, good grip got it for a fair price love it</li>
            <li>Gives a very good, clean shave.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do the best job, however this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li>and he can&#x27;t stop raving about how many  attachments there are!</li>
            <li>This would be my first electrical razor and it works awesome.</li>
            <li>Awesome tool, exactly what is was looking for.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I waited so many years to upgrade!</li>
            <li>Does a wonderful job and is very versatile!</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>Now this is great and so easy because he just trims it up every 2/3 days when he feels he needs to.</li>
            <li>amazing battery life.</li>
            <li>Giving it 3 stars because the body shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li>The Norelco twin head electric razor is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>This attractively designed shaving device works quietly, is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>All in all, a good multipurpose shaving system, and I am pleased with results and the price.</li>
            <li>Smoothly, deeply, effectively pulling hair from akin.</li>
            <li>Still, it cleans things up nicely without nicks or scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Its a really nice shaver..</li>
            <li>I really apreciate the purchase, it matches perfectly my expectations about the product</li>
            <li>Changeable heads all seat nicely with no</li>
            <li>The grooming attachments are nice too, to be honest I haven&#x27;t fully tested them, and I&#x27;ll have to update this review</li>
            <li>lovey shaver dose nice job fits in hand</li>
            <li>It has a nice assortment of blades and accessories but no box to store them in.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li>I am advicing it to everyone who looks for that kind of item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a good, safe intro to electric shaving, based on the competitive price.</li>
            <li>I kind of want to switch the the rotary head</li>
            <li>Great razor, is water friendly so safe to use it in the shower!</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s waterproof -</li>
            <li>Fast shipping &amp; great customer service!</li>
            <li>A nice combo.</li>
            <li>Handy for travel.</li>
            <li>keeps everything nice and even.</li>
            <li>The reason is that the foil design capture hairs as effectively.  </li>
            <li>The body groomer attachment is nice since it has a clipper on either side and a foil that doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair.  </li>
            <li>But I love the body grooming head, it good for all areas below the neck.</li>
            <li>I use this very often and it always works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great seller, great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>and they provide a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li>Probably the best feature of this groomer is that it&#x27;s always ready to use.</li>
            <li>a superb Remington Micro Screen electric shaver and an equally good Norelco G370 All-in-One Grooming system, both 10+ years old.  </li>
            <li>There are cheaper products out there that work just as good and better.</li>
            <li>And may also be great if you are 100% clean shave but may not get all the hair under the nose or at the edge of the side</li>
            <li>powerful and beautiful.</li>
            <li>he was super happy.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Razor came with good accessories and they are easy to attach and detach.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Additionally is Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone that has a beard very easy to trim.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for maintaining more of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look, which happens to be what I prefer, but my job requires a clean shave</li>
            <li>and it is by far the best trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li>to charge, good battery life, comfortable in my hand and heads change in and out without a problem.</li>
            <li>Best shaver, I don&#x27;t use it on my face because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a nice shaver and does the job for the most part, still not as close shave as a razor</li>
            <li>This would  probably not be a good product if you&#x27;re looking for a close, precise shave.</li>
            <li>it is a good product but some parts are cheaply made</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for some kind of \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; shaver for a while now to use mostly when traveling or on vacation - having to carry two or three separate shavers/trimmers is cumbersome.</li>
            <li>: Not as close of a shave, shouldn&#x27;t have to stretch own face skin for a better shave.</li>
            <li>but it is very versatile and ideal for travel.</li>
            <li>trim groom and shave all with one unit, good battery life and leaves a smooth cut</li>
            <li>Has great features &amp; attachments that are useful.</li>
            <li>At first when I received the product I liked it and was happy except for the fact it didn&#x27;t come with a case.</li>
            <li>great shaver, smooth, close shave, and strong engine.</li>
            <li>most pleasant surprise is that it is extremely comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li>battery life is great and the ergonomics is just right</li>
            <li>Easy and painless!</li>
            <li>He liked it a lot and the more he uses it the more he likes it.</li>
            <li>way better than the cheap electric razors but just as good as the $300 ones.</li>
            <li>Honestly I bought this after the commercial and I have to say this is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>The truth is that this unit brilliantly fits and fuctions with the high end</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great but set it at one setting higher</li>
            <li>This was a gift, and I was told it works great, very close shave, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very light</li>
            <li>Very smooth cut</li>
            <li>Two of the attachments, in very light use, have come apart at the seams...literally.  </li>
            <li>but this would be good for throwing in the gym bag or keeping in the office desk for that quick touch-up.</li>
            <li>The two head facial shaver is great and does a superb job, but adding the three head that pivots from the Senso-touch line adds a great layer of speed and comfort that you get from shavers that are 2-3 times higher in value (be aware not all shaver heads fit the Click and Style, I used the RQ12 and it works FANTASTIC)!!</li>
            <li>Great price and came quickly and securely.</li>
            <li>they certainly have made some great improvements over the years.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean .!!</li>
            <li>I like the 2 head design better then 3.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you do more research when you purchase a shaving unit.</li>
            <li>love it  </li>
            <li>The body hair trimmer is okay.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is my favorite part.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for an okay body, and beard trimmer, consider this as an option.</li>
            <li>i love this product i can save , trim all the excess hair on my body.</li>
            <li>Could not ask for a better razor.</li>
            <li>Even if I could ask for a better razor, I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>that did not nick me, but it uses battery the most of all the attachments.</li>
            <li>So I used it for about two months - it did get better but never got to an acceptable level.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer</li>
            <li>I would recommend this more so as a trimmer than a shaver.</li>
            <li>Love or like loves you.</li>
            <li>Shaves ok.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco has been my favorite brand for shaving tools for many years now.</li>
            <li>Like many of the women in Vine, I chose this item and asked my husband to try it.</li>
            <li>I agree with most of the reviews already written.</li>
            <li>Shaving at the gym before work is more about convenience and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>me, shaving with a razor at the gym is just as convenient, more efficient, and provides smoother results than using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Could provide better resultsrd with a #3 comb on a set of Walh clippers, which cuts to a 3/8&amp;#34; or 9mm length.  </li>
            <li>me, shaving with a razor at the gym is just as convenient, more efficient, and provides smoother results than using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Could provide better results</li>
            <li>You can substitute a three-rotor SensoTouch head if you want, but unless you already have one I don&#x27;t think buying one is worthwhile.  </li>
            <li>I like being able to use it in the shower, and the fact that I can get almost any length of hair I want.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m hopping to get a replacement part and have better luck...</li>
            <li>now use the Norelco most mornings and my technique of shaving in circular motions and pulling the skin taut is improving.</li>
            <li>This is one good and economical shaving kit; well recommended.</li>
            <li>Love this razor set from Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product as it does everything it says it does.</li>
            <li>The three heads afford confident grooming on all areas of the body.</li>
            <li>I gave this 5 stars since it is the 1st electric razor that actually does what it advertises and works flawlessly</li>
            <li>you get 5 or more shaves on a charge</li>
            <li>I guess i am just used to better material this products appears to have run of the mill material.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does shave as good as the more powerful</li>
            <li>althoug the triple headed Norelco would be a better</li>
            <li>I bought this in June 2013 and for as many times as I&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li>And my life has changed for the better.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend this to anyone who was looking to buy a style shave kit :)</li>
            <li>i love this thing.</li>
            <li>glad i bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m used to shaving in the car with a Norelco Sensotouch 3D razor and a Remington Hyper Series electric razor (both of which I love), so my perspective on this shaver is influenced by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shave is so so, the blade is better.</li>
            <li>and it works better than any of the others he has had.</li>
            <li>and I admit I was a bit leery that it did not cost more, but am sure glad that I ordered it.  </li>
            <li>This razor has a good battery charge and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>and I was impressed at the prospect of the different tools that come with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I felt safe using this with no gritting teeth moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t shave any better than the three head,</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I would just make sure your skin is taunt in said region.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>For the most part I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>Love the beqard trimmer attchment so taht you can get</li>
            <li>wheres the &amp;#34;squares&amp;#34; shaver is better for getting a closer shave elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a versatile shaving kit that is a great value and gives good performance.</li>
            <li>glad</li>
            <li>idea of the three-in-one is great and it is designed really well.</li>
            <li>love this appliance</li>
            <li>With just the two heads, it takes more passes and takes longer to shave, which defeats the purpose of an electric</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, to love it would require the ability to use the shaver while plugged in.</li>
            <li>still works and get you an okay shave but takes a while to do it since it&#x27;s two heads</li>
            <li>Battery life could be better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Effectively replaces my razor for most uses.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>be ordering more)</li>
            <li>It shaves very well, it has a great battery life</li>
            <li>and now it rattles and i need to keep my finger on top to keep it closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay for body hair</li>
            <li>still use it almost every couple of days and probably one of the better trimmer combo sets I have ever owned that&#x27;s is made by Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is okay.</li>
            <li>, \\&quot;FACIAL HAIR IS AWESOME.... \\&quot;  </li>
            <li>, \\&quot;FACIAL HAIR IS AWESOME.... \\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I am sure it was probably said by one of the Duck Dynasty Dudes.</li>
            <li>use shaving gel when I shave the that works well, my hopes to shave more with an electric was to try to save some cash.  </li>
            <li>Works ok</li>
            <li>roommate would really love it if the head swiveled more.</li>
            <li>Satisfied...</li>
            <li>He says that it is okay.  </li>
            <li>It is OK</li>
            <li>Fast shipping/ great product</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t match my Panasonic wet/dry razor Panasonic ES8103S for the face, but I expect it will do much better than it for my body hair.  </li>
            <li>That leaves this as only a razor, which is not its best function.  </li>
            <li>This works well on the face and body, so if the battery was better, I would classify it a five star product.</li>
            <li>does the beard trimming better.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied and I recommend.</li>
            <li>No need to spend more.</li>
            <li>but overall this was an awesome buy.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure because of some of the reviews</li>
            <li>I have used the shaver most days of the week for a month and have still not recharged the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The body groomer attachment works OK.  </li>
            <li>The foil does not seem to get a close shave of the body hair in my opinion, but I am not 100% sure it is meant to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>an electric shaver, I think this product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>an electric shaver, I think this product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li>Two words -- \\&quot;razor stubble\\&quot; -- in close contact with your most tender areas should be explanation enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>It will be great for my purposes as a unit I will use when traveling, but for my day to day shaving I will continue to use my superior individual products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will be great for my purposes as a unit I will use when traveling, but for my day to day shaving I will continue to use my superior individual products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought this from Tarjee as got additional 5% off with Redcard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>It is okay for beginners but lacks the close shave.</li>
            <li>( Maybe because it doesn&#x27;t have a triple head like most electric shavers)  </li>
            <li>Norelco should ditch the two head razor and keep the three head razors like they use on most of their electric razors for a closer shave.</li>
            <li>Sometimes they are around $30, so one can try those before buying a more expensiver branded Norelco one.</li>
            <li>design is ok....</li>
            <li>Hopefully this shaver works out :)</li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s ok to shave the rest of one&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li>body groomer does an excellent job on those hard-to-reach places on the back and shoulder</li>
            <li>I love the way his body looks after using it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, youre better off with disposable razors and a comb.</li>
            <li>Only wanted to use it to trim my beard and it has all the perfect lengths.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Replacement heads cost a lot, so be sure to take care of this product.</li>
            <li>Sure if your trying to sport a beard over an inch this is not the tool for you to just rake through to trim it up</li>
            <li>have had many Norelco trimmers over the years and still have a Bodygroomer</li>
            <li>Not their top of the line.</li>
            <li>dislike norelco since it takes more than one pass to shave hair that my panasonic LV 81 will do in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for trimming underarms, legs, chest, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in a hurry (has happened more than once)</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>buy any more of their products.</li>
            <li>but im sure it will work well for that.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping that this Norelco would be a more sophisticated machine and give me a more even trim.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to wait the three weeks, if this machine miraculously becomes better I will update my review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m going to wait the three weeks, if this machine miraculously becomes better I will update my review.</li>
            <li>Comfortable to use!</li>
            <li>For sure it wasn&#x27;t the length of my beard because I do not allow it to grow longer than a five o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It pulled most of it.  </li>
            <li>However my is that although fully charged it doesn&#x27;t run for more then 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>It was ok with me</li>
            <li>So far my rating is based on how many good gift brownie points I got from him!</li>
            <li>had three head shavers for years.this model has two heads that seem to fit my face better.easy to clean and good close shave.</li>
            <li>Wow this is a really good product!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give you a nice clean shave at all.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have this come with a box that held the parts cleanly and neatly on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice product, very versatile , great price quick shipping</li>
            <li>I love that i can use this in the shower, makes grooming more easy.</li>
            <li>Shaving on the neck is an issue if you like a very clean shave.</li>
            <li>But in my opinion it&#x27;s pretty dang good.</li>
            <li>The battery charge holds up pretty good.</li>
            <li>but for a first purchase and for a lite user this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In conclusion, if you&#x27;re in the market for a shaver, a beard trimmer, and a body trimmer, the Philips Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit is a pretty good value over purchasing three separate devices.</li>

            <li>is the kind of trimmer I am exactly looking for...!</li>
            <li>The overall build quality is very good.</li>
            <li>I have had very good luck with Norelco razors over the years, and I suspect this one will provide the same quality.</li>
            <li>This is a very cool concept.</li>
            <li>Being able to use in the shower is huge bonus.</li>
            <li>The most important is that after using it you won&#x27;t feel any pain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, gives me a pretty smooth shave, and has good battery life and features.</li>
            <li>was (as and couple can attest to) becoming an issue around the sink area.  </li>
            <li>Great price and arrived early.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was impressed by the stubble trimmer&#x27;s adjustments (it clicks back and forth to adjust maybe 1/4 inch) and the body hair trimmer is probably the most useful attachment for</li>
            <li>Maybe I didn&#x27;t make sure it was securely on.</li>
            <li>It helps me keep my nape hair free and being able to use it w/ shaving cream is a BONUS.</li>
            <li>My 16 yr old son is so happy with it.</li>
            <li>Because there are optional heads available, my wife has relegated to using on of the heads to shave her lovely legs.</li>
            <li>, the shipment was fast, I received just in a while, price was good</li>
            <li>it does takes time to get a good shave, might as well do the real shave/razor.</li>
            <li>Its a nice useful trimmer and multi-purpose.</li>
            <li>It is a good value though and very flexible.  </li>
            <li>Without a good groomer I kinda let it go, and didn&#x27;t manscape as much.  </li>
            <li>in all an excellent product, very pleased with it and haven&#x27;t complained once since I got it.</li>
            <li>All in all an excellent product, very pleased with it and haven&#x27;t complained once since I got it.</li>
            <li>A good choice  for the person that wants or needs to be well groomed.</li>
            <li>Very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li>The finish is a bit cheap, and I don&#x27;t think the attachments are super nice.</li>
            <li>this is my favorite shaving machine,my first one  lasted almost 2 years and it worked great, this is my second one and this one is as perfect as the old one ...</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and recommend it.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s also easy to accidentally press the power button on this model when traveling) .</li>
            <li>The adjustments are easy to make, and the combs work well, too.</li>
            <li>interchangeable heads, close shave, battery indicator, easy to clean&lt;br</li>
            <li>my old Norelco did, leaving my cheeks smooth and feeling great after a bit of moisturizing after shave.  </li>
            <li>The heads are so easy to change.</li>
            <li>it was an easy decision to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The heads of the razor are easy to switch.  </li>
            <li>easy to change attachments</li>
            <li>heads are easily adjustable and well-made</li>
            <li>Easy to carry as well.</li>
            <li>Note: At the shortest length as well as with the comb removed, the blade is quite close to the skin, making it relatively easy to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Since this is more of an entry-level product it uses a NiMH battery instead of a more powerful lithium-ion battery.</li>
            <li>Since this is more of an entry-level product it uses a NiMH battery instead of a more powerful lithium-ion battery.</li>
            <li>Works great, just like it does in the comercials also cheaper than at most retail stores that sell same product</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning it is also really easy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this razor to any one who likes easy shaving.</li>
            <li>The battery life also seems to be pretty good, and quick to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I have only had this new shaver for about two weeks, I have to say I&#x27;m impressed, price value was really good and was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Bottom line is that the concept and shaving/trimming performance are great, but the materials used in the drive train for the face shaver are not very durable and should be able to stand up better, even if there is user error.</li>
            <li>The addition of a comb on this attachment was great because I could still choose to trim or go bare and still get the safety benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First electric razor I&#x27;ve really liked.</li>
            <li>and it could stay more than a month on one full charge.</li>
            <li>This is, hands down, the best razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>This shaver cuts fine</li>
            <li>Everything is fine</li>
            <li>but in the end everything was fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve probably tried half a dozen products over the years, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and changes heads and cleans easily.</li>
            <li>Smooth, easy, and convenient.</li>
            <li>but it woks fine.</li>
            <li>No issues there at all.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life on it has been more then adequate as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten it to work more then 10 minutes if I&#x27;m lucky.</li>
            <li>of the features are great, you can even touch up your hair with the clippers attachment, which was great for the military high fade</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor but it does a great job as a trimmer with multiple length settings, more than adequate adjustment and easily trims side burns as well.</li>
            <li>I bought this product earlier in the month and it worked great at first, all the attachments worked perfectly but then suddenly the bodyfoil attachment started to act up...</li>
            <li>the best is the charge it states that it will run for a 40 min shave, but I found that I used it for 10 days a little each day and it still didn&#x27;t need a charge</li>
            <li>Just wish the razor cut my face a little closer but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with this product and vendor, highly recommend</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not that accurate.</li>
            <li>Clean shaves easy and smooth.</li>
            <li>I would consider this for a great space saving appliance for traveling, or for use as a primary trimmer and back up shaver at home.</li>
            <li>my kindle has been great and the game looks great on it.</li>
            <li>The attachments have also been a huge plus.</li>
            <li>The whole thing just has a nice feel to it.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a comfortable shaver to hold and use.</li>
            <li>but still provides a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>The motor doesn&#x27;t sound like buzzzz but</li>
            <li>no complants and the different heads are great to</li>
            <li>Leaves a smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li>A few weeks in, and everything fits perfectly still.</li>
            <li>We are happy with each of the different performances and options, and they all get used.</li>
            <li>great overall product except the 2 cut shaver piece</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, store, and recharge.  </li>
            <li>The razor is light in the hand and its contours provide comfortable holding.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bodygroom shaver/trimmer uses rounded combs and tips to prevent skin irritation, and supposedly provide reliably smooth grooming anywhere below the neckline.  </li>
            <li>If you have course facial hair and are looking for a great shave, the Philips Norelco YS524 will probably disappoint.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The bodygroom shaver/trimmer uses rounded combs and tips to prevent skin irritation, and supposedly provide reliably smooth grooming anywhere below the neckline.  </li>
            <li>If you have course facial hair and are looking for a great shave, the Philips Norelco YS524 will probably disappoint.  </li>
            <li>Never misses a hair, and no hair falls out, everything is caught inside the head for easy clean up.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li>I bought this unit for one reason, I wanted to enjoy shaving with Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D, without having to shell out $150.00+ to get one.</li>
            <li>i had heard that when using body groom it runs out of charge really soon, but though i&#x27;m way to hairy, it works really nice</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beard styler works great for me as I keep short stubble beard.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>but it feels really cheap.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to clean with a water rinse&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li>He starts to enjoy</li>
            <li>this is a free voltage product, so no problem with additional buying of the adapter.&lt;br /&gt;(In</li>
            <li>Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>Shaving with the two rotary heads takes longer than shaving with a razor with three rotary heads, an important factor when I am trying to get to work on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will say the trimmer did not seem to work so well on the back of my neck but was great for my face.</li>
            <li>Light weights and</li>
            <li>tried it on, and it feels smooth while shaving, so if I had not opened it up and had to see what the head looks like, my comments would have been</li>
            <li>Easy to clean</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and wash the device.</li>
            <li>This razor works great with the face attachment, even though it only has two heads.</li>
            <li>that means that my dollars are subsidizing their free stuff.</li>
            <li>They ought to replace it for free</li>
            <li>i dont need to use soap or water pain free and even tickles kinda.</li>
            <li>I bought this primarily as a trimmer but have started to utilize the shaver too.  </li>
            <li>Light weight and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>but if you keep it relatively short this is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s blades are really smooth without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li>At that time there weren&#x27;t even cordless razors available.  </li>
            <li>So, overall, these are great razors, but I have had this battery problem so often with them, I cannot recommend them without a warning about the battery life.  </li>
            <li>Got the face baby smooth.</li>
            <li>i have never gotten a orange battery light.</li>
            <li>This one feels so light and is so ergonomical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The face shave is great, however, since i have coarse hair on my  neck, I can&#x27;t get as a close shave as on my face.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and waterproof.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would recommend this as a supplement, not a replacement, for your primary shaver.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Battery life is fantastic.</li>
            <li>very convenient to use in shower, trims and shaves nicely.  </li>
            <li>so I tend to just use a cheap Remington trimmer without the comb.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>Bought this item as a birthday gift for my husband two weeks ago, and he loves it.so far so good.</li>
            <li>Does not shave as good as my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>The facial shaver is the best part of it, the rest of the attachments don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer works very well and the adjustments allow for a great trim of any reasonable beard.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>so far i loved.</li>
            <li>it works smooth and nice, but opening up, makes me realized the quality of the blade attachement was very poor.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My $20 cheap shaver thats made in China is more useful...</li>
            <li>i was surprised something this reasonaby priced would work so good.</li>
            <li>Nothing more to really say here, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use this on body hair because the battery died (more on that</li>
            <li>He said its not bad, pretty handy too.</li>
            <li>I like remington 3 head cut better, however the other attachments are great.</li>
            <li>It is very useful.</li>
            <li>and he says it is very useful and works well.</li>
            <li>so it is very useful for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shaving in the shower with water or cream is smooth and leaves me feeling clean and smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li>The trimmer attachment on the razor is more like an electric sheep sheer, which is great, because I can get pretty</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad the have this one since it&#x27;s cordless and more versatile, but I feel like $60 might be a bit high.</li>
            <li>extremely functional.many options everything they promise and more and a very good first electric shaver, body groom and trimmer .</li>
            <li>it is an excellent razor that allows to make several styles without difficulty, the three heads are easily interchangeable and durable, my old razor phillips 105 work by 15 years.</li>
            <li>Super easy to return.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to change the shaver heads</li>
            <li>Very powerful razor, even though I had a light rash for 3 days my skin quickly adapted and now it&#x27;s a smooth shave everytime.  </li>
            <li>The razor&#x27;s different attachments are very nice and quick to change, it has great battery life from very first charge, easy to clean and overall</li>
            <li>Click &amp; Style got pretty good reviews and was available at a decent price</li>
            <li>Amazon didnt send me one, or an invoice, or anything, except my original order number which Philips wont accept.</li>
            <li>And the three tasks it does makes it a unique device</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t try body groomer or original 2 head shaver that came with it</li>
            <li>it works fine and quick</li>
            <li>Pretty fantastic shaver!</li>
            <li>I was hoping to use it to trim my neck under the beard, but it seems more interested in pulling my neck hairs than shaving.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased this razor to use for trimming body hair.  </li>
            <li>Battery charge lasts a long time, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy one of these for body grooming, although for shaving I would buy a dedicated shaver (but this does the trick, maybe great for a trip bag).</li>
            <li>Crisp and clean shave :)</li>
            <li>The Braun I had doesn&#x27;t shave that great, but the battery is strong and willing after several years.  </li>
            <li>My dedicated beard trimmer (also a Norelco) has a trimmer attachment with very fine (close together) blades, that produces a much neater edge to my goatee than the  Click &amp; Style trimmer does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this very complete&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, I needed like a bear:, D thanks..... . . .</li>
            <li>Shave is good but have not been able to understand the instructions for how to use the other attachments available.</li>
            <li>I also own a beard/mustache trimming set, and I thought this one new unit could replace them both.  </li>
            <li>knew it doesn&#x27;t come with one and thought I can live with it, but will have to make my own using Spiderpodium and some sugru maybe.</li>
            <li>My head is clean shaved and</li>
            <li>Love to shave, trim and groom a nice beard, goatee or short boxed look.</li>
            <li>It is really about as close as the blade and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>He spend couple days searching and comparing different brands - this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>clean shaves and trims.</li>
            <li>He gets a close clean shave with it.</li>
            <li>i had a triple head prior that liked more</li>
            <li>so i really like that works great leaves skin soft</li>
            <li>Need to keep it clean, though</li>
            <li>he does keep it clean</li>
            <li>Also, I like how you can take the attachment and run it with water to keep the heads clean.</li>
            <li>I assume most shavers are like this because it really can&#x27;t get as close or smoothly of a shave as my razor does.</li>
            <li>I own several of Norelco shavers and all of them seem of better quality, specially the heads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Ordering was easy, delivery right on time and pricing was value added.</li>
            <li>heads are easy to switch out, and each of them work very well and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li>We are very happy with the purchase, and it is easy to use for me as a partner carefully following the back of the neck and for him as a years-long trimmer.</li>
            <li>Sometimes there are coupons or special deals on this product where you can get almost up to 20 dollars off.</li>
            <li>But you will actually need shaving foam for a good clean shave from this electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my son but he told me he liked it very much and use it for the whole body.  </li>
            <li>I have an older philips and it was broken, this one is more safe, confortable and makes a perfect shave.</li>
            <li>Great price for the money spent.</li>
            <li>I have gone through many trimmers and this is by far the most versatile, powerful, and reliable.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning the nozzle heads is easy as well just rinse out with steaming hot water and the blades will be clean of any hair.</li>
            <li>Had to literally hold the thing to my skin for a good minute before it actually cleaned the stubble off my face.</li>
            <li>I don’t think the face shaving attachment can articulate enough to provide a good close shave on a head.</li>
            <li>Overall battery life is good.</li>
            <li>but I decided to give it some more time because of that whole &amp;#34;adjust to your face&amp;#34; thing that razor companies claim.</li>
            <li>So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So</li>
            <li>This thing works for over 40min on a full charge.</li>
            <li>Returned for a full refund.</li>
            <li>the good thing: I find myself preferring the 2 rotary head shavers over the 3 rotary head shavers as they allow extra flexibility around the nose, neck and close to the ears.</li>
            <li>Has all the attractments and adjustable length is cool</li>
            <li>I bought this as a x-mas present, he loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>light, worth</li>
            <li>I do wish RQ12 came with plastic cover as it does in a full kit, replacement head does not come with one :o(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I liked that my old Remington would work when plugged in or when just on batteries.  </li>
            <li>The razor is definitely portable, so whether you are at home on the couch, or on the road, you can take this with you and have just as good of a shave no matter where you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean and quick shave.</li>
            <li>The body trimer is good for shaving and trimming the neck and the two head shaver works as well as the three head just a smaller area.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer a shaver with three rotary heads since the three heads will make the shaving process quicker as it covers more skin surface.</li>
            <li>after that the battery would die with in minutes or even seconds with a full charge.  </li>
            <li>For different uses / all in one this is a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought because it has such good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I gave it a full day to charge.  </li>
            <li>and it will run for 15min and die without notice and on a full charge.</li>
            <li>Electric shavers do not irritate my skin as much, but I had never been satisfied with the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li>But because it is more of an entry-level product it doesn&#x27;t really EXCEL at any of these functions.</li>
            <li>But because it is more of an entry-level product it doesn&#x27;t really EXCEL at any of these functions.</li>
            <li>35 minutes for an &#x27;almost&#x27; smooth shave when all i had on my face was a days worth of stubble is just unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It will also travel better and it cut out the need to take as much on trips since it can do it all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thus far, I love the sleekness and the simplicity and unless a problem develops later on, am happy with this style shaver</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for, fair price, great attachments, close shave wet or dry, amazing charge time (only once a week)</li>
            <li>Attachments click in solidly and are nicely stable, and remove easily.</li>
            <li>but it does leave u smooth to the touch I&#x27;d done right.</li>
            <li>The standard against which a multiple use product like this is to be measured is NOT whether it is the best performing product at each task, but rather whether it performs well enough to replace two or more items in your bathroom or more importantly in your carry on luggage.  </li>
            <li>to be a pretty sturdy plastic and tips click on and off easily .&lt;br</li>
            <li>The double-head isnt great, but per one of the other reviews I purchased an RQ12 head (the SensoTouch 3D head)</li>
            <li>The styler works perfectly for trimming my beard, though be warned that the guard does not extend out as far as most dedicated beard trimmers (I usually use the maximum setting, unless I&#x27;ve just had a haircut).  </li>
            <li>so I can say nothing, other than if it works like the rest of this razor it will be great too.</li>
            <li>The other attachments are great uses.</li>
            <li>On the first week of use, they are fine, and then decline rapidly.  </li>
            <li>I find that the shaving unit does not do an adequate job-</li>
            <li>but it has quickly lost it’s battery life and blade sharpness</li>
            <li>Either that or I am so used to getting a super close shave with my Headblade that nothing compares.</li>
            <li>My nephew is in the Army so he is always in need do a quick shave.</li>
            <li>Most of the time the shave is smooth, but once in a while the razor seems to irritate my skin around my neck and has even made me bleed; this may just be operator error or my already sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>That being said this razor does cut close, and even better, with the additional heads/attachments that are included, you are able to keep the rest of your bodily areas under control</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s pleased with it and raves that its much better than a standard razor.</li>
            <li>The shaver proved adequate, but just.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The body and beard trimmers are super.</li>
            <li>so if you are a super hairy guy then don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li>in all I would say that this grooming toolkit is decent, but would recommend something else if you can find one that is better reviewed.</li>
            <li>Overall it has been and excellent daily shaver.</li>
            <li>AMA was very nice sending stuff back thanks</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, while this unit is very pretty (even the packaging was shiny and high-tech looking) and it works</li>
            <li>Since growing a beard for the first time 8 or so years ago, I have missed how smooth my cheeks would get using my Norelco three-head shaver.  </li>
            <li>The shaver/kit is pretty light, so its convenient to travel with.  </li>
            <li>This is the very first electric shaver I have ever bought</li>
            <li>that was offered on their very first model.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used electric razors before that gave me a closer shave, and with no irritation, on the very first use.</li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased at the clean cut and ease of use.</li>
            <li>I already have an electric razor that I&#x27;m happy with (another, older Norelco model), so I was really only looking at this for the beard trim stuff.  </li>
            <li>The older models were much more powerful.</li>
            <li>and I think he is enjoying playing with this on his new beard.</li>
            <li>Overall though, I liked being able to get a decent shave on my stomach without irritation, which is otherwise prone to ingrown hairs when using a razor blade.</li>
            <li>I used it on my legs armpits and anywhere else i need it its fast and easy</li>
            <li>Delivery very quick and much cheaper than buying in uk.</li>
            <li>It is an unusual shape for an electric razor but it works well and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more versatile and pretty much the coolest thing out there to take care of all the hair you want trimmed.</li>
            <li>Although I was a bit uncertain of how it will work, I was amazed at how easy and fast it is.  </li>
            <li>I have finally found a Electric Shave that actually works and gives me a GREAT close clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>This is his first shaver/trimmer and he LOVES IT!</li>
            <li>I bought this recently because my dermatologist found my use of a manual razor was causing ingrown hairs to form under my chin, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>This is my first Electric Shaver!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t use to trim fine points very well at all.</li>
            <li>The motor is great on this little thing.</li>
            <li>The body groomer is awesome and you can use it in very delicate regions if you get my drift.</li>
            <li>However, all my complaints with the trimmer really stem from that cheap plastic head.    </li>
            <li>dual round shaving head does a great job on my neck.</li>
            <li>The body trimmer adapter works well without much hair pulling and is a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>While shaving you would enjoy a tickle feeling, but it really not is, but feels amazing.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer provides me with a  far better shave then the Remington ever did.</li>
            <li>It is worth it to have the different options, and it is so nice to have an affordable way to use all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I always liked them (bought two of the same model)</li>
            <li>I checked out the Philips Norelco YS524 and found it to be equally useful.</li>
            <li>The Norelco’s rotary heads give me a worry free shave and safely shave the back of my neck and also my arm pits.</li>
            <li>My only suggestion would be to have some kind of case to store it in when not in use.</li>
            <li>nice extra heads are</li>
            <li>This unit doesn&#x27;t shave as efficiently as the old one, but as I can run it over my face for 5 minutes or more without the slightest burning sensation that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li>Does a great job below the belt as well, with absolute minimal pulling or irritation.  </li>
            <li>I would buy the 52 pack of Gillett disposables and milk them for all they where worth (the downgrade them to my wife for her legs).  </li>
            <li>Just great lots better thin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Its more like a toy, maybe something an 11 year old could play with to feel adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old Philips Norelco with three heads shaves better than this.</li>
            <li>like the beard trimmer, and have used it by far the most with and without the attachment.</li>
            <li>I liked the idea of the universal heads on the device.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>over all worth the investment, and with the interchangeable heads</li>
            <li>Works better than his old one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems that the body groomer uses the most power.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even that old &amp; hairy</li>
            <li>As it has all kinds of blade you need, it&#x27;s really useful</li>
            <li>For the price this is really worth it.</li>
            <li>shaver is worth.</li>
            <li>The commercial and website are a complete lie from what I experienced.</li>
            <li>Really worth the money</li>
            <li>The motor simply isn&#x27;t as powerful as higher-end models, and the price reflects that.</li>
            <li>Its not as good as I expected it.</li>
            <li>I have always used regular razors but thought I would try this out to see if I liked using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I liked that it has multiple attachments and is rechargeable,</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, battery lasts long, and easy to switch parts out.</li>
            <li>I paid a little more than i normally do for these things because I don&#x27;t use electrical shavers but this is a good way to ease your way into one if you have ever considered it.  </li>
            <li>While charging it for a few minutes I noticed the handle got very warm</li>
            <li>The battery power seems to be more than enough to trim both my arms and chest and still get a shave in which has been a challenge for my past trimmers and none of them offered a very good</li>
            <li>All three attach easily by snapping on and can similar detach easily by pulling off.</li>
            <li>Have tried other razors but have not had good resluts</li>
            <li>For some reason when groomer head is attached, shaver power drops and than it just dies w/o Battery warning but then if you replace with the other heads item work good.</li>
            <li>The three heads really help the user get the look they want no matter how unique.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on reviews here I opted to get RQ12 head right away</li>
            <li>And the price is right.</li>
            <li>all right</li>
            <li>maybe i wasn&#x27;t using it right</li>
            <li>The rest of the attachments seem to be all right.  </li>
            <li>The rest of the attachments seem to be all right.  </li>
            <li>just right, as when I hold the razor upright</li>
            <li>another go figuring I just wasn&#x27;t using it right.</li>
            <li>its own this thing is a nice little body groomer, lots of nice little attachments, but when you combine it with a RQ12 shaver head</li>
            <li>You might be able to do that with a normal razor and trimmer, but it really makes it a lot easier.</li>
            <li>Run time overall was satisfactory, as I was able to get about three full shaves on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Run time overall was satisfactory, as I was able to get about three full shaves on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So far he is pleased with it but has learned from the first time he used it to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It is very easy use overall.</li>
            <li>I havent used other electric razors for body shaving, but does not get a smooth shaves and its average at best.</li>
            <li>really enjoy the multiple heads that make it insanely easy to change between close shave, beard trim, chop sideburns.</li>
            <li>I dry shave mostly or after shower with drop of lotion to smooth.</li>
            <li>I chose this rating because my son told me it performed just as he had expected He was very pleased</li>
            <li>I was given a Braun top of the line foil razor several years ago, and it was OK, but I would take out my cheap old corded (very old)</li>
            <li>I have found that I can never get a full clean shave with it and still have to keep my traditional hand razor to clean up remaining hairs that it misses or to hit my sideburns or the sides of my goatee.</li>
            <li>My advice would be spend a little more money and get a better razor without all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li>He likes the fact that he is able to use shaving gels and other products with it, &amp; loves the fact that it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>had a full beard when I got it, so the grooming tool came in very handy for getting my whiskers down to a reasonable length for the two-head shaver, which did a decent job of completing the job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I contacted Norelco, I was told that because the product was so new, they didn&#x27;t have any parts available.</li>
            <li>Hesitated at first with the quality of this product and my hunch was right.</li>
            <li>It mounts in an odd angle/position and I can&#x27;t find a really comfortable grip to use this easily and comfortably.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great shaver at a low price.</li>
            <li>I prefer a slightly scruffy look so a good clipper designed for the face is something I keep my eye out for.</li>
            <li>It never did nearly as good a job as my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li>My teen using it in the showers, great for facial hear as well as for body grooming.</li>
            <li>The shaver is very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy clean up &amp; solid grip.</li>
            <li>those parts of your face not covered by your beard or mustache, it is quite adequate, while for shaving your whole face, it gets the job done</li>
            <li>and I am good to go in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>The quick switching heads are very convenient.</li>
            <li>Working very well very useful thanks</li>
            <li>Have not tried in the shower yet, as I usually need the mirror to trim my beard properly, but being able to rinse out everything is great.</li>
            <li>Its a good Idea to keep your normal razor around, at least for the sideburns if you don&#x27;t feel confident using a circle to cut a square sideburn.</li>
            <li>All pieces are easy to clean: just run under hot water and use the provided brush as necessary to get all the excess hair out.</li>
            <li>Tough your face needs some time to get use to the product, once it does is very good.</li>
            <li>I just puff my cheeks press it very gently to my face</li>
            <li>Unlike my beard, my body hair is soft and fine.  </li>
            <li>Unlike my beard, my body hair is soft and fine.  </li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t had any other electric razors to compare battery life to, but this one rarely gives me this kind of issue.</li>
            <li>The little panel notifying you of it charging, or needing charge is well placed, and bright.</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my husband and it pretty much doing its job!</li>
            <li>This is his first electric</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, so when I am trimming my hair though, a ton of s</li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver in over 30 years.  </li>
            <li>This Norelco Click and Style is the first electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>have made it the first trimmer I have ever owned</li>
            <li>On every shave, I need to shave the same area for more than 3 times before I can get all hair removed.</li>
            <li>also I&#x27;ve been a norelco user since they came out with the first body groomer.  </li>
            <li>for the price you can&#x27;t go wroung even if its a first time trimmer.</li>
            <li>Seeing as how this is a known defect and Norelco hasn&#x27;t sent a recall, I give this thing 1 star for only being able to do 2/3 of what it&#x27;s advertised to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the interchangeable heads for different parts of the body.</li>
            <li>Works great bought for boyfriend for Xmas and said it works well with triming and cuts threw thick beard when you let it grow out.</li>
            <li>It is exactly the razor that my husband wanted</li>
            <li>Said it was exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li>First - why is this not a 5 start item?</li>
            <li>We finally settled on this, after reading many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, it sounded underpowered, like the difference between an electric lawn trimmer and a gas-powered one.  </li>
            <li>I found mine for 50, and on day one at least, consider it a great buy.</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off I got this because it can be used in the shower</li>
            <li>I can shave faster and better with a regular razor with shaving cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Here&#x27;s what I think: compared to the Sensotouch 3D and Hyper, the Click &amp; Style is a slower shave, with a smaller compartment for shaved hair, but it&#x27;s vastly better at maintaining beards and shaving body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first charge too, so the battery life seems excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first tried to use it in the shower with my face wash as &amp;#34;shaving cream&amp;#34; but soon realized I could not see what I was doing.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>The razor also is safe to use in the shower, and the battery is rated to last 40 minutes between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does not shave as close as my regular electric/ rechargeable razor, but for throwing it in your over night bag, it seems to work OK.</li>
            <li>I feel OK, just from the United States to buy Chinese products are cheaper than China</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the battery losing juice</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, of its three components, the groomer and trimmer options tied for first place in functionality.</li>
            <li>body shaver and trimmer shaved close to the skin and was able to maintain that closeness over curvatures of chest, stomach and back.</li>
            <li>Pry open your wallet and buy something better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Attractive design most likely inspired by Star Trek&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li>But, it did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li>This is the fist time I&#x27;ve ever bought an electric shaver, but I definitely like it more than shaving with razors.</li>
            <li>well he is not wrong.  </li>
            <li>so hopefully it will get better later on.</li>
            <li>Would give it more than 5 stars if possible.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK for shaving your face, but if you have any facial hair you DON&amp;#34;t want this razor.  </li>
            <li>have to admit this is my first electric shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i have more of a baby face and tend to only need to shave maybe</li>
            <li>I really reccomend it ti everyone!</li>
            <li>For the first time in my experience with a Norelco, it was the quality.  </li>
            <li>I Have to say that this is my first elcetric shaver</li>
            <li>Nothing about the performance of this trimmer&#x27;s shaver head has changed my mind, and for shaving the entire face it is clearly inferior to any of their more advanced triple headed shavers.  </li>
            <li>The NiMH battery in it charges in a couple of hours and doesn&#x27;t have the slow-drain problems of early (or cheap) NiMH</li>
            <li>It takes a lot longer to shave with this version as you have to cover the same ground more than once.</li>
            <li>was my first ever electric razor to buy, but not the first one to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many of my friends electric razors and many of them seemed to be a poor fit for me.</li>
            <li>my first electric razor</li>
            <li>Finally, I&#x27;ve used the bodygroom attachment to shave below the belt for a while now, and it&#x27;s mostly painless if you&#x27;re careful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first shaver/body groomer but not my first beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I had to go over the same area many times because the hairs just didn&#x27;t catch on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would most definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>First off I have to say I like this razor.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer with guard works pretty well.</li>
            <li>not the best strictly as a razor, but it will get you by on weekends or casual days.</li>
            <li>I primarily use mine as a quick trimmer and travel shaver; So my use is not daily.  </li>
            <li>was most excited about this attachment, and this was ultimately the reason why I wanted to branch out from just my old Remington beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>However the other attachments are handy.</li>
            <li>you can live without the charging cradle from the more expensive models, then this is a great buy.</li>
            <li>Use it for so many shaving needs, and no matter where I use it, it works great with no pinch or cutting</li>
            <li>Razor head works fine; the beard trimmer also works fine, except that the comb/collar is far too short.</li>
            <li>I also liked the idea of the different attachments that it offers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are a couple redeeming qualities that I will mention: The battery life does seem pretty long - I haven&#x27;t drained it yet.</li>
            <li>Today more pieces broke off and the attachment just fell apart completely and can&#x27;t be fixed.  </li>
            <li>Still shaves OK, but much more slowly.  </li>
            <li>came across this Click and Style and noticed the reviews were positive on it</li>
            <li>five - if I want a really close shave, my Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor and hot lather from a shaving mug can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>Love it this shaver gave me bumps first time but that was expected cause its my first shaver</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco electric razors for a long time, and usually am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The whole system is pretty well made.</li>
            <li>minor quibble - as many heads and accessories as this has (shaver, three heads, plastic cover, ac adapter, brush)</li>
            <li>The engine doesn&#x27;t sound smooth compared with my other shaver.</li>
            <li>No hair pulling, the rotary shaver works like any blade razor, the other shaver works wonders for the nether regions (no hair pulling, very close shave) and the beard trimmer has excellent length settings, plus everything is waterproof, so all the mess stays in the shower.</li>
            <li>okay, it falls short when compared to the older model I was trying to replace.  </li>
            <li>Fairly quick, complete charge.</li>
            <li>has only 2 drawbacks for me, corded use is unsupported and the battery indicator is so easy to miss when its flashing &amp;#</li>
            <li>The different components snap on and off easily and all worked as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to change the different tops.  </li>
            <li>Really easy to change to different heads.</li>
            <li>The heads pop off easy and I like that the trimmer can be placed on either direction giving you a different angle of attack.</li>
            <li>NOT as easy as the commercial.</li>
            <li>The charge on the battery last a good long while too.</li>
            <li>year later: after owning this razor for over a year, all of its parts seem to be functional and still going strong.</li>
            <li>I would venture to guess, however, that that is because it has a real, powerful motor at work inside it, again, very unlike these cheaply made devices that just buzz a little and struggle to cut through your beard/stubble as you shave/trim it.  </li>
            <li>Certain areas of my face would turn inflamed and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li>This is a great razor wet or dry</li>
            <li>The only downside is that you really can&#x27;t do fine shaping, like trim the edge of a sideburn, with the circular blades.  </li>
            <li>Accepted it since inner package is sealed and fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall this product is great as long as you want the 5 O&#x27;clock shadow with sharp lines for your goatee/side burns.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even easy to trim just enough for a constant 5 o clock shadow look I much enjoy.</li>
            <li>Simple, quick, versatile, and no ripping hairs out of my face!</li>
            <li>The length lock is mechanical and seems pretty steady; it never \\&quot;slipped\\&quot; on me.  </li>
            <li>First or second time I tried to clean the beard trimming attachment</li>
            <li>have used this unit for beard trimming primarily, but also trim other parts of my body like my chest, and down below which this is REALLY good for in my opinion.</li>
            <li>An easy fix to that would be to have both ends of the comb be more open, allowing hair to be combed through one side and fall out the other.</li>
            <li>Have only tried the body hair attachment, but given my previous lack of success with other products, this is already the best in its category.</li>
            <li>only had it for a few weeks and it cuts great</li>
            <li>Big hassle, and a huge head-ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Big hassle, and a huge head-ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very versitile.  </li>
            <li>*** will get caught up in the comb really fast.</li>
            <li>It trims my beard at a very even length.</li>
            <li>Trimmer attachment works very well, and rounded tips  </li>
            <li>And it charged in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Very affordable.</li>
            <li>very short.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He has a relatively light beard, and an occasional goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to go over my face several times to be sure I&#x27;m shaving all the stubble, and no matter how many times I do that, I always end up missing</li>
            <li>The directions say &amp;#34;Do not use while plugged in,&amp;#34; but they do not mention that the unit absolutely will not work when it is plugged in.  </li>
            <li>It works well and hasn&#x27;t really irritated my skin</li>
            <li>It feels very durable and is not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li>It grips very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This was a gift for someone and he always tells me how much he likes it.</li>
            <li>Very versatile, takes care of all the man-scaping of everything.</li>
            <li>you get a high quality shave at a bargain price!</li>
            <li>This item has a trimmer and was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Quiet, comfortable and flexible.</li>
            <li>Very versatile.  </li>
            <li>This product is lightweight and does not take up too much room.  </li>
            <li>This shaver works very well as promised.  </li>
            <li>i thought thanks</li>
            <li>Arrived fast, works prefect</li>
            <li>shaver works better than i expected all i do is run it under water</li>
            <li>Fast charge, and 1 to 2 weeks between charges.</li>
            <li>Closest shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric shaver at a very affordable cost</li>
            <li>but it appears one of them keeps the top of the trimer closed</li>
            <li>I personally do not like to buy this because looking through the reviews I see a lot of people got it for free (viners).  </li>
            <li>so I could continue to use it--just had to be more careful when cleaning it after that.  </li>
            <li>He said it works very well.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it was so fast</li>
            <li>But the thing that really bugged me is that this shaver doesn&#x27;t have a pop-up trimmer which I use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>Bought as a gift and the recipient really likes it.</li>
            <li>Gives a close shave especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This prutuct works really well</li>
            <li>and I really like how you can just rinse it off after you finish shaving.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping works well and</li>
            <li>I really appreciate the stamina of battery.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>and he really enjoys using it.  </li>
            <li>I had to move the whole shaver about to follow the contours of my face, instead of the heads flexing to follow the curves.</li>
            <li>es, that produces a much neater edge to my goatee than the  Click &amp; Style trimmer does.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so my face wouldn&#x27;t burn so much after the shave.</li>
            <li>It gives a great close shave, and if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t shave on a daily basis, the battery charge will last you at least a month or more.</li>
            <li>Phillips norelco should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li>No hair pulling and very even shave.</li>
            <li>The attachments make it very versatile.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The attachments don&#x27;t do much to salvage the purchase, either.</li>
            <li>Very reliable.  </li>
            <li>I know some people said that the trimmer did not adjust that much</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this product, but</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that it comes with a body hair trimmer as well.</li>
            <li>What I did want from the Norelco was a fast shave that would be passable in case I was in a hurry and needed to look professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if this is because im not used to electric shavers, but this really took me a while.</li>
            <li>It seems like this attachment really drains the juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like this attachment really drains the juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quality-wise, this device is really just a very flimsy, cheaply made personal groomer/trimmer.  </li>
            <li>As a body hair trimmer, it works very well.</li>
            <li>really lives up to the name</li>
            <li>Every attachment works really well.  </li>
            <li>: You really gotta spend some money in order to keep this going.</li>
            <li>I have a full beard and the trimmer/groomer element works better than any I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li>love the extra attachments, makes it the complete styling kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find the Norelco foils more irritating then the Braun or Panasonic style, but I also find they work better on longer hairs.  </li>
            <li>And there is a danger this will dissuade some men from having a beard as many of them will be trimmed to a length far too short by this.</li>
            <li>The different attachments are nice so you can style and groom different parts of the body.</li>
            <li>unless I&#x27;ve gone too many days, then I first use the trimmer to cut it down before shaving.</li>
            <li>Having a small carrying pouch is nice because there are several parts that are easy to misplace.</li>
            <li>My hair is really not very thick or course</li>
            <li>Using this razor for basic trimming and a quick shave, while not expecting too much, is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>At first I was a tad dissappointed but quickly got over it as I realized it is actually easier to use this</li>
            <li>&quot; is pretty meh, not very good on its own.</li>
            <li>Its just great, I use it dry and it has never iritated my face skin (though I expected it!!)</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t run out of power during a shave, it just deteriorates quickly to the point where the blades are barely spinning.  </li>
            <li>am glad I chose this one over other products</li>
            <li>I love the other attachments though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to shave more often, due to my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It could be better, like the plastic head to the trimmer is ridiculously cheap, and with enough force I can push it down without using the lever.</li>
            <li>You can probably spend more for several different devices to do the individual jobs far better</li>
            <li>The comb settings lock into place and are stable during use and simply requires rinsing under water to clean.  </li>
            <li>The comb settings lock into place and are stable during use and simply requires rinsing under water to clean.  </li>
            <li>And then we have the trimmer, which is great if you haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days and your beard is too long to be shaved by these.</li>
            <li>I use this trimmer for my beard and mustache and occasionally to shave those areas of my face where I want a clean cut.  </li>
            <li>But this does well enough to clean up my Duck Dynasty look.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small in size and easy to clean the blades.</li>
            <li>But after a few days I got used to the shaver and was able to get a pretty close shave in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>You just pop the trimming clip off and clean underneath of it and pop it back on.</li>
            <li>I highly encourage this to any guy that wants power and portability!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very usefull and high quality item.</li>
            <li>This body groomer works very well and is high quality.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The shave head mounts in a more conventional position on the body and</li>
            <li>All I really wanted from Norelco here was less irritation and a more even trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn’t seem to take that long to charge (except for the first charge) and it has always been able to last me through both my beard and neck shaving and</li>
            <li>First off, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It comes with a full array of Tools, to shave, trim hair above and below the shoulders.</li>
            <li>Now, it only lasts about two minutes on a full charge.</li>
            <li>My facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow extremely quickly, but it is thicker than most other people in my age group, and if I let it be for a week and a half or so most of my face will get</li>
            <li>For me, the &amp;#34;circles&amp;#34; shavers seem to do a better job on those longer hairs down on my lower neck,</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get much better results, that you control, in half the time--They just wont look as cool next to the sink.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that when its low on power it still functions like its full of juice until the last second when it dies.</li>
            <li>I have some really stubborn spots down at my neck that even my razor can&#x27;t easily get where the Norelco really struggled.</li>
            <li>I really like this shaver and find it as easy to shave with as the 3 head, but since I have the other attachments</li>
            <li>It takes me less than a minute to fully run it across my face and get most of my hair shaved up.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that people thought it didn&#x27;t click on well, but I actually was really confident in clicking the different heads on, and off.</li>
            <li>And the length at which it does trim is a decent length.    </li>
            <li>The trimmer (not the foil thing) attachment is also decent.</li>
            <li>and it did a decent job.</li>
            <li>I guess I shave about two times a week for mainly stubble</li>
            <li>The main reason though was that I have a beard and the trimming</li>
            <li>My housemate has an older Norelco</li>
            <li>I will probably look to buy a better, more expensive unit.</li>
            <li>This one does better than others that I have bought for him in the past at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li>It gets decent reviews online</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly for the beard trimming feature but the body groomer works well too.</li>
            <li>you look at the more expensive one, each head has more holes in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;ve got decent peace of mind knowing that Philips Norelco give me a 3 Year Warranty just for registering the shaver online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent design</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit is a decent electric razor and groomer.</li>
            <li>Does not come close in quality to my older Norelco.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m going for a particular look or anything, but any shaving has always caused acne.</li>
            <li>First I must tell you that I have owned other electric shavers and have never gotten a close clean shave with one.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s great little shaver.</li>
            <li>my old razor died and this came along just at the right time so far its doing everything</li>
            <li>product says its good for wet/dry shave, but to my experience dry shave is not worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an awesome trimmer the only thing i would say is bad is the beard trimmer headed unit keeps popping the top piece off while im shaving only stays on with the attachment</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>but I guess but got it at a price which was a bit high by Amazon standards.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m mid-40&#x27;s and have not used an electric shaver since high school.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>id recommend this product highly to anyone looking for something that can trim those pesky hairs so you can look the way you want.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>YES YES I highly recommend this shaver to everyone.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I used to purchase philips norelco products, they are a high quality shavers.</li>
            <li>but after witnesing the highly offencive comercial for this product i refuse to use /</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it for electric shaver newbies like myself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RQ12 head it outstanding, smooth and very close shave on my neck without any irritation, its actually night and day compare to my old Nivea razor, but that also could be due to old head running close to 2 years old.</li>
            <li>and i really do get smooth shave like other reviews</li>
            <li>The shaver works fine for a two-head, but the trimmer (main reason for purchase) broke during first few uses.</li>
            <li>In any case you can use the longer combs from other current models, should you happen to own one, like for example the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The click and style is nice, but the only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the razor head for your face doesn&#x27;t get as close as my other Norelco razor.</li>
            <li>the longest selection leaves you with little more than 5 O&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li>but I was used to having a 3 headed razor which works a little better.</li>
            <li>The body groomer takes a little practice do be able to groom yourself without scratching yourself and pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this item a little more than a year ago and am reviewing it now once it has been used for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The first is that the handle is awkwardly large which makes it cumbersome to hold in all the positions you need to get a proper shave.</li>
            <li>is easy after that.trimmer is sharp and gaurd works well.</li>
            <li>I do prefer some of their other three-head shaver just for coverage, but it still trims hair easily and efficiently.</li>
            <li>So I trim my beard about once a week with this, and so far I haven&#x27;t really had any complaints on that end.</li>
            <li>However, it did do very well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It feels cheaply made, and today it stopped working (it seems to have gotten jammed.)  </li>
            <li>Start with the comb to trim dry and clean hair to a length of 1/8 in/3mm before grooming in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Start with the comb to trim dry and clean hair to a length of 1/8 in/3mm before grooming in the shower.  </li>
            <li>not quite as smooth as I expected..</li>
            <li>I use it to get a close shave near the straight edge of my side burns.</li>
            <li>, it totally surprised me and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>Seems to be working very well thus far.</li>
            <li>The third head, a foil head for body shaving, is something I don&#x27;t use, but I tried it out and not surprisingly it works best if you&#x27;ve already trimmed the long hairs, which you could do with the beard trimmer, and then use the body shaver for maintenance.</li>
            <li>Not even worth shipping it back.</li>
            <li>Love this, I use it everyday</li>
            <li>It might be from the hot water or from me simply not cleaning it as much as I should, but either way</li>
            <li>It might be from the hot water or from me simply not cleaning it as much as I should, but either way</li>
            <li>I am not a guy who trims bald down there, but nice and short</li>
            <li>I were to venture a guess, the other heads probably work just fine but will take some time for those with thicker beards.</li>
            <li>Shave was not near as smooth or comfortable as my previous Nerelco</li>
            <li>The body groomer is nice and helps trim but other than that this thing is for a 13 year old just starting out.</li>
            <li>You will be happy that you did not spend a small fortune on any other razor.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the two other heads do a fine job for light grooming and styling.  </li>
            <li>We used to use razors to do so, but they quickly got clogged, needed cleaning and thus took a long time.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sound like a damned vacuum, which is useful if you live with other people.</li>
            <li>It works pretty much the same wet or dry: I don&#x27;t really notice any better shave closeness.</li>
            <li>without the attachment, its work great for the most part, but leaves behind a few hair, here and there that I have to target individually with intent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If I get another 10+ years out of them (I seriously have only the vaguest of memories of purchasing them originally, it has been so long), then I will be in very good shape for a long time to come!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t pay out of pocket for things that other people get for free...</li>
            <li>it is smooth, it doesn&#x27;t prick, pull or even tingle like other groomers have.  </li>
            <li>Though I&#x27;d used Norelco shavers before, this new version caught my eyed on an Amazon ad</li>
            <li>but I can live without it.</li>
            <li>as it was a new one?</li>
            <li>i told myself i wanted a new cordless trimmer/shaver and did some research and came across this one.</li>
            <li>I will be sending it in for a new one.  </li>
            <li>You could also try the new [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Unit is sturdier and more solid than expected.</li>
            <li>Trimming body hair with this attachment was simple enough, and appeared smooth.  </li>
            <li>Trimming body hair with this attachment was simple enough, and appeared smooth.  </li>
            <li>old unit did a decent job of getting the hair, but it ripped my skin to Hell.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband as I thought he would enjoy the different attachments and he would be using it not only on his face but body as well.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, the traditional razor and shaving cream method of shaving irritates my skin and prevents me from shaving more than every 2nd or 3rd day.  </li>
            <li>As a habitually clean-shaven man, I might seem a poor choice to review such a product, but a fortuitously timed Great Recession has allowed me to grow a beard in order to fully test the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>much bigger problem IMHO, which cost this product a star in my review, was their redesign of the handle so that it cannot fit into the Back Shave Attachment that comes with their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The razor head does not cut good with thick facial hair week razor and takes forever.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very flexible in shaving any parts of the body needed and comes with easily detachable parts--such as a shaving attachment, a beard styler attachment, and a bodygroom attachment (just be careful and avoid excessive pressure when fitting them back</li>
            <li>I thought this product had a bit more duality with grooming, unless you consider super short and shaved good enough variety in trimming lengths you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li>He has very sensitive skin 0 and it doesn&#x27;t pull at his skin.</li>
            <li>The face shaver is really good, but it starts slowing down when you use the body groomer, it shuts itself down in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>The bear trimmer settings don&#x27;t go very long so you can&#x27;t maintain a long beard with this is better for stubble.</li>
            <li>After doing some research and due diligence I have learned some new things: You also have the ability to add some of the heads from the other Philips shavers, this is where it gets really interesting!</li>
            <li>Battery life is really good, I think I only charged it 5-7 times can&#x27;t tell exactly, but I mean it keeps charge for several usage.</li>
            <li>at first it seemed to work well enough.  </li>
            <li>Then i have to go back over with a straight razor to get anything missed!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for several years, and this was my first electric razor.</li>
            <li>When using shaving cream, it may be necessary to reapply cream to ensure a thorough and consistent shave.  </li>
            <li>Considering the attachments it comes with this is a pretty big bummer.</li>
            <li>Purchased it 2 months ago and exact same issue.  </li>
            <li>First, add a third rotary shaver head.</li>
            <li>He loves it so far!</li>
            <li>I kept the original blue plastic casing for this trimmer, and keep my attachments and trimmer in it when I travel and it has survived multiple trips in my checked in baggage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;d even be willing to buy the replacement if necessary.  </li>
            <li>Was happily surprised at how well it works!</li>
            <li>I want to replace the batteries, but they cost so much it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it, especially if they are of the same quality as the originals..  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll first mention that I basically use this as a trimmer on the shortest position so my review will only address the trimming head.</li>
            <li>If you grow your hair out, you&#x27;ll have to first use the trimmer with the grain to shorten it out, then go for a second pass in the manner you wish.</li>
            <li>I looked at the specs and noted that the shortest length cut was about 1mm, I would have preferred something a bit closer but it seemed like this was pretty universal</li>
            <li>Attempting to shave your neck and above your upper lip, as many have noted, is simply a lost cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>After waiting another 30 seconds I was able to hit the power button and it came roaring back to life, only to die again shortly after.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit provides a single solution to male grooming needs, as the three interchangeable attachments easily click on and off the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will still stay with my old Norelco and buy new heads for it.</li>
            <li>Should said always cold person be willing to assist you in regular shearings, the potential for peaceful compromise could be greatly increased.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t tell you precisely how long, because I have a beard and only trim the fuzz every once in a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never enjoyed an electric razor more than this one and my old one was a Norelco too.</li>
            <li>, I had to keep going over the same area to finally get a full shave.</li>
            <li>Both of the devices I&#x27;ve re-ordered may look a bit dated compared to these sleeker looking newer models, but are far more sturdy and functional that this particular device at least.</li>
            <li>in all it is great, the only down side is the screen protector that clips on the razor doesn&#x27;t stay on well and tends to fall off after a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Comparing</li>
            <li>Whether trimming a beard up, keeping it a certain length, dry or wet shaving completely smooth skin (all parts are completely waterproof and you can take it in the shower if you want)</li>
            <li>A beard is a new concept for me - my wife has never really liked that, but I tried it last summer, and she liked it, so I&#x27;ve kept it.  </li>
            <li>It is good for little touch up spots or doing a little manscaping.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a less than smooth face from regular razors but was pleasantly surprised to see that it gave me very close shaves.</li>
            <li>I would be inclined, however, to call this an \\&quot;entry-level\\&quot; product as the plastics and parts feel a little on the cheap side.</li>
            <li>The shaver gives me a clean shave whether my stubble is long or short.  </li>
            <li>Should said always cold person be willing to assist you in regular shearings, the potential for peaceful compromise could be greatly increased.he acreage and thickness of your backwoods, or the presence of a partner willing to help you clear the underbrush on a regular basis, this might not be an issue for you, in which case you can add that star back.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco did a pretty decent job here, and usually got shorter hairs in the first two passes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean and hasn&#x27;t randomly decided to stop working as of yet.</li>
            <li>It keeps a charge very well so far and is lightweight in comparison to my last electric razor/trimmer.</li>
            <li>I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by all 3 attachments:&lt;br /&gt;- shaver, on my skin, gives an equivalent shave to my Norelco 9170XL, albeit much slower with only 2 heads not</li>
            <li>So far I really like the Norelco, everything they said about the different pieces you can put on and</li>
            <li>At least make sure that you can replace the parts if not anything else.</li>
            <li>I got these to replace an old set that I had for years.</li>
            <li>My old razor was a Norelco triple head</li>
            <li>Bought this for my 17 year old son.  </li>
            <li>I shave my head completely as well as my face.</li>
            <li>Especially for those that want a multi-purpose shaving tool that does it all really well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to every body and the battery lasts pretty long</li>
            <li>both my 19 yr old son and husband have purchased.</li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t completely sold on the trimmer idea, hence I knew he wouldn&#x27;t buy one himself.</li>
            <li>At this point, I plan to keep using the old model until it completely dies and keep this one for traveling.</li>
            <li>It has no trouble shaving any of the described areas that I have tried it on.  </li>
            <li>The beard trimmer trims my goatee very well, but I still need to use a razor very briefly around it and my sideburns.</li>
            <li>B002P9BP3K straight razor]], although don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s practical for my daily shaving routine.  </li>
            <li>It feels light and is ergonomically shaped, and I now use the Norelco as my everyday face shaver.  </li>
            <li>Some plastic piece broke off and now won&#x27;t shut completely.</li>
            <li>Bought it to replace my 5+ year old Norelco HS8420 Nivea Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Old Norelco gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li>The beard trimmer seems to be a bit cumbersome and lacks precision needed for its purpose, but I have only used it for trimming my sideburns and haven&#x27;t used that much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve completely stopped using razors in favor of this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, it worked well until it just unexpectedly quit.</li>
            <li>Too much radical was needed in order to move the device to a different position.  </li>
            <li>It does not shave me nearly as close as the electric one.  </li>
            <li>I will keep using my old electric one till it dies.</li>
            <li>As far as the razor component, it feels as though the unit lacks power to shave.</li>
            <li>I kept my old norelco.</li>
            <li>I need to direct connect now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the side note, I bought this because my old Norelco attachment comb broke during travel.</li>
            <li>when we are too busy to shave we woman need something like that.</li>
            <li>Too much backtracking with the razor head over the same spots to get a close shave.</li>
            <li>and it really surprised me on how well it worked.</li>
            <li>Really something that simple</li>
            <li>You can shave, trim your beard, and completely shave yourself with three attachments.</li>
            <li>And if you don&#x27;t to go completely bald with the body shaver, there&#x27;s always a trimmer you can put over it.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to buy this product, but after having it for over 6 months, I have only praises.</li>
            <li>One holds a charge for a minute before it beeps loudly and shuts off.  </li>
            <li>I use it frequently for trimming</li>
            <li>After 4 days of not shaving (and my old razor, a Braun, had died after 10+ years of faithful service), I decided to give this thing a try.  </li>
            <li>The Click and Style has 4 settings; the longest is shorter than a 4 (longer than a 3) on the old trimmer.</li>
            <li>it gets the job done and is a very close shave facial or anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I can shave much, much faster with a regular hand</li>
            <li>B0001LQGFG Gillette Venus Divine Sensitive Women&#x27;s Razor]]</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s in the army and needed something to give him a close shave, but also accomodate to his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The regular shaver attachment doesn&#x27;t do the job very well</li>
            <li>The take away story is that I was really unimpressed, and I&#x27;ll go ahead and review the various components of the device in detail</li>
            <li>Some hairs it completely missed</li>
            <li>: yes, it is indeed loud.  </li>
            <li>Hubby says it is well developed design for a mans face and body.</li>
            <li>I use all three attachments when trimming facial hair and really cant find anything to complain about this tool.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s necessary for me to first \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; the longer stubble on my face with the bare trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts pretty long, the body attachment works pretty decent also, have not used the other attachment as of now.</li>
            <li>short, if you&#x27;re going to use this every day to shave your face, I&#x27;d personally consider other razors, but if you want a handy travel shaver or something to help your wife trim your back hair, then this thing is tops.</li>
            <li>The RQ12&#x27;s are a little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
            <li>The body trimmer head--like the shaver head before it--picks and chooses when and where it descides to actually &#x27;cut,&#x27; regardless of the angle you decide to work with, and the other head is designed in such a way that it make no sense to use unless youre okay with closing your eyes and hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>double head saving attachment leaves must to be desired, with the round design if you are shaving with it near a goatee or side burns, it leaves a buffer zone as it can&#x27;t make clean straight edges.</li>
            <li>This was my first electric razor/trimmer in a very long time.</li>
            <li>Depending on the length and flexibility of your arms, the acreage and thickness of your backwoods, or the presence of a partner willing to help you clear the underbrush on a regular basis, this might not be an issue for you, in which case you can add that star back.  </li>
            <li>I have bought other shavers before an they were ether hard to clean cheaply made out plastic ,but this isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>When it finally wears out or I decide to get a new one, Philips Norelco will be the brand I choose!</li>
            <li>Seriously, if you have ANYTHING better to do than shave, buy something else.</li>
            <li>If I were to shave my entire face I would still probably use a standard razor first and then go over it with the shaver.  </li>
            <li>to say, I have mixed feelings about this, its better than what I have had in the past but doesn&#x27;t satisfies me 100%.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I am sure it was probably said by one of the Duck Dynasty Dudes.me around, which may come in a few years if this one survives for that long, (which I think it would)&lt;br</li>
            <li>to say, I have mixed feelings about this, its better than what I have had in the past but doesn&#x27;t satisfies me 100%.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>But I find I&#x27;m leaning back towards my razor, mainly because I can get straighter and finer lines with my razor rather than with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>note my review is mainly based around the facial shaving use of it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now I&#x27;m planning on sending this back to Norelco for their money back guarantee since I can&#x27;t exactly return it to Amazon in \\&quot;new\\&quot; condition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Right now I&#x27;m planning on sending this back to Norelco for their money back guarantee since I can&#x27;t exactly return it to Amazon in \\&quot;new\\&quot; condition.</li>
            <li>I once tried to shave a penis stencil into a horse with this and the blades were still sharp enough to give me a clean shave and fend off a rowdy Andorian</li>
            <li>Given the low price, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit.</li>
            <li>of the benefits of this compared to the high powered devices is that it is quiet.</li>
            <li>I am able to trim / shave body hair effeciently.&lt;br /&gt;The beard shaver and trimmer and not good at all.</li>
            <li>It charges fast and holds the charge a long time.  </li>
            <li>I am getting the same close shave as I would with a normal razor.</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is with the normal razor head.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Exactly what i expected</li>
            <li>So guys, you&#x27;ll need to think carefully about what exactly you want shaved each day and account for the fact you may need to recharge this device to get everything done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Brand loyal for life with this little guy that can get any type of hair anywhere.</li>
            <li>motor on this shaver feels a little underpowered most of the time, like it&#x27;s just strong enough to do the job, but it starts bogging down (and pulling hairs) as soon as the battery starts to run down a bit.</li>

            <li>far it is working fine again, but you have to be delicate.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t grow a ton of facial hair and when I do it is usually pretty thin and not very visible, but this electric shaver deals with it quite effectively.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Changing from one attachment to the other is simple and quick, so is cleaning them.</li>
            <li>When it finally wears out or I decide to get a new one, Philips Norelco will be the brand</li>
            <li>The third head, advertised for body grooming is actually a foil head, so while you cna use it for body hair, it really can be used however you like, on the face, neck, etc.</li>
            <li>and I really like the ease of changing out the different heads for different cuts...</li>
            <li>last thing, those commercials are very adolescent and immature given that majority of girls/women don&#x27;t even appreciate facial hair on men.</li>
            <li>last thing, those commercials are very adolescent and immature given that majority of girls/women don&#x27;t even appreciate facial hair on men.</li>
            <li>you have a real heavy beard the two heads might not be that strong.</li>
            <li>The beard styling trimmer is pretty basic, having no vacuum and only 5 length settings: 11/64, 9/64, 7/64, 5/64, and 3/64 inch.  </li>
            <li>Blades are not sharp.</li>
            <li>Other than that, all of the attachments are pretty useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ironically, the battery that I criticized was not the major problem.  </li>
            <li>I am even guilty of using it :) I also like how it is water proof!</li>
            <li>But if you mostly need a face shaver and want rotary baldes, you can get a low-end three-head Norelco that works about as well, and has a pop-up trimmer, for less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Under powered, has a hard time trimming, feels cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve never had to work this hard  for smooth results.</li>
            <li>Many other people have noticed that the grooming head will work for a short while then have an odd effect of &amp;#34;draining</li>
            <li>While it generally works well, it has some drawbacks.</li>
            <li>Also, beard trimmers are a bit dangerous at times when it comes to body grooming, so I was interested in  a safe body grooming solution.</li>
            <li>It is completely unusable, and I found myself going back to razors within about a month of trying to get used to using this thing.</li>
            <li>I used a drawstring bag from my old Norelco beard trimmer on a recent trip, but the shaver cover kept popping off.  </li>
            <li>My 15 yea old rechargeable trimmer finally quit.  </li>
            <li>After years of abusing my skin with the old unit I finally decided to toss it and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Norelco also offers a styler attachment, with five length settings to provide maximum choice for facial hair.</li>
            <li>So far whenever my boyfriend uses it I send him back to go over spots that didn&#x27;t trim evenly.</li>
            <li>and I actually followed the instructions and read through it completely</li>
            <li>Take note that it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of all the facial hair</li>
            <li>The Remington did an alright job doubling as a body groomer, but I wanted something that gave me the flexibility to shave bare as well as just trim.</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;m not sure, if this is good on thick hair.</li>
            <li>The other attachment actually shaves better but still not clean.</li>
            <li>I apologize that I don&#x27;t have a long, comprehensive review of this product, but I was unwilling to use it for very long, and that is relevant to why the review is short and only covers one element of the possible experience with this product.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;d been using a decent foil shaver, which always left some neck hairs uncut no matter what I did, and the Norelco gets them all, and gives me a closer shave very comfortably, so forget how it sounds, it works.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps not surprisingly, I also do a fair amount of manscaping to tame my body hair and improve the appearance of my physique.  </li>
            <li>Of all 2 rotary head shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one is the most flexible due to the angled design of the rotary heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Beard styler was just ok, was not able to get the sharp line that I am used to from a dedicated use style tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer worked fine, the comb was essentially useless since I wanted the closest stubble I could get to really have that 5-o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li>My husband uses it daily and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin like a regular razor does.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not it&#x27;s worth shelling out a few extra dollars for a shaver, do it.</li>
            <li>Well, first of all, the shaver is only 2 heads not 3 like a typical Norelco shaver, so it takes longer to shave.</li>
            <li>Throw away the rotary head and only use for general grooming.</li>
            <li>I am a big Norelco fan in general, and found this to be another quality product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get much progress in trimming my facial hair; contrarily, I can hold it the other way with the handle pointing up and it will overtrim.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco has always been trusty, I&#x27;ve had their products for a few years now and this one works exactly as advertised just like the others.</li>
            <li>Alas, I got tired of shaving using razors and bought this, and I loved it since day one!</li>
            <li>I had tried various Norelco three head shavers in the past and have been less than satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe to first experience was due to not charging it long enough.  </li>
            <li>Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Power Razor]], I have always believed that electric razors are for men who don&#x27;t really insist on a close shave (or less facetiously for men whose lifestyle requires shaving on-the-go).  </li>
            <li>if it sits for a few days after a full charge, its empty again.</li>
            <li>While I likes the length it trimmed to (which was lucky because this comb doesn&#x27;t have different length settings), I didn&#x27;t like how hard it was to shave evenly.</li>
            <li>All it would take is a separate snap on collar in order to be long enough (for me; they might need a third for people who trim to a 9 on the old one or longer for the Austin beard set).</li>
            <li>/&gt;honestly can&#x27;t compare this with any thing else other than a normal razor...</li>
            <li>I tried all the tricks like stretching the skin, wet and dry shaving, nothing really made it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>regularly this isn&#x27;t much of a problem, but if you only use it monthly you may find the battery has worn down quite a lot as NiMH batteries self-discharge quite rapidly.</li>
            <li>regularly this isn&#x27;t much of a problem, but if you only use it monthly you may find the battery has worn down quite a lot as NiMH batteries self-discharge quite rapidly.</li>
            <li>Shave by using both straight and circular motions, pulling skin tight where needed.  </li>
            <li>Especially in certain parts of the body where it&#x27;s a little more painful.</li>
            <li>but he likes a much closer shave and said it pulled a little bit.</li>
            <li>As a relatively new beard guy, I can&#x27;t say how well this compares to other models.  </li>
            <li>Gives a clean, smooth shave, without feeling like it is yanking out hairs, or cutting  my face!</li>
            <li>However, it takes a while to power through tough spots and isn&#x27;t nearly as precise as I was hoping.</li>
            <li>So if you want a sub-par shaver that has a good body clip and beard trimmer, this bad boy is for you.</li>
            <li>Each shaving tool in the kit are good, nothing bad to say.</li>

            <li> This product is great for those who can&#x27;t decide whether to buy the &amp;#34;circles&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;rectangle&amp;#34; type of electric shaver.</li>

            <li> options seem to work great.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted this for Christmas, and it works great.</li>
            <li> you have everything you need in one machine, which is great.</li>
            <li> lol.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a great razor and price</li>
            <li> /&gt;Other than that, the trimmer portion works great.</li>
            <li> I just have a great experience whit this norelco.</li>
            <li> lol</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> charge lasts for ever, is a great device</li>
            <li> This is a great product..</li>
            <li> This is a great item.  </li>
            <li> Really happy with this purchase and product.</li>
            <li> Really great razor.</li>
            <li> Takes some time to get used to it, maybe a couple weeks, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Very nice.</li>
            <li> Great product, nice quality!</li>
            <li> Great product, very comfortable for use and excellent quality of shave!!</li>
            <li> The beard shaving attachment I have found at its longest setting to be perfect length for body hair, and the body hair a great length for more detail.</li>
            <li> The speed at which this was shipped out is amazing as well!</li>
            <li> Build quality is great, it feels good in the hand.</li>
            <li> But this Philips is awesome shave way better than any electric and as close as a manual.</li>
            <li> Three products in one, and they all work remarkably well.</li>
            <li> I tried many of these things, I think philips as a brand is the best</li>
            <li> Nice quality!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect razor to shave all most all the hair of your body parts.</li>
            <li> I love it, its the best shaver I have ever had.</li>
            <li> I have had many others electric razers and this is the best one.</li>
            <li> This device is truly one of a kind !</li>
            <li> I would not say this product is remarkable.</li>
            <li> A stand would been the perfect deal closer, but as the unit is, I like it a heck of a lot and would easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use,  shave awesome,.</li>
            <li> very good, I love it.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m good for 21/2 years</li>
            <li> At the end of the day I wish I had returned this, and just bought a good beard trimmer.    </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a good starter to electric shaving, don&#x27;t get this.    </li>
            <li> I don’t do a lot of “below the neck line” shaving but figured I might start if I had a good shaver to use.</li>
            <li> and I cannot give a good shave from this thing which is surprising.</li>
            <li> and it DOES fit and work perfectly on this shaver.</li>
            <li> He loves using it in the shower and gives him a good share.</li>
            <li> He thought that someone with a heavier beard might find this a good tool.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize how good the triple-blade heads were until I tried to use these single-cut blades.  </li>
            <li> Good for use at home and while traveling.  </li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> so good.</li>
            <li> This Norelco face and body shaver and beard trimmer is a good deal if you plan to use all three functions.  </li>
            <li> I loved it.</li>
            <li> Its a good shaver</li>
            <li> It was a really good price</li>
            <li> A good system.</li>
            <li> It has a good Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll just add that I loved these.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a good while.</li>
            <li> Worked good - just had to shave every morning.</li>
            <li> I used this to shave it dose not do a good job</li>
            <li> Purchased one and worked fairly well for about 3 months.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shaver is good.</li>
            <li> Did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Good buy.</li>
            <li> the money does not give a good shave</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the battery life to be quite good.</li>
            <li> Its a good buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Looks like the battery is good too.</li>
            <li> Hey, this was a good razor for the price point.</li>
            <li> Maybe still good for the teenager who has an outlet nearby tho.</li>
            <li> All in all it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Also the two attachments for beard and body hair are good.</li>
            <li> The rotary design is superior in all regards to all foil razors.  </li>
            <li> good material</li>
            <li> i recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li> He said it is a good razor.  </li>
            <li> Performance of the 2-head shave head was fairly good.</li>
            <li> It is really cheap and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is designed to go over the area to be trimmed at a tilted angle and when done correctly it can leave a good amount of hair.</li>
            <li> This is as good an electric razor as I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> does the job its meant to, good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Really a good all around razor, the two heads take a bit longer to shave my face than a 3 headed electric shaver</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go for that shaving session.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Frankly, I loved the playful  advertising for this product</li>
            <li> This seems to be a good alternative to troubles I have been going through to shave each morning.  </li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a friend and they loved it.</li>
            <li> easy to use !!</li>
            <li> easy to charge !!</li>
            <li> The styler attachment is my favorite piece; I use it to keep my gray beard beautiful.</li>
            <li> They said it was very easy to use and it shaved very nicely.</li>
            <li> Amazon is always exceptional when it comes to customer service.</li>
            <li> Maybe the shaving unit will do better at body grooming (lol).</li>
            <li> These are much better quality and the battery life is great.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer seems to do a better job of body grooming than the body grooming tool, but otherwise this is great</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s already so many great reviews</li>
            <li> but i love it trimmer is also great</li>
            <li> Works great love the machine.</li>
            <li> It is great to be able to kill 2 birds with one stone.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is great, body trimmer is okay as well as the shaver attachment.</li>
            <li> It is totally amazing how anyone thinks this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> Over the years, I settled on a Remington foil type shaver with better results, but it still did not do a great job.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the shave</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the shave</li>
            <li> Now that I do, it is amazing, feels good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great shaver for more smoother hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> It feels really nice in the hand, has a really good premium finish all over.</li>
            <li> I would have loved to have a nice bag with it to keep the accessories</li>
            <li> : Good for begginners and attachments are nice.</li>
            <li> has a good shave, all the heads attach with ease, good grip got it for a fair price love it</li>
            <li> Gives a very good, clean shave.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do the best job, however this is my first electric shaver</li>
            <li> and he can&#x27;t stop raving about how many  attachments there are!</li>
            <li> This would be my first electrical razor and it works awesome.</li>
            <li> Awesome tool, exactly what is was looking for.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so many years to upgrade!</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job and is very versatile!</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Now this is great and so easy because he just trims it up every 2/3 days when he feels he needs to.</li>
            <li> amazing battery life.</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars because the body shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li> The Norelco twin head electric razor is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> This attractively designed shaving device works quietly, is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> All in all, a good multipurpose shaving system, and I am pleased with results and the price.</li>
            <li> Smoothly, deeply, effectively pulling hair from akin.</li>
            <li> Still, it cleans things up nicely without nicks or scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Its a really nice shaver..</li>
            <li> I really apreciate the purchase, it matches perfectly my expectations about the product</li>
            <li> Changeable heads all seat nicely with no</li>
            <li> The grooming attachments are nice too, to be honest I haven&#x27;t fully tested them, and I&#x27;ll have to update this review</li>
            <li> lovey shaver dose nice job fits in hand</li>
            <li> It has a nice assortment of blades and accessories but no box to store them in.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> I am advicing it to everyone who looks for that kind of item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a good, safe intro to electric shaving, based on the competitive price.</li>
            <li> I kind of want to switch the the rotary head</li>
            <li> Great razor, is water friendly so safe to use it in the shower!</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s waterproof -</li>
            <li> Fast shipping &amp; great customer service!</li>
            <li> A nice combo.</li>
            <li> Handy for travel.</li>
            <li> keeps everything nice and even.</li>
            <li> The reason is that the foil design capture hairs as effectively.  </li>
            <li> The body groomer attachment is nice since it has a clipper on either side and a foil that doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair.  </li>
            <li> But I love the body grooming head, it good for all areas below the neck.</li>
            <li> I use this very often and it always works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Great seller, great product, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> and they provide a nice, close shave.</li>
            <li> Probably the best feature of this groomer is that it&#x27;s always ready to use.</li>
            <li> a superb Remington Micro Screen electric shaver and an equally good Norelco G370 All-in-One Grooming system, both 10+ years old.  </li>
            <li> There are cheaper products out there that work just as good and better.</li>
            <li> And may also be great if you are 100% clean shave but may not get all the hair under the nose or at the edge of the side</li>
            <li> powerful and beautiful.</li>
            <li> he was super happy.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Razor came with good accessories and they are easy to attach and detach.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally is Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone that has a beard very easy to trim.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for maintaining more of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look, which happens to be what I prefer, but my job requires a clean shave</li>
            <li> and it is by far the best trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> to charge, good battery life, comfortable in my hand and heads change in and out without a problem.</li>
            <li> Best shaver, I don&#x27;t use it on my face because I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a nice shaver and does the job for the most part, still not as close shave as a razor</li>
            <li> This would  probably not be a good product if you&#x27;re looking for a close, precise shave.</li>
            <li> it is a good product but some parts are cheaply made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some kind of \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; shaver for a while now to use mostly when traveling or on vacation - having to carry two or three separate shavers/trimmers is cumbersome.</li>
            <li> : Not as close of a shave, shouldn&#x27;t have to stretch own face skin for a better shave.</li>
            <li> but it is very versatile and ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> trim groom and shave all with one unit, good battery life and leaves a smooth cut</li>
            <li> Has great features &amp; attachments that are useful.</li>
            <li> At first when I received the product I liked it and was happy except for the fact it didn&#x27;t come with a case.</li>
            <li> great shaver, smooth, close shave, and strong engine.</li>
            <li> most pleasant surprise is that it is extremely comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> battery life is great and the ergonomics is just right</li>
            <li> Easy and painless!</li>
            <li> He liked it a lot and the more he uses it the more he likes it.</li>
            <li> way better than the cheap electric razors but just as good as the $300 ones.</li>
            <li> Honestly I bought this after the commercial and I have to say this is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> The truth is that this unit brilliantly fits and fuctions with the high end</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great but set it at one setting higher</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and I was told it works great, very close shave, and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very light</li>
            <li> Very smooth cut</li>
            <li> Two of the attachments, in very light use, have come apart at the seams...literally.  </li>
            <li> but this would be good for throwing in the gym bag or keeping in the office desk for that quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> The two head facial shaver is great and does a superb job, but adding the three head that pivots from the Senso-touch line adds a great layer of speed and comfort that you get from shavers that are 2-3 times higher in value (be aware not all shaver heads fit the Click and Style, I used the RQ12 and it works FANTASTIC)!!</li>
            <li> Great price and came quickly and securely.</li>
            <li> they certainly have made some great improvements over the years.  </li>
            <li> easy to clean .!!</li>
            <li> I like the 2 head design better then 3.</li>
            <li> Just make sure that you do more research when you purchase a shaving unit.</li>
            <li> love it  </li>
            <li> The body hair trimmer is okay.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is my favorite part.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for an okay body, and beard trimmer, consider this as an option.</li>
            <li> i love this product i can save , trim all the excess hair on my body.</li>
            <li> Could not ask for a better razor.</li>
            <li> Even if I could ask for a better razor, I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> that did not nick me, but it uses battery the most of all the attachments.</li>
            <li> So I used it for about two months - it did get better but never got to an acceptable level.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer</li>
            <li> I would recommend this more so as a trimmer than a shaver.</li>
            <li> Love or like loves you.</li>
            <li> Shaves ok.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco has been my favorite brand for shaving tools for many years now.</li>
            <li> Like many of the women in Vine, I chose this item and asked my husband to try it.</li>
            <li> I agree with most of the reviews already written.</li>
            <li> Shaving at the gym before work is more about convenience and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> me, shaving with a razor at the gym is just as convenient, more efficient, and provides smoother results than using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Could provide better resultsrd with a #3 comb on a set of Walh clippers, which cuts to a 3/8&amp;#34; or 9mm length.  </li>
            <li> me, shaving with a razor at the gym is just as convenient, more efficient, and provides smoother results than using an electric razor.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Could provide better results</li>
            <li> You can substitute a three-rotor SensoTouch head if you want, but unless you already have one I don&#x27;t think buying one is worthwhile.  </li>
            <li> I like being able to use it in the shower, and the fact that I can get almost any length of hair I want.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m hopping to get a replacement part and have better luck...</li>
            <li> now use the Norelco most mornings and my technique of shaving in circular motions and pulling the skin taut is improving.</li>
            <li> This is one good and economical shaving kit; well recommended.</li>
            <li> Love this razor set from Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product as it does everything it says it does.</li>
            <li> The three heads afford confident grooming on all areas of the body.</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars since it is the 1st electric razor that actually does what it advertises and works flawlessly</li>
            <li> you get 5 or more shaves on a charge</li>
            <li> I guess i am just used to better material this products appears to have run of the mill material.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does shave as good as the more powerful</li>
            <li> althoug the triple headed Norelco would be a better</li>
            <li> I bought this in June 2013 and for as many times as I&#x27;ve used this</li>
            <li> And my life has changed for the better.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br</li>
            <li> recommend this to anyone who was looking to buy a style shave kit :)</li>
            <li> i love this thing.</li>
            <li> glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to shaving in the car with a Norelco Sensotouch 3D razor and a Remington Hyper Series electric razor (both of which I love), so my perspective on this shaver is influenced by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shave is so so, the blade is better.</li>
            <li> and it works better than any of the others he has had.</li>
            <li> and I admit I was a bit leery that it did not cost more, but am sure glad that I ordered it.  </li>
            <li> This razor has a good battery charge and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> and I was impressed at the prospect of the different tools that come with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I felt safe using this with no gritting teeth moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t shave any better than the three head,</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I would just make sure your skin is taunt in said region.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> For the most part I am satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> Love the beqard trimmer attchment so taht you can get</li>
            <li> wheres the &amp;#34;squares&amp;#34; shaver is better for getting a closer shave elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a versatile shaving kit that is a great value and gives good performance.</li>
            <li> glad</li>
            <li> idea of the three-in-one is great and it is designed really well.</li>
            <li> love this appliance</li>
            <li> With just the two heads, it takes more passes and takes longer to shave, which defeats the purpose of an electric</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, to love it would require the ability to use the shaver while plugged in.</li>
            <li> still works and get you an okay shave but takes a while to do it since it&#x27;s two heads</li>
            <li> Battery life could be better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Effectively replaces my razor for most uses.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> be ordering more)</li>
            <li> It shaves very well, it has a great battery life</li>
            <li> and now it rattles and i need to keep my finger on top to keep it closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay for body hair</li>
            <li> still use it almost every couple of days and probably one of the better trimmer combo sets I have ever owned that&#x27;s is made by Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is okay.</li>
            <li> , \\&quot;FACIAL HAIR IS AWESOME.... \\&quot;  </li>
            <li> , \\&quot;FACIAL HAIR IS AWESOME.... \\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I am sure it was probably said by one of the Duck Dynasty Dudes.</li>
            <li> use shaving gel when I shave the that works well, my hopes to shave more with an electric was to try to save some cash.  </li>
            <li> Works ok</li>
            <li> roommate would really love it if the head swiveled more.</li>
            <li> Satisfied...</li>
            <li> He says that it is okay.  </li>
            <li> It is OK</li>
            <li> Fast shipping/ great product</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t match my Panasonic wet/dry razor Panasonic ES8103S for the face, but I expect it will do much better than it for my body hair.  </li>
            <li> That leaves this as only a razor, which is not its best function.  </li>
            <li> This works well on the face and body, so if the battery was better, I would classify it a five star product.</li>
            <li> does the beard trimming better.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied and I recommend.</li>
            <li> No need to spend more.</li>
            <li> but overall this was an awesome buy.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure because of some of the reviews</li>
            <li> I have used the shaver most days of the week for a month and have still not recharged the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The body groomer attachment works OK.  </li>
            <li> The foil does not seem to get a close shave of the body hair in my opinion, but I am not 100% sure it is meant to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> an electric shaver, I think this product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> an electric shaver, I think this product is outstanding.  </li>
            <li> Two words -- \\&quot;razor stubble\\&quot; -- in close contact with your most tender areas should be explanation enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> It will be great for my purposes as a unit I will use when traveling, but for my day to day shaving I will continue to use my superior individual products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Bought this from Tarjee as got additional 5% off with Redcard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many.  </li>
            <li> It is okay for beginners but lacks the close shave.</li>
            <li> ( Maybe because it doesn&#x27;t have a triple head like most electric shavers)  </li>
            <li> Norelco should ditch the two head razor and keep the three head razors like they use on most of their electric razors for a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Sometimes they are around $30, so one can try those before buying a more expensiver branded Norelco one.</li>
            <li> design is ok....</li>
            <li> Hopefully this shaver works out :)</li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s ok to shave the rest of one&#x27;s body.</li>
            <li> body groomer does an excellent job on those hard-to-reach places on the back and shoulder</li>
            <li> I love the way his body looks after using it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, youre better off with disposable razors and a comb.</li>
            <li> Only wanted to use it to trim my beard and it has all the perfect lengths.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Replacement heads cost a lot, so be sure to take care of this product.</li>
            <li> Sure if your trying to sport a beard over an inch this is not the tool for you to just rake through to trim it up</li>
            <li> have had many Norelco trimmers over the years and still have a Bodygroomer</li>
            <li> Not their top of the line.</li>
            <li> dislike norelco since it takes more than one pass to shave hair that my panasonic LV 81 will do in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for trimming underarms, legs, chest, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in a hurry (has happened more than once)</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love it..</li>
            <li> buy any more of their products.</li>
            <li> but im sure it will work well for that.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping that this Norelco would be a more sophisticated machine and give me a more even trim.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to wait the three weeks, if this machine miraculously becomes better I will update my review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to wait the three weeks, if this machine miraculously becomes better I will update my review.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use!</li>
            <li> For sure it wasn&#x27;t the length of my beard because I do not allow it to grow longer than a five o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It pulled most of it.  </li>
            <li> However my is that although fully charged it doesn&#x27;t run for more then 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> It was ok with me</li>
            <li> So far my rating is based on how many good gift brownie points I got from him!</li>
            <li> had three head shavers for years.this model has two heads that seem to fit my face better.easy to clean and good close shave.</li>
            <li> Wow this is a really good product!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you a nice clean shave at all.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have this come with a box that held the parts cleanly and neatly on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice product, very versatile , great price quick shipping</li>
            <li> I love that i can use this in the shower, makes grooming more easy.</li>
            <li> Shaving on the neck is an issue if you like a very clean shave.</li>
            <li> But in my opinion it&#x27;s pretty dang good.</li>
            <li> The battery charge holds up pretty good.</li>
            <li> but for a first purchase and for a lite user this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In conclusion, if you&#x27;re in the market for a shaver, a beard trimmer, and a body trimmer, the Philips Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit is a pretty good value over purchasing three separate devices.</li>

            <li> nice product, quick delivery</li>

            <li> clean!</li>
            <li> I am not fussy about my beard trimmer, most number 3s are fine out there.  </li>
            <li> is the kind of trimmer I am exactly looking for...!</li>
            <li> The overall build quality is very good.</li>
            <li> I have had very good luck with Norelco razors over the years, and I suspect this one will provide the same quality.</li>
            <li> This is a very cool concept.</li>
            <li> Being able to use in the shower is huge bonus.</li>
            <li> The most important is that after using it you won&#x27;t feel any pain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, gives me a pretty smooth shave, and has good battery life and features.</li>
            <li> was (as and couple can attest to) becoming an issue around the sink area.  </li>
            <li> Great price and arrived early.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was impressed by the stubble trimmer&#x27;s adjustments (it clicks back and forth to adjust maybe 1/4 inch) and the body hair trimmer is probably the most useful attachment for</li>
            <li> Maybe I didn&#x27;t make sure it was securely on.</li>
            <li> It helps me keep my nape hair free and being able to use it w/ shaving cream is a BONUS.</li>
            <li> My 16 yr old son is so happy with it.</li>
            <li> Because there are optional heads available, my wife has relegated to using on of the heads to shave her lovely legs.</li>
            <li> , the shipment was fast, I received just in a while, price was good</li>
            <li> it does takes time to get a good shave, might as well do the real shave/razor.</li>
            <li> Its a nice useful trimmer and multi-purpose.</li>
            <li> It is a good value though and very flexible.  </li>
            <li> Without a good groomer I kinda let it go, and didn&#x27;t manscape as much.  </li>
            <li> in all an excellent product, very pleased with it and haven&#x27;t complained once since I got it.</li>
            <li> All in all an excellent product, very pleased with it and haven&#x27;t complained once since I got it.</li>
            <li> A good choice  for the person that wants or needs to be well groomed.</li>
            <li> Very easy and quick to use.</li>
            <li> The finish is a bit cheap, and I don&#x27;t think the attachments are super nice.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite shaving machine,my first one  lasted almost 2 years and it worked great, this is my second one and this one is as perfect as the old one ...</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and recommend it.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s also easy to accidentally press the power button on this model when traveling) .</li>
            <li> The adjustments are easy to make, and the combs work well, too.</li>
            <li> interchangeable heads, close shave, battery indicator, easy to clean&lt;br</li>
            <li> my old Norelco did, leaving my cheeks smooth and feeling great after a bit of moisturizing after shave.  </li>
            <li> The heads are so easy to change.</li>
            <li> it was an easy decision to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The heads of the razor are easy to switch.  </li>
            <li> easy to change attachments</li>
            <li> heads are easily adjustable and well-made</li>
            <li> Easy to carry as well.</li>
            <li> Note: At the shortest length as well as with the comb removed, the blade is quite close to the skin, making it relatively easy to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since this is more of an entry-level product it uses a NiMH battery instead of a more powerful lithium-ion battery.</li>
            <li> Since this is more of an entry-level product it uses a NiMH battery instead of a more powerful lithium-ion battery.</li>
            <li> Works great, just like it does in the comercials also cheaper than at most retail stores that sell same product</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning it is also really easy.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor to any one who likes easy shaving.</li>
            <li> The battery life also seems to be pretty good, and quick to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I have only had this new shaver for about two weeks, I have to say I&#x27;m impressed, price value was really good and was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> Bottom line is that the concept and shaving/trimming performance are great, but the materials used in the drive train for the face shaver are not very durable and should be able to stand up better, even if there is user error.</li>
            <li> The addition of a comb on this attachment was great because I could still choose to trim or go bare and still get the safety benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First electric razor I&#x27;ve really liked.</li>
            <li> and it could stay more than a month on one full charge.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This shaver cuts fine</li>
            <li> Everything is fine</li>
            <li> but in the end everything was fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve probably tried half a dozen products over the years, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and changes heads and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> Smooth, easy, and convenient.</li>
            <li> but it woks fine.</li>
            <li> No issues there at all.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life on it has been more then adequate as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten it to work more then 10 minutes if I&#x27;m lucky.</li>
            <li> of the features are great, you can even touch up your hair with the clippers attachment, which was great for the military high fade</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor but it does a great job as a trimmer with multiple length settings, more than adequate adjustment and easily trims side burns as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product earlier in the month and it worked great at first, all the attachments worked perfectly but then suddenly the bodyfoil attachment started to act up...</li>
            <li> the best is the charge it states that it will run for a 40 min shave, but I found that I used it for 10 days a little each day and it still didn&#x27;t need a charge</li>
            <li> Just wish the razor cut my face a little closer but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product and vendor, highly recommend</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not that accurate.</li>
            <li> Clean shaves easy and smooth.</li>
            <li> I would consider this for a great space saving appliance for traveling, or for use as a primary trimmer and back up shaver at home.</li>
            <li> my kindle has been great and the game looks great on it.</li>
            <li> The attachments have also been a huge plus.</li>
            <li> The whole thing just has a nice feel to it.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comfortable shaver to hold and use.</li>
            <li> but still provides a comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t sound like buzzzz but</li>
            <li> no complants and the different heads are great to</li>
            <li> Leaves a smooth shave every time.</li>
            <li> A few weeks in, and everything fits perfectly still.</li>
            <li> We are happy with each of the different performances and options, and they all get used.</li>
            <li> great overall product except the 2 cut shaver piece</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, store, and recharge.  </li>
            <li> The razor is light in the hand and its contours provide comfortable holding.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bodygroom shaver/trimmer uses rounded combs and tips to prevent skin irritation, and supposedly provide reliably smooth grooming anywhere below the neckline.  </li>
            <li> If you have course facial hair and are looking for a great shave, the Philips Norelco YS524 will probably disappoint.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The bodygroom shaver/trimmer uses rounded combs and tips to prevent skin irritation, and supposedly provide reliably smooth grooming anywhere below the neckline.  </li>
            <li> If you have course facial hair and are looking for a great shave, the Philips Norelco YS524 will probably disappoint.  </li>
            <li> Never misses a hair, and no hair falls out, everything is caught inside the head for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and charge.  </li>
            <li> I bought this unit for one reason, I wanted to enjoy shaving with Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D, without having to shell out $150.00+ to get one.</li>
            <li> i had heard that when using body groom it runs out of charge really soon, but though i&#x27;m way to hairy, it works really nice</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beard styler works great for me as I keep short stubble beard.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> but it feels really cheap.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Super easy to clean with a water rinse&lt;br /&gt;Super</li>
            <li> He starts to enjoy</li>
            <li> this is a free voltage product, so no problem with additional buying of the adapter.&lt;br /&gt;(In</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> Shaving with the two rotary heads takes longer than shaving with a razor with three rotary heads, an important factor when I am trying to get to work on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will say the trimmer did not seem to work so well on the back of my neck but was great for my face.</li>
            <li> Light weights and</li>
            <li> tried it on, and it feels smooth while shaving, so if I had not opened it up and had to see what the head looks like, my comments would have been</li>
            <li> Easy to clean</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and wash the device.</li>
            <li> This razor works great with the face attachment, even though it only has two heads.</li>
            <li> that means that my dollars are subsidizing their free stuff.</li>
            <li> They ought to replace it for free</li>
            <li> i dont need to use soap or water pain free and even tickles kinda.</li>
            <li> I bought this primarily as a trimmer but have started to utilize the shaver too.  </li>
            <li> Light weight and holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> but if you keep it relatively short this is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s blades are really smooth without causing any irritation.</li>
            <li> At that time there weren&#x27;t even cordless razors available.  </li>
            <li> So, overall, these are great razors, but I have had this battery problem so often with them, I cannot recommend them without a warning about the battery life.  </li>
            <li> Got the face baby smooth.</li>
            <li> i have never gotten a orange battery light.</li>
            <li> This one feels so light and is so ergonomical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The face shave is great, however, since i have coarse hair on my  neck, I can&#x27;t get as a close shave as on my face.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and waterproof.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this as a supplement, not a replacement, for your primary shaver.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Battery life is fantastic.</li>
            <li> very convenient to use in shower, trims and shaves nicely.  </li>
            <li> so I tend to just use a cheap Remington trimmer without the comb.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a birthday gift for my husband two weeks ago, and he loves it.so far so good.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as good as my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> The facial shaver is the best part of it, the rest of the attachments don&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer works very well and the adjustments allow for a great trim of any reasonable beard.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> so far i loved.</li>
            <li> it works smooth and nice, but opening up, makes me realized the quality of the blade attachement was very poor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My $20 cheap shaver thats made in China is more useful...</li>
            <li> i was surprised something this reasonaby priced would work so good.</li>
            <li> Nothing more to really say here, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use this on body hair because the battery died (more on that</li>
            <li> He said its not bad, pretty handy too.</li>
            <li> I like remington 3 head cut better, however the other attachments are great.</li>
            <li> It is very useful.</li>
            <li> and he says it is very useful and works well.</li>
            <li> so it is very useful for us.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shaving in the shower with water or cream is smooth and leaves me feeling clean and smooth with no irritation.</li>
            <li> The trimmer attachment on the razor is more like an electric sheep sheer, which is great, because I can get pretty</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad the have this one since it&#x27;s cordless and more versatile, but I feel like $60 might be a bit high.</li>
            <li> extremely functional.many options everything they promise and more and a very good first electric shaver, body groom and trimmer .</li>
            <li> it is an excellent razor that allows to make several styles without difficulty, the three heads are easily interchangeable and durable, my old razor phillips 105 work by 15 years.</li>
            <li> Super easy to return.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to change the shaver heads</li>
            <li> Very powerful razor, even though I had a light rash for 3 days my skin quickly adapted and now it&#x27;s a smooth shave everytime.  </li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s different attachments are very nice and quick to change, it has great battery life from very first charge, easy to clean and overall</li>
            <li> Click &amp; Style got pretty good reviews and was available at a decent price</li>
            <li> Amazon didnt send me one, or an invoice, or anything, except my original order number which Philips wont accept.</li>
            <li> And the three tasks it does makes it a unique device</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t try body groomer or original 2 head shaver that came with it</li>
            <li> it works fine and quick</li>
            <li> Pretty fantastic shaver!</li>
            <li> I was hoping to use it to trim my neck under the beard, but it seems more interested in pulling my neck hairs than shaving.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased this razor to use for trimming body hair.  </li>
            <li> Battery charge lasts a long time, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy one of these for body grooming, although for shaving I would buy a dedicated shaver (but this does the trick, maybe great for a trip bag).</li>
            <li> Crisp and clean shave :)</li>
            <li> The Braun I had doesn&#x27;t shave that great, but the battery is strong and willing after several years.  </li>
            <li> My dedicated beard trimmer (also a Norelco) has a trimmer attachment with very fine (close together) blades, that produces a much neater edge to my goatee than the  Click &amp; Style trimmer does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this very complete&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, I needed like a bear:, D thanks..... . . .</li>
            <li> Shave is good but have not been able to understand the instructions for how to use the other attachments available.</li>
            <li> I also own a beard/mustache trimming set, and I thought this one new unit could replace them both.  </li>
            <li> knew it doesn&#x27;t come with one and thought I can live with it, but will have to make my own using Spiderpodium and some sugru maybe.</li>
            <li> My head is clean shaved and</li>
            <li> Love to shave, trim and groom a nice beard, goatee or short boxed look.</li>
            <li> It is really about as close as the blade and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> He spend couple days searching and comparing different brands - this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> clean shaves and trims.</li>
            <li> He gets a close clean shave with it.</li>
            <li> i had a triple head prior that liked more</li>
            <li> so i really like that works great leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> Need to keep it clean, though</li>
            <li> he does keep it clean</li>
            <li> Also, I like how you can take the attachment and run it with water to keep the heads clean.</li>
            <li> I assume most shavers are like this because it really can&#x27;t get as close or smoothly of a shave as my razor does.</li>
            <li> I own several of Norelco shavers and all of them seem of better quality, specially the heads.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Ordering was easy, delivery right on time and pricing was value added.</li>
            <li> heads are easy to switch out, and each of them work very well and are easy to clean.</li>
            <li> We are very happy with the purchase, and it is easy to use for me as a partner carefully following the back of the neck and for him as a years-long trimmer.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there are coupons or special deals on this product where you can get almost up to 20 dollars off.</li>
            <li> But you will actually need shaving foam for a good clean shave from this electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my son but he told me he liked it very much and use it for the whole body.  </li>
            <li> I have an older philips and it was broken, this one is more safe, confortable and makes a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> Great price for the money spent.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many trimmers and this is by far the most versatile, powerful, and reliable.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning the nozzle heads is easy as well just rinse out with steaming hot water and the blades will be clean of any hair.</li>
            <li> Had to literally hold the thing to my skin for a good minute before it actually cleaned the stubble off my face.</li>
            <li> I don’t think the face shaving attachment can articulate enough to provide a good close shave on a head.</li>
            <li> Overall battery life is good.</li>
            <li> but I decided to give it some more time because of that whole &amp;#34;adjust to your face&amp;#34; thing that razor companies claim.</li>
            <li> So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So</li>
            <li> This thing works for over 40min on a full charge.</li>
            <li> Returned for a full refund.</li>
            <li> the good thing: I find myself preferring the 2 rotary head shavers over the 3 rotary head shavers as they allow extra flexibility around the nose, neck and close to the ears.</li>
            <li> Has all the attractments and adjustable length is cool</li>
            <li> I bought this as a x-mas present, he loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> light, worth</li>
            <li> I do wish RQ12 came with plastic cover as it does in a full kit, replacement head does not come with one :o(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I liked that my old Remington would work when plugged in or when just on batteries.  </li>
            <li> The razor is definitely portable, so whether you are at home on the couch, or on the road, you can take this with you and have just as good of a shave no matter where you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean and quick shave.</li>
            <li> The body trimer is good for shaving and trimming the neck and the two head shaver works as well as the three head just a smaller area.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer a shaver with three rotary heads since the three heads will make the shaving process quicker as it covers more skin surface.</li>
            <li> after that the battery would die with in minutes or even seconds with a full charge.  </li>
            <li> For different uses / all in one this is a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought because it has such good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I gave it a full day to charge.  </li>
            <li> and it will run for 15min and die without notice and on a full charge.</li>
            <li> Electric shavers do not irritate my skin as much, but I had never been satisfied with the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> But because it is more of an entry-level product it doesn&#x27;t really EXCEL at any of these functions.</li>
            <li> But because it is more of an entry-level product it doesn&#x27;t really EXCEL at any of these functions.</li>
            <li> 35 minutes for an &#x27;almost&#x27; smooth shave when all i had on my face was a days worth of stubble is just unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It will also travel better and it cut out the need to take as much on trips since it can do it all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thus far, I love the sleekness and the simplicity and unless a problem develops later on, am happy with this style shaver</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for, fair price, great attachments, close shave wet or dry, amazing charge time (only once a week)</li>
            <li> Attachments click in solidly and are nicely stable, and remove easily.</li>
            <li> but it does leave u smooth to the touch I&#x27;d done right.</li>
            <li> The standard against which a multiple use product like this is to be measured is NOT whether it is the best performing product at each task, but rather whether it performs well enough to replace two or more items in your bathroom or more importantly in your carry on luggage.  </li>
            <li> to be a pretty sturdy plastic and tips click on and off easily .&lt;br</li>
            <li> The double-head isnt great, but per one of the other reviews I purchased an RQ12 head (the SensoTouch 3D head)</li>
            <li> The styler works perfectly for trimming my beard, though be warned that the guard does not extend out as far as most dedicated beard trimmers (I usually use the maximum setting, unless I&#x27;ve just had a haircut).  </li>
            <li> so I can say nothing, other than if it works like the rest of this razor it will be great too.</li>
            <li> The other attachments are great uses.</li>
            <li> On the first week of use, they are fine, and then decline rapidly.  </li>
            <li> I find that the shaving unit does not do an adequate job-</li>
            <li> but it has quickly lost it’s battery life and blade sharpness</li>
            <li> Either that or I am so used to getting a super close shave with my Headblade that nothing compares.</li>
            <li> My nephew is in the Army so he is always in need do a quick shave.</li>
            <li> Most of the time the shave is smooth, but once in a while the razor seems to irritate my skin around my neck and has even made me bleed; this may just be operator error or my already sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> That being said this razor does cut close, and even better, with the additional heads/attachments that are included, you are able to keep the rest of your bodily areas under control</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s pleased with it and raves that its much better than a standard razor.</li>
            <li> The shaver proved adequate, but just.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The body and beard trimmers are super.</li>
            <li> so if you are a super hairy guy then don&#x27;t buy this.</li>
            <li> in all I would say that this grooming toolkit is decent, but would recommend something else if you can find one that is better reviewed.</li>
            <li> Overall it has been and excellent daily shaver.</li>
            <li> AMA was very nice sending stuff back thanks</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, while this unit is very pretty (even the packaging was shiny and high-tech looking) and it works</li>
            <li> Since growing a beard for the first time 8 or so years ago, I have missed how smooth my cheeks would get using my Norelco three-head shaver.  </li>
            <li> The shaver/kit is pretty light, so its convenient to travel with.  </li>
            <li> This is the very first electric shaver I have ever bought</li>
            <li> that was offered on their very first model.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors before that gave me a closer shave, and with no irritation, on the very first use.</li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased at the clean cut and ease of use.</li>
            <li> I already have an electric razor that I&#x27;m happy with (another, older Norelco model), so I was really only looking at this for the beard trim stuff.  </li>
            <li> The older models were much more powerful.</li>
            <li> and I think he is enjoying playing with this on his new beard.</li>
            <li> Overall though, I liked being able to get a decent shave on my stomach without irritation, which is otherwise prone to ingrown hairs when using a razor blade.</li>
            <li> I used it on my legs armpits and anywhere else i need it its fast and easy</li>
            <li> Delivery very quick and much cheaper than buying in uk.</li>
            <li> It is an unusual shape for an electric razor but it works well and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more versatile and pretty much the coolest thing out there to take care of all the hair you want trimmed.</li>
            <li> Although I was a bit uncertain of how it will work, I was amazed at how easy and fast it is.  </li>
            <li> I have finally found a Electric Shave that actually works and gives me a GREAT close clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> This is his first shaver/trimmer and he LOVES IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this recently because my dermatologist found my use of a manual razor was causing ingrown hairs to form under my chin, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> This is my first Electric Shaver!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use to trim fine points very well at all.</li>
            <li> The motor is great on this little thing.</li>
            <li> The body groomer is awesome and you can use it in very delicate regions if you get my drift.</li>
            <li> However, all my complaints with the trimmer really stem from that cheap plastic head.    </li>
            <li> dual round shaving head does a great job on my neck.</li>
            <li> The body trimmer adapter works well without much hair pulling and is a smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> While shaving you would enjoy a tickle feeling, but it really not is, but feels amazing.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer provides me with a  far better shave then the Remington ever did.</li>
            <li> It is worth it to have the different options, and it is so nice to have an affordable way to use all of them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always liked them (bought two of the same model)</li>
            <li> I checked out the Philips Norelco YS524 and found it to be equally useful.</li>
            <li> The Norelco’s rotary heads give me a worry free shave and safely shave the back of my neck and also my arm pits.</li>
            <li> My only suggestion would be to have some kind of case to store it in when not in use.</li>
            <li> nice extra heads are</li>
            <li> This unit doesn&#x27;t shave as efficiently as the old one, but as I can run it over my face for 5 minutes or more without the slightest burning sensation that&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> Does a great job below the belt as well, with absolute minimal pulling or irritation.  </li>
            <li> I would buy the 52 pack of Gillett disposables and milk them for all they where worth (the downgrade them to my wife for her legs).  </li>
            <li> Just great lots better thin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Its more like a toy, maybe something an 11 year old could play with to feel adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My old Philips Norelco with three heads shaves better than this.</li>
            <li> like the beard trimmer, and have used it by far the most with and without the attachment.</li>
            <li> I liked the idea of the universal heads on the device.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> over all worth the investment, and with the interchangeable heads</li>
            <li> Works better than his old one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems that the body groomer uses the most power.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even that old &amp; hairy</li>
            <li> As it has all kinds of blade you need, it&#x27;s really useful</li>
            <li> For the price this is really worth it.</li>
            <li> shaver is worth.</li>
            <li> The commercial and website are a complete lie from what I experienced.</li>
            <li> Really worth the money</li>
            <li> The motor simply isn&#x27;t as powerful as higher-end models, and the price reflects that.</li>
            <li> Its not as good as I expected it.</li>
            <li> I have always used regular razors but thought I would try this out to see if I liked using an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I liked that it has multiple attachments and is rechargeable,</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, battery lasts long, and easy to switch parts out.</li>
            <li> I paid a little more than i normally do for these things because I don&#x27;t use electrical shavers but this is a good way to ease your way into one if you have ever considered it.  </li>
            <li> While charging it for a few minutes I noticed the handle got very warm</li>
            <li> The battery power seems to be more than enough to trim both my arms and chest and still get a shave in which has been a challenge for my past trimmers and none of them offered a very good</li>
            <li> All three attach easily by snapping on and can similar detach easily by pulling off.</li>
            <li> Have tried other razors but have not had good resluts</li>
            <li> For some reason when groomer head is attached, shaver power drops and than it just dies w/o Battery warning but then if you replace with the other heads item work good.</li>
            <li> The three heads really help the user get the look they want no matter how unique.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Based on reviews here I opted to get RQ12 head right away</li>
            <li> And the price is right.</li>
            <li> all right</li>
            <li> maybe i wasn&#x27;t using it right</li>
            <li> The rest of the attachments seem to be all right.  </li>
            <li> The rest of the attachments seem to be all right.  </li>
            <li> just right, as when I hold the razor upright</li>
            <li> another go figuring I just wasn&#x27;t using it right.</li>
            <li> its own this thing is a nice little body groomer, lots of nice little attachments, but when you combine it with a RQ12 shaver head</li>
            <li> You might be able to do that with a normal razor and trimmer, but it really makes it a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Run time overall was satisfactory, as I was able to get about three full shaves on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Run time overall was satisfactory, as I was able to get about three full shaves on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So far he is pleased with it but has learned from the first time he used it to use shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It is very easy use overall.</li>
            <li> I havent used other electric razors for body shaving, but does not get a smooth shaves and its average at best.</li>
            <li> really enjoy the multiple heads that make it insanely easy to change between close shave, beard trim, chop sideburns.</li>
            <li> I dry shave mostly or after shower with drop of lotion to smooth.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because my son told me it performed just as he had expected He was very pleased</li>
            <li> I was given a Braun top of the line foil razor several years ago, and it was OK, but I would take out my cheap old corded (very old)</li>
            <li> I have found that I can never get a full clean shave with it and still have to keep my traditional hand razor to clean up remaining hairs that it misses or to hit my sideburns or the sides of my goatee.</li>
            <li> My advice would be spend a little more money and get a better razor without all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> He likes the fact that he is able to use shaving gels and other products with it, &amp; loves the fact that it is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> had a full beard when I got it, so the grooming tool came in very handy for getting my whiskers down to a reasonable length for the two-head shaver, which did a decent job of completing the job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I contacted Norelco, I was told that because the product was so new, they didn&#x27;t have any parts available.</li>
            <li> Hesitated at first with the quality of this product and my hunch was right.</li>
            <li> It mounts in an odd angle/position and I can&#x27;t find a really comfortable grip to use this easily and comfortably.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great shaver at a low price.</li>
            <li> I prefer a slightly scruffy look so a good clipper designed for the face is something I keep my eye out for.</li>
            <li> It never did nearly as good a job as my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> My teen using it in the showers, great for facial hear as well as for body grooming.</li>
            <li> The shaver is very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy clean up &amp; solid grip.</li>
            <li> those parts of your face not covered by your beard or mustache, it is quite adequate, while for shaving your whole face, it gets the job done</li>
            <li> and I am good to go in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> The quick switching heads are very convenient.</li>
            <li> Working very well very useful thanks</li>
            <li> Have not tried in the shower yet, as I usually need the mirror to trim my beard properly, but being able to rinse out everything is great.</li>
            <li> Its a good Idea to keep your normal razor around, at least for the sideburns if you don&#x27;t feel confident using a circle to cut a square sideburn.</li>
            <li> All pieces are easy to clean: just run under hot water and use the provided brush as necessary to get all the excess hair out.</li>
            <li> Tough your face needs some time to get use to the product, once it does is very good.</li>
            <li> I just puff my cheeks press it very gently to my face</li>
            <li> Unlike my beard, my body hair is soft and fine.  </li>
            <li> Unlike my beard, my body hair is soft and fine.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had any other electric razors to compare battery life to, but this one rarely gives me this kind of issue.</li>
            <li> The little panel notifying you of it charging, or needing charge is well placed, and bright.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband and it pretty much doing its job!</li>
            <li> This is his first electric</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, so when I am trimming my hair though, a ton of s</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver in over 30 years.  </li>
            <li> This Norelco Click and Style is the first electric shaver I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> have made it the first trimmer I have ever owned</li>
            <li> On every shave, I need to shave the same area for more than 3 times before I can get all hair removed.</li>
            <li> also I&#x27;ve been a norelco user since they came out with the first body groomer.  </li>
            <li> for the price you can&#x27;t go wroung even if its a first time trimmer.</li>
            <li> Seeing as how this is a known defect and Norelco hasn&#x27;t sent a recall, I give this thing 1 star for only being able to do 2/3 of what it&#x27;s advertised to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the interchangeable heads for different parts of the body.</li>
            <li> Works great bought for boyfriend for Xmas and said it works well with triming and cuts threw thick beard when you let it grow out.</li>
            <li> It is exactly the razor that my husband wanted</li>
            <li> Said it was exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li> First - why is this not a 5 start item?</li>
            <li> We finally settled on this, after reading many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, it sounded underpowered, like the difference between an electric lawn trimmer and a gas-powered one.  </li>
            <li> I found mine for 50, and on day one at least, consider it a great buy.</li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off I got this because it can be used in the shower</li>
            <li> I can shave faster and better with a regular razor with shaving cream.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I think: compared to the Sensotouch 3D and Hyper, the Click &amp; Style is a slower shave, with a smaller compartment for shaved hair, but it&#x27;s vastly better at maintaining beards and shaving body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first charge too, so the battery life seems excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first tried to use it in the shower with my face wash as &amp;#34;shaving cream&amp;#34; but soon realized I could not see what I was doing.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> The razor also is safe to use in the shower, and the battery is rated to last 40 minutes between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not shave as close as my regular electric/ rechargeable razor, but for throwing it in your over night bag, it seems to work OK.</li>
            <li> I feel OK, just from the United States to buy Chinese products are cheaper than China</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the battery losing juice</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, of its three components, the groomer and trimmer options tied for first place in functionality.</li>
            <li> body shaver and trimmer shaved close to the skin and was able to maintain that closeness over curvatures of chest, stomach and back.</li>
            <li> Pry open your wallet and buy something better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Attractive design most likely inspired by Star Trek&lt;br /&gt;-Easy</li>
            <li> But, it did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> This is the fist time I&#x27;ve ever bought an electric shaver, but I definitely like it more than shaving with razors.</li>
            <li> well he is not wrong.  </li>
            <li> so hopefully it will get better later on.</li>
            <li> Would give it more than 5 stars if possible.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK for shaving your face, but if you have any facial hair you DON&amp;#34;t want this razor.  </li>
            <li> have to admit this is my first electric shaver.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i have more of a baby face and tend to only need to shave maybe</li>
            <li> I really reccomend it ti everyone!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my experience with a Norelco, it was the quality.  </li>
            <li> I Have to say that this is my first elcetric shaver</li>
            <li> Nothing about the performance of this trimmer&#x27;s shaver head has changed my mind, and for shaving the entire face it is clearly inferior to any of their more advanced triple headed shavers.  </li>
            <li> The NiMH battery in it charges in a couple of hours and doesn&#x27;t have the slow-drain problems of early (or cheap) NiMH</li>
            <li> It takes a lot longer to shave with this version as you have to cover the same ground more than once.</li>
            <li> was my first ever electric razor to buy, but not the first one to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of my friends electric razors and many of them seemed to be a poor fit for me.</li>
            <li> my first electric razor</li>
            <li> Finally, I&#x27;ve used the bodygroom attachment to shave below the belt for a while now, and it&#x27;s mostly painless if you&#x27;re careful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my first shaver/body groomer but not my first beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had to go over the same area many times because the hairs just didn&#x27;t catch on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would most definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> First off I have to say I like this razor.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer with guard works pretty well.</li>
            <li> not the best strictly as a razor, but it will get you by on weekends or casual days.</li>
            <li> I primarily use mine as a quick trimmer and travel shaver; So my use is not daily.  </li>
            <li> was most excited about this attachment, and this was ultimately the reason why I wanted to branch out from just my old Remington beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> However the other attachments are handy.</li>
            <li> you can live without the charging cradle from the more expensive models, then this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Use it for so many shaving needs, and no matter where I use it, it works great with no pinch or cutting</li>
            <li> Razor head works fine; the beard trimmer also works fine, except that the comb/collar is far too short.</li>
            <li> I also liked the idea of the different attachments that it offers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a couple redeeming qualities that I will mention: The battery life does seem pretty long - I haven&#x27;t drained it yet.</li>
            <li> Today more pieces broke off and the attachment just fell apart completely and can&#x27;t be fixed.  </li>
            <li> Still shaves OK, but much more slowly.  </li>
            <li> came across this Click and Style and noticed the reviews were positive on it</li>
            <li> five - if I want a really close shave, my Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor and hot lather from a shaving mug can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Love it this shaver gave me bumps first time but that was expected cause its my first shaver</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco electric razors for a long time, and usually am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The whole system is pretty well made.</li>
            <li> minor quibble - as many heads and accessories as this has (shaver, three heads, plastic cover, ac adapter, brush)</li>
            <li> The engine doesn&#x27;t sound smooth compared with my other shaver.</li>
            <li> No hair pulling, the rotary shaver works like any blade razor, the other shaver works wonders for the nether regions (no hair pulling, very close shave) and the beard trimmer has excellent length settings, plus everything is waterproof, so all the mess stays in the shower.</li>
            <li> okay, it falls short when compared to the older model I was trying to replace.  </li>
            <li> Fairly quick, complete charge.</li>
            <li> has only 2 drawbacks for me, corded use is unsupported and the battery indicator is so easy to miss when its flashing &amp;#</li>
            <li> The different components snap on and off easily and all worked as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to change the different tops.  </li>
            <li> Really easy to change to different heads.</li>
            <li> The heads pop off easy and I like that the trimmer can be placed on either direction giving you a different angle of attack.</li>
            <li> NOT as easy as the commercial.</li>
            <li> The charge on the battery last a good long while too.</li>
            <li> year later: after owning this razor for over a year, all of its parts seem to be functional and still going strong.</li>
            <li> I would venture to guess, however, that that is because it has a real, powerful motor at work inside it, again, very unlike these cheaply made devices that just buzz a little and struggle to cut through your beard/stubble as you shave/trim it.  </li>
            <li> Certain areas of my face would turn inflamed and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two</li>
            <li> This is a great razor wet or dry</li>
            <li> The only downside is that you really can&#x27;t do fine shaping, like trim the edge of a sideburn, with the circular blades.  </li>
            <li> Accepted it since inner package is sealed and fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall this product is great as long as you want the 5 O&#x27;clock shadow with sharp lines for your goatee/side burns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even easy to trim just enough for a constant 5 o clock shadow look I much enjoy.</li>
            <li> Simple, quick, versatile, and no ripping hairs out of my face!</li>
            <li> The length lock is mechanical and seems pretty steady; it never \\&quot;slipped\\&quot; on me.  </li>
            <li> First or second time I tried to clean the beard trimming attachment</li>
            <li> have used this unit for beard trimming primarily, but also trim other parts of my body like my chest, and down below which this is REALLY good for in my opinion.</li>
            <li> An easy fix to that would be to have both ends of the comb be more open, allowing hair to be combed through one side and fall out the other.</li>
            <li> Have only tried the body hair attachment, but given my previous lack of success with other products, this is already the best in its category.</li>
            <li> only had it for a few weeks and it cuts great</li>
            <li> Big hassle, and a huge head-ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Big hassle, and a huge head-ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very versitile.  </li>
            <li> *** will get caught up in the comb really fast.</li>
            <li> It trims my beard at a very even length.</li>
            <li> Trimmer attachment works very well, and rounded tips  </li>
            <li> And it charged in a reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Very affordable.</li>
            <li> very short.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He has a relatively light beard, and an occasional goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have to go over my face several times to be sure I&#x27;m shaving all the stubble, and no matter how many times I do that, I always end up missing</li>
            <li> The directions say &amp;#34;Do not use while plugged in,&amp;#34; but they do not mention that the unit absolutely will not work when it is plugged in.  </li>
            <li> It works well and hasn&#x27;t really irritated my skin</li>
            <li> It feels very durable and is not flimsy at all.</li>
            <li> It grips very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This was a gift for someone and he always tells me how much he likes it.</li>
            <li> Very versatile, takes care of all the man-scaping of everything.</li>
            <li> you get a high quality shave at a bargain price!</li>
            <li> This item has a trimmer and was reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Quiet, comfortable and flexible.</li>
            <li> Very versatile.  </li>
            <li> This product is lightweight and does not take up too much room.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works very well as promised.  </li>
            <li> i thought thanks</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, works prefect</li>
            <li> shaver works better than i expected all i do is run it under water</li>
            <li> Fast charge, and 1 to 2 weeks between charges.</li>
            <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric shaver at a very affordable cost</li>
            <li> but it appears one of them keeps the top of the trimer closed</li>
            <li> I personally do not like to buy this because looking through the reviews I see a lot of people got it for free (viners).  </li>
            <li> so I could continue to use it--just had to be more careful when cleaning it after that.  </li>
            <li> He said it works very well.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it was so fast</li>
            <li> But the thing that really bugged me is that this shaver doesn&#x27;t have a pop-up trimmer which I use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and the recipient really likes it.</li>
            <li> Gives a close shave especially on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This prutuct works really well</li>
            <li> and I really like how you can just rinse it off after you finish shaving.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping works well and</li>
            <li> I really appreciate the stamina of battery.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and he really enjoys using it.  </li>
            <li> I had to move the whole shaver about to follow the contours of my face, instead of the heads flexing to follow the curves.</li>
            <li> es, that produces a much neater edge to my goatee than the  Click &amp; Style trimmer does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so my face wouldn&#x27;t burn so much after the shave.</li>
            <li> It gives a great close shave, and if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t shave on a daily basis, the battery charge will last you at least a month or more.</li>
            <li> Phillips norelco should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> No hair pulling and very even shave.</li>
            <li> The attachments make it very versatile.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The attachments don&#x27;t do much to salvage the purchase, either.</li>
            <li> Very reliable.  </li>
            <li> I know some people said that the trimmer did not adjust that much</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this product, but</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that it comes with a body hair trimmer as well.</li>
            <li> What I did want from the Norelco was a fast shave that would be passable in case I was in a hurry and needed to look professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if this is because im not used to electric shavers, but this really took me a while.</li>
            <li> It seems like this attachment really drains the juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like this attachment really drains the juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quality-wise, this device is really just a very flimsy, cheaply made personal groomer/trimmer.  </li>
            <li> As a body hair trimmer, it works very well.</li>
            <li> really lives up to the name</li>
            <li> Every attachment works really well.  </li>
            <li> : You really gotta spend some money in order to keep this going.</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and the trimmer/groomer element works better than any I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> love the extra attachments, makes it the complete styling kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find the Norelco foils more irritating then the Braun or Panasonic style, but I also find they work better on longer hairs.  </li>
            <li> And there is a danger this will dissuade some men from having a beard as many of them will be trimmed to a length far too short by this.</li>
            <li> The different attachments are nice so you can style and groom different parts of the body.</li>
            <li> unless I&#x27;ve gone too many days, then I first use the trimmer to cut it down before shaving.</li>
            <li> Having a small carrying pouch is nice because there are several parts that are easy to misplace.</li>
            <li> My hair is really not very thick or course</li>
            <li> Using this razor for basic trimming and a quick shave, while not expecting too much, is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> At first I was a tad dissappointed but quickly got over it as I realized it is actually easier to use this</li>
            <li> &quot; is pretty meh, not very good on its own.</li>
            <li> Its just great, I use it dry and it has never iritated my face skin (though I expected it!!)</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t run out of power during a shave, it just deteriorates quickly to the point where the blades are barely spinning.  </li>
            <li> am glad I chose this one over other products</li>
            <li> I love the other attachments though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to shave more often, due to my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could be better, like the plastic head to the trimmer is ridiculously cheap, and with enough force I can push it down without using the lever.</li>
            <li> You can probably spend more for several different devices to do the individual jobs far better</li>
            <li> The comb settings lock into place and are stable during use and simply requires rinsing under water to clean.  </li>
            <li> The comb settings lock into place and are stable during use and simply requires rinsing under water to clean.  </li>
            <li> And then we have the trimmer, which is great if you haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days and your beard is too long to be shaved by these.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer for my beard and mustache and occasionally to shave those areas of my face where I want a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> But this does well enough to clean up my Duck Dynasty look.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small in size and easy to clean the blades.</li>
            <li> But after a few days I got used to the shaver and was able to get a pretty close shave in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> You just pop the trimming clip off and clean underneath of it and pop it back on.</li>
            <li> I highly encourage this to any guy that wants power and portability!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very usefull and high quality item.</li>
            <li> This body groomer works very well and is high quality.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave head mounts in a more conventional position on the body and</li>
            <li> All I really wanted from Norelco here was less irritation and a more even trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn’t seem to take that long to charge (except for the first charge) and it has always been able to last me through both my beard and neck shaving and</li>
            <li> First off, I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It comes with a full array of Tools, to shave, trim hair above and below the shoulders.</li>
            <li> Now, it only lasts about two minutes on a full charge.</li>
            <li> My facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow extremely quickly, but it is thicker than most other people in my age group, and if I let it be for a week and a half or so most of my face will get</li>
            <li> For me, the &amp;#34;circles&amp;#34; shavers seem to do a better job on those longer hairs down on my lower neck,</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get much better results, that you control, in half the time--They just wont look as cool next to the sink.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that when its low on power it still functions like its full of juice until the last second when it dies.</li>
            <li> I have some really stubborn spots down at my neck that even my razor can&#x27;t easily get where the Norelco really struggled.</li>
            <li> I really like this shaver and find it as easy to shave with as the 3 head, but since I have the other attachments</li>
            <li> It takes me less than a minute to fully run it across my face and get most of my hair shaved up.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that people thought it didn&#x27;t click on well, but I actually was really confident in clicking the different heads on, and off.</li>
            <li> And the length at which it does trim is a decent length.    </li>
            <li> The trimmer (not the foil thing) attachment is also decent.</li>
            <li> and it did a decent job.</li>
            <li> I guess I shave about two times a week for mainly stubble</li>
            <li> The main reason though was that I have a beard and the trimming</li>
            <li> My housemate has an older Norelco</li>
            <li> I will probably look to buy a better, more expensive unit.</li>
            <li> This one does better than others that I have bought for him in the past at a much higher price.  </li>
            <li> It gets decent reviews online</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the beard trimming feature but the body groomer works well too.</li>
            <li> you look at the more expensive one, each head has more holes in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;ve got decent peace of mind knowing that Philips Norelco give me a 3 Year Warranty just for registering the shaver online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent design</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit is a decent electric razor and groomer.</li>
            <li> Does not come close in quality to my older Norelco.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m going for a particular look or anything, but any shaving has always caused acne.</li>
            <li> First I must tell you that I have owned other electric shavers and have never gotten a close clean shave with one.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s great little shaver.</li>
            <li> my old razor died and this came along just at the right time so far its doing everything</li>
            <li> product says its good for wet/dry shave, but to my experience dry shave is not worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome trimmer the only thing i would say is bad is the beard trimmer headed unit keeps popping the top piece off while im shaving only stays on with the attachment</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> but I guess but got it at a price which was a bit high by Amazon standards.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mid-40&#x27;s and have not used an electric shaver since high school.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> id recommend this product highly to anyone looking for something that can trim those pesky hairs so you can look the way you want.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> YES YES I highly recommend this shaver to everyone.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used to purchase philips norelco products, they are a high quality shavers.</li>
            <li> but after witnesing the highly offencive comercial for this product i refuse to use /</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it for electric shaver newbies like myself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RQ12 head it outstanding, smooth and very close shave on my neck without any irritation, its actually night and day compare to my old Nivea razor, but that also could be due to old head running close to 2 years old.</li>
            <li> and i really do get smooth shave like other reviews</li>
            <li> The shaver works fine for a two-head, but the trimmer (main reason for purchase) broke during first few uses.</li>
            <li> In any case you can use the longer combs from other current models, should you happen to own one, like for example the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The click and style is nice, but the only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the razor head for your face doesn&#x27;t get as close as my other Norelco razor.</li>
            <li> the longest selection leaves you with little more than 5 O&#x27;clock shadow.  </li>
            <li> but I was used to having a 3 headed razor which works a little better.</li>
            <li> The body groomer takes a little practice do be able to groom yourself without scratching yourself and pulling the hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item a little more than a year ago and am reviewing it now once it has been used for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The first is that the handle is awkwardly large which makes it cumbersome to hold in all the positions you need to get a proper shave.</li>
            <li> is easy after that.trimmer is sharp and gaurd works well.</li>
            <li> I do prefer some of their other three-head shaver just for coverage, but it still trims hair easily and efficiently.</li>
            <li> So I trim my beard about once a week with this, and so far I haven&#x27;t really had any complaints on that end.</li>
            <li> However, it did do very well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It feels cheaply made, and today it stopped working (it seems to have gotten jammed.)  </li>
            <li> Start with the comb to trim dry and clean hair to a length of 1/8 in/3mm before grooming in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Start with the comb to trim dry and clean hair to a length of 1/8 in/3mm before grooming in the shower.  </li>
            <li> not quite as smooth as I expected..</li>
            <li> I use it to get a close shave near the straight edge of my side burns.</li>
            <li> , it totally surprised me and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working very well thus far.</li>
            <li> The third head, a foil head for body shaving, is something I don&#x27;t use, but I tried it out and not surprisingly it works best if you&#x27;ve already trimmed the long hairs, which you could do with the beard trimmer, and then use the body shaver for maintenance.</li>
            <li> Not even worth shipping it back.</li>
            <li> Love this, I use it everyday</li>
            <li> It might be from the hot water or from me simply not cleaning it as much as I should, but either way</li>
            <li> It might be from the hot water or from me simply not cleaning it as much as I should, but either way</li>
            <li> I am not a guy who trims bald down there, but nice and short</li>
            <li> I were to venture a guess, the other heads probably work just fine but will take some time for those with thicker beards.</li>
            <li> Shave was not near as smooth or comfortable as my previous Nerelco</li>
            <li> The body groomer is nice and helps trim but other than that this thing is for a 13 year old just starting out.</li>
            <li> You will be happy that you did not spend a small fortune on any other razor.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the two other heads do a fine job for light grooming and styling.  </li>
            <li> We used to use razors to do so, but they quickly got clogged, needed cleaning and thus took a long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t sound like a damned vacuum, which is useful if you live with other people.</li>
            <li> It works pretty much the same wet or dry: I don&#x27;t really notice any better shave closeness.</li>
            <li> without the attachment, its work great for the most part, but leaves behind a few hair, here and there that I have to target individually with intent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If I get another 10+ years out of them (I seriously have only the vaguest of memories of purchasing them originally, it has been so long), then I will be in very good shape for a long time to come!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t pay out of pocket for things that other people get for free...</li>
            <li> it is smooth, it doesn&#x27;t prick, pull or even tingle like other groomers have.  </li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;d used Norelco shavers before, this new version caught my eyed on an Amazon ad</li>
            <li> but I can live without it.</li>
            <li> as it was a new one?</li>
            <li> i told myself i wanted a new cordless trimmer/shaver and did some research and came across this one.</li>
            <li> I will be sending it in for a new one.  </li>
            <li> You could also try the new [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Unit is sturdier and more solid than expected.</li>
            <li> Trimming body hair with this attachment was simple enough, and appeared smooth.  </li>
            <li> Trimming body hair with this attachment was simple enough, and appeared smooth.  </li>
            <li> old unit did a decent job of getting the hair, but it ripped my skin to Hell.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as I thought he would enjoy the different attachments and he would be using it not only on his face but body as well.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, the traditional razor and shaving cream method of shaving irritates my skin and prevents me from shaving more than every 2nd or 3rd day.  </li>
            <li> As a habitually clean-shaven man, I might seem a poor choice to review such a product, but a fortuitously timed Great Recession has allowed me to grow a beard in order to fully test the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> much bigger problem IMHO, which cost this product a star in my review, was their redesign of the handle so that it cannot fit into the Back Shave Attachment that comes with their [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The razor head does not cut good with thick facial hair week razor and takes forever.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s very flexible in shaving any parts of the body needed and comes with easily detachable parts--such as a shaving attachment, a beard styler attachment, and a bodygroom attachment (just be careful and avoid excessive pressure when fitting them back</li>
            <li> I thought this product had a bit more duality with grooming, unless you consider super short and shaved good enough variety in trimming lengths you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> He has very sensitive skin 0 and it doesn&#x27;t pull at his skin.</li>
            <li> The face shaver is really good, but it starts slowing down when you use the body groomer, it shuts itself down in 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> The bear trimmer settings don&#x27;t go very long so you can&#x27;t maintain a long beard with this is better for stubble.</li>
            <li> After doing some research and due diligence I have learned some new things: You also have the ability to add some of the heads from the other Philips shavers, this is where it gets really interesting!</li>
            <li> Battery life is really good, I think I only charged it 5-7 times can&#x27;t tell exactly, but I mean it keeps charge for several usage.</li>
            <li> at first it seemed to work well enough.  </li>
            <li> Then i have to go back over with a straight razor to get anything missed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for several years, and this was my first electric razor.</li>
            <li> When using shaving cream, it may be necessary to reapply cream to ensure a thorough and consistent shave.  </li>
            <li> Considering the attachments it comes with this is a pretty big bummer.</li>
            <li> Purchased it 2 months ago and exact same issue.  </li>
            <li> First, add a third rotary shaver head.</li>
            <li> He loves it so far!</li>
            <li> I kept the original blue plastic casing for this trimmer, and keep my attachments and trimmer in it when I travel and it has survived multiple trips in my checked in baggage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;d even be willing to buy the replacement if necessary.  </li>
            <li> Was happily surprised at how well it works!</li>
            <li> I want to replace the batteries, but they cost so much it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it, especially if they are of the same quality as the originals..  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll first mention that I basically use this as a trimmer on the shortest position so my review will only address the trimming head.</li>
            <li> If you grow your hair out, you&#x27;ll have to first use the trimmer with the grain to shorten it out, then go for a second pass in the manner you wish.</li>
            <li> I looked at the specs and noted that the shortest length cut was about 1mm, I would have preferred something a bit closer but it seemed like this was pretty universal</li>
            <li> Attempting to shave your neck and above your upper lip, as many have noted, is simply a lost cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> After waiting another 30 seconds I was able to hit the power button and it came roaring back to life, only to die again shortly after.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit provides a single solution to male grooming needs, as the three interchangeable attachments easily click on and off the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will still stay with my old Norelco and buy new heads for it.</li>
            <li> Should said always cold person be willing to assist you in regular shearings, the potential for peaceful compromise could be greatly increased.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell you precisely how long, because I have a beard and only trim the fuzz every once in a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never enjoyed an electric razor more than this one and my old one was a Norelco too.</li>
            <li> , I had to keep going over the same area to finally get a full shave.</li>
            <li> Both of the devices I&#x27;ve re-ordered may look a bit dated compared to these sleeker looking newer models, but are far more sturdy and functional that this particular device at least.</li>
            <li> in all it is great, the only down side is the screen protector that clips on the razor doesn&#x27;t stay on well and tends to fall off after a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Comparing</li>
            <li> Whether trimming a beard up, keeping it a certain length, dry or wet shaving completely smooth skin (all parts are completely waterproof and you can take it in the shower if you want)</li>
            <li> A beard is a new concept for me - my wife has never really liked that, but I tried it last summer, and she liked it, so I&#x27;ve kept it.  </li>
            <li> It is good for little touch up spots or doing a little manscaping.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a less than smooth face from regular razors but was pleasantly surprised to see that it gave me very close shaves.</li>
            <li> I would be inclined, however, to call this an \\&quot;entry-level\\&quot; product as the plastics and parts feel a little on the cheap side.</li>
            <li> The shaver gives me a clean shave whether my stubble is long or short.  </li>
            <li> Should said always cold person be willing to assist you in regular shearings, the potential for peaceful compromise could be greatly increased.he acreage and thickness of your backwoods, or the presence of a partner willing to help you clear the underbrush on a regular basis, this might not be an issue for you, in which case you can add that star back.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco did a pretty decent job here, and usually got shorter hairs in the first two passes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean and hasn&#x27;t randomly decided to stop working as of yet.</li>
            <li> It keeps a charge very well so far and is lightweight in comparison to my last electric razor/trimmer.</li>
            <li> I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by all 3 attachments:&lt;br /&gt;- shaver, on my skin, gives an equivalent shave to my Norelco 9170XL, albeit much slower with only 2 heads not</li>
            <li> So far I really like the Norelco, everything they said about the different pieces you can put on and</li>
            <li> At least make sure that you can replace the parts if not anything else.</li>
            <li> I got these to replace an old set that I had for years.</li>
            <li> My old razor was a Norelco triple head</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 year old son.  </li>
            <li> I shave my head completely as well as my face.</li>
            <li> Especially for those that want a multi-purpose shaving tool that does it all really well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to every body and the battery lasts pretty long</li>
            <li> both my 19 yr old son and husband have purchased.</li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t completely sold on the trimmer idea, hence I knew he wouldn&#x27;t buy one himself.</li>
            <li> At this point, I plan to keep using the old model until it completely dies and keep this one for traveling.</li>
            <li> It has no trouble shaving any of the described areas that I have tried it on.  </li>
            <li> The beard trimmer trims my goatee very well, but I still need to use a razor very briefly around it and my sideburns.</li>
            <li> B002P9BP3K straight razor]], although don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s practical for my daily shaving routine.  </li>
            <li> It feels light and is ergonomically shaped, and I now use the Norelco as my everyday face shaver.  </li>
            <li> Some plastic piece broke off and now won&#x27;t shut completely.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace my 5+ year old Norelco HS8420 Nivea Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old Norelco gives a closer shave.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer seems to be a bit cumbersome and lacks precision needed for its purpose, but I have only used it for trimming my sideburns and haven&#x27;t used that much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve completely stopped using razors in favor of this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, it worked well until it just unexpectedly quit.</li>
            <li> Too much radical was needed in order to move the device to a different position.  </li>
            <li> It does not shave me nearly as close as the electric one.  </li>
            <li> I will keep using my old electric one till it dies.</li>
            <li> As far as the razor component, it feels as though the unit lacks power to shave.</li>
            <li> I kept my old norelco.</li>
            <li> I need to direct connect now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the side note, I bought this because my old Norelco attachment comb broke during travel.</li>
            <li> when we are too busy to shave we woman need something like that.</li>
            <li> Too much backtracking with the razor head over the same spots to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> and it really surprised me on how well it worked.</li>
            <li> Really something that simple</li>
            <li> You can shave, trim your beard, and completely shave yourself with three attachments.</li>
            <li> And if you don&#x27;t to go completely bald with the body shaver, there&#x27;s always a trimmer you can put over it.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy this product, but after having it for over 6 months, I have only praises.</li>
            <li> One holds a charge for a minute before it beeps loudly and shuts off.  </li>
            <li> I use it frequently for trimming</li>
            <li> After 4 days of not shaving (and my old razor, a Braun, had died after 10+ years of faithful service), I decided to give this thing a try.  </li>
            <li> The Click and Style has 4 settings; the longest is shorter than a 4 (longer than a 3) on the old trimmer.</li>
            <li> it gets the job done and is a very close shave facial or anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I can shave much, much faster with a regular hand</li>
            <li> B0001LQGFG Gillette Venus Divine Sensitive Women&#x27;s Razor]]</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s in the army and needed something to give him a close shave, but also accomodate to his sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The regular shaver attachment doesn&#x27;t do the job very well</li>
            <li> The take away story is that I was really unimpressed, and I&#x27;ll go ahead and review the various components of the device in detail</li>
            <li> Some hairs it completely missed</li>
            <li> : yes, it is indeed loud.  </li>
            <li> Hubby says it is well developed design for a mans face and body.</li>
            <li> I use all three attachments when trimming facial hair and really cant find anything to complain about this tool.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s necessary for me to first \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; the longer stubble on my face with the bare trimmer attachment.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts pretty long, the body attachment works pretty decent also, have not used the other attachment as of now.</li>
            <li> short, if you&#x27;re going to use this every day to shave your face, I&#x27;d personally consider other razors, but if you want a handy travel shaver or something to help your wife trim your back hair, then this thing is tops.</li>
            <li> The RQ12&#x27;s are a little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> The body trimmer head--like the shaver head before it--picks and chooses when and where it descides to actually &#x27;cut,&#x27; regardless of the angle you decide to work with, and the other head is designed in such a way that it make no sense to use unless youre okay with closing your eyes and hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> double head saving attachment leaves must to be desired, with the round design if you are shaving with it near a goatee or side burns, it leaves a buffer zone as it can&#x27;t make clean straight edges.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor/trimmer in a very long time.</li>
            <li> Depending on the length and flexibility of your arms, the acreage and thickness of your backwoods, or the presence of a partner willing to help you clear the underbrush on a regular basis, this might not be an issue for you, in which case you can add that star back.  </li>
            <li> I have bought other shavers before an they were ether hard to clean cheaply made out plastic ,but this isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> When it finally wears out or I decide to get a new one, Philips Norelco will be the brand I choose!</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have ANYTHING better to do than shave, buy something else.</li>
            <li> If I were to shave my entire face I would still probably use a standard razor first and then go over it with the shaver.  </li>
            <li> to say, I have mixed feelings about this, its better than what I have had in the past but doesn&#x27;t satisfies me 100%.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I am sure it was probably said by one of the Duck Dynasty Dudes.me around, which may come in a few years if this one survives for that long, (which I think it would)&lt;br</li>
            <li> to say, I have mixed feelings about this, its better than what I have had in the past but doesn&#x27;t satisfies me 100%.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> But I find I&#x27;m leaning back towards my razor, mainly because I can get straighter and finer lines with my razor rather than with this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> note my review is mainly based around the facial shaving use of it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m planning on sending this back to Norelco for their money back guarantee since I can&#x27;t exactly return it to Amazon in \\&quot;new\\&quot; condition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m planning on sending this back to Norelco for their money back guarantee since I can&#x27;t exactly return it to Amazon in \\&quot;new\\&quot; condition.</li>
            <li> I once tried to shave a penis stencil into a horse with this and the blades were still sharp enough to give me a clean shave and fend off a rowdy Andorian</li>
            <li> Given the low price, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit.</li>
            <li> of the benefits of this compared to the high powered devices is that it is quiet.</li>
            <li> I am able to trim / shave body hair effeciently.&lt;br /&gt;The beard shaver and trimmer and not good at all.</li>
            <li> It charges fast and holds the charge a long time.  </li>
            <li> I am getting the same close shave as I would with a normal razor.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is with the normal razor head.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> So guys, you&#x27;ll need to think carefully about what exactly you want shaved each day and account for the fact you may need to recharge this device to get everything done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Brand loyal for life with this little guy that can get any type of hair anywhere.</li>
            <li> motor on this shaver feels a little underpowered most of the time, like it&#x27;s just strong enough to do the job, but it starts bogging down (and pulling hairs) as soon as the battery starts to run down a bit.</li>

            <li> far it is working fine again, but you have to be delicate.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grow a ton of facial hair and when I do it is usually pretty thin and not very visible, but this electric shaver deals with it quite effectively.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Changing from one attachment to the other is simple and quick, so is cleaning them.</li>
            <li> When it finally wears out or I decide to get a new one, Philips Norelco will be the brand</li>
            <li> The third head, advertised for body grooming is actually a foil head, so while you cna use it for body hair, it really can be used however you like, on the face, neck, etc.</li>
            <li> and I really like the ease of changing out the different heads for different cuts...</li>
            <li> last thing, those commercials are very adolescent and immature given that majority of girls/women don&#x27;t even appreciate facial hair on men.</li>
            <li> last thing, those commercials are very adolescent and immature given that majority of girls/women don&#x27;t even appreciate facial hair on men.</li>
            <li> you have a real heavy beard the two heads might not be that strong.</li>
            <li> The beard styling trimmer is pretty basic, having no vacuum and only 5 length settings: 11/64, 9/64, 7/64, 5/64, and 3/64 inch.  </li>
            <li> Blades are not sharp.</li>
            <li> Other than that, all of the attachments are pretty useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ironically, the battery that I criticized was not the major problem.  </li>
            <li> I am even guilty of using it :) I also like how it is water proof!</li>
            <li> But if you mostly need a face shaver and want rotary baldes, you can get a low-end three-head Norelco that works about as well, and has a pop-up trimmer, for less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Under powered, has a hard time trimming, feels cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never had to work this hard  for smooth results.</li>
            <li> Many other people have noticed that the grooming head will work for a short while then have an odd effect of &amp;#34;draining</li>
            <li> While it generally works well, it has some drawbacks.</li>
            <li> Also, beard trimmers are a bit dangerous at times when it comes to body grooming, so I was interested in  a safe body grooming solution.</li>
            <li> It is completely unusable, and I found myself going back to razors within about a month of trying to get used to using this thing.</li>
            <li> I used a drawstring bag from my old Norelco beard trimmer on a recent trip, but the shaver cover kept popping off.  </li>
            <li> My 15 yea old rechargeable trimmer finally quit.  </li>
            <li> After years of abusing my skin with the old unit I finally decided to toss it and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Norelco also offers a styler attachment, with five length settings to provide maximum choice for facial hair.</li>
            <li> So far whenever my boyfriend uses it I send him back to go over spots that didn&#x27;t trim evenly.</li>
            <li> and I actually followed the instructions and read through it completely</li>
            <li> Take note that it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of all the facial hair</li>
            <li> The Remington did an alright job doubling as a body groomer, but I wanted something that gave me the flexibility to shave bare as well as just trim.</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;m not sure, if this is good on thick hair.</li>
            <li> The other attachment actually shaves better but still not clean.</li>
            <li> I apologize that I don&#x27;t have a long, comprehensive review of this product, but I was unwilling to use it for very long, and that is relevant to why the review is short and only covers one element of the possible experience with this product.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;d been using a decent foil shaver, which always left some neck hairs uncut no matter what I did, and the Norelco gets them all, and gives me a closer shave very comfortably, so forget how it sounds, it works.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps not surprisingly, I also do a fair amount of manscaping to tame my body hair and improve the appearance of my physique.  </li>
            <li> Of all 2 rotary head shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one is the most flexible due to the angled design of the rotary heads.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beard styler was just ok, was not able to get the sharp line that I am used to from a dedicated use style tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer worked fine, the comb was essentially useless since I wanted the closest stubble I could get to really have that 5-o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it daily and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin like a regular razor does.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not it&#x27;s worth shelling out a few extra dollars for a shaver, do it.</li>
            <li> Well, first of all, the shaver is only 2 heads not 3 like a typical Norelco shaver, so it takes longer to shave.</li>
            <li> Throw away the rotary head and only use for general grooming.</li>
            <li> I am a big Norelco fan in general, and found this to be another quality product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get much progress in trimming my facial hair; contrarily, I can hold it the other way with the handle pointing up and it will overtrim.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco has always been trusty, I&#x27;ve had their products for a few years now and this one works exactly as advertised just like the others.</li>
            <li> Alas, I got tired of shaving using razors and bought this, and I loved it since day one!</li>
            <li> I had tried various Norelco three head shavers in the past and have been less than satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe to first experience was due to not charging it long enough.  </li>
            <li> Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Power Razor]], I have always believed that electric razors are for men who don&#x27;t really insist on a close shave (or less facetiously for men whose lifestyle requires shaving on-the-go).  </li>
            <li> if it sits for a few days after a full charge, its empty again.</li>
            <li> While I likes the length it trimmed to (which was lucky because this comb doesn&#x27;t have different length settings), I didn&#x27;t like how hard it was to shave evenly.</li>
            <li> All it would take is a separate snap on collar in order to be long enough (for me; they might need a third for people who trim to a 9 on the old one or longer for the Austin beard set).</li>
            <li> /&gt;honestly can&#x27;t compare this with any thing else other than a normal razor...</li>
            <li> I tried all the tricks like stretching the skin, wet and dry shaving, nothing really made it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> regularly this isn&#x27;t much of a problem, but if you only use it monthly you may find the battery has worn down quite a lot as NiMH batteries self-discharge quite rapidly.</li>
            <li> regularly this isn&#x27;t much of a problem, but if you only use it monthly you may find the battery has worn down quite a lot as NiMH batteries self-discharge quite rapidly.</li>
            <li> Shave by using both straight and circular motions, pulling skin tight where needed.  </li>
            <li> Especially in certain parts of the body where it&#x27;s a little more painful.</li>
            <li> but he likes a much closer shave and said it pulled a little bit.</li>
            <li> As a relatively new beard guy, I can&#x27;t say how well this compares to other models.  </li>
            <li> Gives a clean, smooth shave, without feeling like it is yanking out hairs, or cutting  my face!</li>
            <li> However, it takes a while to power through tough spots and isn&#x27;t nearly as precise as I was hoping.</li>
            <li> So if you want a sub-par shaver that has a good body clip and beard trimmer, this bad boy is for you.</li>
            <li> Each shaving tool in the kit are good, nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> The clipper doesn&#x27;t grab or pull hair and is powerful enough to cut through thick hair.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m not certain why they only made it with 2 not 3, which is the only con I&#x27;ve noted thus far), regardless, I would still purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend, especially if you want to keep a little bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only thing missing from this and main reason for 4 stars is no charging cradle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This unit wont last long enough to get all your grooming done + a shave is the basic gist of this.</li>
            <li> This unit wont last long enough to get all your grooming done + a shave is the basic gist of this.</li>
            <li> gave this to my son as birthday present and next day he gave it to me because one of the blades completely went down, from where it is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> The trimmers on the edge of the attachment ripped out my hair, and after I used my buzz clippers, i thought maybe I could at least shave the stubble down to be smooth.</li>
            <li> : Should you be attempting to share living quarters with a smaller massed, higher voiced person who complains about being cold all the time, this body groomer may offer a solution because I have noted that after removing my fur I feel noticeably cooler and can tolerate a higher thermostat setting.  </li>

            <li> I have been a big fan of the Norelco shaver for a long time,but this model is way below the standers for Norelco.</li>
            <li> I can’t comment on how long they last</li>
            <li> Long lasting battery life.</li>
            <li> I got this razor to replace my Norelco 8140 XL, which is wearing out and is apparently no longer made.  </li>
            <li> the 60$ I payed, I expect it to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The attachments are quality made an seem they will last a long time.</li>
            <li> We went on a month long tour of Europe and this was the only grooming appliance I brought.  </li>
            <li> I can repeat this process for a long long time before the battery actually dies and needs to be recharged for real, only to repeat this process.</li>
            <li> Sometimes when I shaved with my normal 4-blade razor with shaving cream I would still get a few pimples and my face would feel irritated.</li>
            <li> And it’s nice to see the price of replacement blades for the Click and Style aren’t very expensive.</li>
            <li> If u use it and you got some pretty thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap construction is absolutely NOT up to the task of providing even a decent shave, as it pulls and nicks and leaves random full and partial hairs behind after innumerable passes at every conscievable angle with each and every attachment.  </li>
            <li> No man in his right mind would choose such a product unless he was planning to at least experiment with facial hair, and for the purpose of shaving (wet or dry)</li>
            <li> This product is well built and feels as though it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I actually prefer dry</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s old Norelco body shaver finally bit the dust, after a few years of travel, dropping it, and using it for body grooming as well as beard trimming.</li>
            <li> The complete story will not be known until I use it for a few months to see how the blades last.  </li>
            <li> Same crappy battery life on all of them even after a few complete recharges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike their various model single use body groomers which come with three trimmer combs (Numbers 1, 2, 3), this model comes with only a single trimmer comb, the shortest one (Number 1); however, unless your body hair grooming style is Neat Wookie, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  </li>
            <li> If one keeps alternating between attachments, it&#x27;s likely they won&#x27;t be as fix and stable in time, but become loose, since their connectors are made of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> One of the heads did a nice job but cutting my facial down to that coveted 5 o&#x27;clock Shawdow.  </li>
            <li> Like, it took long enough that I think I could have just done a single pass with my safety razor and probably have gotten a closer shave.</li>
            <li> It was less irritating to the skin than my 30 dollar Remington trimmer, but not really that much more even.</li>
            <li> facial shaver attachment blades are designed to last for twelve months of wet or dry shaving.  </li>
            <li> 1 is for facial shave and the other is for trimming the beard and the last one is for shaving the body hair.</li>
            <li> There are lots of beard trimmer/shavers out there, but Philips made its name in body grooming, and what you get here is the very same revolutionary; wet, dry, or in the shower; dual-sided trimming blades with shaver foil in the middle</li>
            <li> For years I used a regular razor and shaving cream because my cow licks on my face had the hairs growing in 30+ different directions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really disappointed overall have had great experience with Norelco in the past.</li>
            <li> When it comes to facial hair, I have never used an electric shaver with my dark colored course facial hair which provided pleasing results.  </li>
            <li> He is a 53 year old retired Air Force Senior Master Sergeant and has shaved everyday for 32 years.</li>
            <li> So instead he would just go about 3/4 days until his beard was too long</li>
            <li> also because there are only 2 heads, there is not much space for it to store the trimmings....  just not well designed...</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to carry additional trimmer on long tours .</li>
            <li> and I found that recharging also did not take too long.</li>
            <li> battery is stout and lasts surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> long battery life</li>
            <li> Long battery life.</li>
            <li> When I charge I let it charge thoroughly for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Click &amp; Style, while not busy subduing Cardassians and the Borg, is a grooming appliance with an identity crisis.</li>
            <li> If you want a long trimmer this won&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Charges well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> As long as the shaver is used (and charged)</li>
            <li> As long as the shaver is used (and charged)</li>
            <li> The battery lasts as long as I need it to.</li>
            <li> Charge lasts long.  </li>
            <li> This shaver works well lasts long on a charge.</li>
            <li> Just takes too long to get a quality shave.  </li>
            <li> But be careful, sometimes when you snap them back in, they are sort of wobbly.</li>
            <li> I really liked the concept and the results of all three of the heads and was highly disappointed that I was going to have to send it back.</li>
            <li> The shaver cant handle the groomer head for some odd reason I bought 1 and had to get a replacement and still item were acting the same</li>
            <li> I really appreciated the fact that the razor did cut as close as it did, as I have tried other electric razors in the past and have come to find that they do not hold up and deliver on the results that they portend.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer worked great, the body shaver pulled hairs out painfully before cutting them, and the razor worked pretty well until it died just 4 months after I bought it and 3 months after I could return it.</li>
            <li> The other accessories don&#x27;t exhibit the same slowness.  </li>
            <li> This was a razor that will allow you to get not only a close shave on your face, but also will allow you to take care of the other parts of your body that need grooming too.</li>
            <li> I have yet to actually talk to them because of voicemail, but was told that they would offer other remedies for the problem.</li>
            <li> have fewer holes for your facial hair to get trap into the blade, hence it&#x27;s cheaper than the other norelco</li>
            <li> so he is only shaving a goatee and a mustache every other day.</li>
            <li> His other one finally wore out.</li>
            <li> It consists of a regular metal shaver/blades like the other two pieces, and also has a plastic attachment that serves as a &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; while shaving.</li>
            <li> It only has 2 heads for the shaver part, but has two other attachments for mangrooming and trimming.</li>
            <li> As somebody coming from a manual razor I decided to give electric shavers a try to speed up my routine and also because I was nicking myself a lot due to trying to shave a lot of facial hair with my razor.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it</li>
            <li> Also the battery can hold very long.</li>
            <li> Set phasers to stunning: you&#x27;ll be a steaming pile of volcanic sex by the time this bad boy is through grooming your facial</li>
            <li> The shaver will not cut or knick the skin, and can either be used dry or by applying shaving cream to the face.  </li>
            <li> Use it dry or under the Shower, it won&#x27;t budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve dry shaved and used gel with this item.&lt;br /&gt;seems</li>
            <li> but it does the job and does it with limited</li>
            <li> 5 shaves in, and every single one of them has resulted in pulled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had been hoping for a single item solution to decrease space usage.</li>
            <li> It takes me at least twice as long to shave with this razor, the shave isn&#x27;t as close and still leaves TONS of stray hairs everywhere (even on the cheek which is never a trouble area for shaving!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lifted weights for years, and would fall into the &amp;#34;significantly above average muscle mass&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> if not better for all sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> My son is new to shaving and was having a hard time using razor blades.</li>
            <li> Plus, it is hard to find new applicators for the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> course, there&#x27;s a separate trimmer head, which does a decent, but not great, job on beard edges, back of the neck,</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and after being let down by a couple of different style trimmers, I decided to try this one out.</li>
            <li> That gives this shaver 3 interchangeable attachments AND the 3D shaving head for less than the cost of any of Norelco&#x27;s actual 3D</li>
            <li> although it only has to heads instead of the typical three a rotary system has it produces an acceptable shave.</li>
            <li> This is such and improvement over the previous Philips Norelco shaver I had.</li>
            <li> When i say this razor with the three attachments, wet or dry shave for $40...</li>
            <li> It can be used for dry shaving, wet shaving, beard styling, and body</li>
            <li> The only con is having to buy replacement razor heads and bodygroom foils twelve months later--which can get pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides being multi-functional, price and wet / dry ability balance out</li>
            <li> /&gt;The shave head&#x27;s ability to be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t dry shave with it, and when you wet shave even then it will not glide over your face.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to buy a Braun trimmer for my next time around, which may come in a few years if this one survives for that long, (which I think it would)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I already had a Norelco shaver with 3 heads that I can use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Electric, wet, dry, safety-razor, multi-blade, against the grain or with</li>
            <li> I got it for was the ability to shave wet or dry while in or out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also dry or wet.</li>
            <li> no more, no less.</li>
            <li> The blades didn&#x27;t stay sharp for long.</li>
            <li> I have only had the product for a little over 3 months.</li>
            <li> You could use the face shaver on your body the same way, although it might be a little slower.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The head is not nice and \\&quot;on track\\&quot; like old triple head style was.  </li>
            <li> The machine was everything I expected.</li>
            <li> YS524/41, when wet shaving, holds water and when tipped sideways all the water runs out vs the &amp;#34;1280X/42&amp;#34; never did that.</li>
            <li> yes it also work wet n with cream.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t leave it on the charger but it is really not working well at all.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected, holds a charge well and cuts my beard and body hair well.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Click &amp; Style has exceeded my expectations in the roughly two months that I have been using it.  </li>
            <li> The shaver is wet/dry, and can be used in the shower and with shaving cream, but frankly if I want to shave wet</li>
            <li> However, this does prove the razor is water resistant and can be used fully wet.</li>
            <li> Since then, I just wet my face after I wash it and shave away.</li>
            <li> one tip don&#x27;t get it too much wet</li>
            <li> Feels sturdy and not cheap, and the charge last awhile.</li>
            <li> I would not use this for everyday shaving because it just doesn&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
            <li> attachments are bulky but not really an issue for me.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that this shaver head is narrow</li>
            <li> I expected the moon from this product just based on the commercials I had seen.</li>
            <li> I always had to drag an electric (Wahl type) trimmer on vacation.</li>
            <li> It does not shave as closely as I would like but that is to be expected with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I wet my skin and then applied shaving cream to my face and went over my face in circular motions as they instruct you to do</li>
            <li> Finally, I just gave up on the idea of shaving everyday.  </li>
            <li> However, in fairness, it was never really intended for this purpose.  </li>
            <li> And yes, I have even used it &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; carefully if you need it do that as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Furthermore, if it does happen to be empty</li>
            <li> I want to shave I go ahead and use a safety razor with BlueBird blades, so I had absolutely no expectation for the Norelco to give me a closer shave than that.</li>
            <li> I tried using the razor to do a partial test trim of the beard, then a shave, then I tried to do body grooming during which the battery died.</li>
            <li> I tried using the razor to do a partial test trim of the beard, then a shave, then I tried to do body grooming during which the battery died.</li>
            <li> I have had issues with my old norelco, which would pull hair and run slow when the battery was getting low.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a long battery life, but i&#x27;m not real pleased with the quality of the shave.</li>
            <li> (Otherwise, shaving with the rotary heads alone, it would take about 20 minutes to shave down the long stubble!)</li>
            <li> Not a very powerful trimmer either.</li>
            <li> Using this left my face raw, and did not even provide a close shave as a mitigating part of that experience (and I tried).</li>
            <li> While the resulting shave was not blade shave close, it was still a very close shave with hardly any missed whiskers and very few scratchy, stubbly spots.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this numerous times to clip my face (except for my goatee) down to stubble and have used the shave head a few times.</li>
            <li> I still use shaving cream out of habit I guess, but when I am tight on time I use it on dry skin and it works just as well.</li>
            <li> I would not let other people try this.</li>
            <li> As a first time user of electric shavers, I was not impressed.    </li>
            <li> I bought it due to included beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> A dedicated trimmer--or even the pop-up trimmer on my other razor does a cleaner job.  </li>
            <li> other issue</li>
            <li> My fiancée got it for me as a Christmas present this past christmas.</li>
            <li> it to Remington&#x27;s and other razors I&#x27;ve had, including a Schik quatro razors, this is the closest and cleanest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten.</li>
            <li> the shaving stick serves me well as I shave every other day.</li>
            <li> ... one other thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other electric razors and none could give a clean/close shave like a manual razor.</li>
            <li> so id say its money well spent !</li>
            <li> The majority of the other reviews here already talk about this razor&#x27;s features so I will skip that and talk about my experiences with this razor.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and he was disappointed after being so excited from the commercial.</li>
            <li> It has other attachments that attracted me to this product which I have found works well.</li>
            <li> but I realised this wasn&#x27;t the case when I&#x27;d put one of the other attachments on and</li>
            <li> shaver head only has two blades as opposed to the usual 3.</li>
            <li> Holds charge over sevens days; shave face every other day &amp; one body groom touch up.</li>
            <li> My other Norelco products have died altogether after about a year and became anemic within a month of purchase.  </li>
            <li> Plus, when you store this thing in a drawer or cabinet there are always bits of stubble left in the heads and attachments that invariably make a mess in the bottom of a drawer or travel bag after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten rid of all my other shavers because of it.</li>
            <li> But it does its job, like all other Philips products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the other blades at all</li>
            <li> Just hoping it will work longer compare to other brands.</li>
            <li> It just plain breaks quickly making it a rather useless product.  </li>
            <li> It takes forever to shave, almost impossible to get my neck smooth.</li>
            <li> He is Active Duty Army, so he has to have a close shave.</li>
            <li> The base handle piece is a bit big and bulky but is comfortable to hold.</li>
            <li> I will say the clipper to cut body hair works fine, but the shaver is bad.  </li>
            <li> I also have extremely curly black hair, so not trimming my beard makes it look like a bundle of hay.</li>
            <li> The body trimmer is hard to use unless hair is very very short.</li>
            <li> Long lasting charge, ergonomic design and made tough.</li>
            <li> it was painful and didn&#x27;t get it smooth.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the lack of carrying case or bag.  </li>
            <li> It barely cuts your facial hair and is does a lousy job at that.</li>
            <li> If you have coarse hair, this sucker is going to rip it out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;We end up having to use the edges of the &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; for body hair trimming, which irritates my skin enough to redden it for a few minutes, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for grooming efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The one negative for me is the fact that the shaver attachment only has two rotary heads.</li>
            <li> you absolutely cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Not worth</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this trimmer is that there aren&#x27;t longer attachments for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle</li>
            <li> This item is far worse than junk.</li>
            <li> It literally took 15 minutes of going as slow as I possibly could</li>
            <li> Seriously, I&#x27;ve used other trimmers and shavers that are basically like a quiet hair drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im too scared to use it down below</li>
            <li> (see trimmings staying contained in shower and going down the drain) and has a trimmer attachment.  </li>
            <li> You have to move it around from every angle (up to down, down to up, side to side...</li>
            <li> (that is, with the handle pointing down)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe any guy should ever shave his legs, but I do shave the arms and chest down</li>
            <li> Having thrown down money for one of those ~$100 electrics, I&#x27;d tell you to save your money.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First I tried trimming down my chest hair with the combed body groomer.</li>
            <li> I understand now why Remington has such a loyal customer base, among whom I now count myself.</li>
            <li> This stopped working after having it for less than six months, not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Am unable to use normal razors due to in-grown hair problem and eventual pimples and black spots.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Updated to add that after using this for 4 years, once a week, the battery no longer holds a charge past a single shave and there&#x27;s no way to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it seems to operate a little &amp;#34;Slow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> only thing that was stupid was that it has an american power plug and I live in the Netherlands...</li>
            <li> I do have a beard, it extends about half an inch off my face.</li>
            <li> so I get my stuff in less then 2 bussiness days.  </li>
            <li> even a half way close shave...</li>
            <li> I typically lather my face using a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> at home or use [[ASIN:B002TSOJGC Jack Black beard lube]] on the go</li>
            <li> Amazon provided a refund less a $10 restocking fee.</li>
            <li> If I could put less than one start</li>
            <li> Been using it for almost half a year now and all my shaving and some of my body hair trimming needs have been taken care of.</li>
            <li> From previous experience with electric razors, I think that is just BS.</li>
            <li> I have to shave half of my face, then re-charge it, then finish shaving.</li>
            <li> Had to stop half way through, and finish with something else.  </li>
            <li> but this one beats it hands down This little beauty</li>
            <li> If you push the head just a little, these blades go down as a button.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but although fully charged, the motor is not strong enough so it cuts slow.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, for regular face shaving, this electric shaver takes twice as long to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> it takes a little getting use to</li>
            <li> , i had a little problem with delevery</li>
            <li> However touch revealed sharp stubble, not exactly appealing for the person you may want to snuggle up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However touch revealed sharp stubble, not exactly appealing for the person you may want to snuggle up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> might take a little  bit</li>
            <li> i can still feel a little stubble on my chest</li>
            <li> this shaver takes a little longer the triple head shavers of Norelco that I have</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is a faint white color that is on the inside of the shaver that seems to have built up over the past year.</li>
            <li> The attachment for the close shave takes a little longer than I expect but it still works well</li>
            <li> I broke a little piece of plastic something when I was cleaning the adjustable shaver</li>
            <li> This razor works fine for about three months, after which the battery starts to crap out.</li>
            <li> While not a huge bother, it won&#x27;t hug your face as well and might take a little longer to get the job done</li>
            <li> A total waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> Trimmers, razors and even a novel hair cutting tool they sell for cutting your own hair (does a quite acceptable job) have all had battery problems within weeks of purchase.  </li>
            <li> ARE NOT AVAILABLE ANY</li>
            <li> While the shaver bodies have changed over time, the round shaving heads themselves do not appear to have changed at all.  </li>
            <li> This Norelco is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The shave toolkit worked for a few months, then it would not turn on.</li>
            <li> The LED did not light and the motor would not turn on.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> trimmer&#x27;s 5 length settings are not working after few times of using...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a waste of $60 bucks.</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months now.</li>
            <li> He has to shave everyday before work so this helps make the process alot quicker in the morning</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> Bought this, a few months ago, specifically for beard trimming and used it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> Shaver is light-weight but not cheaply made, cordless, and waterproof which is why I purchased it.  </li>
            <li> and I use it everyday</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a few uses, I have learned to shave in circular motions.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bog down or slow down at all while fully charged and shaving.</li>
            <li> The other parts feel a little clumsy.</li>
            <li> I will be returning this terrible Click &amp; Style Toolkit ASAP, and have already placed orders here on Amazon for a new Remington MS2-390 Microscreen shaver (which is being phased out, so get one fast if you want one!)</li>
            <li> razor is a typical &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; razor style in which you should theoretically not be able to cut yourself by shaving</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I had a hard time getting hairs around the navel, and before I got to try other areas the battery died on the unit.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I had a hard time getting hairs around the navel, and before I got to try other areas the battery died on the unit.</li>
            <li> With that said it does a decent job of cutting the hair on my cheeks and neck</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was exactly as poor as the first one.  </li>
            <li> Not sure where the little pieces of plastic came from</li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone who will use all three functions will find this less expensive than buying three devices, and it&#x27;s well-priced if you like the SensoTouch floating head design and don&#x27;t mind having only the two heads.  </li>
            <li> I chopped one of my sideburns way too short by accident because the trimmer length is difficult to set and use because of the odd angle.</li>
            <li> With trimmers there is always a fear of getting skin getting caught and nicked pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Really not good quality as expected from that brand.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a blade for the past few years.</li>
            <li> and I usually for through a few shaves before I need to charge it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, I felt like the shaver gave me a very mediocre shave without saving me that much time compared to my safety razor.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this so that I could stop using razors, or at least cut down on the frequency I have to use them.</li>
            <li> only complaint that I have with this electric shaver is that it seems to do an exceptionally poor job with longer whiskers.  </li>
            <li> I opened it up and tryed to put the blade system back in its place, but it all comes to a little plastic piece, very thin which holds the blade in its place.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize that the returns process to Norelco is a bit complicated, and involves waiting 3 weeks before you can send it back, filling out returns paperwork (that you apparently need to call a phone number to have mailed to you), paying shipping on the returns, and waiting 6-8 weeks for your check.</li>

            <li> And aren&#x27;t a delicate little flower of a man.</li>
            <li> The dual razor head gets dull and doesn&#x27;t shave closely after a few months use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this razor.</li>
            <li> Not sure how to deal with this issue</li>
            <li> No more shaving cream and razor blades.</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;m usually lazy about cleaning shavers</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use the dual head shaver</li>
            <li> Not sure of specs</li>
            <li> I noticed a small piece of plastic broke off and landed in the sink.  </li>
            <li> The two heads just don&#x27;t shave as well as the three usually found on Norelco&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I usually have to resort to a blade shave before using the electric shaver again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this time I felt I had to.</li>
            <li> My life isn&#x27;t complicated enough that I need to save a minute or two.</li>
            <li> I usually use this</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t style my beard because I like to look clean-cut, but the five length settings on the styler attachment lets me have a beard that&#x27;s not too out of control.</li>
            <li> They give you a small brush with it to wipe the hair from your attachments and it helps.</li>
            <li> I choose!ced is a faint white color that is on the inside of the shaver that seems to have built up over the past year.</li>
            <li> past shavers I have had.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind it at all because I usually just run it across my face and then switch to my razor to shave my sideburns and anything I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll bother.</li>
            <li> I am lazy when it comes to shaving</li>
            <li> None the less, a tiny plastic piece that holds the cutting head in place broke.</li>
            <li> But for one device that does three jobs, two of which I can attest to being decent, it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Not impressed think they should come up with one that cut thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my 93-year old father did not find it user friendly and was very disappointed with it--especially with all the unnecessary attachments.</li>
            <li> Things are getting a little thick and scary down there.&lt;br</li>
            <li> For aesthetic reasons and keeping it dry next to the sink, we prefer a base</li>
            <li> then the blades get so dull</li>
            <li> It is bulky - which makes it hard for traveling,</li>
            <li> It just sounds like it is having a hard time making the rotary blades</li>
            <li> I have even dropped it really hard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll look to buy the 3headed attachment for a closer shave once my blades go dull.</li>
            <li> so thats not why it&#x27;s become dull.</li>
            <li> instructions say to use it for at least 3 weeks in order to condition your skin and get it used to electric razor shaving.</li>
            <li> now husband for a late Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> What really sucks is that I paid over 70 dollars for it.</li>
            <li> When it comes to using the body groomer head the shaver loses life and continues to do that.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a wet shave would help the smoothness and irritation, but I have yet to try it as I am skeptical of waterproof razors.</li>
            <li> Sucks.  </li>
            <li> He says it sucks and to place</li>
            <li> So, I have stuck with Norelco brand, but I have been having a problem with all their products of late.  </li>
            <li> I am not a hairy man in the least</li>
            <li> the least useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also wanted to try out a 2-head version of Norelco&#x27;s rotary heads because the 3-head versions I have owned always felt a bit clumsy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trimmer blades on this unit are of a fairly coarse design intended for rapid cutting, but at the expense of precision.</li>
            <li> Where it did shave it did an alright job, but not really a close shave as I could still see a faint shadow-beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my bear is a bit thick so one of the attachment get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> Basically it is as slow as a snail</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> he tried it on dries skin his thick beard start coming off immediatly</li>
            <li> so it wouldn&#x27;t pull my hair and even going slow,</li>
            <li> Also, it is incredibly slow to use.</li>
            <li> Before you buy this product just know that is not for men with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I mean you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> so I have been switching over to the body shaver/trimmer, but that failed me too, so now I use a razor if I want sharp looking</li>
            <li> I mean all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trimmed my beard and mustache three times in the past month, and each trim is uneven, with stray hairs sticking out at random angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this engineering failure, kept pulling my hair.  </li>
            <li> Insane packaging takes about ten minutes and a some sturdy shears to actually get at the thing.</li>
            <li> your money and buy one of the less expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry but can&#x27;t say anything positive. :(</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> but this one is no good....  </li>
            <li> Feels as if it tries to pull the hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> I HATED that unit so much.</li>
            <li> You could use it to cut hair but its probably not a good idea.</li>
            <li> body shaver is frustrating, to say the least.</li>
            <li> I have found the comb to be not much use, as not much comes off while using it, and unfortunately without it the blades pull a bit painfully.</li>
            <li> During cutting, the applicators would get jammed in my beard.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it was absolutely terrible</li>
            <li> Disappointed in overall quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the reason I gave this 3 stars is because the motor is weak.  </li>
            <li> On the face it is too weak to give a close or even a close shave.</li>
            <li> The shaver has a tough time dealing with a 2 day beard growth.  </li>
            <li> The 2 head face shaver adapter is a little awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> There is junk and then there is worse than junk.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not great.</li>
            <li> He said that it just does not get a close shave and leaves behind unshaven hairs.</li>
            <li> The retainer clip that holds the rotary blades in the tangs were broken.</li>
            <li> The rotary head does a poor job on face stubble.  </li>
            <li> The device was either broken or this was a feature.  </li>
            <li> have not experienced any of the battery problems others have mentioned in reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Its not great, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is a poorly designed piece.  </li>
            <li> , nicks the skin a lot, cuts poorly, etc.,</li>
            <li> a couple of pieces of plastic within the beard trimer attachment have broken.</li>
            <li> The body shaver/trimmer combo has been useless to say the least.</li>
            <li> Finally, the shave attachment works well, but the gap between the two foils is annoying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found it to be a bit frustrating to get it</li>
            <li> It leaves patches of hair behind and no matter how taut I pull skin</li>
            <li> In fact I usuallly just take the shaver and attachments, leaving behind the charger when I go away for up to a week.</li>
            <li> I was, however, very surprised (and disappointed) that the heads don&#x27;t pivot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands, but always got spotty and sometimes painful results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If it can handle my tough beard and make me a believer in electric shavers then you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> it feels awkward to move this around on your face and its hard to tell where your sideburns  or beard are getting cut.</li>
            <li> The two heads instead of three make for a lousy shave.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to be stuck with a expensive shaving unit and REPLACEMENT PARTS</li>
            <li> This makes trimming extremely tedious.</li>
            <li> The disadvantage with the shaving stick is that is cuts when held at the wrong angle.</li>
            <li> So when the batteries go... the shaver will be useless.  </li>
            <li> Its expensive</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t post this sooner to save some others.</li>
            <li> All three attachments work flawlessly, not cuts, irritation, nothing.  </li>
            <li> This was an expensive trimmer and now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> but this is quite possibly the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Beyond lame.  </li>
            <li> Since the razor is circular it has a difficult time hitting edges like that.</li>
            <li> Shave is almost useless on my face.</li>
            <li> I am revising this review because it has turned out this product is made very poorly from a durability standpoint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed with the poor quality.</li>
            <li> This is THE WORST electric shaver I have ever purchased, HANDS DOWN!  </li>
            <li> I am sorry Nerelco,but you put out a bad razor.</li>
            <li> the motor might keep cutting on it.  </li>
            <li> No fear of cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> the angle of the beard trimmer is a bit awkward.  </li>
            <li> that is good.&lt;br /&gt;there are three kinds of cutting adjusts.</li>
            <li> That is all I know, sorry!</li>
            <li> But VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND REPLACEMENT Shaver foil for this AX525 unit.</li>
            <li> The shaver is really bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really, really bad.</li>
            <li> The shaving attachment isn&#x27;t all that bad either.</li>
            <li> one bad point is that not has an bag to carry.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I thought it must be defective.</li>
            <li> I have get a bad shave with your products</li>
            <li> : I was developing bad irritation after my shave/cut.</li>
            <li> grrrr ...</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so unbelievably disappointed by this item.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit disappointed in the battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit disappointed in the battery.</li>
            <li> find the clipper head very awkward to use.</li>
            <li> then the bloody groomer and the dual circular shaver on my neck.  </li>
            <li> dislike that it does not sit in a base to charge, and instead, you plug into the bottom of it and lie it on its side.</li>
            <li> Annoying, but not a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> It is crap in that dept.</li>
            <li> Hate it.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> but it will not work when the charger is connected, just throw a waring on the charger and for idiots that shock them</li>
            <li> I hated shaving and avoided it until it grew out to the point I looked like a homeless guy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned from experience that using the shaver attachment on a beard is a very painful mistake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with a case/bag, but aside from that I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this razor - the way the pictures are taken, you would think there are 3 heads....  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this razor.  </li>
            <li> I had the worst shave and it does not even shave close.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to help with &#x27;&#x27;close shaving,&#x27;&#x27; and its Terrible</li>
            <li> Very Disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible quality.  </li>

            <li> Great shaver works well get the job done and I quite versatile.great for travelling too.really wished it came with a pouch.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is, hands down, the best razor I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for about a month and all attachments work great. I like the 2 head design better then 3. No shaver burn and if you want an extra close shave use some shave gel.body shaver works well but 1st grooming takes a bit to get through maintaining is easy after that.trimmer is sharp and gaurd works well.</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It is very versitile.  I was supprised at how well it did shaving my face and it is &amp;#34;shower proof&amp;#34; which I put to the test.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> works great it takes a little getting use to but after that is great!would buy it again great value for the price!</li>
            <li> I charged it like it said, but the charge only lasted maybe ten minutes. I called Philips, and they said that I could send it back, and pay S&amp;H both ways, just include the receipt, oh yeah, Amazon didnt send me one, or an invoice, or anything, except my original order number which Philips wont accept. Thanks for a waste of my money...</li>
            <li> I have been a big fan of the Norelco shaver for a long time,but this model is way below the standers for Norelco. I had the worst shave and it does not even shave close. The two heads instead of three make for a lousy shave. I would not let other people try this. I am sorry Nerelco,but you put out a bad razor. I will still stay with my old Norelco and buy new heads for it.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for, fair price, great attachments, close shave wet or dry, amazing charge time (only once a week)</li>
            <li> This product is a great Father&#x27;s day gift! I ordered this for my husband and it pretty much doing its job! He said its not bad, pretty handy too.</li>
            <li> I find that the shaving unit does not do an adequate job-doesn&#x27;t seem to remove hair well-at first it seemed to work well enough.  I use the body grooming attachment and that seems to do the trick.  Maybe the shaving unit will do better at body grooming (lol). If I had known this I would have tried another device.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my Hubby for Father&#x27;s Day. He liked it a lot and the more he uses it the more he likes it. Yea for Me! He is a 53 year old retired Air Force Senior Master Sergeant and has shaved everyday for 32 years. This is his first electric and I think he is enjoying playing with this on his new beard.</li>
            <li> my old razor died and this came along just at the right time so far its doing everything as advertised I know I&#x27;m good for 21/2 years</li>
            <li> great product. trims perfect. amazing battery life. perfect choice</li>
            <li> The shaver is 100 % Great!!! One of the best shaving units I have ever purchased. Gets a excellent A+. But VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND REPLACEMENT Shaver foil for this AX525 unit. Lost All points gets a F-. Just make sure that you do more research when you purchase a shaving unit. At least make sure that you can replace the parts if not anything else. You don&#x27;t want to be stuck with a expensive shaving unit and REPLACEMENT PARTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE ANY WHERE. Not even at their website store www.philips.com/store go see for yourself.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with this product and vendor, highly recommend</li>
            <li> My son loves the razor. He has very sensitive skin 0 and it doesn&#x27;t pull at his skin.</li>
            <li> not the best, but works good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that accurate.</li>
            <li> love it  I have a beard and its perfect for me</li>
            <li> shaves face, works nice, super versitile.  i can go stubble, trim my crappy side burns, back.. all of it!</li>
            <li> The razor head does not cut good with thick facial hair week razor and takes forever. Not impressed think they should come up with one that cut thick facial hair.</li>
            <li> Got it for my son and he loves it!</li>
            <li> As a first time user of electric shavers, I was not impressed.    The overall build quality is very good. It feels really nice in the hand, has a really good premium finish all over. I read some reviews that people thought it didn&#x27;t click on well, but I actually was really confident in clicking the different heads on, and off. The little panel notifying you of it charging, or needing charge is well placed, and bright. The whole thing just has a nice feel to it.    The shaver is really bad. It&#x27;s really, really bad. Had to literally hold the thing to my skin for a good minute before it actually cleaned the stubble off my face. It is completely unusable, and I found myself going back to razors within about a month of trying to get used to using this thing. I currently have not used the shaving head for about 4 months.    The body hair trimmer is okay. I&#x27;m a pretty hairy guy, so when I am trimming my hair though, a ton of s*** will get caught up in the comb really fast. An easy fix to that would be to have both ends of the comb be more open, allowing hair to be combed through one side and fall out the other. This is however not the case, and after trimming for a very short amount of time, I will find myself pulling the comb off, dumping all the hair, and combing again. This makes trimming extremely tedious. But, it works. And the length at which it does trim is a decent length.    The beard trimmer is my favorite part. I do have a beard, it extends about half an inch off my face. I also have extremely curly black hair, so not trimming my beard makes it look like a bundle of hay. So I trim my beard about once a week with this, and so far I haven&#x27;t really had any complaints on that end. It could be better, like the plastic head to the trimmer is ridiculously cheap, and with enough force I can push it down without using the lever. However, all my complaints with the trimmer really stem from that cheap plastic head.    At the end of the day I wish I had returned this, and just bought a good beard trimmer.    If you&#x27;re looking for a good starter to electric shaving, don&#x27;t get this.    If you&#x27;re looking for an okay body, and beard trimmer, consider this as an option.</li>
            <li> i love this product i can save , trim all the excess hair on my body. the shaver works great and the hair trimmers are great too&lt;br /&gt;and it is reasonabley priced</li>
            <li> This is a great razor wet or dry and it get&#x27;s a close shave. Great price for the money spent.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used. Each different attachment does its job. Could not ask for a better razor. Even if I could ask for a better razor, I wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I got these to replace an old set that I had for years. These are much better quality and the battery life is great. I lave that they are water proof. If you are on the fence buy them they are great.</li>
            <li> I love that i can use this in the shower, makes grooming more easy. The charge on the battery last a good long while too.</li>
            <li> My old razor was a Norelco triple head but this one beats it hands down This little beauty does it all</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver in over 30 years.  It does the job and no blood!!  I should have done this years sooner.</li>
            <li> The machine was everything I expected. Tough your face needs some time to get use to the product, once it does is very good. I am getting shaves like I never did before with regular razors. I bought one for my brother too, and he is like a child with.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 17 year old son.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come close to the quality of shave that &amp;#34;Philips Norelco 1280X/42 SensoTouch&amp;#34; does.&lt;br /&gt;The YS524/41, when wet shaving, holds water and when tipped sideways all the water runs out vs the &amp;#34;1280X/42&amp;#34; never did that.</li>
            <li> had three head shavers for years.this model has two heads that seem to fit my face better.easy to clean and good close shave.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my son but he told me he liked it very much and use it for the whole body.  That is all I know, sorry!</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> This Norelco Click and Style is the first electric shaver I have ever owned. I tried using a friends “foil” style shaver several years ago and didn’t like the shave it gave my face.&lt;br /&gt;I am a blade shaver. I shave my head completely as well as my face. For the last year or so I’ve been growing a stubble type beard but have continued shaving my head and neck with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;In order to keep my beard at a shorter length I have been using a Remington beard trimmer but it has quickly lost it’s battery life and blade sharpness so I decided to try out a different brand electric beard trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I came across this Click and Style and noticed the reviews were positive on it so I decided to give it a try. I also liked the idea of the different attachments that it offers. I figured I could use the beard Styler “trimmer” to replace my Remington and use the shaver head for my neck. I don’t do a lot of “below the neck line” shaving but figured I might start if I had a good shaver to use. Things are getting a little thick and scary down there.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to use it for at least 3 weeks in order to condition your skin and get it used to electric razor shaving. After 1 week of use I have been extremely happy with the results I’m getting from the Norelco, even without any shaving cream or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;The dual round shaving head does a great job on my neck. The beard trimmer provides me with a  far better shave then the Remington ever did. It trims my beard at a very even length. I saw that some people had issues with the beard comb that Norelco either didn’t provide or whatever. The beard comb that came with mine works great. No issues there at all.&lt;br /&gt;The battery life on it has been more then adequate as well. It doesn’t seem to take that long to charge (except for the first charge) and it has always been able to last me through both my beard and neck shaving and then some.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I find that it doesn’t do well is shave my head. I don’t think the face shaving attachment can articulate enough to provide a good close shave on a head. Either that or I am so used to getting a super close shave with my Headblade that nothing compares. I’m not concerned about the head shaving though, it was just something I thought I would try.&lt;br /&gt;Changing from one attachment to the other is simple and quick, so is cleaning them. It&#x27;s a comfortable shaver to hold and use. It&#x27;s quiet and feels solid.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this shaver. Especially for those that want a multi-purpose shaving tool that does it all really well. And it’s nice to see the price of replacement blades for the Click and Style aren’t very expensive. I can’t comment on how long they last but I won’t mind replacing them for what they cost.</li>
            <li> Unit is sturdier and more solid than expected. Attachments click in solidly and are nicely stable, and remove easily. A 3-head shaver would have been nicer than the included 2-head, but it gets the job done well enough. Beard trimmer works well, but the included length guard does not allow for beards longer than about one week of growth. Trimmer attachment works very well, and rounded tips  have made it the first trimmer I have ever owned that did not nick me, but it uses battery the most of all the attachments. Have not tried in the shower yet, as I usually need the mirror to trim my beard properly, but being able to rinse out everything is great. Overall battery life is good. All in all, a good multipurpose shaving system, and I am pleased with results and the price. Would recommend, especially for travel.</li>
            <li> Dissapointed with the result. After 5th shave I still can not get a close shave. On every shave, I need to shave the same area for more than 3 times before I can get all hair removed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed in this razor. The first time I used it, it was absolutely terrible but I decided to give it some more time because of that whole &amp;#34;adjust to your face&amp;#34; thing that razor companies claim. So I used it for about two months - it did get better but never got to an acceptable level. It takes me at least twice as long to shave with this razor, the shave isn&#x27;t as close and still leaves TONS of stray hairs everywhere (even on the cheek which is never a trouble area for shaving!). I tried all the tricks like stretching the skin, wet and dry shaving, nothing really made it better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple redeeming qualities that I will mention: The battery life does seem pretty long - I haven&#x27;t drained it yet. And it charged in a reasonable time. The trimmer (not the foil thing) attachment is also decent. I used on on the back of my neck and for sideburns and it did a decent job. I haven&#x27;t tried the body shaver yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is truly a &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34; scenario. My hair is really not very thick or course and I cannot give a good shave from this thing which is surprising. I&#x27;ll be going back to my Panasonic for regular shaving purposes - no questions. My advice would be spend a little more money and get a better razor without all the bells and whistles.</li>
            <li> Check out the video  So I was convinced to try dollar shave club after seeing all those cool commercials and checking out the website .So this is my opinion comparing years of using the Gillette razors vs Dollar Shave Club mid range 4x razor    [...]</li>
            <li> Only 2 heads but still provides a comfortable shave. I like the look too.</li>
            <li> After only two shaves the shaver would not hold a charge. However, it did do very well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This shaver cuts fine but although fully charged, the motor is not strong enough so it cuts slow.  The motor doesn&#x27;t sound like buzzzz but instead brrrrr.  I would not buy again</li>
            <li> I love it. let me start with that I&#x27;m a prime member so I get my stuff in less then 2 bussiness days.  also I&#x27;ve been a norelco user since they came out with the first body groomer.  they certainly have made some great improvements over the years.  This thing works for over 40min on a full charge. the the 3 heads are a great idea. I actully use the trimmer on my head n facial beard. then the bloody groomer and the dual circular shaver on my neck.  takes some time to get the neck use to it.  but it does leave u smooth to the touch I&#x27;d done right. yes it also work wet n with cream.  for the price you can&#x27;t go wroung even if its a first time trimmer.</li>
            <li> The grooming head has a known defect. Many other people have noticed that the grooming head will work for a short while then have an odd effect of &amp;#34;draining the battery to nothing&amp;#34; except once you replace the head with a different one, the shaver will work again. Seeing as how this is a known defect and Norelco hasn&#x27;t sent a recall, I give this thing 1 star for only being able to do 2/3 of what it&#x27;s advertised to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated to add that after using this for 4 years, once a week, the battery no longer holds a charge past a single shave and there&#x27;s no way to replace the battery. Junk.</li>
            <li> There is junk and then there is worse than junk. This item works for about 10 days then the blades get so dull you could not cut the fuzz off a peach. This item is far worse than junk.</li>
            <li> i reckon it is attractive in price and quality. i like the brand of the philips.</li>
            <li> I like remington 3 head cut better, however the other attachments are great.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer I got it with a christmas gift card and it is by far the best trimmer I have used. I love the interchangeable heads for different parts of the body. Its easy to use and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great bought for boyfriend for Xmas and said it works well with triming and cuts threw thick beard when you let it grow out.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver. Very affordable. Clean shaves easy and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t irritate skin. Different shaver heads, cleaning tools, everything you need in a compact device. Long lasting battery life. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Giving it 3 stars because the body shaver is amazing. I am able to trim / shave body hair effeciently.&lt;br /&gt;The beard shaver and trimmer and not good at all. I still had to use my razor blade after using this beard shaver</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great shaver at a low price. The double-head isnt great, but per one of the other reviews I purchased an RQ12 head (the SensoTouch 3D head) and it DOES fit and work perfectly on this shaver. That gives this shaver 3 interchangeable attachments AND the 3D shaving head for less than the cost of any of Norelco&#x27;s actual 3D razors.&lt;br /&gt;If you can live without the charging cradle from the more expensive models, then this is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Everything is fine i dont have any complaine for this product, i had a little problem with delevery but in the end everything was fine</li>
            <li> Great product no complants and the different heads are great to I would recommend to every body and the battery lasts pretty long</li>
            <li> Wonderful shaver... both my 19 yr old son and husband have purchased.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Leaves a smooth shave every time. My husband uses it every day and has stated that he will never use a regular razor again. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> It is exactly the razor that my husband wanted and he got it as a Father&#x27;s Day present from his children. Happy with it.</li>
            <li> Great product! I bought this for my fiance/now husband for a late Christmas gift. This is his first shaver/trimmer and he LOVES IT! He wasn&#x27;t completely sold on the trimmer idea, hence I knew he wouldn&#x27;t buy one himself. So instead he would just go about 3/4 days until his beard was too long and then just shave it all off again. Now this is great and so easy because he just trims it up every 2/3 days when he feels he needs to. It takes no time at all. I would recommend this more so as a trimmer than a shaver. It doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor but it does a great job as a trimmer with multiple length settings, more than adequate adjustment and easily trims side burns as well. This product is well built and feels as though it will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to help with &#x27;&#x27;close shaving,&#x27;&#x27; and its Terrible I have to go over and over and over to get even a half way close shave...Then i have to go back over with a straight razor to get anything missed! Very Disappointed! Would not recommend!!</li>
            <li> My nephew is in the Army so he is always in need do a quick shave. He loves using it in the shower and gives him a good share. He is looking forward to bringing this with him while out in the field with the Army so he doesn&#x27;t have to use a disposable razor and canteen water to shave. It is very easy use overall.</li>
            <li> I prefer a slightly scruffy look so a good clipper designed for the face is something I keep my eye out for. I&#x27;ve used this numerous times to clip my face (except for my goatee) down to stubble and have used the shave head a few times. I have not used the body grooming head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the clipper head very awkward to use. It mounts in an odd angle/position and I can&#x27;t find a really comfortable grip to use this easily and comfortably. With that said it does a decent job of cutting the hair on my cheeks and neck very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave head mounts in a more conventional position on the body and although it only has to heads instead of the typical three a rotary system has it produces an acceptable shave. It isn&#x27;t the closest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had but it does the job and does it with limited irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body grooming head I have not tried. I do no body grooming or sculpting and the head is designated for use below the neck only so I have no experience with that facet of the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all... It&#x27;s not great. But for one device that does three jobs, two of which I can attest to being decent, it isn&#x27;t bad. You can probably spend more for several different devices to do the individual jobs far better but this would be good for throwing in the gym bag or keeping in the office desk for that quick touch-up.</li>
            <li> This razor works. Buy it and be happy. Love or like loves you. Smoothly, deeply, effectively pulling hair from akin. Why by anything anywhere else?</li>
            <li> So disappointed with this item. Shaves ok. Does not give a close shave when trimming sideburns. Returned for a full refund.</li>
            <li> Got this for my son - his last one died after several years. Loves the shaver and that&#x27;s why he wanted the same one again.  Great price and came quickly and securely.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for the grandson. He loves it. Said it was exactly what he was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have only had the product for a little over 3 months. I have only used it maybe 10 times and now the battery wont keep a charge. I don&#x27;t leave it on the charger but it is really not working well at all. What really sucks is that I paid over 70 dollars for it.</li>
            <li> First - why is this not a 5 start item? It is bulky - which makes it hard for traveling, For traveling I recommend smaller 2 disc (2 rotary heads) shavers with AA batteries which won&#x27;t run out suddenly (it&#x27;s also easy to accidentally press the power button on this model when traveling) . Also, the style and groom attachments are inferior to the shaver. If one keeps alternating between attachments, it&#x27;s likely they won&#x27;t be as fix and stable in time, but become loose, since their connectors are made of plastic.&lt;br /&gt;Now the good thing: I find myself preferring the 2 rotary head shavers over the 3 rotary head shavers as they allow extra flexibility around the nose, neck and close to the ears. Of all 2 rotary head shavers I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one is the most flexible due to the angled design of the rotary heads. Philips Norelco has been my favorite brand for shaving tools for many years now.</li>
            <li> Like many of the women in Vine, I chose this item and asked my husband to try it. He has a relatively light beard, and an occasional goatee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His verdict: Not good. He said that it just does not get a close shave and leaves behind unshaven hairs. He thought that someone with a heavier beard might find this a good tool. But for him, it just was not the shaver that he needed or wanted. He immediately went back to his razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be an item to examine or try in-store before purchasing.</li>
            <li> I got this razor to replace my Norelco 8140 XL, which is wearing out and is apparently no longer made.  I also own a beard/mustache trimming set, and I thought this one new unit could replace them both.  I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the heads are only single-cut.  I didn&#x27;t realize how good the triple-blade heads were until I tried to use these single-cut blades.  They do not measure up.  I have to go over my face several times to be sure I&#x27;m shaving all the stubble, and no matter how many times I do that, I always end up missing something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit also cannot be used while it&#x27;s plugged in.  The directions say &amp;#34;Do not use while plugged in,&amp;#34; but they do not mention that the unit absolutely will not work when it is plugged in.  The battery died in the middle of a shave one night, I tried to plug it in and continue using it - nothing.  So...lesson learned.  Don&#x27;t let the battery run dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard/mustache trimming attachment also does not measure up to the standalone unit I have.  I&#x27;ve trimmed my beard and mustache three times in the past month, and each trim is uneven, with stray hairs sticking out at random angles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used the body hair trimmer, so I can&#x27;t speak to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, while this unit is very pretty (even the packaging was shiny and high-tech looking) and it works okay, it falls short when compared to the older model I was trying to replace.  At this point, I plan to keep using the old model until it completely dies and keep this one for traveling.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as described.</li>
            <li> This has been a great razor.  It has no trouble shaving any of the described areas that I have tried it on.  The interchangeable heads allow it to cover (or should I say uncover) a variety of surfaces with ease.  I would buy again and recommend if asked.</li>
            <li> It works well and hasn&#x27;t really irritated my skin but it doesn&#x27;t give as close of a shave as in used to so now I have to go from shaving ever 2 weeks to every 3 days.</li>
            <li> The retainer clip that holds the rotary blades in the tangs were broken. Other than that it&#x27;s great little shaver.</li>
            <li> No speed in the rotors. Insane packaging takes about ten minutes and a some sturdy shears to actually get at the thing. Avoid this one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great, in or out of the shower. This product comes with three different detachable heads, all of which work wonders. I use this for an every morning shave being in the Army and it shaves close enough to pass a shave inspection all day any day without causing any razor burn or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend&#x27;s old Norelco body shaver finally bit the dust, after a few years of travel, dropping it, and using it for body grooming as well as beard trimming. We finally settled on this, after reading many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were worried about the durability, seeing as how you will be switching out the heads. A few weeks in, and everything fits perfectly still. It feels very durable and is not flimsy at all. The connection between the heads and the body is strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most pleasant surprise is that it is extremely comfortable to hold. It grips very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We dislike that it does not sit in a base to charge, and instead, you plug into the bottom of it and lie it on its side. For aesthetic reasons and keeping it dry next to the sink, we prefer a base charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The heads are easy to switch out, and each of them work very well and are easy to clean. The adjustments are easy to make, and the combs work well, too. We are happy with each of the different performances and options, and they all get used. We made do with just one option before, because we didn&#x27;t want to purchase several trimmers/shavers. Never again! It is worth it to have the different options, and it is so nice to have an affordable way to use all of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry this review is a bit scattered. We are very happy with the purchase, and it is easy to use for me as a partner carefully following the back of the neck and for him as a years-long trimmer.</li>
            <li> The razor seems to work well, but I do not  get a close shave. Have tried other razors but have not had good resluts</li>
            <li> great overall product except the 2 cut shaver piece but you can change that to a 3 cut by buying the head as the are interchangeable</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed by this razor - the way the pictures are taken, you would think there are 3 heads....  there are only 2!  and 2 simply do not get the job done.....  and you have to unplug it each time you use it!  I like Norelco products but this one is no good....  also because there are only 2 heads, there is not much space for it to store the trimmings....  just not well designed...</li>
            <li> I used this a total of five times. And it butchered my face. Which  amazed me. Because it is a electric razor. Returned it. Amazon is always exceptional when it comes to customer service. Super easy to return. Purchased a DE Parker 99r safety razor. And all the fixing that go with it. If you are looking for a great shave. And aren&#x27;t a delicate little flower of a man. Get a safety razor. The best shave off your life is waiting for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a year, and I&#x27;m going to throw it out.  It feels cheaply made, and today it stopped working (it seems to have gotten jammed.)  It never did nearly as good a job as my previous Norelco.</li>
            <li> Everything I expected, holds a charge well and cuts my beard and body hair well. Has all the attractments and adjustable length is cool</li>
            <li> It is very useful. Also the battery can hold very long. The most important is that after using it you won&#x27;t feel any pain.</li>
            <li> I always used Norelco shavers. This one has a flimsy head. I bought it due to included beard trimmer. You don&#x27;t have to carry additional trimmer on long tours . Did not use its body hair trimmer so offer no comments.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a trimmer. It&#x27;s also easy to clean and hasn&#x27;t randomly decided to stop working as of yet. It&#x27;s what you need and not what you don&#x27;t. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Please do not buy this item as is DEFECTIVE. Item works well with all heads except groomer head. For some reason when groomer head is attached, shaver power drops and than it just dies w/o Battery warning but then if you replace with the other heads item work good. The shaver cant handle the groomer head for some odd reason I bought 1 and had to get a replacement and still item were acting the same so i just ask for a refund..</li>
            <li> This shaver just doesn&#x27;t have enough power for shaving. The rotary head does a poor job on face stubble.  On the other hand, the two other heads do a fine job for light grooming and styling.  Throw away the rotary head and only use for general grooming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for several years, and this was my first electric razor. I agree with most of the reviews already written. It&#x27;s convenient, gives me a pretty smooth shave, and has good battery life and features. However, it takes a while to power through tough spots and isn&#x27;t nearly as precise as I was hoping. The beard trimmer trims my goatee very well, but I still need to use a razor very briefly around it and my sideburns.</li>
            <li> I think I should have gotten three heads.However the other attachments are handy. I also would prefer to have had a stand .</li>
            <li> works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;3 interchangeable heads, close shave, battery indicator, easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;tough to trim around a beard with, but with some practice it can be done</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer seems to do a better job of body grooming than the body grooming tool, but otherwise this is great</li>
            <li> The device was either broken or this was a feature.  I could not get this device to chage up.&lt;br /&gt;I try several outlets but no luck.</li>
            <li> This is a versatile tool.  Good for use at home and while traveling.  Easy to clean, store, and recharge.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> I just picked up a Philips Norelco Click and Style. Great product! Gives a clean, smooth shave, without feeling like it is yanking out hairs, or cutting  my face! It is fairly quiet and very simple to use! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Bought this item as a birthday gift for my husband two weeks ago, and he loves it.so far so good.</li>
            <li> My husband says: I choose four out five stars because it is three tools in one with two out of the three functions performing well.  The body clip and beard shaver functions work well but the shaver is sub-par for Norelco standards.  There are only two shaver heads and they have only one direction for flexing to accommodate facial features.  When compared to my three headed Norelco shaver, this shaver just can&#x27;t cut close enough and doesn&#x27;t flex as well.  So if you want a sub-par shaver that has a good body clip and beard trimmer, this bad boy is for you.</li>
            <li> I like trimmers and tools for maintaining facial and body hair.  When it comes to facial hair, I have never used an electric shaver with my dark colored course facial hair which provided pleasing results.  I typically lather my face using a [[ASIN:B000WB4WVK badger silvertip shaving brush]] at home or use [[ASIN:B002TSOJGC Jack Black beard lube]] on the go and then shave with a [[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion proglide razor]].  I&#x27;m also preparing to learn to shave with a [[ASIN:B002P9BP3K straight razor]], although don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s practical for my daily shaving routine.  Shaving at the gym before work is more about convenience and efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Philips Norelco YS524/41 click &amp; style shave toolkit, made in used China, uses a click on/off attachment system with a facial shaver, beard styler, and bodygroom shaver/trimmer.  The shower proof, 100-240 volt razor takes an hour to charge and lasts for about 40 minutes of use.  The razor is light in the hand and its contours provide comfortable holding.  Registering the Philips Norelco YS524/41 shaver provides a 6 month warranty extension, plus shows tips and an instructional video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial shaver attachment blades are designed to last for twelve months of wet or dry shaving.  While the shaver bodies have changed over time, the round shaving heads themselves do not appear to have changed at all.  Shave by using both straight and circular motions, pulling skin tight where needed.  The shaver will not cut or knick the skin, and can either be used dry or by applying shaving cream to the face.  When using shaving cream, it may be necessary to reapply cream to ensure a thorough and consistent shave.  Philips Norelco recommends using the shaver three times a week for several weeks so the face can adapt to this type of shaving and provide the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard styler with five length settings from 3/64 - 11/64 inches or 1 - 4.5mm is perfect for creating well kept stubble.  I trim my beard with a #3 comb on a set of Walh clippers, which cuts to a 3/8&amp;#34; or 9mm length.  The comb settings lock into place and are stable during use and simply requires rinsing under water to clean.  The maximum beard styler setting gets no where close to the length i need for trimming. Although, for those with a stubble length beards, this shaver kit may provide all in one convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodygroom shaver/trimmer uses rounded combs and tips to prevent skin irritation, and supposedly provide reliably smooth grooming anywhere below the neckline.  Start with the comb to trim dry and clean hair to a length of 1/8 in/3mm before grooming in the shower.  Unlike my beard, my body hair is soft and fine.  Trimming body hair with this attachment was simple enough, and appeared smooth.  However touch revealed sharp stubble, not exactly appealing for the person you may want to snuggle up with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, shaving with a razor at the gym is just as convenient, more efficient, and provides smoother results than using an electric razor.  If you have course facial hair and are looking for a great shave, the Philips Norelco YS524 will probably disappoint.  However if you&#x27;re simply looking for a convenient no fuss shave on the go, the Philips Norelco YS524 may be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;45 day money back guarantee&lt;br /&gt;Full 2-2.5 year warranty coverage&lt;br /&gt;Cordless and shower proof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Could provide better resultsrd with a #3 comb on a set of Walh clippers, which cuts to a 3/8&amp;#34; or 9mm length.

            <li> The Philips Norelco Click &amp; Style has exceeded my expectations in the roughly two months that I have been using it.  Since growing a beard for the first time 8 or so years ago, I have missed how smooth my cheeks would get using my Norelco three-head shaver.  The two-head shaver option on the Click &amp; Style works as well as my old Norelco did, leaving my cheeks smooth and feeling great after a bit of moisturizing after shave.  The styler works perfectly for trimming my beard, though be warned that the guard does not extend out as far as most dedicated beard trimmers (I usually use the maximum setting, unless I&#x27;ve just had a haircut).  The BodyGroom attachment is convenient and works well, but does not compare with a manual razor for clearing everything &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34;.  Still, it cleans things up nicely without nicks or scratches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not experienced any of the battery problems others have mentioned in reviews.  It&#x27;s still running on its initial charge after two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the lack of carrying case or bag.  This wouldn&#x27;t be as big of an issue if the two-head shaver&#x27;s cover stayed on.  I used a drawstring bag from my old Norelco beard trimmer on a recent trip, but the shaver cover kept popping off.  Annoying, but not a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> Good product but I guess but got it at a price which was a bit high by Amazon standards. Nevertheless the packaging was great and delivery timelines matched the estimates. It was a gift for my nephew and I may come back after some time after he Fbs me.</li>
            <li> I bought it in September, 2013 and it&#x27;s still working like a charm. Battery life is really good, I think I only charged it 5-7 times can&#x27;t tell exactly, but I mean it keeps charge for several usage. I&#x27;m a heavy user and I shave frequently so this product is operating so far so good. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This Norelco face and body shaver and beard trimmer is a good deal if you plan to use all three functions.  The face shaver is a two-headed version of Norelco&#x27;s SensoTouch 2D flexing shaving head, and it works well on my face.  When I first turned it on, it sounded underpowered, like the difference between an electric lawn trimmer and a gas-powered one.  But I&#x27;d been using a decent foil shaver, which always left some neck hairs uncut no matter what I did, and the Norelco gets them all, and gives me a closer shave very comfortably, so forget how it sounds, it works.  It feels light and is ergonomically shaped, and I now use the Norelco as my everyday face shaver.  I don&#x27;t find the fact that it has only two heads to be a problem at all.  You can substitute a three-rotor SensoTouch head if you want, but unless you already have one I don&#x27;t think buying one is worthwhile.  The shaver is wet/dry, and can be used in the shower and with shaving cream, but frankly if I want to shave wet I&#x27;ll use a blade.  The only downside is that you really can&#x27;t do fine shaping, like trim the edge of a sideburn, with the circular blades.  There&#x27;s no pop-up trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, there&#x27;s a separate trimmer head, which does a decent, but not great, job on beard edges, back of the neck, etc., and it comes with an adjustable guide that allows you to make stubble if you prefer.  A dedicated trimmer--or even the pop-up trimmer on my other razor does a cleaner job.  The third head, a foil head for body shaving, is something I don&#x27;t use, but I tried it out and not surprisingly it works best if you&#x27;ve already trimmed the long hairs, which you could do with the beard trimmer, and then use the body shaver for maintenance. You could use the face shaver on your body the same way, although it might be a little slower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone who will use all three functions will find this less expensive than buying three devices, and it&#x27;s well-priced if you like the SensoTouch floating head design and don&#x27;t mind having only the two heads.  But if you mostly need a face shaver and want rotary baldes, you can get a low-end three-head Norelco that works about as well, and has a pop-up trimmer, for less than half the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other issue: it comes without any protective cover for the rotating blades, or carry case, so you&#x27;ll have to improvise if you want to travel with it.</li>
            <li> This stopped working after having it for less than six months, not worth buying.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco has always been trusty, I&#x27;ve had their products for a few years now and this one works exactly as advertised just like the others. I like being able to use it in the shower, and the fact that I can get almost any length of hair I want.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this razor! A total waste of money!!! It barely cuts your facial hair and is does a lousy job at that.</li>
            <li> Very nice. This was a gift for someone and he always tells me how much he likes it.</li>
            <li> The item is not working properly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give you a nice clean shave at all.  If you have coarse hair, this sucker is going to rip it out.  And yes, I&#x27;m talking about off your groin area.</li>
            <li> Its just great, I use it dry and it has never iritated my face skin (though I expected it!!) And the three tasks it does makes it a unique device</li>
            <li> Its a really nice shaver.. but they should have design t with 3 blades instead of 2. It tooks longer with just 2 blades.</li>
            <li> Hesitated at first with the quality of this product and my hunch was right. The shaver works fine for a two-head, but the trimmer (main reason for purchase) broke during first few uses. Some plastic piece broke off and now won&#x27;t shut completely. Not sure how to deal with this issue but I&#x27;m hopping to get a replacement part and have better luck...</li>
            <li> I really apreciate the purchase, it matches perfectly my expectations about the product, the shipment was fast, I received just in a while, price was good so I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> My last two shavers were Braun. I always liked them (bought two of the same model)...that was until I picked this up yesterday. Build quality is great, it feels good in the hand. Changeable heads all seat nicely with no wobble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is really impressive. I found mine for 50, and on day one at least, consider it a great buy.</li>
            <li> The Norelco click &amp; style shaver is an excellent razor.  Works exceptionally well in the shower!  I was able to go from shaving my head to trimming my beard with one easy attachment.  Fairly quick, complete charge.</li>
            <li> The Norelco twin head electric razor is simply amazing. For years I used a regular razor and shaving cream because my cow licks on my face had the hairs growing in 30+ different directions. My college roommate got this for Christmas and told me to try it. I instantly fell in love. My fiancée got it for me as a Christmas present this past christmas. After using it daily, I have had to only charger it twice, it is now August.&lt;br /&gt;All of the features are great, you can even touch up your hair with the clippers attachment, which was great for the military high fade I keep.&lt;br /&gt;All in all it is great, the only down side is the screen protector that clips on the razor doesn&#x27;t stay on well and tends to fall off after a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;Comparing it to Remington&#x27;s and other razors I&#x27;ve had, including a Schik quatro razors, this is the closest and cleanest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. Never misses a hair, and no hair falls out, everything is caught inside the head for easy clean up.</li>
            <li> Though I&#x27;d used Norelco shavers before, this new version caught my eyed on an Amazon ad so I decided to give it, and Amazon, a try. Both met my expectations fully. Ordering was easy, delivery right on time and pricing was value added.I&#x27;ll do this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E. Duffie, Jr.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a x-mas present, he loved it!&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I chose this one over other products</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit&lt;br /&gt;Awesome shaver. Very versatile, takes care of all the man-scaping of everything.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions and let it charge for about 2 hours.  Very powerful razor, even though I had a light rash for 3 days my skin quickly adapted and now it&#x27;s a smooth shave everytime.  I have a full beard and the trimmer/groomer element works better than any I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  Easy to clean and charge.  I&#x27;ll probably never use the body grooming portion so I can say nothing, other than if it works like the rest of this razor it will be great too.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what you would expect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is the attachment to shave your face. It doesn&#x27;t do the best job, however this is my first electric shaver so maybe they are all like this. I love the other attachments though.</li>
            <li> im 19, been shaving for about 4 years now and this is the best one in all that time. light, worth the 60$ I payed, I expect it to last a long time. I recommend 100%</li>
            <li> I bought this unit for one reason, I wanted to enjoy shaving with Philips Norelco SensoTouch 3D, without having to shell out $150.00+ to get one. The truth is that this unit brilliantly fits and fuctions with the high end Philips Norelco RQ-12/RQ12 head([[ASIN:B003V37Z6U Philips Norelco RQ12 Replacement Head  for SensoTouch 3D]]) no problem! And it shaves fantastically! However The dual-action shaver head(RQ32) that comes stock with this \\&quot;Click &amp; Style\\&quot; is pretty meh, not very good on its own. The grooming attachments are nice too, to be honest I haven&#x27;t fully tested them, and I&#x27;ll have to update this review once I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;On its own this thing is a nice little body groomer, lots of nice little attachments, but when you combine it with a RQ12 shaver head you get a high quality shave at a bargain price! The RQ12&#x27;s are a little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
            <li> i had heard that when using body groom it runs out of charge really soon, but though i&#x27;m way to hairy, it works really nice and i didn&#x27;t notice running out of charge soon! Just follow the instructions.</li>
            <li> Though I have only had this new shaver for about two weeks, I have to say I&#x27;m impressed, price value was really good and was worth the buy. Simple, quick, versatile, and no ripping hairs out of my face! I guess I shave about two times a week for mainly stubble and it does the job well. Each shaving tool in the kit are good, nothing bad to say. The shaver/kit is pretty light, so its convenient to travel with.  The battery life also seems to be pretty good, and quick to recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with a case/bag, but aside from that I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I had a three-head Norelco shaver back in the 1960s, but quit using it when I grew a beard. I&#x27;m back to shaving now and this Norelco reminds me of why I like the brand. I&#x27;ve used other brands, but always got spotty and sometimes painful results.&lt;br /&gt;I had a full beard when I got it, so the grooming tool came in very handy for getting my whiskers down to a reasonable length for the two-head shaver, which did a decent job of completing the job.&lt;br /&gt;I now use the Norelco most mornings and my technique of shaving in circular motions and pulling the skin taut is improving. It&#x27;s easy to clean and holds a charge well.&lt;br /&gt;But - and this is why I gave it four stars instead of five - if I want a really close shave, my Gillette Fusion ProGlide razor and hot lather from a shaving mug can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Bought it to replace my 5+ year old Norelco HS8420 Nivea Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on reviews here I opted to get RQ12 head right away and it fits and work great.&lt;br /&gt;Basic SensoTouch 3D razor starts at $179, Click &amp; Style + RQ12 &#x3D; $100 :o)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard styler works great for me as I keep short stubble beard. But longest setting on it might not be enough for someone with longer beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RQ12 head it outstanding, smooth and very close shave on my neck without any irritation, its actually night and day compare to my old Nivea razor, but that also could be due to old head running close to 2 years old. I do wish RQ12 came with plastic cover as it does in a full kit, replacement head does not come with one :o(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t try body groomer or original 2 head shaver that came with it so cant comment on those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing missing from this and main reason for 4 stars is no charging cradle.&lt;br /&gt;I knew it doesn&#x27;t come with one and thought I can live with it, but will have to make my own using Spiderpodium and some sugru maybe.</li>
            <li> My shaving needs are rather simple. My head is clean shaved and the shaving stick serves me well as I shave every other day. I checked out the Philips Norelco YS524 and found it to be equally useful. The disadvantage with the shaving stick is that is cuts when held at the wrong angle. The Norelco’s rotary heads give me a worry free shave and safely shave the back of my neck and also my arm pits. The styler attachment is my favorite piece; I use it to keep my gray beard beautiful. This is one good and economical shaving kit; well recommended.</li>
            <li> Love to shave, trim and groom a nice beard, goatee or short boxed look. Love this razor set from Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> When it comes to using the body groomer head the shaver loses life and continues to do that. The close shaver doesn&#x27;t have that problem for some reason. I don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> i use great for shaving and trimming all over except well you know. Im too scared to use it down below</li>
            <li> way better than the cheap electric razors but just as good as the $300 ones. bust shaver ive ever owned.</li>
            <li> it is an excellent razor that allows to make several styles without difficulty, the three heads are easily interchangeable and durable, my old razor phillips 105 work by 15 years.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in overall quality. My 15 yr. Old Norelco gives a closer shave. Would not recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;The shaved is plastic and feels like a toy.</li>
            <li> Very easy and quick to use. Solid built. I would have loved to have a nice bag with it to keep the accessories but I can live without it.</li>
            <li> Causes pain. Blades are not sharp. Feels as if it tries to pull the hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son for his birthday and he said it is the best razor he has ever had.  It charges fast and holds the charge a long time.  Great product, nice quality!</li>
            <li> My 15 yea old rechargeable trimmer finally quit.  I&#x27;ve always used a safety razor for shaving and the trimmer for my mustache.  This item has a trimmer and was reasonably priced.  Just for kicks, I tried the shaver on my face.  I love it.  No more shaving cream and razor blades.</li>
            <li> It shipped quickly and everything packed nicely. I just don&#x27;t think it is a great razor. The body trimmer is hard to use unless hair is very very short. Not the cleanest shave.</li>
            <li> First off I got this because it can be used in the shower and....well it works in the shower.  The main reason though was that I have a beard and the trimming was (as and couple can attest to) becoming an issue around the sink area.  I thought this would be the solution it can be used in the shower (see trimmings staying contained in shower and going down the drain) and has a trimmer attachment.  Well this &amp;#34;trimmer&amp;#34; attachment is not for beards the longest selection leaves you with little more than 5 O&#x27;clock shadow.  Men with beards should not see that as a viable option to trim their beards, those who seek the perfectly cut unshaven look well, your Armani Exchange outfits have met their shaving rival.</li>
            <li> The battery does not hold the charge when using the body attachment.&lt;br /&gt;I returned it and purchased the BG2040 BodyGroom Pro</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product as it does everything it says it does. The heads are so easy to change. Using it in the shower is awesome! It is just a great product all around. My only suggestion would be to have some kind of case to store it in when not in use.</li>
            <li> The razor&#x27;s different attachments are very nice and quick to change, it has great battery life from very first charge, easy to clean and overall gets the job done. The beard trimmer seems to be a bit cumbersome and lacks precision needed for its purpose, but I have only used it for trimming my sideburns and haven&#x27;t used that much. The actual razor itself has a few issues, having only two heads, I feel it doesn&#x27;t give a very close shave and takes a lot of time to get a close shave. It&#x27;s great for maintaining more of a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look, which happens to be what I prefer, but my job requires a clean shave so I find myself spending a lot of time trying to get a close enough shave. Most of the time the shave is smooth, but once in a while the razor seems to irritate my skin around my neck and has even made me bleed; this may just be operator error or my already sensitive skin. Perhaps a wet shave would help the smoothness and irritation, but I have yet to try it as I am skeptical of waterproof razors. I had a $20 Norelco razor before this and it was a smoother shave with three heads and no irritation. I&#x27;m glad the have this one since it&#x27;s cordless and more versatile, but I feel like $60 might be a bit high.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor! Doesn&#x27;t nick or cut. Quiet, comfortable and flexible. The three heads afford confident grooming on all areas of the body. Long lasting charge, ergonomic design and made tough. I&#x27;ve dropped it and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a blade for the past few years. Before that, I had a 3 head Noreclo that also could be used in the shower (actually had 3 - twice Phillips replaced it under warranty). Before that a blade again and before that a moderately priced Braun and various plug-in Norelco&#x27;s before that.&lt;br /&gt;This razor has given me the best shaving experience I have had. It is really about as close as the blade and much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> this will be a Christmas gift for my fiance. So, I don&#x27;t know if it actually really great or not yet.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my boyfriend.  He has yet to try it but I will update this review as soon as he does.  So far my rating is based on how many good gift brownie points I got from him!</li>
            <li> I gave this 5 stars since it is the 1st electric razor that actually does what it advertises and works flawlessly</li>
            <li> lovey shaver dose nice job fits in hand nice extra heads are very good battery life is good you get 5 or more shaves on a charge</li>
            <li> Shave is good but have not been able to understand the instructions for how to use the other attachments available.</li>
            <li> Was a surprise Christmas present for my husband. He loves it. He is Active Duty Army, so he has to have a close shave. This does the trick. Great price and arrived early.</li>
            <li> Great product, the changeable features is great for styling your beard/stubble. It&#x27;s waterproof so it very easy to clean. The bear trimmer settings don&#x27;t go very long so you can&#x27;t maintain a long beard with this is better for stubble.</li>
            <li> The three attachments work fantastically, I.e., the shaver, groomer, and trimmer. Though the shaver only has two blades instead of three (I&#x27;m not certain why they only made it with 2 not 3, which is the only con I&#x27;ve noted thus far), regardless, I would still purchase this item again. You get a lot for your money with this purchase.</li>
            <li> My teen using it in the showers, great for facial hear as well as for body grooming. He spend couple days searching and comparing different brands - this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> I guess i am just used to better material this products appears to have run of the mill material.</li>
            <li> bought from lighting deals! found plastic transparent clip on opening edge was double pasted and opened before! as it was a new one? Accepted it since inner package is sealed and fine</li>
            <li> This replaced a Remington that broke after years of use.  It has a nice assortment of blades and accessories but no box to store them in.  So I have them laying in a drawer by the sink.  It would have been nice to have this come with a box that held the parts cleanly and neatly on the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reason I gave this 3 stars is because the motor is weak.  My housemate has an older Norelco and I think you could put a screwdriver in the blades and the motor might keep cutting on it.  But this thing seems to struggle to power the dual rotary blades.  The other accessories don&#x27;t exhibit the same slowness.  It just sounds like it is having a hard time making the rotary blades go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does shave as good as the more powerful Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh... one other thing.  You cannot use it when it is plugged in.  So when the batteries go... the shaver will be useless.  I liked that my old Remington would work when plugged in or when just on batteries.  But this unit will not run unless you unplug it.</li>
            <li> I chose this rating because my son told me it performed just as he had expected He was very pleased</li>
            <li> Very good, with good accessories. althoug the triple headed Norelco would be a better choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank You,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;G L Walters</li>
            <li> Does not shave as good as my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> However you get what you pay for. I should have known by the price that this was going to be a chintzy razor.&lt;br /&gt;The rotary razor does not shave well. The other attachment actually shaves better but still not clean. It is very light&lt;br /&gt;and feels cheaply made. I will probably look to buy a better, more expensive unit. Not even worth shipping it back. Sorry but can&#x27;t say anything positive. :(</li>
            <li> Works great with all attachments. Haven&#x27;t had any of the problems people have been mentioning with the bodygroom attachment. Beard trimmer works great as well.</li>
            <li> This was my first electric razor/trimmer in a very long time. A lot has change in 20 years. I&#x27;m not saying that this is the best one ever made. But in my opinion it&#x27;s pretty dang good. The trimmer attachments work fantastically. With trimmers there is always a fear of getting skin getting caught and nicked pretty bad. Especially in certain parts of the body where it&#x27;s a little more painful. I bought this in June 2013 and for as many times as I&#x27;ve used this, I can count the number of times I&#x27;ve been nicked on one hand. The shaving attachment isn&#x27;t all that bad either. I&#x27;ve completely stopped using razors in favor of this. It&#x27;s definitely made me a believer in electric razors. I&#x27;ll be looking to purchase an upgrade soon. Very good product though. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Very versatile.  This is replacing another multi function shaver.  My only complaint is that it seems to operate a little &amp;#34;Slow&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Love it this shaver gave me bumps first time but that was expected cause its my first shaver so anyways great shaver with accessories also give great styling need if you wanted to style yourself.</li>
            <li> This is such and improvement over the previous Philips Norelco shaver I had. I HATED that unit so much. I don&#x27;t know what they changed between that series and this one, but the differences are stellar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old unit did a decent job of getting the hair, but it ripped my skin to Hell. I hated shaving and avoided it until it grew out to the point I looked like a homeless guy. After years of abusing my skin with the old unit I finally decided to toss it and try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I got this. And my life has changed for the better. Same brand, but the heads no longer shred skin in the pursuit of hair. This unit doesn&#x27;t shave as efficiently as the old one, but as I can run it over my face for 5 minutes or more without the slightest burning sensation that&#x27;s not a problem. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The additional beard and body trimmers just sweeten the deal. A stand would been the perfect deal closer, but as the unit is, I like it a heck of a lot and would easily recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was a razor that will allow you to get not only a close shave on your face, but also will allow you to take care of the other parts of your body that need grooming too. I really appreciated the fact that the razor did cut as close as it did, as I have tried other electric razors in the past and have come to find that they do not hold up and deliver on the results that they portend. That being said this razor does cut close, and even better, with the additional heads/attachments that are included, you are able to keep the rest of your bodily areas under control too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor holds its&#x27; charge and I found that recharging also did not take too long. The razor is definitely portable, so whether you are at home on the couch, or on the road, you can take this with you and have just as good of a shave no matter where you are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, no matter what area of your body you are trying to control, this razor steps up to the challenge and for me it met and surpassed it. I highly encourage this to any guy that wants power and portability!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this for review - all opinions are my own*</li>
            <li> I can shave faster and better with a regular razor with shaving cream. This Norelco is a waste of money.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this!! I would def. recommend this to anyone who was looking to buy a style shave kit :)</li>
            <li> I have only used once but it woked vey good! you can consider buying this product it works fine and quick</li>
            <li> Everything you need for shaving in one awesome package. You could use it to cut hair but its probably not a good idea.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. My fianc&amp;eacute; loves this shaver!</li>
            <li> First electric razor I&#x27;ve really liked. It exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Under powered, has a hard time trimming, feels cheaply constructed.</li>
            <li> The beard trimmer worked great, the body shaver pulled hairs out painfully before cutting them, and the razor worked pretty well until it died just 4 months after I bought it and 3 months after I could return it.</li>
            <li> Best electric razor I have ever used. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other electric razors and none could give a clean/close shave like a manual razor. But this Philips is awesome shave way better than any electric and as close as a manual. Being able to use in the shower is huge bonus.</li>
            <li> i love this thing. i told myself i wanted a new cordless trimmer/shaver and did some research and came across this one. glad i bought it. no tugging of my hair. clean shaves and trims. battery is stout and lasts surprisingly long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m used to shaving in the car with a Norelco Sensotouch 3D razor and a Remington Hyper Series electric razor (both of which I love), so my perspective on this shaver is influenced by that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I think: compared to the Sensotouch 3D and Hyper, the Click &amp; Style is a slower shave, with a smaller compartment for shaved hair, but it&#x27;s vastly better at maintaining beards and shaving body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed by the stubble trimmer&#x27;s adjustments (it clicks back and forth to adjust maybe 1/4 inch) and the body hair trimmer is probably the most useful attachment for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll sometimes shave my armpits or (when my wife is unlucky), have my spouse shave my back. We used to use razors to do so, but they quickly got clogged, needed cleaning and thus took a long time. The trimmer attachment on the razor is more like an electric sheep sheer, which is great, because I can get pretty hairy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We end up having to use the edges of the &amp;#34;sheer&amp;#34; for body hair trimming, which irritates my skin enough to redden it for a few minutes, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for grooming efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, if you&#x27;re going to use this every day to shave your face, I&#x27;d personally consider other razors, but if you want a handy travel shaver or something to help your wife trim your back hair, then this thing is tops.</li>
            <li> A pain in the butt to change heads.  Shave is so so, the blade is better.</li>
            <li> got this as a present for my dad. he was super happy. he says it gives him a close shave and he can&#x27;t stop raving about how many  attachments there are! so id say its money well spent !</li>
            <li> I loved it. It is very usefull and high quality item. I am advicing it to everyone who looks for that kind of item.</li>
            <li> However, two days later, the shaver head popped off.. Maybe I didn&#x27;t make sure it was securely on. None the less, a tiny plastic piece that holds the cutting head in place broke. When I contacted Norelco, I was told that because the product was so new, they didn&#x27;t have any parts available. When I asked about an estimated arrival of parts, they couldn&#x27;t even give me a ball park time. They told me me I could use the 45 day money back option, if I returned it. They didn&#x27;t offer to replace it. I really liked the concept and the results of all three of the heads and was highly disappointed that I was going to have to send it back. I emailed their customer service department and in about a week I got a call from Customer Service.I have yet to actually talk to them because of voicemail, but was told that they would offer other remedies for the problem. Bottom line is that the concept and shaving/trimming performance are great, but the materials used in the drive train for the face shaver are not very durable and should be able to stand up better, even if there is user error. Time will tell if they correct the problem, but it is covered by a standard 2 year warranty, extendable to 2.5 yrs via product registration</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband.  He says it works well.  Uses it as a trimmer and it works better than any of the others he has had.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shaver for a while. Its a good shaver but if i had the option to go back in time, before i bought it i would not have bought it. The facial shaver is the best part of it, the rest of the attachments don&#x27;t really work. Its expensive but it feels really cheap.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband who has a stubborn beard.  He loves it and it gives a wonderfully close shave even for him.  He likes the fact that he is able to use shaving gels and other products with it, &amp; loves the fact that it is so easy to use.  It was a really good price and I admit I was a bit leery that it did not cost more, but am sure glad that I ordered it.  This one does better than others that I have bought for him in the past at a much higher price.  I cannot recommend it highly enough.  You will be happy that you did not spend a small fortune on any other razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve lifted weights for years, and would fall into the &amp;#34;significantly above average muscle mass&amp;#34; category.  Perhaps not surprisingly, I also do a fair amount of manscaping to tame my body hair and improve the appearance of my physique.  Ie, I like how it looks.  I&#x27;ve probably tried half a dozen products over the years, and this is the best.  Highly recommend.  Does a great job below the belt as well, with absolute minimal pulling or irritation.  No fear of cutting myself.  Have only tried the body hair attachment, but given my previous lack of success with other products, this is already the best in its category.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mid-40&#x27;s and have not used an electric shaver since high school. I&#x27;ve been thinking of changing to reduce skin irritation and the ongoing cost of disposable blades. I would buy the 52 pack of Gillett disposables and milk them for all they where worth (the downgrade them to my wife for her legs).  A good system. They cost $30 for 52 count. When i say this razor with the three attachments, wet or dry shave for $40...it was an easy decision to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 weeks now and I&#x27;m happy with it. It works pretty much the same wet or dry: I don&#x27;t really notice any better shave closeness. I actually prefer dry so I can use it in a mirror (save water in the shower too).  I have not used the attachments. I&#x27;m still on my first charge too, so the battery life seems excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good, safe intro to electric shaving, based on the competitive price.</li>
            <li> The shave toolkit worked for a few months, then it would not turn on. The LED did not light and the motor would not turn on. While charging it for a few minutes I noticed the handle got very warm so I discontinued charging the unit. I talked to the customer service rep and was informed that a shipping label would be emailed to me but its been a while and I never received it.&lt;br /&gt;Again, it worked well until it just unexpectedly quit.</li>
            <li> Great  shaving/trimming tool. Jack of all trades and does all of them well. And the price is right. long battery life</li>
            <li> This Phillips is Very good. It has a good Price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally is Very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one bad point is that not has an bag to carry.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it daily and it doesn&#x27;t irritate his sensitive skin like a regular razor does. He gets a close clean shave with it.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s already so many great reviews but I&#x27;ll just add that I loved these. Clean and quick shave. I kind of want to switch the the rotary head so it&#x27;s three instead of two.</li>
            <li> This product is lightweight and does not take up too much room.  It holds a charge for a good while. The heads of the razor are easy to switch.  The item works great!!!</li>
            <li> The majority of the other reviews here already talk about this razor&#x27;s features so I will skip that and talk about my experiences with this razor. First off, I have sensitive skin. Sometimes when I shaved with my normal 4-blade razor with shaving cream I would still get a few pimples and my face would feel irritated. I do not experiece any of that with this eletric razor. I first tried to use it in the shower with my face wash as &amp;#34;shaving cream&amp;#34; but soon realized I could not see what I was doing. However, this does prove the razor is water resistant and can be used fully wet. Since then, I just wet my face after I wash it and shave away. You have to move it around from every angle (up to down, down to up, side to side...etc) to get some hairs but the result are great. I am getting the same close shave as I would with a normal razor. The only issue I have is with the normal razor head. It is two circular disks. it feels awkward to move this around on your face and its hard to tell where your sideburns  or beard are getting cut. I go as close as I can and then switch to they trimmer head to upkeep my goatee mustache. I use the trimmer for my side burns too then carefully go back over to the razor head and get as close as I can. I give this 4 out of 5 stars for that reason. Its a good Idea to keep your normal razor around, at least for the sideburns if you don&#x27;t feel confident using a circle to cut a square sideburn.</li>
            <li> This would be my first electrical razor and it works awesome. I like how I can change the 3 different heads. 1 is for facial shave and the other is for trimming the beard and the last one is for shaving the body hair. Works great in the shower.</li>
            <li> has only 2 drawbacks for me, corded use is unsupported and the battery indicator is so easy to miss when its flashing &amp;#34;low battery&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwsie, a great product. love the extra attachments, makes it the complete styling kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the head from SensoTouch 2D or 3D works well with this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it anyday</li>
            <li> I am a big Norelco fan in general, and found this to be another quality product. This attractively designed shaving device works quietly, is comfortable to hold. It can be used for dry shaving, wet shaving, beard styling, and body grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very flexible in shaving any parts of the body needed and comes with easily detachable parts--such as a shaving attachment, a beard styler attachment, and a bodygroom attachment (just be careful and avoid excessive pressure when fitting them back in).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The toolkit includes a protective cap, charger, cleaning brush, bodygroom trimmer comb, etc. Charging takes up one hour and lasts for up to forty minutes of cordless shaving. The only con is having to buy replacement razor heads and bodygroom foils twelve months later--which can get pretty expensive.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco Razor came with good accessories and they are easy to attach and detach.  The beard trimmer works very well and the adjustments allow for a great trim of any reasonable beard.  The body trimmer adapter works well without much hair pulling and is a smooth shave.  The 2 head face shaver adapter is a little awkward to use.  (I have a 3 head shaver.)  It does not cover the facial area as well as a 3 head unit, but it does get the job done.  This razor has a good battery charge and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was not the item I hoped it would be.  I still use it 3 times a week. It doesn&#x27;t do well on the contours of the jaw line. The other parts feel a little clumsy. The battery is great though.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and after being let down by a couple of different style trimmers, I decided to try this one out. It gets decent reviews online and I was impressed at the prospect of the different tools that come with this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this unit for beard trimming primarily, but also trim other parts of my body like my chest, and down below which this is REALLY good for in my opinion. I am not a guy who trims bald down there, but nice and short and I have no complaints in this area, I felt safe using this with no gritting teeth moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Nice even trim&lt;br /&gt;No hair tugging or pulling&lt;br /&gt;Very versitile&lt;br /&gt;Decent battery life&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold and use&lt;br /&gt;Water resistance for use in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to clean with a water rinse&lt;br /&gt;Super easy to change attachments&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;No storage case! Considering the attachments it comes with this is a pretty big bummer.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it shaved well and didn&#x27;t even come with a case.</li>
            <li> The head is not nice and \\&quot;on track\\&quot; like old triple head style was.  Too much radical was needed in order to move the device to a different position.  THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A TRIMMWE.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite shaving machine,my first one  lasted almost 2 years and it worked great, this is my second one and this one is as perfect as the old one ... one tip don&#x27;t get it too much wet it is shower proof not water proof!</li>
            <li> good product, excellent.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my grandson.. he loves them,</li>
            <li> Great product, very comfortable for use and excellent quality of shave!!</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking I could use a face shaver, and saw this at Walgreens and noticed it could do my head to. It is crap in that dept. The trimmers on the edge of the attachment ripped out my hair, and after I used my buzz clippers, i thought maybe I could at least shave the stubble down to be smooth. Nope. didn&#x27;t do that either. it was painful and didn&#x27;t get it smooth. I returned it.</li>
            <li> This unit has three different uses.  I won&#x27;t use it for beard trimming.  The body trimer is good for shaving and trimming the neck and the two head shaver works as well as the three head just a smaller area.  the best is the charge it states that it will run for a 40 min shave, but I found that I used it for 10 days a little each day and it still didn&#x27;t need a charge I just plugged it in.  It doesn&#x27;t shave any better than the three head, the body trimmer  does shave and trim neck hair well.  All units come apart for cleaning with running water and I guess can be used with lather.</li>
            <li> excellent product.  It helps me keep my nape hair free and being able to use it w/ shaving cream is a BONUS. 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I have had this shaver for a month and I absolutely love it. The body groomer is awesome and you can use it in very delicate regions if you get my drift. I would just make sure your skin is taunt in said region.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting. so far so good.</li>
            <li> Great razor, is water friendly so safe to use it in the shower! love it.</li>
            <li> My 16 yr old son is so happy with it. PERFECT</li>
            <li> This thing stopped charging after like a week. I got this for my boyfriend and he was disappointed after being so excited from the commercial. After this one broke he though maybe he got a defective one so he got his hands on another one, and still the same problem. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product.  I have been using the same electric razor for 25 years.  I decided to try a cordless one.  It does not have the power of the electric, even when fully charged.  It does not shave me nearly as close as the electric one.  I want to send it back, but did not keep the packaging it came in.  I will keep using my old electric one till it dies.</li>
            <li> Saw this razor in a retail store and purchased it for a friend.  He is really happy with it.</li>
            <li> Does not shave as close as my foil razor, but I got this one to take overseas for the dual voltage and multiple heads. Worked good - just had to shave every morning.</li>
            <li> It is a present for my son.&lt;br /&gt;Good. He starts to enjoy shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For korean, the plug is of 11 shape, nprth american type.&lt;br /&gt;But this is a free voltage product, so no problem with additional buying of the adapter.&lt;br /&gt;(In korean... 11자 플러그지만, 220V 사용가능한 프리볼트라서 1000원짜리 어댑터 하나만 더 사면 됩니다.)</li>
            <li> Fabulous product.  This shaver works very well as promised.  The complete story will not be known until I use it for a few months to see how the blades last.  So far, I am pleased at the clean cut and ease of use.</li>
            <li> For the most part I am satisfied with the product. It has other attachments that attracted me to this product which I have found works well. As far as the razor component, it feels as though the unit lacks power to shave. It is a wet/dry unit and I shave immediately when I get out of the shower. With my skin wet, the razor sounds like it is laboring to complete the task. I do not have an abundance of facial hair as I am of pacific islander descent. I may try using a shaving foam or gel and see what the results would yield. Because there are optional heads available, my wife has relegated to using on of the heads to shave her lovely legs. She&#x27;s pleased with it and raves that its much better than a standard razor. In the end, it does the job which is what counts.</li>
            <li> Awesome tool, exactly what is was looking for. Love the beqard trimmer attchment so taht you can get the &amp;#34;Al Michaels &amp;#34; Monday Night Football stubble beard. Feels sturdy and not cheap, and the charge last awhile. One of the best shavers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Love this, I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Just great lots better thin i thought thanks</li>
            <li> The shaver gives me a clean shave whether my stubble is long or short.  The shaver is very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a great Shaver and Hair Trimmer. Use it dry or under the Shower, it won&#x27;t budge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a full array of Tools, to shave, trim hair above and below the shoulders.</li>
            <li> Pretty fantastic shaver! Granted, this is only the 2nd electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy the multiple heads that make it insanely easy to change between close shave, beard trim, chop sideburns. Also I&#x27;m usually lazy about cleaning shavers so it&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s waterproof - just run water over it and boom! clean!</li>
            <li> Use it for so many shaving needs, and no matter where I use it, it works great with no pinch or cutting</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, works prefect</li>
            <li> so far i loved. my bear is a bit thick so one of the attachment get stuck.&lt;br /&gt;but with patience, i get it to work.</li>
            <li> not quite as smooth as I expected..m</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave at all, don&#x27;t buy</li>
            <li> Its not great, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Maybe I should have purchased just a shaver, but It does not get all of my facial hair as effortlessly as I would like or have imagined.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco electric razors for a long time, and usually am pleased with the results. The Philips Norelco Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit provides a single solution to male grooming needs, as the three interchangeable attachments easily click on and off the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver attachment, which is the one attachment I will use daily, has two rotary heads. I much prefer a shaver with three rotary heads since the three heads will make the shaving process quicker as it covers more skin surface. Although I could hear the two rotary heads shaving the surface of my face, I found that I had to constantly go over spots as the shave was not as close as I prefer. Shaving with the two rotary heads takes longer than shaving with a razor with three rotary heads, an important factor when I am trying to get to work on time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco also offers a styler attachment, with five length settings to provide maximum choice for facial hair. Additionally, the bodygroom attachment trims and shaves body hair. The bodygroom attachment is designed with rounded combs and tips to prevent skin irritation and seems to do the job well. The razor also is safe to use in the shower, and the battery is rated to last 40 minutes between charges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, I like the Norelco Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit. I like the flexibility of the three interchangeable attachments and the fact that the razor can be used in the shower. I have had very good luck with Norelco razors over the years, and I suspect this one will provide the same quality. The one negative for me is the fact that the shaver attachment only has two rotary heads. I prefer a razor with three rotary heads to save time and provide a closer shave.</li>
            <li> Using this razor for basic trimming and a quick shave, while not expecting too much, is exactly what you get. It does not shave as close as my regular electric/ rechargeable razor, but for throwing it in your over night bag, it seems to work OK. Personally, I prefer a Panasonic over Norelco because they shave like a blade... almost. I would not use this for everyday shaving because it just doesn&#x27;t shave close enough. I like it for travel, because if it gets lost or stolen (at an airport), you don&#x27;t have a couple hundred invested.</li>
            <li> Product was just what I had hoped for in the razor.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a real heavy beard the two heads might not be that strong.</li>
            <li> I used this to shave it dose not do a good job it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> Hate it. Does not give a close shave.</li>
            <li> I feel OK, just from the United States to buy Chinese products are cheaper than China</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> This is a very cool concept. Three products in one, and they all work remarkably well. This product is great for those who can&#x27;t decide whether to buy the &amp;#34;circles&amp;#34; or the &amp;#34;rectangle&amp;#34; type of electric shaver. For me, the &amp;#34;circles&amp;#34; shavers seem to do a better job on those longer hairs down on my lower neck, wheres the &amp;#34;squares&amp;#34; shaver is better for getting a closer shave elsewhere. And then we have the trimmer, which is great if you haven&#x27;t shaved for a few days and your beard is too long to be shaved by these. Overall, this is a versatile shaving kit that is a great value and gives good performance.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.  I had read a product review and for the price ($60 or $70) you absolutely cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t post this sooner to save some others. It takes forever to shave, almost impossible to get my neck smooth. When battery runs out its done! no plugging it in to finish up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its more like a toy, maybe something an 11 year old could play with to feel adult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad I kept my old norelco.</li>
            <li> very good, I love it. powerful and beautiful. The third head, advertised for body grooming is actually a foil head, so while you cna use it for body hair, it really can be used however you like, on the face, neck, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this product earlier in the month and it worked great at first, all the attachments worked perfectly but then suddenly the bodyfoil attachment started to act up... I&#x27;d turn the shaver on and it would grind to a halt! At first I thought it was the battery losing juice but I realised this wasn&#x27;t the case when I&#x27;d put one of the other attachments on and voila... working like a charm! I figured that maybe something was jamming the foil but no amount of cleaning has corrected the issue...</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly for the beard trimming feature but the body groomer works well too. I don&#x27;t usually use the dual head shaver but that is because I keep a beard. If I were to shave my entire face I would still probably use a standard razor first and then go over it with the shaver.  I will say the trimmer did not seem to work so well on the back of my neck but was great for my face.</li>
            <li> Like the fact it had the interchangeable heads.  Purchased one and worked fairly well for about 3 months.  after that the battery would die with in minutes or even seconds with a full charge.  Did have my warranty info, decided to try another one.  Purchased it 2 months ago and exact same issue.  battery dies within a very short time period.  This time have the warranty.  Horrible quality.  Never would buy Norelco again after this.</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best shavers I ever had the use and accuracy of the three heads are just amazing</li>
            <li> Light weights and I like that you can change the heads  my hubby loves it</li>
            <li> Our verdict on this shaver, body groomer and trimmer is that we like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of the three-in-one is great and it is designed really well. The different components snap on and off easily and all worked as promised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To love this appliance I would need a couple of changes. First, add a third rotary shaver head. With just the two heads, it takes more passes and takes longer to shave, which defeats the purpose of an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, to love it would require the ability to use the shaver while plugged in. It&#x27;s designed to only be used with the cord detached. Some of us fight for bathroom plug space and can&#x27;t always get our charge on. I need to direct connect now and then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides being multi-functional, price and wet / dry ability balance out the plus side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, of its three components, the groomer and trimmer options tied for first place in functionality. The shaver proved adequate, but just.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The feature that moves this from &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;I like it&amp;#34; is price. I would consider this for a great space saving appliance for traveling, or for use as a primary trimmer and back up shaver at home.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric shaver yet I have tried!  All three attachments work flawlessly, not cuts, irritation, nothing.  Works as described, if not better for all sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> trimmer&#x27;s 5 length settings are not working after few times of using...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver is good. Did not try Body Grooming head yet...</li>
            <li> Long battery life. attachments are bulky but not really an issue for me.</li>
            <li> For different uses / all in one this is a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body shaver and trimmer shaved close to the skin and was able to maintain that closeness over curvatures of chest, stomach and back. The only downside is that this shaver head is narrow so if you have a lot of area to cover it will take a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beard styler was just ok, was not able to get the sharp line that I am used to from a dedicated use style tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave head&#x27;s ability to be used wet or dry is a plus. I used this attachment in concentrated circles on my face with no irritation. Did a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to charge, good battery life, comfortable in my hand and heads change in and out without a problem. Quality shaver.</li>
            <li> Good buy. I highly recommend it. Shaving on the neck is an issue if you like a very clean shave.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money does not give a good shave</li>
            <li> My old Philips Norelco with three heads shaves better than this. I should have just bought a replacement blade on that one but thought I get a bargain by getting this one and I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;It still works and get you an okay shave but takes a while to do it since it&#x27;s two heads have fewer holes for your facial hair to get trap into the blade, hence it&#x27;s cheaper than the other norelco shavers.&lt;br /&gt;If you look at the more expensive one, each head has more holes in it.&lt;br /&gt;So it does takes time to get a good shave, might as well do the real shave/razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this at Bed Bath and Beyond.  I will say the clipper to cut body hair works fine, but the shaver is bad.  You can&#x27;t dry shave with it, and when you wet shave even then it will not glide over your face.  If you dislike going over your face multiple times and even still not having a close shave, do NOT buy this shaver.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer for my beard and mustache and occasionally to shave those areas of my face where I want a clean cut.  I&#x27;ve found the battery life to be quite good. When I charge I let it charge thoroughly for a long time.  Been using this for probably close to two years. The beard trimmer is a poorly designed piece.  Can&#x27;t use to trim fine points very well at all. The blades didn&#x27;t stay sharp for long. It can pull hairs! Not a very powerful trimmer either. Not sure of specs but the rpm is a weakness for me.</li>
            <li> shaver works better than i expected all i do is run it under water and i really do get smooth shave like other reviews might take a little  bit but i love it trimmer is also great i set it at lowest setting and it&#x27;s great but set it at one setting higher that&#x27;s how close trimmer will get and for the price can&#x27;t beat it again just really happy i got it</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and the charge gave out after a day. Worst experience ever.... It just does not do what it should do. What a waste of $60 bucks.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my husband as a gift and he says it is very useful and works well. Easy to change the different tops.  Good value!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed with this razor.  It was so bad that I thought it must be defective. Amazon promptly replaced it with another.  Unfortunately it was exactly as poor as the first one.  Basically it is as slow as a snail, nicks the skin a lot, cuts poorly, etc., all the things one doesn&#x27;t want in a electric razor.  Overall rating: Sucks.  I ended up sending the second one back also. Amazon provided a refund less a $10 restocking fee.</li>
            <li> I expected the moon from this product just based on the commercials I had seen. So far whenever my boyfriend uses it I send him back to go over spots that didn&#x27;t trim evenly. I thought this product had a bit more duality with grooming, unless you consider super short and shaved good enough variety in trimming lengths you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Its a good buy for the money. Just wish the razor cut my face a little closer but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> It does everything I need it to do. I do not use the razor for daily shaving, but for touch up stuff.The body and beard trimmers are super. This gives me the portability I need. I always had to drag an electric (Wahl type) trimmer on vacation.It&#x27;s light weight and changes heads and cleans easily. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Battery life could be better. Other than that, all of the attachments are pretty useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectively replaces my razor for most uses.</li>
            <li> Love it. Had it for a few months now. No hair pulling, the rotary shaver works like any blade razor, the other shaver works wonders for the nether regions (no hair pulling, very close shave) and the beard trimmer has excellent length settings, plus everything is waterproof, so all the mess stays in the shower. Fast charge, and 1 to 2 weeks between charges. Reccommended</li>
            <li> This movie is a great teaching tool! I teach media literacy and use it in combination with Gary Paulsen&#x27;s book,  Nightjohn.</li>
            <li> Really not good quality as expected from that brand.  I own several of Norelco shavers and all of them seem of better quality, specially the heads.&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my son as birthday present and next day he gave it to me because one of the blades completely went down, from where it is supposed to be.  I opened it up and tryed to put the blade system back in its place, but it all comes to a little plastic piece, very thin which holds the blade in its place.  Extremely fragile piece and extremely fragile system.  If you push the head just a little, these blades go down as a button.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on, and it feels smooth while shaving, so if I had not opened it up and had to see what the head looks like, my comments would have been it works smooth and nice, but opening up, makes me realized the quality of the blade attachement was very poor.&lt;br /&gt;so far it is working fine again, but you have to be delicate.</li>
            <li> Great shaver for the price</li>
            <li> Closest shave I&#x27;ve had with an electric shaver at a very affordable cost</li>
            <li> Best cordless razor I&#x27;ve ever owned... Very smooth cut and I really like the ease of changing out the different heads for different cuts...</li>
            <li> Thank you for your product! all as well as it was written in the description, I loved)&lt;br /&gt;Will be ordering more)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re wondering whether or not it&#x27;s worth shelling out a few extra dollars for a shaver, do it. My only complaint about this trimmer is that there aren&#x27;t longer attachments for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> For this price you get three devices - body shaver, electric razor, and trimmer.  Lots of versatility for the price.</li>
            <li> The product is great for its versatility with the three options. It does not shave as closely as I would like but that is to be expected with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> I mean you get what you pay for. I have thick hair so it pulls &amp; leaves pumps on my face. Fast shipping &amp; great customer service!</li>
            <li> It does what it says it does. Works great love the machine. I&#x27;ve had it for a month and I have had no problems with it. I have even dropped it really hard and it it still works.</li>
            <li> Working very well very useful thanks</li>
            <li> Its a nice useful trimmer and multi-purpose. Easy to clean and I had used it thrice till now and haven&#x27;t charged it yet. Looks like the battery is good too.Easy to clean and wash the device. Crisp and clean shave :)</li>
            <li> i had a triple head prior that liked more</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awesome trimmer the only thing i would say is bad is the beard trimmer headed unit keeps popping the top piece off while im shaving only stays on with the attachment is on it</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband since his last shaver would not keep a charge. He loves it so far!</li>
            <li> got it for my bf and he loves it&lt;br /&gt;u dont need batteries so i really like that works great leaves skin soft</li>
            <li> A nice combo. Works well on face and body. Handy for travel.</li>
            <li> This unit is great for me. It shaves very well, it has a great battery life and I like the three shaving heads</li>
            <li> At first when I received the product I liked it and was happy except for the fact it didn&#x27;t come with a case. However, I don&#x27;t shave or trim my beard often and after several months a couple of pieces of plastic within the beard trimer attachment have broken. Not sure where the little pieces of plastic came from but it appears one of them keeps the top of the trimer closed and now it rattles and i need to keep my finger on top to keep it closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed overall have had great experience with Norelco in the past.</li>
            <li> This razor works great with the face attachment, even though it only has two heads. Battery lasts pretty long, the body attachment works pretty decent also, have not used the other attachment as of now.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap. Okay for body hair but it takes FOREVER to shave you face with this thing. Pry open your wallet and buy something better.</li>
            <li> Product works well the angle of the beard trimmer is a bit awkward.  Which is the only reason I don&#x27;t give it another star.  It is a good value though and very flexible.  I primarily use mine as a quick trimmer and travel shaver; So my use is not daily.  It keeps a charge very well so far and is lightweight in comparison to my last electric razor/trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great shaver. The 2 additional heads make it great for man-scaping! I use this in the shower every morning! It is great to be able to kill 2 birds with one stone. I can&#x27;t believe I waited so many years to upgrade!</li>
            <li> Nice product, very versatile , great price quick shipping</li>
            <li> Best shaver, I don&#x27;t use it on my face because I have sensitive skin. But works great in the shower. Every guy who care about his appearance should have one of these.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone that has a beard very easy to trim.</li>
            <li> Set phasers to stunning: you&#x27;ll be a steaming pile of volcanic sex by the time this bad boy is through grooming your facial forest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Click &amp; Style, while not busy subduing Cardassians and the Borg, is a grooming appliance with an identity crisis. Perhaps with the electric razor equivalent of transsexualism, the Click &amp; Style goes from a close shave to bear trimming to manscaping with ferocious flexibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get three interchangeable heads, each specializing in your hairy, hairy needs. The whole system is pretty well made. I once tried to shave a penis stencil into a horse with this and the blades were still sharp enough to give me a clean shave and fend off a rowdy Andorian the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Great for use in the shower&lt;br /&gt;-Interchangeable heads are easily adjustable and well-made&lt;br /&gt;-Attractive design most likely inspired by Star Trek&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The shaver head only has two blades as opposed to the usual 3. While not a huge bother, it won&#x27;t hug your face as well and might take a little longer to get the job done&lt;br /&gt;-No battery meter</li>
            <li> The body shaver/trimmer combo has been useless to say the least. I use it to get a close shave near the straight edge of my side burns. But with the built in trimmer, which is always on, I have cut away some side burn hair that I didn&#x27;t intend to cut. which there was an option to toggle the trimmer / shaver so they are not both ON at the same time if not needed.&lt;br /&gt;I like the beard trimmer, and have used it by far the most with and without the attachment. with attachment it works awesome. keeps everything nice and even. without the attachment, its work great for the most part, but leaves behind a few hair, here and there that I have to target individually with intent.&lt;br /&gt;the double head saving attachment leaves must to be desired, with the round design if you are shaving with it near a goatee or side burns, it leaves a buffer zone as it can&#x27;t make clean straight edges. so I have been switching over to the body shaver/trimmer, but that failed me too, so now I use a razor if I want sharp looking lines.&lt;br /&gt;Overall this product is great as long as you want the 5 O&#x27;clock shadow with sharp lines for your goatee/side burns. And may also be great if you are 100% clean shave but may not get all the hair under the nose or at the edge of the side burn.&lt;br /&gt;I still use it almost every couple of days and probably one of the better trimmer combo sets I have ever owned that&#x27;s is made by Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;On the side note, I bought this because my old Norelco attachment comb broke during travel. I kept the original blue plastic casing for this trimmer, and keep my attachments and trimmer in it when I travel and it has survived multiple trips in my checked in baggage.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is okay. I love the fact that when its low on power it still functions like its full of juice until the last second when it dies. I have had issues with my old norelco, which would pull hair and run slow when the battery was getting low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am tempted to buy a Braun trimmer for my next time around, which may come in a few years if this one survives for that long, (which I think it would)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needless to say, I have mixed feelings about this, its better than what I have had in the past but doesn&#x27;t satisfies me 100%.&lt;br /&gt;and last thing, those commercials are very adolescent and immature given that majority of girls/women don&#x27;t even appreciate facial hair on men. BUT WHO CARES ABOUT THEM, \\&quot;FACIAL HAIR IS AWESOME.... \\&quot;  I am sure it was probably said by one of the Duck Dynasty Dudes.me around, which may come in a few years if this one survives for that long, (which I think it would)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needless to say, I have mixed feelings about this, its better than what I have had in the past but doesn&#x27;t satisfies me 100%.&lt;br /&gt;and last thing, those commercials are very adolescent and immature given that majority of girls/women don&#x27;t even appreciate facial hair on men.

            <li> I bought this razor for 3reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I liked the idea of the universal heads on the device.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cost of razors for my mach 5 are outrageous!&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;m trying to shave more often, due to my job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a nice shaver and does the job for the most part, still not as close shave as a razor but it does the job of 3.&lt;br /&gt;I use shaving gel when I shave the that works well, my hopes to shave more with an electric was to try to save some cash.  But I find I&#x27;m leaning back towards my razor, mainly because I can get straighter and finer lines with my razor rather than with this.&lt;br /&gt;And I know this is a safety issue but it will not work when the charger is connected, just throw a waring on the charger and for idiots that shock them self&#x27;s well they should have read the warning.&lt;br /&gt;But over all worth the investment, and with the interchangeable heads I&#x27;ll look to buy the 3headed attachment for a closer shave once my blades go dull.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Valentines Day. He loves it. No razor bumps. No itchy skin after shaving. Very easy to use. He has to shave everyday before work so this helps make the process alot quicker in the morning</li>
            <li> The face shaver is really good, but it starts slowing down when you use the body groomer, it shuts itself down in 10 seconds. I had two already and both have the same issue. Don&#x27;t waste your money and time.</li>
            <li> Works ok battery life is great but not as close of shave as I would like. I go over face with razor to finish up</li>
            <li> I personally do not like to buy this because looking through the reviews I see a lot of people got it for free (viners).  Philips Norelco, you wanted a review... well here you go.  I don&#x27;t pay out of pocket for things that other people get for free... that means that my dollars are subsidizing their free stuff.</li>
            <li> This shaver is great! The three heads really help the user get the look they want no matter how unique. What really impressed me was how close one of the heads can get. It&#x27;s as if I was shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> Wonderful body razor shaves your face nicely also</li>
            <li> Easy to use,  shave awesome,.</li>
            <li> Bought this, a few months ago, specifically for beard trimming and used it once or twice a week. First or second time I tried to clean the beard trimming attachment I noticed a small piece of plastic broke off and landed in the sink.  The attachment still held together so I could continue to use it--just had to be more careful when cleaning it after that.  Today more pieces broke off and the attachment just fell apart completely and can&#x27;t be fixed.  Checked the website and called customer service only to find out they don&#x27;t replace the beard trimmer attachment. They ought to replace it for free but I&#x27;d even be willing to buy the replacement if necessary.  This was an expensive trimmer and now it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> Works like advertised. Cuts all hairs on entire body. Holds charge over sevens days; shave face every other day &amp; one body groom touch up. I dry shave mostly or after shower with drop of lotion to smooth. Easy clean up &amp; solid grip.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shaver.  Husband is very happy! Works better than his old one.  He said it works very well.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> My son is new to shaving and was having a hard time using razor blades. This does well enough for him to manage and maintain a goatee. This would  probably not be a good product if you&#x27;re looking for a close, precise shave.</li>
            <li> I tried many of these things, I think philips as a brand is the best and this one is the best in terms of price and and functionality together.</li>
            <li> roommate would really love it if the head swiveled more. Hey, this was a good razor for the price point.</li>
            <li> My husband has always been a man of shaving he never had a shaver like this one&lt;br /&gt;as he came back from work he tried it on dries skin his thick beard start coming off immediatly&lt;br /&gt;it was so fast an easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;he loves it and it saves alot of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit:&lt;br /&gt;sometimes when we are too busy to shave we woman need something like that. I used it on my legs armpits and anywhere else i need it its fast and easy i dont need to use soap or water pain free and even tickles kinda. i use it to</li>
            <li> Great for a man who hates to shave! Easy and painless!</li>
            <li> It works for what I bought it for (body grooming), but overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s underpowered for facial hair.  Too much backtracking with the razor head over the same spots to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Satisfied...no more, no less.</li>
            <li> This is the very first electric shaver I have ever bought and I had my doubts, but when I got this, I charged it up for the required time and I actually followed the instructions and read through it completely, it totally surprised me and it worked very well. I wet my skin and then applied shaving cream to my face and went over my face in circular motions as they instruct you to do and it really surprised me on how well it worked. I also tried using it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; with no water or shaving cream and it did not get all the hair off to well, and I had to use a razor to get the rest. But, it did exactly what it said it would do.</li>
            <li> I bought this recently because my dermatologist found my use of a manual razor was causing ingrown hairs to form under my chin, and I absolutely love it! All those ingrowns I had have disappeared in the month that I&#x27;ve owned it! Plus I&#x27;ve got decent peace of mind knowing that Philips Norelco give me a 3 Year Warranty just for registering the shaver online.</li>
            <li> Wow this is a really good product! Was happily surprised at how well it works! Really easy to change to different heads. But the only problem with it is you cant use it while it is plugged in?! Really something that simple how could you miss that as a manufacturer?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has been 6 months of ownership and I am very happy with the product. After doing some research and due diligence I have learned some new things: You also have the ability to add some of the heads from the other Philips shavers, this is where it gets really interesting! The two head facial shaver is great and does a superb job, but adding the three head that pivots from the Senso-touch line adds a great layer of speed and comfort that you get from shavers that are 2-3 times higher in value (be aware not all shaver heads fit the Click and Style, I used the RQ12 and it works FANTASTIC)!! Now I travel with the two head shaver and use the three head for day to day shaving.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any power issues. Used all three heads in succession. Everything worked great! I would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent design and I like the changeable heads but the battery life is subpar. They should have used lithium instead of nimh or whatever is in it. I only get like 5-10 minutes of use before having to recharge. It seemed like a defect so Amazon sent me another. Same thing so I contacted Philips and they sent me another. Same crappy battery life on all of them even after a few complete recharges.&lt;br /&gt;It seems that the body groomer uses the most power.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even that old &amp; hairy so if you are a super hairy guy then don&#x27;t buy this. Maybe still good for the teenager who has an outlet nearby tho.</li>
            <li> I have gone through many trimmers and this is by far the most versatile, powerful, and reliable.  All changeable heads perform well, not just thrown together to simply market a product.  I paid a little more than i normally do for these things because I don&#x27;t use electrical shavers but this is a good way to ease your way into one if you have ever considered it.  I bought this primarily as a trimmer but have started to utilize the shaver too.  Only downside is that its a bit bulky for travel and wish it came with a pouch.  Otherwise, great job Norelco</li>
            <li> I bought this and wish I hadn&#x27;t. The two heads just don&#x27;t shave as well as the three usually found on Norelco&#x27;s. But the thing that really bugged me is that this shaver doesn&#x27;t have a pop-up trimmer which I use a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy one of the less expensive 3-head Norelco&#x27;s with a pop-up trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is the fist time I&#x27;ve ever bought an electric shaver, but I definitely like it more than shaving with razors. It&#x27;s waterproof so you can do your manscaping in the shower instead of leaving hairs everywhere. My friends were telling me it made their faces breakup, but I&#x27;ve had zero problems with that. For never having used an electric shaver before I&#x27;d still recommend this one. Easy to clean, battery lasts long, and easy to switch parts out. You can shave, trim your beard, and completely shave yourself with three attachments. And if you don&#x27;t to go completely bald with the body shaver, there&#x27;s always a trimmer you can put over it. All in all it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Trimmer is great, body trimmer is okay as well as the shaver attachment. For the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> it is a good product but some parts are cheaply made</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who is 15.  He says it sucks and to place buy him something else.  I thought he was exaggerating so I tried it, well he is not wrong.  YOu have to pass over the same spot 15 times for it to do anything, and not even then.  I bought because it has such good reviews.  It is totally amazing how anyone thinks this is a good product.  If I could put less than one start I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift and the recipient really likes it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as I thought he would enjoy the different attachments and he would be using it not only on his face but body as well.  He says that it is okay.  He doesn&#x27;t give him quite the close shave as he had hoped.  But it does say that it will take 3 to 4 weeks for your face to adjust to the shaver so hopefully it will get better later on.</li>
            <li> This was a gift, and I was told it works great, very close shave, and very easy to use. It doesn&#x27;t bog down or slow down at all while fully charged and shaving. The motor is great on this little thing.</li>
            <li> I got it in Dec and within 2 months, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Just do yourself a favor and buy this. I&#x27;ve never enjoyed an electric razor more than this one and my old one was a Norelco too. Brand loyal for life with this little guy that can get any type of hair anywhere. It&#x27;s even easy to trim just enough for a constant 5 o clock shadow look I much enjoy.</li>
            <li> It is OK but I was used to having a 3 headed razor which works a little better.</li>
            <li> extremely functional.many options everything they promise and more and a very good first electric shaver, body groom and trimmer .</li>
            <li> Excellent for all beard and hair grooming. Gives a close shave especially on sensitive skin. Delivery very quick and much cheaper than buying in uk.</li>
            <li> I love this very complete&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase, I needed like a bear:, D thanks..... . . .</li>
            <li> Light weight and holds a charge well. Does the job well as both a trimmer and a shaver. If you want a long trimmer this won&#x27;t work but if you keep it relatively short this is great.</li>
            <li> This will trim my beard and shave my face above the beard.  I was hoping to use it to trim my neck under the beard, but it seems more interested in pulling my neck hairs than shaving.  The battery charge holds up pretty good.</li>
            <li> Got this one at good price! Nice quality!</li>
            <li> This is a perfect razor to shave all most all the hair of your body parts. I mean all. It&#x27;s blades are really smooth without causing any irritation. While shaving you would enjoy a tickle feeling, but it really not is, but feels amazing.As it has all kinds of blade you need, it&#x27;s really useful and moreover it supports Asian Europe and US power supply to charge itself. I totally recommend this product</li>
            <li> Highly recommend. Would give it more than 5 stars if possible.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this razor if you don&#x27;t need any of the attachments.  It&#x27;s OK for shaving your face, but if you have any facial hair you DON&amp;#34;t want this razor.  The attachments simply don&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m going to try and send it back to Philips Norelco.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to buy this product, but after having it for over 6 months, I have only praises. I would highly recommend, especially if you want to keep a little bit of stubble.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping/ great product</li>
            <li> This kit Does not have any tool to fade beard if you need that DO NOT BUY THIS</li>
            <li> Works ok. It has a long battery life, but i&#x27;m not real pleased with the quality of the shave. It takes a long time to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> Great product, only takes me two minutes to get a nice trim</li>
            <li> I wasnt real impressed.  I havent used other electric razors for body shaving, but does not get a smooth shaves and its average at best.</li>
            <li> This prutuct works really well and I really like how you can just rinse it off after you finish shaving.  For the price this is really worth it.</li>
            <li> The big attachment over heats and then the razor turns off. I will be sending it in for a new one.  I only had the razor two weeks.</li>
            <li> One of the heads did a nice job but cutting my facial down to that coveted 5 o&#x27;clock Shawdow.  AMA was very nice sending stuff back thanks</li>
            <li> have to admit this is my first electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;i have more of a baby face and tend to only need to shave maybe once a week.&lt;br /&gt;i chose this shaver because of its multi-use toolkit that allows for shaving ,trimming and body shaving.&lt;br /&gt;all options seem to work great. i&#x27;ve dry shaved and used gel with this item.&lt;br /&gt;seems to be a pretty sturdy plastic and tips click on and off easily .&lt;br /&gt;honestly can&#x27;t compare this with any thing else other than a normal razor...but for a first purchase and for a lite user this is a good place to start.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Does a wonderful job and is very versatile! Easy to carry as well. I really reccomend it ti everyone!</li>
            <li> Gives a very good, clean shave. It is an unusual shape for an electric razor but it works well and is easy to handle.  Also the two attachments for beard and body hair are good.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this razor to use for trimming body hair.  I have not yet used it for that, but I have used this razor 3 times on my face.  It doesn&#x27;t match my Panasonic wet/dry razor Panasonic ES8103S for the face, but I expect it will do much better than it for my body hair.  Shaver is light-weight but not cheaply made, cordless, and waterproof which is why I purchased it.  Looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted this for Christmas, and it works great. Charges well and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> I am revising this review because it has turned out this product is made very poorly from a durability standpoint.  Two of the attachments, in very light use, have come apart at the seams...literally.  That leaves this as only a razor, which is not its best function.  Ironically, the battery that I criticized was not the major problem.  For the first time in my experience with a Norelco, it was the quality.  It just plain breaks quickly making it a rather useless product.  --------  I have been using Norelco electric shavers after my father introduced me to them decades ago.  At that time there weren&#x27;t even cordless razors available.  The rotary design is superior in all regards to all foil razors.  The reason is that the foil design capture hairs as effectively.  I was given a Braun top of the line foil razor several years ago, and it was OK, but I would take out my cheap old corded (very old) Norelco to finish the job at times because it would repeatedly pass over areas of my face without removing the hair.  So, I have stuck with Norelco brand, but I have been having a problem with all their products of late.  Trimmers, razors and even a novel hair cutting tool they sell for cutting your own hair (does a quite acceptable job) have all had battery problems within weeks of purchase.  The batteries on all of them are horrible.  On the first week of use, they are fine, and then decline rapidly.  This shaver now sounds anemic after several weeks use even when it has been charged for hours and cleaned.  And these will not operate off of a plug.  It will only charge the battery.  If it could run off of an outlet, I would just leave it plugged in, but it won&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t run out of power during a shave, it just deteriorates quickly to the point where the blades are barely spinning.  Still shaves OK, but much more slowly.  My other Norelco products have died altogether after about a year and became anemic within a month of purchase.  One holds a charge for a minute before it beeps loudly and shuts off.  Another won&#x27;t charge at all after about six months of use.  I want to replace the batteries, but they cost so much it doesn&#x27;t seem worth it, especially if they are of the same quality as the originals..  So, overall, these are great razors, but I have had this battery problem so often with them, I cannot recommend them without a warning about the battery life.  The Braun I had doesn&#x27;t shave that great, but the battery is strong and willing after several years.  I use it frequently for trimming but I still don&#x27;t shave with it.  This works well on the face and body, so if the battery was better, I would classify it a five star product.</li>
            <li> This body groomer works very well and is high quality.  The clipper doesn&#x27;t grab or pull hair and is powerful enough to cut through thick hair.  The body groomer attachment is nice since it has a clipper on either side and a foil that doesn&#x27;t rip out your hair.  Finally, the shave attachment works well, but the gap between the two foils is annoying, Norelco&#x27;s regular razors have 3 foils so that it doesn&#x27;t leave a gap in the middle.  I find the Norelco foils more irritating then the Braun or Panasonic style, but I also find they work better on longer hairs.  Battery charge lasts a long time, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy one of these for body grooming, although for shaving I would buy a dedicated shaver (but this does the trick, maybe great for a trip bag).</li>
            <li> I am not a hairy man in the least but this is quite possibly the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  After 4 days of not shaving (and my old razor, a Braun, had died after 10+ years of faithful service), I decided to give this thing a try.  It literally took 15 minutes of going as slow as I possibly could so it wouldn&#x27;t pull my hair and even going slow, this engineering failure, kept pulling my hair.  Beyond lame.  I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe to first experience was due to not charging it long enough.  I gave it a full day to charge.  Tried again...same result.  5 shaves in, and every single one of them has resulted in pulled hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to Braun or Wahl.  This is company does not know how to make a razor.</li>
            <li> Seems to be working very well thus far. I can&#x27;t complain. my kindle has been great and the game looks great on it.</li>
            <li> I already have an electric razor that I&#x27;m happy with (another, older Norelco model), so I was really only looking at this for the beard trim stuff.  A beard is a new concept for me - my wife has never really liked that, but I tried it last summer, and she liked it, so I&#x27;ve kept it.  Need to keep it clean, though - she said she doesn&#x27;t want me going all Duck Dynasty on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer stuff works well enough I suppose.  As a relatively new beard guy, I can&#x27;t say how well this compares to other models.  What I can say is the pro at my barber shop does the beard trimming better.  But this does well enough to clean up my Duck Dynasty look.  For that it&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor quibble - as many heads and accessories as this has (shaver, three heads, plastic cover, ac adapter, brush), there&#x27;s no bag to hold all that in.  You&#x27;d think they&#x27;d include that.  Ah well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping works well and good material</li>
            <li> you have everything you need in one machine, which is great. you don&#x27;t need any razors anymore, just buy it</li>
            <li> that is good.&lt;br /&gt;there are three kinds of cutting adjusts. so it is very useful for us.&lt;br /&gt;it is practical.</li>
            <li> I Have to say that this is my first elcetric shaver and It&#x27;s working all right and I use it everyday</li>
            <li> I am satisfied and I recommend. I really appreciate the stamina of battery.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is worth. The ratio price/power.</li>
            <li> Razor head works fine; the beard trimmer also works fine, except that the comb/collar is far too short. My existing beard trimmer (from Norelco as well), goes from 1-9. The Click and Style has 4 settings; the longest is shorter than a 4 (longer than a 3) on the old trimmer. My neatly trimmed beard uses a 6 on the sides. I had been hoping for a single item solution to decrease space usage. This is not it. And there is a danger this will dissuade some men from having a beard as many of them will be trimmed to a length far too short by this. All it would take is a separate snap on collar in order to be long enough (for me; they might need a third for people who trim to a 9 on the old one or longer for the Austin beard set).</li>
            <li> Got the face baby smooth.</li>
            <li> only had it for a few weeks and it cuts great but i have been having problems with the battery. I have charged it just like the manual says to and it will run for 15min and die without notice and on a full charge. i have never gotten a orange battery light.</li>
            <li> nice product, quick delivery</li>
            <li> Very good razor and it&#x27;s quiet too.</li>
            <li> Works well and battery charge lasts for almost 2 weeks.  It&#x27;s small in size and easy to clean the blades.</li>
            <li> I had this for a year and I use this every week. No need to spend more. Get this and you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Although, I&#x27;m not sure, if this is good on thick hair.</li>
            <li> The dual razor head gets dull and doesn&#x27;t shave closely after a few months use. My husband isn&#x27;t blessed with a lot of facial hair so he is only shaving a goatee and a mustache every other day. he does keep it clean so thats not why it&#x27;s become dull.</li>
            <li> This shaving set is awesome it gets the job done and is a very close shave facial or anywhere else. id recommend this product highly to anyone looking for something that can trim those pesky hairs so you can look the way you want. i gave it four only because i feel the body grooming tool need to be a bit closer when shaving. i can still feel a little stubble on my chest maybe i wasn&#x27;t using it right but overall this was an awesome buy. i recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li> my last electric shaver died on me so I purchased this. I wasn&#x27;t sure because of some of the reviews but I just opened it up and tried all 3 attachments. Everything works perfect. Smooth, easy, and convenient. Great product!</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband and he really enjoys using it.  He said it is a good razor.  His other one finally wore out.</li>
            <li> This is my first Electric Shaver! Given to me as a gift from my wife. Coming from a regular razor, there is a learning curve With operator errors, and i need to learn how to use an Electric Shaver. This shaver works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Bradley S.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, the traditional razor and shaving cream method of shaving irritates my skin and prevents me from shaving more than every 2nd or 3rd day.  Electric shavers do not irritate my skin as much, but I had never been satisfied with the quality of the shave.  I had tried various Norelco three head shavers in the past and have been less than satisfied.  Over the years, I settled on a Remington foil type shaver with better results, but it still did not do a great job.  Finally, I just gave up on the idea of shaving everyday.  The last electric shavers I tried would be considered ancient by today’s standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I had the opportunity to try Phillips Norelco YS521/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit.  It had been years since I tried an electric shaver and I wanted to see how the technology has changed over the last decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made my final shave with a blade and the next morning I popped on the shave head and proceeded with my morning shave.  I have to say I was incredibly impressed with the results.  While the resulting shave was not blade shave close, it was still a very close shave with hardly any missed whiskers and very few scratchy, stubbly spots.  I have used the shaver most days of the week for a month and have still not recharged the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have with this electric shaver is that it seems to do an exceptionally poor job with longer whiskers.  The shaver has a tough time dealing with a 2 day beard growth.  I usually have to resort to a blade shave before using the electric shaver again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then tried the body groomer attachment.  The body groomer takes a little practice do be able to groom yourself without scratching yourself and pulling the hair.  The body groomer attachment works OK.  The foil does not seem to get a close shave of the body hair in my opinion, but I am not 100% sure it is meant to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I played with the beard trimmer a bit, but I do not have a beard.  I tried it on body hair before using the body groomer attachment.  The beard trimmer is easily adjustable and seems to do an OK job.  Not having a beard, I cannot give it a thorough review though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an electric shaver, I think this product is outstanding.  I was very pleased with the shave I got using this product.  The rest of the attachments seem to be all right.

            <li> The Philips Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit is a decent electric razor and groomer. It comes with three separate attachments, an electric face razor, a beard trimmer, and a body shaver. All three attach easily by snapping on and can similar detach easily by pulling off. All pieces are easy to clean: just run under hot water and use the provided brush as necessary to get all the excess hair out. The base handle piece is a bit big and bulky but is comfortable to hold. While the battery life is quoted as 40 minutes, I actually found it to be probably about twice that, and it seemed to die without warning. My impressions of the three attachments are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor is a typical &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; razor style in which you should theoretically not be able to cut yourself by shaving (however, I actually drew blood yesterday while using it). It contours to your face as you move it around your cheek and jawline. While it generally works well, it has some drawbacks. I have found that I can never get a full clean shave with it and still have to keep my traditional hand razor to clean up remaining hairs that it misses or to hit my sideburns or the sides of my goatee. Since the razor is circular it has a difficult time hitting edges like that. Also, it is incredibly slow to use. I can shave much, much faster with a regular hand razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer has an adjustable piece that attaches to the trimming unit so that you can adjust the closeness of the blades to your face. I&#x27;ve found it to be a bit frustrating to get it just right, as when I hold the razor upright (that is, with the handle pointing down) I can&#x27;t seem to get much progress in trimming my facial hair; contrarily, I can hold it the other way with the handle pointing up and it will overtrim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body shaver is frustrating, to say the least. It consists of a regular metal shaver/blades like the other two pieces, and also has a plastic attachment that serves as a &amp;#34;comb&amp;#34; while shaving. I have found the comb to be not much use, as not much comes off while using it, and unfortunately without it the blades pull a bit painfully. I find this attachment to be the least useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would say that this grooming toolkit is decent, but would recommend something else if you can find one that is better reviewed.</li>
            <li> The standard against which a multiple use product like this is to be measured is NOT whether it is the best performing product at each task, but rather whether it performs well enough to replace two or more items in your bathroom or more importantly in your carry on luggage.  As a habitually clean-shaven man, I might seem a poor choice to review such a product, but a fortuitously timed Great Recession has allowed me to grow a beard in order to fully test the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEARD STYLING HEAD: The beard styling trimmer is pretty basic, having no vacuum and only 5 length settings: 11/64, 9/64, 7/64, 5/64, and 3/64 inch.  The length lock is mechanical and seems pretty steady; it never \\&quot;slipped\\&quot; on me.  The beard styling comb is removable for contouring.  Note: At the shortest length as well as with the comb removed, the blade is quite close to the skin, making it relatively easy to cut yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHAVER HEAD: As a blade shaver whose weapon of choice is the [[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Men&#x27;s Power Razor]], I have always believed that electric razors are for men who don&#x27;t really insist on a close shave (or less facetiously for men whose lifestyle requires shaving on-the-go).  Nothing about the performance of this trimmer&#x27;s shaver head has changed my mind, and for shaving the entire face it is clearly inferior to any of their more advanced triple headed shavers.  However, in fairness, it was never really intended for this purpose.  No man in his right mind would choose such a product unless he was planning to at least experiment with facial hair, and for the purpose of shaving (wet or dry) those parts of your face not covered by your beard or mustache, it is quite adequate, while for shaving your whole face, it gets the job done eventually.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GROOMER HEAD: Chances are this is going to be the selling point.  There are lots of beard trimmer/shavers out there, but Philips made its name in body grooming, and what you get here is the very same revolutionary; wet, dry, or in the shower; dual-sided trimming blades with shaver foil in the middle [[ASIN:B000MN63CO Philips Norelco Bodygroom Trimmer/Shaver Foil]] that was offered on their very first model.  The Trimmer Combs have changed design only once and that was to make them bidirectional.  Unlike their various model single use body groomers which come with three trimmer combs (Numbers 1, 2, 3), this model comes with only a single trimmer comb, the shortest one (Number 1); however, unless your body hair grooming style is Neat Wookie, this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.  In any case you can use the longer combs from other current models, should you happen to own one, like for example the [[ASIN:B007VB50JC Philips Norelco BG2028 Bodygroom]], or Philips Norelco will no doubt sell them to you as replacement parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Unless you plan on regularly maintaining yourself in that condition, it is not advisable to shave yourself too closely between the waist and the knees.  Two words -- \\&quot;razor stubble\\&quot; -- in close contact with your most tender areas should be explanation enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Another option for those looking for the closest possible grooming is the [[ASIN:B001VEK1GW Braun BodyCruzer Men&#x27;s Body Groomer, Titanium]].  Though the trimmer head is inferior to any Philips Norelco Bodygroom IMHO, its ace in the hole is the attachment for a [[ASIN:B003EMXLIE Gillette Fusion Cartridge]].  You cannot get a closer body shave than that.  You could also try the new [[ASIN:B00HF3XSRW Gillette Body Razor]], essentially a [[ASIN:B0001LQGFG Gillette Venus Divine Sensitive Women&#x27;s Razor]] with a color change, for that closest possible body shave finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A much bigger problem IMHO, which cost this product a star in my review, was their redesign of the handle so that it cannot fit into the Back Shave Attachment that comes with their [[ASIN:B007VB50LU Philips Norelco BG2038 Bodygroom Plus]].  Depending on the length and flexibility of your arms, the acreage and thickness of your backwoods, or the presence of a partner willing to help you clear the underbrush on a regular basis, this might not be an issue for you, in which case you can add that star back.  However, if when you wear a mesh shirt, no one looking at your back can tell you are wearing a shirt, you should probably give this some thought.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Should you be attempting to share living quarters with a smaller massed, higher voiced person who complains about being cold all the time, this body groomer may offer a solution because I have noted that after removing my fur I feel noticeably cooler and can tolerate a higher thermostat setting.  Should said always cold person be willing to assist you in regular shearings, the potential for peaceful compromise could be greatly increased.he acreage and thickness of your backwoods, or the presence of a partner willing to help you clear the underbrush on a regular basis, this might not be an issue for you, in which case you can add that star back.

            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for some kind of \\&quot;all-in-one\\&quot; shaver for a while now to use mostly when traveling or on vacation - having to carry two or three separate shavers/trimmers is cumbersome. I also wanted to try out a 2-head version of Norelco&#x27;s rotary heads because the 3-head versions I have owned always felt a bit clumsy to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Click &amp; Style got pretty good reviews and was available at a decent price so I gave it a try. I would be inclined, however, to call this an \\&quot;entry-level\\&quot; product as the plastics and parts feel a little on the cheap side. Also, no stand or carry bag is included with this item. Having a small carrying pouch is nice because there are several parts that are easy to misplace. Plus, when you store this thing in a drawer or cabinet there are always bits of stubble left in the heads and attachments that invariably make a mess in the bottom of a drawer or travel bag after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this shaver a couple of times a weeks for about a month now. Performance of the 2-head shave head was fairly good. I was, however, very surprised (and disappointed) that the heads don&#x27;t pivot! This made the shaving experience much more difficult than necessary. I had to move the whole shaver about to follow the contours of my face, instead of the heads flexing to follow the curves. But after a few days I got used to the shaver and was able to get a pretty close shave in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I only shave about twice a week it&#x27;s necessary for me to first \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot; the longer stubble on my face with the bare trimmer attachment. (Otherwise, shaving with the rotary heads alone, it would take about 20 minutes to shave down the long stubble!) I have a goatee, so I trim around that during the \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot;. The trimmer blades on this unit are of a fairly coarse design intended for rapid cutting, but at the expense of precision. My dedicated beard trimmer (also a Norelco) has a trimmer attachment with very fine (close together) blades, that produces a much neater edge to my goatee than the  Click &amp; Style trimmer does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor on this shaver feels a little underpowered most of the time, like it&#x27;s just strong enough to do the job, but it starts bogging down (and pulling hairs) as soon as the battery starts to run down a bit. Since this is more of an entry-level product it uses a NiMH battery instead of a more powerful lithium-ion battery. As long as the shaver is used (and charged) regularly this isn&#x27;t much of a problem, but if you only use it monthly you may find the battery has worn down quite a lot as NiMH batteries self-discharge quite rapidly. Run time overall was satisfactory, as I was able to get about three full shaves on a charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the body trimmer only a bit to trim some areas on my neck and back. I actually had my girlfriend do the back trimming as I couldn&#x27;t see or reach back there. It did a satisfactory job the two times we used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, if you&#x27;re in the market for a shaver, a beard trimmer, and a body trimmer, the Philips Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit is a pretty good value over purchasing three separate devices. But because it is more of an entry-level product it doesn&#x27;t really EXCEL at any of these functions. It will be great for my purposes as a unit I will use when traveling, but for my day to day shaving I will continue to use my superior individual products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** MARGINALLY RECOMMENDED - 3 STARS ***es, that produces a much neater edge to my goatee than the  Click &amp; Style trimmer does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The motor on this shaver feels a little underpowered most of the time, like it&#x27;s just strong enough to do the job, but it starts bogging down (and pulling hairs) as soon as the battery starts to run down a bit.

            <li> It met my expectations and I was amazed by the results..!&lt;br /&gt;This is the kind of trimmer I am exactly looking for...!</li>
            <li> Bought this from Tarjee as got additional 5% off with Redcard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many.  I am not fussy about my beard trimmer, most number 3s are fine out there.  This one feels so light and is so ergonomical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best part is the body groomer ... grrrr ... it is smooth, it doesn&#x27;t prick, pull or even tingle like other groomers have.  I have tried everything even had a phase where I was shaved with a razor.  Without a good groomer I kinda let it go, and didn&#x27;t manscape as much.  Now that I do, it is amazing, feels good.  No hair in nostrils for the partner either ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best buy.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to try out electric shaver for a closer shave. It is okay for beginners but lacks the close shave.( Maybe because it doesn&#x27;t have a triple head like most electric shavers)  The different attachments are nice so you can style and groom different parts of the body. Once I charged the battery, i have used it for 5-6 times without charging. Also, I like how you can take the attachment and run it with water to keep the heads clean. The styling groomer and trimmer are pretty sturdy and good for trimming body hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product says its good for wet/dry shave, but to my experience dry shave is not worth it. I was using shaving soap with Aloe so my face wouldn&#x27;t burn so much after the shave. But you will actually need shaving foam for a good clean shave from this electric shaver. I don&#x27;t like how the instructions say you have to stretch your skins so you can get a closer shave. Isn&#x27;t that what the electric heads are for?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few uses, I have learned to shave in circular motions. The face shave is great, however, since i have coarse hair on my  neck, I can&#x27;t get as a close shave as on my face. I end up using a razor blade to get the bottom of my neckline are. The one thing I find neat about the electric shaver after using it, is that it does not give cuts to my skin and make me bleed like a razor shave would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Good for begginners and attachments are nice. No bleeding compared to razor shave. Sometimes there are coupons or special deals on this product where you can get almost up to 20 dollars off. Battery use is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Not as close of a shave, shouldn&#x27;t have to stretch own face skin for a better shave. Takes about the same time as razor shaving to get the close shave. Norelco should ditch the two head razor and keep the three head razors like they use on most of their electric razors for a closer shave. Another thing, I seen the same design/product resold as Axe electic razor which can cost same/cheaper at Wal-Mart stores. It looks same as this product but with a different name. Sometimes they are around $30, so one can try those before buying a more expensiver branded Norelco one.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my 93-year old father did not find it user friendly and was very disappointed with it--especially with all the unnecessary attachments.</li>
            <li> Everything with it is just perfect, except for the battery. you cant use it while its on the charger. if it sits for a few days after a full charge, its empty again.</li>
            <li> I bought this at bestbuy because i had a 50$ gift card to best buy so it was only 10$. This is the best product ever. It gives a great close shave, and if you&#x27;re like me and don&#x27;t shave on a daily basis, the battery charge will last you at least a month or more. It is easy to clean and waterproof. The other attachments are great uses.</li>
            <li> Works great, just like it does in the comercials also cheaper than at most retail stores that sell same product</li>
            <li> On the face it is too weak to give a close or even a close shave. I have a squared jaw line and it just can&#x27;t cut where it needs to. The body groomer is nice and helps trim but other than that this thing is for a 13 year old just starting out.</li>
            <li> Piece of Crap!  design is ok....but the design is nasty and non-ergonomic.  My $20 cheap shaver thats made in China is more useful...than this over-hyped product/</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and works awesome. The speed at which this was shipped out is amazing as well! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but this time I felt I had to. I was so unbelievably disappointed by this item. I bought this so that I could stop using razors, or at least cut down on the frequency I have to use them. It says it&#x27;s supposed to give 40 minutes of cordless work for about an hour charge time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is untrue. I&#x27;ve never gotten it to work more then 10 minutes if I&#x27;m lucky. It doesn&#x27;t shave the face at all. I didn&#x27;t buy this product to double the amount of time I spend shaving cause I still have to use a razor after I&#x27;m done. It leaves patches of hair behind and no matter how taut I pull skin it will not remove hair from neck/chin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body grooming attachment it a joke. As soon as I begin to use it the razor dies every time. I&#x27;ll just get started and it shuts off every time. The commercial and website are a complete lie from what I experienced. Phillips norelco should be absolutely ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband, but he hasn&#x27;t used it yet, since he&#x27;s across the country. But I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll like it! He&#x27;s in the army and needed something to give him a close shave, but also accomodate to his sensitive skin. Hopefully this shaver works out :)</li>
            <li> I already had a Norelco shaver with 3 heads that I can use wet or dry. But this one I specifically purchased for traveling. It only has 2 heads for the shaver part, but has two other attachments for mangrooming and trimming. Between them all I can groom my body, face and head hair just how I want it. The battery lasts as long as I need it to. In fact I usuallly just take the shaver and attachments, leaving behind the charger when I go away for up to a week. I shave my head, so I use the shaver head for that unless I&#x27;ve gone too many days, then I first use the trimmer to cut it down before shaving. I really like this shaver and find it as easy to shave with as the 3 head, but since I have the other attachments it&#x27;s more versatile and pretty much the coolest thing out there to take care of all the hair you want trimmed. I don&#x27;t believe any guy should ever shave his legs, but I do shave the arms and chest down sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;I personally feel that a man with shaved legs is too effeminate, and would never do it. but I think it&#x27;s ok to shave the rest of one&#x27;s body. lol. (Insert laughter).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. So far he is pleased with it but has learned from the first time he used it to use shaving cream. You dont have to but he said it pulls if you dont. He also thought it would come with a charging dock which it doesnt. All and all he likes it.</li>
            <li> My son is very happy with this product. He is a swimmer and needs a close shave. Would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> For the price, this thing is awesome. Been using it for almost half a year now and all my shaving and some of my body hair trimming needs have been taken care of. Whether trimming a beard up, keeping it a certain length, dry or wet shaving completely smooth skin (all parts are completely waterproof and you can take it in the shower if you want) this thing does it all and does it well in my opinion. And yes, I have even used it &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; carefully if you need it do that as well. Cleaning the nozzle heads is easy as well just rinse out with steaming hot water and the blades will be clean of any hair.</li>
            <li> Given the low price, I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for the Norelco YS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised by all 3 attachments:&lt;br /&gt;- shaver, on my skin, gives an equivalent shave to my Norelco 9170XL, albeit much slower with only 2 heads not 3&lt;br /&gt;- trimmer has one-step-closer than my trusty Wahl trimmer, although the head is a bit larger and takes some getting used to&lt;br /&gt;- body groomer does an excellent job on those hard-to-reach places on the back and shoulder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s not to like? Well, first of all, the shaver is only 2 heads not 3 like a typical Norelco shaver, so it takes longer to shave. Secondly, the RQ32 replacement shaver heads are EXPENSIVE - at $32.18 (Amazon price) they are actually $2 more than the HQ9 3-head replacements for my 9170XL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is a bit larger than my all-in-one Wahl unit, so it takes some getting used to, even though it gives a closer trim at the lowest setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the angle of the body groomer again takes some getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this as a supplement, not a replacement, for your primary shaver.</li>
            <li> I apologize that I don&#x27;t have a long, comprehensive review of this product, but I was unwilling to use it for very long, and that is relevant to why the review is short and only covers one element of the possible experience with this product.Using this left my face raw, and did not even provide a close shave as a mitigating part of that experience (and I tried). The instructions included advise to give it &amp;#34;three weeks&amp;#34; to let your face and beard acclimate to it. From previous experience with electric razors, I think that is just BS. I&#x27;ve used electric razors before that gave me a closer shave, and with no irritation, on the very first use.</li>
            <li> Really worth the money</li>
            <li> So far I really like the Norelco, everything they said about the different pieces you can put on and the quality of the product is true.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that was stupid was that it has an american power plug and I live in the Netherlands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else is great!</li>
            <li> This shaver has some problems. The first is that the handle is awkwardly large which makes it cumbersome to hold in all the positions you need to get a proper shave. The regular shaver attachment doesn&#x27;t do the job very well and I have to keep going over the same spots to get it to work. The engine doesn&#x27;t sound smooth compared with my other shaver. I chopped one of my sideburns way too short by accident because the trimmer length is difficult to set and use because of the odd angle. I don&#x27;t recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> great shaver, smooth, close shave, and strong engine. I love it, its the best shaver I have ever had.It doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way his body looks after using it.  Seems to be a great razor and price was $10 cheaper than at walmart!  Great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Does not come close in quality to my older Norelco. Lots of plastic and even after trying for a week it does not shave well either.</li>
            <li> has a good shave, all the heads attach with ease, good grip got it for a fair price love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll first mention that I basically use this as a trimmer on the shortest position so my review will only address the trimming head. It&#x27;s not that I&#x27;m going for a particular look or anything, but any shaving has always caused acne. Electric, wet, dry, safety-razor, multi-blade, against the grain or with, it doesn&#x27;t matter and I&#x27;ve tried them all. So permanent shadow it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to venture a guess, the other heads probably work just fine but will take some time for those with thicker beards. The motor simply isn&#x27;t as powerful as higher-end models, and the price reflects that. If you grow your hair out, you&#x27;ll have to first use the trimmer with the grain to shorten it out, then go for a second pass in the manner you wish. Having thrown down money for one of those ~$100 electrics, I&#x27;d tell you to save your money. My life isn&#x27;t complicated enough that I need to save a minute or two. If I did, I simply wouldn&#x27;t bother shaving...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the benefits of this compared to the high powered devices is that it is quiet. It doesn&#x27;t sound like a damned vacuum, which is useful if you live with other people. Seriously, I&#x27;ve used other trimmers and shavers that are basically like a quiet hair drier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is fantastic. I charge it before it dies (the thing simply doesn&#x27;t die, even after a week of daily use). The NiMH battery in it charges in a couple of hours and doesn&#x27;t have the slow-drain problems of early (or cheap) NiMH batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the trimmer portion works great. Using it against the grain basically creates the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow look.</li>
            <li> The older models were much more powerful. It takes a lot longer to shave with this version as you have to cover the same ground more than once.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I usually use this</li>
            <li> First I must tell you that I have owned other electric shavers and have never gotten a close clean shave with one.  I have always had to revert back to a regulear razor.  I decided to give the Phillips NorelcoYS524/41 Click &amp; Style Shave Toolkit a try.  I have finally found a Electric Shave that actually works and gives me a GREAT close clean smooth shave.  The additional Style attacments are a bonus and work flawlessly.  This has to be the BEST Electric Shaver around.  YES YES YES I highly recommend this shaver to everyone.  If it can handle my tough beard and make me a believer in electric shavers then you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The click and style is nice, but the only thing I don&#x27;t like about is the razor head for your face doesn&#x27;t get as close as my other Norelco razor. But I love the body grooming head, it good for all areas below the neck.</li>
            <li> if I use the beard styler without the comb, the product disassembles! I&#x27;m disappointed with the poor quality. It&#x27;s not what I expected.</li>
            <li> You can do anything you want with this product, I like this a lot. I have had many others electric razers and this is the best one.</li>
            <li> Before you buy this product just know that is not for men with thick hair. If u use it and you got some pretty thick hair your just going to jam it. It&#x27;s great shaver for more smoother hair. Gets the job done 👍</li>
            <li> Its not as good as I expected it. The shaver does not work if you have think facial hairs like I have.&lt;br /&gt;I can only use the trimmer for trimming hairs. Shave is almost useless on my face.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco razors all my life and this this the best yet. I have get a bad shave with your products</li>
            <li> Excellent product !! easy to use !! perfect for all kind of hair removal !! chest ..hands...foot !!! face !!! excellent !! you can use it on the shower too !! easy to clean .!! easy to charge !! I recommend !!</li>
            <li> I use this very often and it always works perfectly. No hair pulling and very even shave. It seems like I never have to charge the battery either. Very good product and I&#x27;ve gotten rid of all my other shavers because of it. The attachments make it very versatile.</li>
            <li> I just have a great experience whit this norelco. It is really cheap and it works perfectly. I have an older philips and it was broken, this one is more safe, confortable and makes a perfect shave.</li>
            <li> This razor works fine for about three months, after which the battery starts to crap out. Now, it only lasts about two minutes on a full charge. I have to shave half of my face, then re-charge it, then finish shaving. Total pain in the ass.</li>
            <li> Seriously, if you have ANYTHING better to do than shave, buy something else. In the 15 years i&#x27;ve been shaving i&#x27;ve never had to work this hard  for smooth results. 35 minutes for an &#x27;almost&#x27; smooth shave when all i had on my face was a days worth of stubble is just unacceptable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attachments don&#x27;t do much to salvage the purchase, either. The body trimmer head--like the shaver head before it--picks and chooses when and where it descides to actually &#x27;cut,&#x27; regardless of the angle you decide to work with, and the other head is designed in such a way that it make no sense to use unless youre okay with closing your eyes and hoping for the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, youre better off with disposable razors and a comb. You&#x27;ll get much better results, that you control, in half the time--They just wont look as cool next to the sink.</li>
            <li> This device is truly one of a kind ! It works great everywhere ! lol I recommend this to every man and woman. YES ladies why not.</li>
            <li> this shaver takes a little longer the triple head shavers of Norelco that I have but it is very versatile and ideal for travel.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Very reliable.  Charge lasts long.  Only wanted to use it to trim my beard and it has all the perfect lengths.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would not say this product is remarkable. The finish is a bit cheap, and I don&#x27;t think the attachments are super nice. But it does its job, like all other Philips products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads cost a lot, so be sure to take care of this product.</li>
            <li> Im not a big fan of shaving but have to be for work. I am a fan of trimming my body hair and this does both well. The heads pop off easy and I like that the trimmer can be placed on either direction giving you a different angle of attack. I know some people said that the trimmer did not adjust that much but I have not found it to be an issue. The trimmer is designed to go over the area to be trimmed at a tilted angle and when done correctly it can leave a good amount of hair. Sure if your trying to sport a beard over an inch this is not the tool for you to just rake through to trim it up but then it was not said to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got it for was the ability to shave wet or dry while in or out of the shower. Shaving in the shower with water or cream is smooth and leaves me feeling clean and smooth with no irritation. The battery power seems to be more than enough to trim both my arms and chest and still get a shave in which has been a challenge for my past trimmers and none of them offered a very good shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I didnt notice about the product was it does NOT come with a stand. It just has a plug that plugs into the bottom of the device. At first I was a tad dissappointed but quickly got over it as I realized it is actually easier to use this was than having a stand take up room on the counter. It will also travel better and it cut out the need to take as much on trips since it can do it all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had many Norelco trimmers over the years and still have a Bodygroomer but this beats them all to date. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is as good an electric razor as I&#x27;ve ever had. It holds its charge for quite a while -- can&#x27;t tell you precisely how long, because I have a beard and only trim the fuzz every once in a while. The interchangable heads offer plenty of variety, and they feel like they&#x27;ll be clicking snugly in place for quite a while (I keep going between two different heads). I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> THIS WAS A GIFT FOR MY SON AND HE LOVES IT.</li>
            <li> does the job its meant to, good value for the price. trim groom and shave all with one unit, good battery life and leaves a smooth cut</li>
            <li> Works but kinda fragile. Not their top of the line.</li>
            <li> This shaver is awesome!! It&#x27;s super easy to change the shaver heads and it gives a VERY good shave! I wasn&#x27;t expecting too much from this product, but man it takes the cake! Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Great seller, great product, fast delivery. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor</li>
            <li> Really a good all around razor, the two heads take a bit longer to shave my face than a 3 headed electric shaver but I have gotten used to them and they provide a nice, close shave. The beard shaving attachment I have found at its longest setting to be perfect length for body hair, and the body hair a great length for more detail. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use this norelco for everything but shaving my facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I dislike norelco since it takes more than one pass to shave hair that my panasonic LV 81 will do in one pass.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent for trimming underarms, legs, chest, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Good product, 4 stars</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was as described....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t grow a ton of facial hair and when I do it is usually pretty thin and not very visible, but this electric shaver deals with it quite effectively. I just puff my cheeks press it very gently to my face move it in a circular motion and I am good to go in less than 3 minutes. Overall it has been and excellent daily shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver works well lasts long on a charge. It is very easy to maintain. The attachments are quality made an seem they will last a long time. I have bought other shavers before an they were ether hard to clean cheaply made out plastic ,but this isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i expected</li>
            <li> charge lasts for ever, is a great device</li>
            <li> I bought this item a little more than a year ago and am reviewing it now once it has been used for a while.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first ever electric razor to buy, but not the first one to use. I&#x27;ve used many of my friends electric razors and many of them seemed to be a poor fit for me. Alas, I got tired of shaving using razors and bought this, and I loved it since day one! My facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow extremely quickly, but it is thicker than most other people in my age group, and if I let it be for a week and a half or so most of my face will get covered.&lt;br /&gt;As my first electric razor I was expecting a less than smooth face from regular razors but was pleasantly surprised to see that it gave me very close shaves. I still use shaving cream out of habit I guess, but when I am tight on time I use it on dry skin and it works just as well. The attachments have also been a huge plus. The styler attachment (beard trimmer) became my go-to whenever I let my beard grow unchecked. I&#x27;ve learned from experience that using the shaver attachment on a beard is a very painful mistake. I usually don&#x27;t style my beard because I like to look clean-cut, but the five length settings on the styler attachment lets me have a beard that&#x27;s not too out of control. Finally, I&#x27;ve used the bodygroom attachment to shave below the belt for a while now, and it&#x27;s mostly painless if you&#x27;re careful.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any other electric razors to compare battery life to, but this one rarely gives me this kind of issue. I use it once every couple of days and it could stay more than a month on one full charge. Furthermore, if it does happen to be empty and I&#x27;m in a hurry (has happened more than once), I stick it in the charger for about 5 minutes and I&#x27;m good to go for that shaving session.&lt;br /&gt;One year later: after owning this razor for over a year, all of its parts seem to be functional and still going strong. They give you a small brush with it to wipe the hair from your attachments and it helps. The only thing I&#x27;ve noticed is a faint white color that is on the inside of the shaver that seems to have built up over the past year. It might be from the hot water or from me simply not cleaning it as much as I should, but either way my shaves are still as close as ever.&lt;br /&gt;All in all an excellent product, very pleased with it and haven&#x27;t complained once since I got it. When it finally wears out or I decide to get a new one, Philips Norelco will be the brand I choose!ced is a faint white color that is on the inside of the shaver that seems to have built up over the past year.

            <li> Excellent product !!!!</li>
            <li> i was surprised something this reasonaby priced would work so good. good battery life, good simple attachments, and you can use it in the shower. not the best strictly as a razor, but it will get you by on weekends or casual days. i love it.</li>
            <li> I have always used regular razors but thought I would try this out to see if I liked using an electric shaver. It does everything I need it to do. I do not use the razor for daily shaving, but for touch up stuff. Probably the best feature of this groomer is that it&#x27;s always ready to use.</li>
            <li> Does the job rather well. I do prefer some of their other three-head shaver just for coverage, but it still trims hair easily and efficiently. I really like the fact that it comes with a body hair trimmer as well. You might be able to do that with a normal razor and trimmer, but it really makes it a lot easier.</li>
            <li> very convenient to use in shower, trims and shaves nicely.  only drawback it where to keep the unused heads when not in use.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.. I love it..</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time. Product as described. Getting used to shaving with these. Yet to use body trimmer.</li>
            <li> great product, excellent seller</li>
            <li> Product design and quality not up to Norelco  past shavers I have had.  Shave was not near as smooth or comfortable as my previous Nerelco</li>
            <li> As somebody coming from a manual razor I decided to give electric shavers a try to speed up my routine and also because I was nicking myself a lot due to trying to shave a lot of facial hair with my razor.&lt;br /&gt;First time I used it I wasn&#x27;t impressed and I missed a lot of hair but I decided to give it another go figuring I just wasn&#x27;t using it right. I&#x27;m very glad that I did because this is an EXCELLENT shaver. It takes me less than a minute to fully run it across my face and get most of my hair shaved up. Take note that it doesn&#x27;t completely get rid of all the facial hair and I use my razor afterwards to run across my face for anything that was missed. I assume most shavers are like this because it really can&#x27;t get as close or smoothly of a shave as my razor does. I don&#x27;t mind it at all because I usually just run it across my face and then switch to my razor to shave my sideburns and anything I missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is also really easy. You just pop the trimming clip off and clean underneath of it and pop it back on. The battery also lasts for quite some time and I usually for through a few shaves before I need to charge it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make note my review is mainly based around the facial shaving use of it. I haven&#x27;t used the other blades at all and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll bother.</li>
            <li> It is perfect to me...</li>
            <li> I used to purchase philips norelco products, they are a high quality shavers. but after witnesing the highly offencive comercial for this product i refuse to use / buy any more of their products.</li>
            <li> If you have about 30 minutes to shave then the face shaver is for you.  Just takes too long to get a quality shave.  I went back to my razor the same morning.  Haven&#x27;t used it for man scaping yet but im sure it will work well for that.  NOT as easy as the commercial.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Overview&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hesitant to buy this product after reading several reviews talk about the unit being low-powered. Unfortunately, I decided to go ahead and try out the item anyways since it comes with a 45 day money-back guarantee (more on that later). It arrived today, and I let it charge for several hours prior to using it as per the instructions. The take away story is that I was really unimpressed, and I&#x27;ll go ahead and review the various components of the device in detail below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Beard Trimmer&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wanted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first shaver/body groomer but not my first beard trimmer. I personally like to keep a 5-o&#x27;clock shadow look so I tend to just use a cheap Remington trimmer without the comb. I was hoping that this Norelco would be a more sophisticated machine and give me a more even trim. I looked at the specs and noted that the shortest length cut was about 1mm, I would have preferred something a bit closer but it seemed like this was pretty universal so I just went with it. All I really wanted from Norelco here was less irritation and a more even trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer worked fine, the comb was essentially useless since I wanted the closest stubble I could get to really have that 5-o&#x27;clock shadow look. It was less irritating to the skin than my 30 dollar Remington trimmer, but not really that much more even. Nothing more to really say here, I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use this on body hair because the battery died (more on that later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Shaver&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wanted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I want to shave I go ahead and use a safety razor with BlueBird blades, so I had absolutely no expectation for the Norelco to give me a closer shave than that. What I did want from the Norelco was a fast shave that would be passable in case I was in a hurry and needed to look professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if this is because im not used to electric shavers, but this really took me a while. Like, it took long enough that I think I could have just done a single pass with my safety razor and probably have gotten a closer shave. I have some really stubborn spots down at my neck that even my razor can&#x27;t easily get where the Norelco really struggled. Some hairs it completely missed, I had to keep going over the same area to finally get a full shave. Where it did shave it did an alright job, but not really a close shave as I could still see a faint shadow-beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I felt like the shaver gave me a very mediocre shave without saving me that much time compared to my safety razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Body Groomer&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wanted:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was most excited about this attachment, and this was ultimately the reason why I wanted to branch out from just my old Remington beard trimmer. The Remington did an alright job doubling as a body groomer, but I wanted something that gave me the flexibility to shave bare as well as just trim. Also, beard trimmers are a bit dangerous at times when it comes to body grooming, so I was interested in  a safe body grooming solution. The addition of a comb on this attachment was great because I could still choose to trim or go bare and still get the safety benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I got:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First I tried trimming down my chest hair with the combed body groomer. While I likes the length it trimmed to (which was lucky because this comb doesn&#x27;t have different length settings), I didn&#x27;t like how hard it was to shave evenly. I had to go over the same area many times because the hairs just didn&#x27;t catch on the comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I decided to try shaving the hairs on my stomach without the comb. The Norelco did a pretty decent job here, and usually got shorter hairs in the first two passes. Longer hairs were more of a challenge as they would easily evade being cut. Overall though, I liked being able to get a decent shave on my stomach without irritation, which is otherwise prone to ingrown hairs when using a razor blade. Nevertheless, I had a hard time getting hairs around the navel, and before I got to try other areas the battery died on the unit. It seems like this attachment really drains the juice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Battery&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit disappointed in the battery. I tried using the razor to do a partial test trim of the beard, then a shave, then I tried to do body grooming during which the battery died. This unit wont last long enough to get all your grooming done + a shave is the basic gist of this. So guys, you&#x27;ll need to think carefully about what exactly you want shaved each day and account for the fact you may need to recharge this device to get everything done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;Money Back Guarantee&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m planning on sending this back to Norelco for their money back guarantee since I can&#x27;t exactly return it to Amazon in \\&quot;new\\&quot; condition. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t realize that the returns process to Norelco is a bit complicated, and involves waiting 3 weeks before you can send it back, filling out returns paperwork (that you apparently need to call a phone number to have mailed to you), paying shipping on the returns, and waiting 6-8 weeks for your check. Big hassle, and a huge head-ache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to wait the three weeks, if this machine miraculously becomes better I will update my review. Otherwise, just assume I shipped it back. I&#x27;ll probably still be waiting for my check.herwise prone to ingrown hairs when using a razor blade.

            <li> This is THE WORST electric shaver I have ever purchased, HANDS DOWN!  Quality-wise, this device is really just a very flimsy, cheaply made personal groomer/trimmer.  In my opinion, it is incredibly misleading to market this as a shaver.  It&#x27;s cheap construction is absolutely NOT up to the task of providing even a decent shave, as it pulls and nicks and leaves random full and partial hairs behind after innumerable passes at every conscievable angle with each and every attachment.  Ironically, I found the body groomer achieved the best (albeit, still terrible) \\&quot;shave\\&quot;.  Attempting to shave your neck and above your upper lip, as many have noted, is simply a lost cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to replace two aging though still functional devices: a superb Remington Micro Screen electric shaver and an equally good Norelco G370 All-in-One Grooming system, both 10+ years old.  Stick with what you know!  I will be returning this terrible Click &amp; Style Toolkit ASAP, and have already placed orders here on Amazon for a new Remington MS2-390 Microscreen shaver (which is being phased out, so get one fast if you want one!) and another Norelco G370.  Norelco&#x27;s G370, unlike this Click and Style travesty, is a quality-made product.  Both of the devices I&#x27;ve re-ordered may look a bit dated compared to these sleeker looking newer models, but are far more sturdy and functional that this particular device at least. If I get another 10+ years out of them (I seriously have only the vaguest of memories of purchasing them originally, it has been so long), then I will be in very good shape for a long time to come!  One final note, regarding reviews on the Remington Micro Screen: yes, it is indeed loud.  I would venture to guess, however, that that is because it has a real, powerful motor at work inside it, again, very unlike these cheaply made devices that just buzz a little and struggle to cut through your beard/stubble as you shave/trim it.  I understand now why Remington has such a loyal customer base, among whom I now count myself.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and we both are so impressed!! I am even guilty of using it :) I also like how it is water proof!</li>
            <li> Frankly, I loved the playful  advertising for this product so I gave it a try. As a body hair trimmer, it works very well. Unfortunately, for regular face shaving, this electric shaver takes twice as long to get a close shave.</li>
            <li> This is a great item.  Works great!  Would most definitely recommend this to anyone. Has great features &amp; attachments that are useful.</li>
            <li> It does all that it said in the ad.  A good choice  for the person that wants or needs to be well groomed.</li>
            <li> We went on a month long tour of Europe and this was the only grooming appliance I brought.  It handled everything without any issues whatsoever, even sometimes felt like the shave was smoother than it was when I used a Razor.  Really happy with this purchase and product.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Bought it for my teenage son and he likes it. Just hoping it will work longer compare to other brands.</li>
            <li> Hubby says it is well developed design for a mans face and body. Comfortable to use!</li>
            <li> really lives up to the name</li>
            <li> Every attachment works really well.  I am lazy when it comes to shaving so this makes it easier.  The attachment for the close shave takes a little longer than I expect but it still works well, it&#x27;s probably me.  I broke a little piece of plastic something when I was cleaning the adjustable shaver but it woks fine.</li>
            <li> Received this item yesterday and already used it this morning -the shaver bit. Although I was a bit uncertain of how it will work, I was amazed at how easy and fast it is.  Am unable to use normal razors due to in-grown hair problem and eventual pimples and black spots.  This seems to be a good alternative to troubles I have been going through to shave each morning.  No oiling required for this piece, the only problem I had was with the charger.  Although you can plug it into a 240v-120v socket, I needed to look for an adaptor since the charger is equipped with a 2-pin wall-socket plugin and without an adaptor, using a regular wall socket will be a problem.  Thus far, I love the sleekness and the simplicity and unless a problem develops later on, am happy with this style shaver</li>
            <li> I have had this for a year but I use is sparingly. Here are my reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed problems after about the 4th month. During cutting, the applicators would get jammed in my beard. This actually hurts because it pulls on your hair, some times I would bleed. I tried using it during a shower with shaving cream but I got the same outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The only working applicator is the body shaver. This works pretty well. For sure it wasn&#x27;t the length of my beard because I do not allow it to grow longer than a five o&#x27;clock shadow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t use it while you&#x27;re charging the battery. Sucks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintenance: You really gotta spend some money in order to keep this going. But be careful, sometimes when you snap them back in, they are sort of wobbly. Plus, it is hard to find new applicators for the machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin: I was developing bad irritation after my shave/cut. Certain areas of my face would turn inflamed and red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Can be used in Shower&lt;br /&gt;Body Shaver works well.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a friend and they loved it. They said it was very easy to use and it shaved very nicely.</li>
            <li> Really great razor. I use all three attachments when trimming facial hair and really cant find anything to complain about this tool.</li>
            <li> My favourite shaver and best shaver ever used...</li>
            <li> before buying this, have been using scissors to trim facial hair. and ever since I bought this, it now has been easier than ever. battery life is great and the ergonomics is just right</li>
            <li> Honestly I bought this after the commercial and I have to say this is the best razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations. My &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; razor for all my needs. There is a moderate learning curve but that&#x27;s me not the razor!</li>
            <li> Takes some time to get used to it, maybe a couple weeks, but it works great. Takes the same amount is time as a shave with a traditional razor. Highly recommend it for electric shaver newbies like myself.</li>
            <li> This is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. The quick switching heads are very convenient. I would recommend this razor to any one who likes easy shaving. It&#x27;s also dry or wet.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the body groomer.  It couldn&#x27;t cut any of my body hair.  It pulled most of it.  Had to stop half way through, and finish with something else.  Then had to shave before work.  I had 5 oclock shade at 9 in the morning.  Wish i could return it but already used it.</li>
            <li> First off I have to say I like this razor. It is good for little touch up spots or doing a little manscaping. However my is that although fully charged it doesn&#x27;t run for more then 30 seconds. Charged it all night, tried to use it in the morning, after being on for about 30 seconds it died as if the battery had run out. After waiting another 30 seconds I was able to hit the power button and it came roaring back to life, only to die again shortly after. I can repeat this process for a long long time before the battery actually dies and needs to be recharged for real, only to repeat this process. There are cheaper products out there that work just as good and better. Not worth the hassle</li>
            <li> I bought this for my man to help trim up his beard and it works pretty good. I liked that it has multiple attachments and is rechargeable, just wished the double head shaver would get a closer shave for his neck.  The beard trimmer with guard works pretty well. It was ok with me but he likes a much closer shave and said it pulled a little bit.</li>
