            <li> I can see my fine lines visibly disappearing.  I have only been using for a couple of weeks but I would recommend.</li>
            <li> i bought this product thinking in my appereance and feel on my face. but after 3 months nothing good, it has not a good smell, and i decided to buy  a Lóreal much better than this piece of junk...</li>
            <li> More ingredients listed such as purified water, mineral oil, aloe Vera etc. &amp; collagen is listed last. I use it on my forearms for thin skin. It definitely makes your skin soft but I see no sign of thickening of the skin.</li>

            <li> Excellent !!!! Just Buy it &amp; Enjoy it !!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The smell of the product is not pleasant.  I wanted to see results in two weeks but I really see no noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> My skin is now noticeably firmer after using this cream. I will buy it again. It takes a bit of time to dry, and I need to use a moisturizer on top of it, but it does what I was hoping for.</li>
