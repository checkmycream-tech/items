            <li>/&gt;Nordstrom&#x27;s $12 lip brush is awesome and selling at a price I can afford to lose.</li>

            <li>I am happy I found this one in great price.</li>

            <li>This is a very nice brush.  </li>
            <li>This is a good buy and cant beat the price.</li>

            <li>The concept and design of this brush is good.</li>
            <li>Good price</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>good buy and good lip brush.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s safe to take in your purse!</li>
            <li>It is a nice size too.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a kind of pen brush, it consists in 2 pieces, not one...</li>
            <li>The retractable tip of this brush is really handy.  </li>
            <li>It covers the lips nicely and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Okay my brush looks nothing like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is just okay for me.</li>
            <li>Looked for more for backup and could not find another anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best in this type of product.</li>
            <li>I love Amazon&#x27;s return policy because this brush did NOT work as a lip brush.</li>
            <li>Revlon&#x27;s is better.</li>
            <li>I love how this brush is protected inside a cap</li>
            <li>Love the fact that this lip brush retracts into itself so easily.  </li>
            <li>The brush is well made and the price is fine, but I would have preferred a more firmer brush.  </li>
            <li>It keeps the brush in good shape and allows you to carry it in a purse or overnight bag with much fuss.</li>
            <li>Was cheap but very clean application and worked wonders.</li>
            <li>works fine</li>
            <li>That being said, the actual brush is not so great.</li>
            <li>Snug fit.</li>
            <li>A very useful tool which I will enjoy using.  </li>
            <li>We found one at a local store and she loved it.  </li>
            <li>Nice soft brush.  </li>
            <li>Good bristles, good size, long lasting.</li>
            <li>Was shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li>Many lip brushes are short and hard to hold but this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much :)</li>
            <li>I love using it to get the remnants of my favorite lipstick when it&#x27;s gone down to the nub.</li>
            <li>Great brush for half the price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Do not waste money on more expensive brushes when this one is great!!</li>
            <li>By pulling the cap off the bottom, the brush retracts back into the body of the holder and the brush stays clean and safe inside when the cap is back on the top, just as you would a pen.</li>
            <li>The brush is nice and soft, enough texture to make an exact line, it is fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s firm, has nice fine, rounded yet straight edge for the corners and edges of the mouth, and the brush is retractable.</li>
            <li>+ the first time, I decided to go with this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>(I mention this because some brushes have damaged on my after first wash).  </li>
            <li>Was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>apply balm or conditioner to lips first, then apply lipcolor with this brush, blot, and repeat the color again.</li>
            <li>My current brush is worn out now but it was a better brush and easier to work with.</li>
            <li>It works pretty much like a ball point pen.</li>
            <li>This is a really handy little addition to my makeup drawer.</li>
            <li>i gently tried both and it seemed like it was coming out</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s 88 and doing very well for herself.</li>
            <li>looked for retractable lip brushes, but, found them very costly....</li>
            <li>After many multiple uses works just as well as when first bought and with cleaning can be used with multiple colors.</li>
            <li>Take the top off, but it on the bottom half and the brush slides up.</li>
            <li>This lip brush is just what I was looking for at more than half the price.  </li>
            <li>Although this is not the most expensive lip brush and even though it is Maybelline, as opposed to a department store brand or designer brand, it works as well or better than those.</li>
            <li>it was a soft brush that was gentle on my lips.</li>
            <li>Good price but brush is pretty lame.  </li>
            <li>Maybelline New York Expert Tools</li>
            <li>The bristles are too soft to spread lipstick evenly, particularly matte lipstick.</li>
            <li>When you done, process reverses and the brush is hidden away and covered so it doesn&#x27;t get lipstick anywhere and stays dust free.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rounded and not stiff enough to hold it&#x27;s shape when applying your lipstick.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft and applies lipstick</li>
            <li>The brush was too soft.</li>
            <li>Then the brush tip is too soft to properly pick up the lipstick and too soft to apply it to the lips just where you want it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But here is my major problem.  </li>
            <li>Reasonable enough to buy several to use with various color lipsticks.</li>
            <li>This brush is not easy or quick to use: you must pull two pieces apart, flip one, put them back together.</li>

            <li> This brush is not easy or quick to use: you must pull two pieces apart, flip one, put them back together.</li>
            <li> it does the job of course, but women sometimes are busy hands, we are putting the shadow on our eyes and using the lip stick at the same time, you know what I mean, well this lip brush doesn&#x27;t help to much in those moments.</li>
            <li> It is long enough both in the handle and in the bristles.</li>
            <li> -- they&#x27;re spendy, but cheaping out on them is just a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is wide enough.</li>
            <li> Bought two on-line and now set for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I usually purchase the Maybelline Lip Brush at Ulta because it is always sold out in other stores, but it is so much cheaper to order it instead.  </li>
            <li> This mabelline lip brush works just like the more expensive ones!  </li>
            <li> Makes application on chapped, cracked, or dry lips a thousand times easier.</li>
            <li> I shoved that back down once i realized its the bit that raises the bush.</li>
            <li> There are not enough bristles and the bristles in the brush are not very strong.</li>
            <li> The other brands I&#x27;ve tried, regardless of price, tend to have thinner, sparse bristles that do not coat as well or feel as luxurious.</li>
            <li> Unlike other brushes, it&#x27;s self contained.</li>
            <li> Although I used to soap-wash it every month or so, but it used to lie in my makeup bag with lots of other makeup stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but, as I&#x27;d had a hard enough time forking out $20</li>
            <li> I had one previously that slid out and then retracted again with one glide of my fingers over the case and the bristles were firmer.</li>
            <li> but then the little orange thing came out with it.</li>
            <li> I actually keep the item in a different compartment in my purse because I&#x27;m afraid it will get jumbled with my makeup, and the cap will come off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Out the package was a little confusing.</li>
            <li> I find it difficult to get enough lipstick on the brush because the bristles flair out and splay.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and they are getting hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find</li>
            <li> Mine arrived without any and it is too late to return it.</li>
            <li> you have to remove the brush, turn it and put it back in base and twist for the brush to pop up.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s broken.</li>
            <li> Defective and useless.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> I lost my MAC lip brush and wanted to replace it but, as I&#x27;d had a hard enough time forking out $20+ the first time, I decided to go with this one. It&#x27;s mediocre at best. The bristles are too soft to spread lipstick evenly, particularly matte lipstick. I guess I&#x27;m going to have to consider makeup brushes as an investment -- they&#x27;re spendy, but cheaping out on them is just a complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;03.15.13 Addendum:&lt;br /&gt;Nordstrom&#x27;s $12 lip brush is awesome and selling at a price I can afford to lose. It&#x27;s firm, has nice fine, rounded yet straight edge for the corners and edges of the mouth, and the brush is retractable. I&#x27;m going back this week to pick up a couple extras!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Thanks so much :)</li>
            <li> This is a great lip brush.  I like the fact that it is retractable, so I can carry in my purse.  The brush is soft and applies lipstick well.  I have washed it with regular soap (like I do all my brushes) and it held up well (I mention this because some brushes have damaged on my after first wash).  This is a good buy and cant beat the price.</li>
            <li> Although this is not the most expensive lip brush and even though it is Maybelline, as opposed to a department store brand or designer brand, it works as well or better than those. I have tried various kinds ranging in price well above the cost of this one, and it simply cannot be beat. It is long enough both in the handle and in the bristles. It is wide enough. It covers the lips nicely and smoothly. The other brands I&#x27;ve tried, regardless of price, tend to have thinner, sparse bristles that do not coat as well or feel as luxurious.</li>
            <li> Loved this makeup brush. Was cheap but very clean application and worked wonders. it was a soft brush that was gentle on my lips. After many multiple uses works just as well as when first bought and with cleaning can be used with multiple colors. Do not waste money on more expensive brushes when this one is great!!</li>
            <li> Okay my brush looks nothing like the picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it work.  Well, yeah, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here is my major problem.  The cap/top comes off.  It does not screw in.  I actually keep the item in a different compartment in my purse because I&#x27;m afraid it will get jumbled with my makeup, and the cap will come off again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just okay for me.</li>
            <li> The concept and design of this brush is good. It works pretty much like a ball point pen. You take the cap off and put it on the bottom of the holder which, in turn, pushes the brush up for use. By pulling the cap off the bottom, the brush retracts back into the body of the holder and the brush stays clean and safe inside when the cap is back on the top, just as you would a pen. That being said, the actual brush is not so great. It&#x27;s very rounded and not stiff enough to hold it&#x27;s shape when applying your lipstick.  I find it difficult to get enough lipstick on the brush because the bristles flair out and splay.  You have to twirl and work the brush on the lipstick to &amp;#34;regroup&amp;#34; the bristles.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  I&#x27;ve used these for years and they are getting hard to find.  Good bristles, good size, long lasting.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my wife.  We found one at a local store and she loved it.  Looked for more for backup and could not find another anywhere.  Bought two on-line and now set for a long time.  Definitely the best in this type of product.</li>
            <li> I love Amazon&#x27;s return policy because this brush did NOT work as a lip brush. The brush was too soft. Revlon&#x27;s is better.</li>
            <li> Maybelline New York Expert Tools, Lip Brush&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for two features, it&#x27;s retractable and it&#x27;s travel size. Out the package was a little confusing. It&#x27;s two pieces. you have to remove the brush, turn it and put it back in base and twist for the brush to pop up. Ok. Brush itself is great! But, to store it you have to twist?? Or pull? i gently tried both and it seemed like it was coming out but then the little orange thing came out with it. I shoved that back down once i realized its the bit that raises the bush. But now every time i want to store it the orange bit comes out. So it&#x27;s broken. Great. I don&#x27;t like that&#x27;s its two pieces and I don&#x27;t like there are no instructions on how to properly store the brush. Maybe i did break it, who knows?? Won&#x27;t buy again and I don&#x27;t recommend it. Get another brush.</li>
            <li> This lipstick brush is perfect for me.  Nothing fancy but it gets the job done.  My mom is passing them out to her friends for llittle birthday presents. She&#x27;s 88 and doing very well for herself. (She carries one of the lipstick brushes in her pocket with lipstick on it for touch ups)</li>
            <li> I got a defective unit that did not have a retractable brush. I sent an email as soon as I received the defective product and got a response from NO ONE.</li>
            <li> This mabelline lip brush works just like the more expensive ones!  Great buy!  Reasonable enough to buy several to use with various color lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that this lip brush retracts into itself so easily.  It is a nice size too.  Many lip brushes are short and hard to hold but this one is perfect. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Nice soft brush.  Snug fit. Good price</li>
            <li> Good price but brush is pretty lame.  There are not enough bristles and the bristles in the brush are not very strong.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice brush.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Was exactly as described.  A very useful tool which I will enjoy using.  Thank you for carrying this procuct.  It is hard to find</li>
            <li> I love how this brush is protected inside a cap so it&#x27;s safe to take in your purse! I like the way it applies color to the lips. Makes application on chapped, cracked, or dry lips a thousand times easier. Plus color lasts longer when applied with a brush. (I don&#x27;t know why, I just notice that it does!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just apply balm or conditioner to lips first, then apply lipcolor with this brush, blot, and repeat the color again.</li>
            <li> This is a really handy little addition to my makeup drawer. Unlike other brushes, it&#x27;s self contained. Take the top off, but it on the bottom half and the brush slides up. When you done, process reverses and the brush is hidden away and covered so it doesn&#x27;t get lipstick anywhere and stays dust free. I&#x27;ve been using them for years but could no longer find them locally. Trust Amazon to have just about anything you need.</li>
            <li> Great brush for half the price and fast shipping. Will definitly buy again when this one wears out. Thank you for a great product</li>
            <li> I was looking for a kind of pen brush, it consists in 2 pieces, not one...it does the job of course, but women sometimes are busy hands, we are putting the shadow on our eyes and using the lip stick at the same time, you know what I mean, well this lip brush doesn&#x27;t help to much in those moments. The brush is nice and soft, enough texture to make an exact line, it is fine.</li>
            <li> This brush is not easy or quick to use: you must pull two pieces apart, flip one, put them back together. Then the brush tip is too soft to properly pick up the lipstick and too soft to apply it to the lips just where you want it. I had one previously that slid out and then retracted again with one glide of my fingers over the case and the bristles were firmer. Loved it. Think it was Sephora.</li>
            <li> good buy and good lip brush.  works fine</li>
            <li> This lip brush is just what I was looking for at more than half the price.  It is retractable so the bristles don&#x27;t get bent and become unusable.  Was shipped quickly and packaged well.</li>
            <li> The retractable tip of this brush is really handy.  It keeps the brush in good shape and allows you to carry it in a purse or overnight bag with much fuss.</li>
            <li> After using a regular lip brush for last 3 years, I suddenly started worrying about its cleanliness.... Although I used to soap-wash it every month or so, but it used to lie in my makeup bag with lots of other makeup stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I looked for retractable lip brushes, but, found them very costly....I am happy I found this one in great price.</li>
            <li> This brush is wonderful. Lipstick and lipgloss goes on expertly with it. I love using it to get the remnants of my favorite lipstick when it&#x27;s gone down to the nub.</li>
            <li> I use this brush daily and do not like to be without it.  I ordered two just incase I lose one.  I usually purchase the Maybelline Lip Brush at Ulta because it is always sold out in other stores, but it is so much cheaper to order it instead.  Great value for the price!</li>
            <li> Brush bristles do not come off on lips when you use it and retractable is great for carrying in purse.</li>
            <li> The brush is well made and the price is fine, but I would have preferred a more firmer brush.  My current brush is worn out now but it was a better brush and easier to work with.</li>
            <li> Defective and useless. Bristles? Mine arrived without any and it is too late to return it.</li>
