            <li>Starbrite has always provided some of the best inks in the industry, I dont have anything new to say other then they still havent dissapointed.</li>
            <li>for the most part it&#x27;s the only brand that I use and trust love that it&#x27;s made in the USA</li>
            <li>Overall starbrite is very good ink, looks really good after healing but packing sucks</li>
            <li>Had a lil mix up through the mail, had to wait an extra week, but i love them!</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money you pay for it</li>
            <li>A friend bought this kit for me and it  didnt have the right colors.</li>
            <li>Being these are inks that will be getting put into people&#x27;s skin, there should be a little more precaution and better packaging of the inks.</li>
            <li>Last, I have used on several tattoos and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>I just received my first tattoo using Starbrite ink....</li>
            <li>I have a few of my favorite colors I really enjoy working with.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>Really wanted those two colors...</li>
            <li>deff recommend  this to any artist who wants to try their hand at slingin ink.</li>
            <li>WOW!!!</li>
            <li>Recommended to everyone interested in getting some new ink</li>
            <li>But i do love the ink other than that....</li>
            <li>It goes in well and stays vibrant.</li>

            <li>I emailed them right back and told them I was sending them back</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>They cooperated but when I got my new set, same thing happened.</li>
            <li>They told me to wash off the other bottles, that they would give me a credit of $10-15, and they would ship a new bottle of blue.</li>

            <li> Definitely recommend this product to any other artists looking for a solid pigment that will keep you and your clients happy.fast shipping reliable producer.</li>
            <li> All but 2 had their main seals busted and ink was slowly leaking out of them.</li>
            <li> i got an extra tribal Black...</li>
            <li> and I will not go back to my previous ink.</li>
            <li> To start, it came a lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> I contacted the seller and they said they were sorry, I emailed them pictures and told them I&#x27;d send them back and wanted a new set.</li>
            <li> Nothing to envy to intenze or other brands</li>
            <li> all my other tats look faded and washed out.</li>
            <li> I reviewed my packages and they were in a small bubble packing pouch inside a thicker yellow envelope.</li>
            <li> The black stays black but never buy there turbo black</li>
            <li> ***, it is not to thick or thin andthe colors are fanatastic, they really pop.</li>
            <li> i got 2 black inks ????</li>
            <li> The bottles were not secure or wrapped.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It is just ok, and the pa kaging is horrible.</li>
            <li> Some colors can be weak.</li>
            <li> the people who use proper aftercare it came out insane!!</li>
            <li> I have 14 tattoos....and the one with the Starbrite ink stands out like crazy with the colors....</li>
            <li> However, the shipping was a disappointment, I was very unhappy with the shipping.</li>

            <li> Some of the best ink that is out there in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I was extremely satisfied with this product. To start, it came a lot sooner than expected. It had been shipped and delivered immediately. All inks were in good shape and each color was accounted for. Last, I have used on several tattoos and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. They stick well and have great texture. I now have my favorite ink. Will definitely purchase again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love starbrite ink. A friend bought this kit for me and it  didnt have the right colors. Instead of the purple i got Deep Maroon and insead of Royal Blue i got an extra tribal Black... Really wanted those two colors... But i do love the ink other than that....</li>
            <li> Great ink, cheap price for this quality top of the line ink. It goes in well and stays vibrant. The black stays black but never buy there turbo black it heals a gray color. This comes with tribal black and outline black both good</li>
            <li> Great, great, really pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product to any other artists looking for a solid pigment that will keep you and your clients happy.fast shipping reliable producer.</li>
            <li> I keep Starbrite in inventory. I have a few of my favorite colors I really enjoy working with. Some colors can be weak. I always recommend this brand to people. However, the shipping was a disappointment, I was very unhappy with the shipping. The bottles were not secure or wrapped. They were just rolling around individually. I have ordered other ink from this seller and was very happy with the shipping process.</li>
            <li> Great ink love how easy it is to use, for the most part it&#x27;s the only brand that I use and trust love that it&#x27;s made in the USA have had a lot of happy friends and family members tattooed with this ink!</li>
            <li> Good product no complaints</li>
            <li> Very vibrant colors. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> Excellent quality ink, bright colors, awesome results. From all the inks in the market, this is a really good quality ink at a reasonable price. Nothing to envy to intenze or other brands</li>
            <li> Starbrite has always provided some of the best inks in the industry, I dont have anything new to say other then they still havent dissapointed. Recommended to everyone interested in getting some new ink</li>
            <li> I just received my first tattoo using Starbrite ink....WOW!!! What a difference...I have 14 tattoos....and the one with the Starbrite ink stands out like crazy with the colors....all my other tats look faded and washed out.</li>
            <li> Wonderful colors! Had a lil mix up through the mail, had to wait an extra week, but i love them!</li>
            <li> Starbrite ink is the only ink that my skin doesn&#x27;t react to. Great set for a great price. Took a lot of stress out of getting my tattoos done.</li>
            <li> will buy over and over and over again! love this ink. love the liner! omg! amazing quality. took awhile to ship but was still in the predicted time frame. over all very happy!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;r ink in the s***, it is not to thick or thin andthe colors are fanatastic, they really pop. Thank you for a great product.</li>
            <li> will be buying more colors of this ink. have used on a dozen people some of which got several tattoos each. the ink lays nicely and stays bright. no infections have occurred. even with those people who do not really do proper aftercare this ink has stayed nicely bright. the people who use proper aftercare it came out insane!! deff recommend  this to any artist who wants to try their hand at slingin ink.</li>
            <li> It is just ok, and the pa kaging is horrible. One of the ink spilled. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I love starbrite ink! It has great pigment and leaves a great color. I am very impressed with this ink. It is well worth the money you pay for it and I will not go back to my previous ink.</li>
            <li> So this review isn&#x27;t about the inks at all, it&#x27;s about the packaging issues and that&#x27;s why I give 2 stars. I reviewed my packages and they were in a small bubble packing pouch inside a thicker yellow envelope. I open it up and the blue had busted open and the rest of the bottles were covered in blue ink. All but 2 had their main seals busted and ink was slowly leaking out of them. Being these are inks that will be getting put into people&#x27;s skin, there should be a little more precaution and better packaging of the inks. I contacted the seller and they said they were sorry, I emailed them pictures and told them I&#x27;d send them back and wanted a new set. They cooperated but when I got my new set, same thing happened. I emailed them right back and told them I was sending them back and I just wanted my money back because I was so irritated. They told me to wash off the other bottles, that they would give me a credit of $10-15, and they would ship a new bottle of blue. It took like 2 weeks to get the credit and I never did receive my blue. Overall starbrite is very good ink, looks really good after healing but packing sucks and I don&#x27;t think Starbrite would be too happy to hear about how they&#x27;re packaging their products.</li>
            <li> Packaged well. The ink sets well, the yellow took a bit longer to set but they all look amazing.</li>
            <li> Ink got shipped super fast and is of great quality.</li>
            <li> I ordered this kit for my son as a gift and he is really happy, good variety of colors and quality. Excellent product, outstanding customer service, I&#x27;m really satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> Great product. Could of been packaged better.</li>
            <li> Love these colors! They take to the skin so easily, and healing time is fabulous! Once healed, vibrancy is a force to be reckoned with when you use Starbrite! Top of the line and worth every penny.</li>
            <li> when i got these two were opened and leaked a bit and there was NO YELLOW AT ALL an i got 2 black inks ???? hopefully they work well but they came in a good time frame and bottles look like the picture</li>
