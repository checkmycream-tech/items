            <li>Very good product.  </li>

            <li>My mom loved how it works on my hair and now she has one too!</li>
            <li>Found the item...priced fairly, and ordered it immediately!</li>

            <li>The features look impressive, but look closer;( coming with two fairly descent brush heads.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s great</li>

            <li>Another great styling tool.  </li>
            <li>This is a great brush air dryer.  </li>
            <li>I will tell you that you do need a great haircut, in order to achieve your desired results.  </li>
            <li>I read the reviews of others and was happy about making the purchase.</li>
            <li>This makes my hair look great.</li>
            <li>Well, that is great except</li>

            <li>Great styling brush.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so so happy.</li>
            <li>I was so happy with the results, I have continued to use this product at home as well.  </li>
            <li>I can always find what I am looking for at great prices and no shipping charges.</li>
            <li>So happy I found it.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great for taming curly hair</li>
            <li>This is a great styler</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>I hope that Conair fixes this problem, as the curler is great otherwise.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job.  </li>
            <li>and it smooths it out great.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these for over 10 years, and it worked great.</li>
            <li>The Great thing it support 110/220 volt&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I still use my curling iron for touch ups between washes, but the great start I get with my Conair makes the touch ups</li>
            <li>My wife seems quite happy with this item.</li>
            <li>It combs out all the tangles and locks them that way, so it leaves the hair great looking all</li>
            <li>Worked great in Ireland.  </li>
            <li>worked great to flip my bangs under.  </li>
            <li>Great if you cannot manage to use brush and hair dryer to style hair.</li>
            <li>Dual voltage makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li>I bought a revlon air brush that works great instead.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great -</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it is a great hair-dryer-shaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one - or if it just LOOKED like the one I used to have that worked great, but this did not heat up well at all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for hair shoulder length and shorter.</li>
            <li>A great buy.  </li>
            <li>GREAT just what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li>Works great for travel</li>
            <li>Works great as a &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s happy with this replacement.  </li>
            <li>The brush attachment is great, but the plastic brush attachment.....</li>
            <li>Great buy</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon - how happy was I!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>So happy I could find it with Amazon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Itâ€™s great for touch-ups.</li>
            <li>sister, whose hair is norma, can use this styler all by itself and get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>and I love it!!</li>
            <li>It styles my hair very nice</li>
            <li>So I got on Amazon and started looking for a replacement and was very happy when I easily found one!  </li>
            <li>great gift and good price</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would work best for me</li>
            <li>I was thrilled!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>In fact, I fall in love with it, as it was my best friend since then.</li>
            <li>you CONAIR, you&#x27;ve always been my best friend wherever I go.. : )</li>
            <li>While I rated the brush as OK, it may be perfect for those with longer hair.  </li>
            <li>they allow for more control, better/larger curl (for turning under or out) and always gives my hair the best result.</li>
            <li>Make sure your hair is in sections to get the best results.</li>
            <li>This is wonderful and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This curling combo makes it so easy and leaves my hair in great condition!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect, easy to use styler for my hair.</li>
            <li>This is the best blowdryer/curler for fine hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably have to replace it fairly soon.</li>
            <li>good price, good product.  </li>
            <li>Well, I just bought a Vidal Sassoon and it does not do a good job on my type of hair at all</li>
            <li>I had one of these and loved it.</li>
            <li>my wife is delighted with the product.</li>
            <li>Working greate, good temperature ,I like to use it.</li>
            <li>The product is good, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is really a good tool for blow drying hair and not straightening or curling hair.</li>
            <li>I loved that one, it worked so well.  </li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>After this brush, IÂ´m feeling good with my hair.</li>
            <li>seem a good idea, but does not curl my hair well...</li>
            <li>You dont have to hold 2 items, but the blowing strength is not as good</li>
            <li>I am not so good with a blow dryer and brush for styling my hair</li>
            <li>it is a good product but not for me.</li>
            <li>Over all it is good item</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve loved it for 8 years</li>
            <li>My sister (Hair dresser) also had one &amp; loved it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for going on two years now, and it is still working as good as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>Good buy</li>
            <li>I have been using this item for a number of years, primarily to control curl and frizz, and was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good multipurpose tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very pleased - good product and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It arrived promptly, in great shape...and now, unlike the airlines, Amazon was able to replace part of my morning ritual.</li>
            <li>love it, great service</li>
            <li>I was more than happy.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the seller.</li>
            <li>I have tried it every time I have done my hair and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>She is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>It has two speeds/settings for hot air styling and works great!</li>
            <li>I love this brush!  </li>
            <li>So, as with so many items I cannot find in stores, I turned to Amazon, and they didn&#x27;t dissapoint me!</li>
            <li>But I do know I love it and use it all the time!</li>
            <li>The the best finishing touch is this Conair Hot Air Curling brush.  </li>
            <li>Had been looking everywhere for one, and so glad Amazon had it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Love this hair styling dryer!</li>
            <li>The hot air brush is perfect for styling and drying damp hair.</li>
            <li>It works way better than their newer model!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product!  </li>
            <li>Love this tool!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this curler for years and love it!  </li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>The product is easy to take on a trip, works great.</li>
            <li>At first I was THRILLED with this product; the perfect size for me.  </li>
            <li>This Hot Air curling iron is a great price and it works great for my hair, which is on the thicker side and wavy.</li>
            <li>Works really well, one of the best dryers I&#x27;ve used and MUCH better than holding a brush and a blow dryer!</li>
            <li>Very good price and very easy and quick for styling.  </li>
            <li>Amazing body.  </li>
            <li>For me, it straightens my unruly wavy hair in a flash and smooths it nicely.</li>
            <li>I really liked the results I got from this iron.</li>
            <li>However, I do not know what kind of hair everyone else has</li>
            <li>Kind of looks</li>
            <li>If you want curlier hair, keep your hair dryer handy.</li>
            <li>Would have liked another speed choice.</li>
            <li>Currently I own three, one in my house, one at my mother&#x27;s, and I keep one in the car in case</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved this product for many years.....</li>
            <li>I already own this item.</li>
            <li>I was THRILLED to find the Conair.  </li>
            <li>I loved mine, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot of money for it.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, but won&#x27;t order another one.</li>
            <li>It needs to be warm to curl</li>
            <li>I was given one of these by my mother and liked it -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d honestly be lost if it ever went out of production bc</li>
            <li>Honestly my hair didn&#x27;t hold a curl with it.</li>
            <li>This works ok, but not as good as others I have had.</li>
            <li>Then the brush won&#x27;t stay locked and you can&#x27;t use it effectively.</li>
            <li>It is for sure for longer hair than I have, but still works good.  </li>
            <li>adds nice finish.</li>
            <li>Nice idea though...</li>
            <li>am most concerened with how the hair right around my face looks, and this dryer is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>Love love love it!!</li>
            <li>very good hot air brush.</li>
            <li>I have used Conair hot air styling brushes for years and have always found them to be very good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if you are patient and talented you could get better results than me.</li>
            <li>Purchased it and am good to go for many more years to come.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with the iron and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use styling tool without fear of burning.</li>
            <li>I was thrilled to be able to find and purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>but it made my hair fly away and full of static.  </li>
            <li>great thing about this styling device is I no longer stress over getting my style right</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that is cut into a (just below) chin length bob.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to straighten your hair, turn your hair under or flip it up or out then give this a try!</li>
            <li>I had owned a Conair Hot Air Curling combo for more than 10 years and LOVED it!  </li>
            <li>If you have fine, straight hair like me and you want that perfect bob or you just want to add a whole-lotta volume to your layers, this is the gadget for you!  </li>
            <li>It was so old that I thought I would never be able to replace this wonderful product!!!  </li>
            <li>and I like it best for my own personal use.</li>
            <li>It doesnt blow very strong, handles ok.  </li>
            <li>the first use lol</li>
            <li>The hot air curling combo work great .My</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s just fine!</li>
            <li>I love this thing..so easy!</li>
            <li>Also, it never tangles with my fine hair!</li>
            <li>Very cheaply made...</li>
            <li>Obviously it is very cheap construction.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li>It is an excellente product, easy to use and with amazing results.</li>
            <li>Does a good job, dries and styles quickly</li>
            <li>great product everyone should have one I just love love how my hair looks after using   conair hot air curing.</li>
            <li>The barrel is huge!  </li>
            <li>The barrel on this device is huge!  </li>
            <li>It is huge!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li>I wish Conaire could do better.</li>
            <li>Not the most powerful but your hair will look good.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>However I find that when I use this to straighten my hair I am able to have more body and volume.  </li>
            <li>Love this dyer.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I missed my dryer more than anything else I lost.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again and am on the lookout for a comparable product but of better quality.</li>
            <li>Glad I found it on Amazon,</li>
            <li>It works like magic...</li>
            <li>Extremely satisfied.</li>

            <li>It worked okay, just took longer.  </li>
            <li>This  is the fourth or fifth replacement of this item as it is perfect for my hairstyle needs.  </li>
            <li>I love this product but when I turn it on, it smells like mildew.  </li>
            <li>I do one side at a time, working my way from top to bottom; flipping the hair over each time I straighten a portion.  </li>
            <li>well, with this brush my hair dries lovely and smooth!  </li>
            <li>Love everything about this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>If you try it, you may want your hair more damp.</li>
            <li>I have used this dryer for many years and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to order two more to keep on hand \\&quot;just in case.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Slightly better luck with the curling iron attachment.  </li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li>If you have curly or frizzy hair, these are fantastic for smoothing and giving a nice shape/style.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this appliance.  </li>
            <li>If you need some volume and lift in your hair, big teeth/spiked appliances are the best!  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not in love with it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Conair still makes this item.</li>
            <li>had one of these for about 5 years until it broke, this one is even better.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I get faster and better results by blow-drying then using a curlng iron.</li>
            <li>As with most electronics, it eventually died.  </li>
            <li>I will purchase another one and hope to have better luck with it.</li>
            <li>I sure wish they wouldn&#x27;t stop making them.</li>
            <li>This should be a 5 because I love the results.</li>
            <li>Fabulous!  </li>
            <li>and I always have problems let it ok at home.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know that all their hairdressers will give me as rewarding results until I tried this year three of their products, which are CONAIR CHV26IX, CS19JCS and CD 160DRCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more like every 3 months now.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>so styling using this would have been awesome if it actually worked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You might have more luck than I with this product.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it online because i went to a well-known department store and they were sold out.</li>
            <li>I call it my magic brush.  </li>
            <li>When it finally broke I was very happy to find this one on line.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I do love the dryer curler combo.</li>
            <li>I love, LOVE , Love this brush.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to do anything more to your hair.  </li>
            <li>Adds volume to top and bangs.  </li>
            <li>great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Be sure to have your hair damp-dry before you start, or styling will take forever.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>but this is a nice alternative when I want smooth waves.  </li>
            <li>Most hotels provided hairdryers, so this was a luxury item to pack.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>If you want more lift, concentrate more on the roots,  If you want more curl, just keep rolling the ends.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the patience or dexterity to do the brush and dryer thing at the same time, so this is perfect!</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would be better, based on some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I really love this brush.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite tool for taming my frizzy mop.  </li>
            <li>There is something MAGICAL about this product.</li>
            <li>never leave myself enough time to do my hair in the morning, but this brush is awesome as it works faster than the dryer/hand held brush method.</li>
            <li>and she love is it</li>
            <li>The best curling brush.....does not tangle and dries and styles your hair in a short time.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>No where in the description or even on the package or package insert does it say how many watts this is....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there are folks who prefer the boar bristles but,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with it as I won&#x27;t be holding brush and blowdry with my two hands anymore.</li>
            <li>I like better at close to this price,</li>
            <li>Should have paid more attention to the don&#x27;t-waste-your-money reviews</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li>Use it all the time, love it.  </li>
            <li>always make sure to put thermal protectant in hair before use.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this styling brush.</li>
            <li>I love what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li>An all time favorite.  </li>
            <li>Love it that it is dryer and brush in one.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for this Curling Combo in stores in my area and haven&#x27;t been able to find one.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>The handle is okay to use; but could be more ergonomic.</li>
            <li>my favorite hair tool</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I think this is a pretty nice styling tool!</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>It takes some doing to not hurt yourself when touching them.  </li>
            <li>I like the way the plastic attachment worked on my hair more than the brush attachment.  </li>
            <li>Glad I chose this model.</li>
            <li>I love it and will always have one.</li>
            <li>It was interesting.</li>
            <li>It brought out the length of my hair giving it more body.  </li>
            <li>gave Amazon one more chance - and this one works great!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was OK.</li>
            <li>But it is OK.</li>
            <li>Love the product I gave it a 5 star.</li>
            <li>I have short hair and it does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li>My favorite hair dryer/styler.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it works.</li>
            <li>Love it and will order another when the time comes</li>
            <li>I have a layered hair cut, and this gives me he right amount of curl in towards the face that I have always loved.</li>
            <li>I owned this product before and its bristles were soft and pliable yet provided perfect curl and left my hair with beautiful volume.</li>
            <li>so I was very excited to come across this.</li>
            <li>Looks high quality &amp; a great size.</li>
            <li>i think that was pretty good use out of them, though.  </li>
            <li>It lifts so your hair looks nice and full.  </li>
            <li>This is a perfect finish styler as long as u don&#x27;t use the brush bristles which can tear the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li>, I have always loved this hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I returned this to Amazon (great Customer Service) and they sent a new one.  </li>
            <li>Plus I like how it helps my hair curl under more easily than the hair dryer/brush do.</li>
            <li>It is perfect when used after my hair is mostly dry.</li>
            <li>brush part is plastic and strong and goes through your hair much better then nylon bristles in my opinion</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m happy to own a third.</li>
            <li>It  is perfect for adding body and loose waves.  </li>
            <li>Great for quick touch-ups when you are in a hurry, a real must have!</li>
            <li>I like the barrel with the shorter bristles, it seems to work better with fine hair.</li>
            <li>more hotter heat ...for me this is just fine.</li>
            <li>This particular Conair is absolutely the best styling brush for me.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived early and this was great as we were traveling overseas and needed the 220 Volt setting.  </li>
            <li>Works great so far.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for soft look.</li>
            <li>it didnt work, ruined my hair, tangles my hair and wasnt able to get free for an hour.</li>
            <li>But I am very eager to use it soon to see how good it will work for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one inch and the 1 1/2&amp;#34; heads are easy to remove and change and have real bristles for good hair management and ease of styling.  </li>
            <li>If you want a very smooth look, after finishing each section, lightly brush and use a light hair spray.</li>
            <li>My original broke after many years of use, so I just bought another one.</li>
            <li>It is just like the other and it works great!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy on your hair.  </li>
            <li>ends easily with a curling iron</li>
            <li>Adds body, but not as easy to operate as a straightner or curling iron.  </li>
            <li>I found it easy to use</li>
            <li>Easy to use and with the brush attachment</li>
            <li>, it tangles easily</li>
            <li>They are also so easy to use.</li>
            <li>the brush makes it easy to control.  </li>
            <li>If you want easy hair care &amp; volumn</li>
            <li>Easy purchase</li>
            <li>dressing has never been as easy.</li>
            <li>This is the answer for easy styling.  </li>
            <li>Easy to switch wattage.</li>
            <li>hair looks great, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Easy to use .</li>
            <li>It is easy to work with.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and make your hair shiny and curly too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy, and I don&#x27;t have to go through the process of seperating my hair before I blow it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and there were no problems with it</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to straighten your hair, turn your hair under or flip it up or out then give this a try!n through the top/outer layer of your hair.</li>
            <li>This is easy to use instead of 2 hands requiring brush and dryer.  </li>
            <li>And, it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>But this helps me, and is easy to use, works well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and does not get tangled in my hair.  </li>
            <li>The heads come on and off easily, and is made well.</li>
            <li>Easy way to style hair....</li>
            <li>Had an older version of this I loved.</li>
            <li>strongly considered taking off 1 star bc</li>
            <li>Works well, but smelled like plastic out of the box, like unusually strong.</li>
            <li>When I used it, I loved it, and bought 6, for gifts, and for my own back up, so I&#x27;ll never be without it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Even with fine hair I can&#x27;t use this to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; my hair, it works best on partially dried hair - takes me more time than blow-drying and ironing combined.</li>
            <li>This was my first product of the kind.</li>
            <li>And make sure you let the hair cool before brushing it.  </li>
            <li>If you want a more \\&quot;unkempt\\&quot; effect, after styling each section, allow hair to cool and style with your fingers, then spray.</li>
            <li>It takes a good 20 minutes to dry the hair but it leaves my hair shiny, bouncy, curled at the end beautifully and straight.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair that gets split</li>
            <li>I would not recommend it for fine hair.</li>
            <li>I like the way this works and the heat level seems fine to me.</li>
            <li>This product does not work well on fine hair.</li>
            <li>Worked fine when turned off yesterday, but today I plug it in and nothing happens.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of medium length fine wavy hair that needs to be straightened</li>
            <li>and it was fine.</li>
            <li>I have medium fine hair and this one gives me the the lift I need as the teeth help separate my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, layered hair that is fine with some wave to it.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair and with a bit of gel ...</li>
            <li>This is fine for touch ups</li>
            <li>One was for a friend and hers is working just fine.</li>
            <li>I put one in my travel bag and it&#x27;s fine, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fine with me</li>
            <li>The power cord is fine.</li>
            <li>Works fine on 110.</li>
            <li>Amazon did replace it and the replacement one works just fine.</li>
            <li>This makes blow drying my hair really easy and hassle free.</li>
            <li>DO NOT BUY if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li>I was born with baby fine hair that never grew up.  </li>
            <li>I got so lucky and found this on sale!</li>
            <li>Usually I do a quick touch up with the curling iron, but most of the job is already done with just this dryer.</li>
            <li>I love the large barrel which is perfect for my long hair</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot but it works ok.</li>
            <li>this was a really good buy for me, but i must say i was hoping to have super straight hair</li>
            <li>The grip is kind of large</li>
            <li>I love this Conair Supreme Hot Air Styling Brush!  </li>
            <li>This a great curling Iron and is hard to find in the stores here, so it is nice to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to have to deal with huge snarls while you&#x27;re using this thinger-bobber.</li>
            <li>and this saves a huge amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes my hair smooth and flowy.  </li>
            <li>and I always keep one or two spare ones available.</li>
            <li>I can smooth out the curls or roll my hair around like a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I have stick straight hair with a mind of its own and hoped this would add curls to my hair, which it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I take it with me everywhere, it has become just as important as my blow-dryer.</li>
            <li>Find a fantastic stylist and get your hair shaped in a way that you can work with it at home, using this item.  </li>
            <li>Luxurious, shiny, smooth.</li>
            <li>(3)It&#x27;s almost polished (smooth) looking about 10 minutes after using the tool.    </li>
            <li>It looks smooth and bouncy and lasts 2 days.</li>
            <li>It was cheaper ordering through Amazon with the free shipping</li>
            <li>I was so happy to find the same appliance after breaking mine, I bought three back-ups.  </li>
            <li>Great product, I have usded one about 15 years, it finally burnt out.</li>
            <li>So I finish it off with the curling brush to smooth and style it.  </li>
            <li>It saves time on my hair and leaves one hand free to drink coffee or apply makeup.</li>
            <li>Great value for the low price!</li>
            <li>so the warm air gently blows in the curl.  </li>
            <li>but my wife thought it could be more powerful.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for getting curl or body into hair while holding only one object.  </li>
            <li>setting which was available overseas</li>
            <li>I was concerned it may no longer be available.  </li>
            <li>Hoping it will always be available -just can&#x27;t find anything like it in stores.  </li>
            <li>this cheap copy is a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I was unimpressed w/ all of them and each one was made primarily of cheap plastics.</li>
            <li>it is light weight, which is why I chose it for travel...</li>
            <li>When I travel to Europe, it is great because it is double voltage.</li>
            <li>It was important</li>
            <li>This curling iron works very well on my frizzy and wavy hair smoothing it nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a comfortable handle while drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is cheap as heck and rips your hair out.  </li>
            <li>It works for my wavy hair to make it look smooth.</li>
            <li>It helps to give the volume I want and smooth where I want it.  </li>
            <li>Although I like this product, and it works great for my hair, I have found that their life expectancy is very short.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this item.  </li>
            <li>Ordered two while I can still find them available..</li>
            <li>But so far so good</li>
            <li>Basically this is one of those products that has just the right combination of components (plus a little bit of magic) that make an AWESOME styling tool.</li>
            <li>But price is right and works, I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li>drop off which was amazingly easy for a full refund.  </li>
            <li>After I blow dry my hair, I use this and it smooths out my hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li>By the time I release it, my hair is dry, and the heat of the barrel acts as a curling iron, making beautiful waves.</li>
            <li>I went to take it off and the whole thing just came apart, bristles and all!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very worth your money.</li>
            <li>I have used this particular product for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>It gave my hair beautiful loose waves.  </li>
            <li>Heats quickly and easy to use.</li>
            <li>My old brush had more options on it, but all I want is to dry my hair, and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy and leaves my hair with bounce and shine.  </li>
            <li>I ended up returning it, which, as always, was super easy through amazon.</li>
            <li>My hair straightens well and curls well, and I had great luck with my old hot air brush.</li>
            <li>it gets very, very hot and puts out strong, forceful air.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To add body to my very fine hair, and to get my hair to turn under, I use this Conair styler in combination with large velcro curlers.  </li>
            <li>It works good but it broke easily after only about 2 months.</li>
            <li>The curling iron attachment uses hot air rather than heat, which is much better for your hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it when it was first out on the market and after many years of satisfaction with this dryer/styler it was lost along with my luggage on a cross-country flight.  </li>
            <li>Got it today, plugged it in, styled my hair super quick!</li>
            <li>Broke my original one I&#x27;ve had for yrs.</li>
            <li>I was looking more for a hot curling brush that will straighten my hair.</li>
            <li>The top plastic end piece broke off the first time it was used.  </li>
            <li>Get the majority of the water out of hair first, and you will be ok.</li>
            <li>The most glaring difference is the smell the hot air curler give off.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for:))))</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, this hot air styling brush would be better if the teeth on the plastic bursh were longer.</li>
            <li>Love this hot air styling brush.</li>
            <li>The fist models were great and lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, shoulder-length hair, and I love this for finishing off my hair.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t get that, but if you use a great flat iron you&#x27;ll be able to do once pass over your hair and get a sleek straight look.</li>
            <li>but I am still happy with the product and it works well to blow dry</li>
            <li>I clean the lint out it lasts longest.</li>
            <li>Great for taming your hair as you blow dry.</li>
            <li>gave it four stars only because it would be nice to have more forceful air coming out of it--</li>
            <li>With the conair I can easily style that cowlick right outta my hair.</li>
            <li>your hair to a greater degree and may work well for certain hair types.</li>
            <li>I just do it on special occasions.</li>
            <li>Price is right!  </li>
            <li>I no longer have to worry about putting too much heat on my hair because this dryer provides just the right amount of heat to dry and style perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have fine, African American kinky hair that has been relaxed and this styling comb/brush is PERFECT for drying and styling!</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my hot air curling brush and although it is a simple design it is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I have several hot air brushes by Conair that are great products, but don&#x27;t have dual voltage.  </li>
            <li>These 2 in 1s  last me a good four or five years before they die</li>
            <li>I just wished that there would have been full disclosure in the item description.</li>
            <li>This product is not at all good for short hair.  </li>
            <li>I used this product at least 5X/week for 2 years and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t ask any more from a hair tool.  </li>
            <li>However, it was slowly dying and I could not find one in the stores, so I was happy to find one on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>thank you so much for the merchandise, I love these curling irons, been lookin all over for them.  </li>
            <li>With just regular blowdryer, my hair would not look as good.</li>
            <li>I have REALLY thick hair &amp; it works GREAT on it!!</li>
            <li>So far so good for performance, the person I gave it to is pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>good for short hair.</li>
            <li>Prime was excellent as usual!</li>
            <li>This one in particular is very cheaply made, it took me days to get the brushes to &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; to the unit.  </li>
            <li>It feels cheaply made right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I find I can get pretty close to a blow out with this as it is so easy.</li>
            <li>This is a great product for building volume and style to fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and much gentler on the hair than a hot iron.</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curling hair which curls but quickly flattens on top and tends to friz.</li>
            <li>I had my last one for about TEN years, I love the beautiful voluminous curls and body that I get from this tool.</li>
            <li>This is good to use when I have a little more time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this to curl my niece&#x27;s hair for special occassions and they did not have a problem withit being too hot and their hair kept the curls all day!  </li>
            <li>This curling iron \\&quot;hot air styler\\&quot; worked fine for 8 months and then died.</li>
            <li>First of all, I have fine hair but a lot of it.</li>
            <li>Worked fine in US but first use in France was a melt-down.  </li>
            <li>Problem is they do burn out quickly.  </li>
            <li>They seem to wear out quickly though.</li>
            <li>This styling brush quickly makes my hair look how I want it to look.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and curls evenly.  </li>
            <li>Never had a quick drying styling brush before.  </li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer and would highly recommend it to anyone with longer hair.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this product especially for the price.</li>
            <li>So happy I found this here - can&#x27;t find it locally anymore and mine (exact model as this one) just quit after 5 years - thanks so much for having this still available!</li>
            <li>I can get my hair pretty smooth with it</li>
            <li>Really good for long hair.</li>
            <li>the multifunction blower does the job, super fast heating, the fan works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>Now we live at a time when more styling devices are required.  </li>
            <li>I love and live by this tool.</li>
            <li>and I love the new one that I got.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and fast.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful tool, even if it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I owned and LOVED a Conair hot air curler (cobalt blue)</li>
            <li>(hot!)</li>
            <li>My favorite by far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Conair Hot Air Curling Combo for years, but am having more and more of a problem finding one local.  </li>
            <li>My hair is color treated and too fine for this much heat.</li>
            <li>I have medium-short fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying another brand and giving this one to my daughter as she doesn&#x27;t use these very often and it was fine for her</li>
            <li>I have layered chin length, fine, straight hair and used it 5 to 6 times a week.</li>
            <li>I do have fine, straight hair which could be part of the problem</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for traveling - takes up little space and dual voltage.  </li>
            <li>Would be great if my hair were a little longer</li>
            <li>This is a great little appliance and I wouldn&#x27;t consider changing to something</li>
            <li>Not very hot good for travel in Europe</li>
            <li>This weekend doing my hair it got caught on a knot and the whole thing snapped...very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this on Amazon as it was not available in any stores.</li>
            <li>I really miss being without it, but don&#x27;t feel comfortable buying another.</li>
            <li>I liked this styling brush but it only lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li>Do not buy...not even worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Oh, and as a side note: I recommend (1) making sure you give yourself enough time to go through the whole process (don&#x27;t rush) and (2) start with the TOP of your hair, NOT the BOTTOM.  </li>
            <li>When I use this curling brush on my hair it makes my hair smooth, soft and light.  </li>
            <li>I read the instructions carefully and used it successfully for the first week.  </li>
            <li>I am always challenged when it comes to product assembly, but I have tried and tried without success.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair look so much better than any old hair dryer and brush combo</li>
            <li>Perfect for styling thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I like my old one better but it didn&#x27;t have a voltage converter switch for Europe.</li>
            <li>I own three of them, and have bought several to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li>but the results look like you&#x27;ve had your hair blown out by a professional- love it.</li>
            <li>I would love one just like my old one</li>
            <li>I rarely ever have to do this</li>
            <li>I rarely ever have to do this</li>
            <li>The price was nice considering I was thinking I was going to have to pay over $40 for this item at a local store!</li>
            <li>Handy for second days.</li>
            <li>All in all, though, for the money it was worth it.</li>
            <li>Both brushes are useful.</li>
            <li>Maybe I can wrap a fabric softer sheet around it &amp; leave it on as a bathroom deodorizer to get my money&#x27;s worth?</li>
            <li>Buy this item at your own risk - and have a back-up plan on how you will style your hair if you plan to take this with you on vacation outside the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My other barrel styler curled my fine hair nicely</li>
            <li>I love this product for drying my hair in the US, it gives a nice soft curl and eliminates the need to use a blow dryer and a curling iron or flat iron.</li>
            <li>and i got it quickly ;)</li>
            <li>All other styling brushes I&#x27;ve used do not do as good a job on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love being able to blow dry and shape my hair into soft smooth curves with one hand.  </li>
            <li>My outlet is on my right</li>
            <li>It will take me a lot of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li>The curl is just the right amount to style my layers and it lasts all day without losing its shape.  </li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d it right away, but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It felt lighter and cheaper right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>this might be the right device, but I do mine while standing in the bathroom and always while in a hurry.</li>
            <li>i did not use it right away .</li>
            <li>I have a shoulder length bob haircut right now  </li>
            <li>They seem to stop working right after the warranty is up at one year.</li>
            <li>just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair</li>
            <li>I received it, it did seem a bit crappier quality, and I was right,</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s fine, not thick.  </li>
            <li>first Styling Brush lasted more than 10 years and I used it nearly every day.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length normal to fine hair, so if yours is longer or thicker you should consider whether this will work for you.  </li>
            <li>After returning the one bought in the store since it&#x27;s curling iron &amp; not what I can use, I started to look online and found exactly the same one I own before.  </li>
            <li>My smaller brush controls the friz and keeps the top full as I like it  </li>
            <li>but my hair is not as FULL as it would be if I blow it out first however it does come out really shinny!</li>
            <li>The tines seem  sharp against the scalp and the attachment didn&#x27;t fit into the wand very easily.  </li>
            <li>Plus it is easy to pack and light enough for hand luggage too.  </li>
            <li>and you have to have your hair somewhat damp (not completely damp) for it to be effective</li>
            <li>I have very soft fine and curly hair</li>
            <li>The brush is fine, but I expected something with more</li>
            <li>I use only the plastic tine attachment because my hair is very fine  and gets tangled in brush attachments.</li>
            <li>I wish this got a little bit hotter but overall, for the price, it&#x27;s a great styling tool!</li>
            <li>It works great on mostly dried hair so you&#x27;re not applying too much heat to your hair.</li>
            <li>but it is light weight in more ways than I expected.  </li>
            <li>A great feature of the brush is that you can flip and switch and use it in either the US or several European countries.</li>
            <li>This is a great styling hot air brush ...ordered two when I seen the price on Amazon prime, their more expensive in retail stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>original package got sent to the wrong house, but amazon was very good and resent me another.</li>
            <li>I have normal, straight, medium-thick hair which \\&quot;takes\\&quot; curl easily.</li>
            <li>The new one offers a brush attachment which is great for using on the top and sides and the larger one is just right for the back.  </li>
            <li>I received this item from the seller very fast, within days of my order.  </li>
            <li>The price was very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I returned it to Amazon which gave a very fast refund.</li>
            <li>She probably used this machine for some 3-4 times before finally giving up and later on getting another similar product from the store which has come out good and effective for her.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my new hot air curling brush as it is the only way I can control my unruly hair!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;(I have naturally wavy, fine hair.)</li>
            <li>I have fine, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I love how the heat is quick, so is cool down.</li>
            <li>It works great (and I like the new black color, for what that matters).  </li>
            <li>Awesome I love it Please do not stop making them!!!!I have had at least 6 of them !!!!</li>
            <li>The dryer is also loud and gets very hot quickly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Conair for such a great product and thanks to Amazon for such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li>The hot air styling brush was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>and I am glad to have it back!!</li>
            <li>The first one broke within the 1st week.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Hot Air Brush for - literally - 15 years.  </li>
            <li>I have had this item for exactly a year</li>
            <li>I had one of these exact dryers for years and broke it.  </li>
            <li>I had it exactly ONE MONTH - April 14, the exact day my 30-day return window expired - and</li>
            <li>but I have to use a blow dryer first if I don&#x27;t want to spend 45 minutes drying my hair.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Conair BC171CS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush 1.25</li>
            <li>: It seems to get too hot, even on the lower setting.</li>
            <li>I noticed zero differnce, perhaps because the higher heat of this unit cancelled out any \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; benefit for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I like this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li>Use it almost daily to smooth my hair out!</li>
            <li>I bought my first Conair Hot Air Brush 15 years ago</li>
            <li>The brush itself doesn&#x27;t get really hot and blows out hot air like a hand held blow dryer.</li>
            <li>It is cheaply made and completely dissatisfactory.</li>
            <li>After switching the voltage from 110 to 220 while in Europe, I used the hot hair brush for about 3 minutes before it overheated.  </li>
            <li>I love my hair dryer/smoother - use it almost daily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;v tried are too hot and tangled my hair.  </li>
            <li>I had a conair hot air curling combo for probably 10 years.</li>
            <li>Well this one broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li>Conair 1-1/2-Inch Hot Air Curling Combo.  </li>
            <li>I have had it for so many years and know it can&#x27;t last forever, so I&#x27;m buying another.  </li>
            <li>I did not like this hot air curling brush.  </li>
            <li>I would love to send it back.</li>
            <li>Ended up with the infinity pro hot air spin dryer.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this Hot AIr Curling brushes for 10+years.  </li>
            <li>In 2002, I bought the first hairdresser from CONAIR - hair setter.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair once a week and after washing it i put some moisturizer on my hair and then use the hot air curling brush.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these Hot Air Curling driers about 15 years ago and one day it quit working</li>
            <li>STOP WORKING AFTER FIRST USE</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace the Conair hot air styling brush that I&#x27;d had for years.</li>
            <li>The first came in and the tip kept falling off , so  the bristles would keep slinding off as well.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Most bathrooms we stayed in did not have the third prong on the adapter (the plug wasn&#x27;t grounded?)</li>
            <li>The shorter stiffer bristles are better for grabbing short hair, but both work.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted about seven years.</li>
            <li>have been trying to make my hair look the way I want it to look for years and years, and this is the first product that truly WORKS.</li>
            <li>The first one I had lasted about one year</li>
            <li>I ended up purchasing a different Conair hot styling brush which works better for my hair type.</li>
            <li>After many years it finally gave out and this was an identical replacement - just a different ( better IMO) color.</li>
            <li>: I just bought the Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush that is 1000 watts.</li>
            <li>This hot air curler smells like mold and mildew when I use it.</li>
            <li>but I can tell you exactly how it works for me and suggest what hair types and styles</li>
            <li>it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works like a hairbrush that blows hot air which eliminates the need for a hair dryer &amp; brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended this curling combo to several people and they too are enjoying the use of it.</li>
            <li>This is a really neat idea but within two weeks it just quit working!</li>
            <li>I have been using this tool for years, probably since it first it the market.  </li>
            <li>One&#x27;s visibility in styling is much better than with a blow dryer, as the airbrush only requires one hand for me.</li>
            <li>Gets too hot for me...</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t use my hot rollers I use this.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t have to take a hair dryer, just the hot air curler.  </li>
            <li>along with initially using a blow dryer to remove most of the dampness.  </li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t seem exactly what I thought it would be</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty neat idea but did not give my hair</li>
            <li>and then I finish off with the Hot Air Curling Combo.  </li>
            <li>The size was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I use the Conair hot ar curling combo every day.  </li>
            <li>Just received the Conair Hot Air curling combo.</li>
            <li>Not curls mind you, but waves, which is exactly what I want for my shoulder-length</li>
            <li>and I imagine this will not last more than a year.</li>
            <li>I like the wire bristles on the smaller barrel better, but not the size</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because I did like the way it worked the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what was this thing designed to do?</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as if someone is blowing hot air out of it like with their .mouth.</li>
            <li>I bought this brush because I needed a hot air brush for travel to Europe.</li>
            <li>My old unit was smaller in diameter and fit my needs better.</li>
            <li>It turned out that I CHOSE too big a size for my hair, otherwise I love it.  </li>
            <li>Not too hot.  </li>
            <li>I used it the first day I was there</li>
            <li>I have been using the Conair hot air brush since it first came out.</li>
            <li>This unit has a small hair dryer which is great for drying the roots of  my fine hair with my head upside down, then I finish off the styling with the brush which is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t tangle.  </li>
            <li>I like the Conair a little better because it doesn&#x27;t overheat as easily</li>
            <li>This curling combo is simple, easy to use, does a great job in very little time.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, so it should not require a long time.  </li>
            <li>These 2 things combined make this hot air brush very unique from others and it&#x27;s the key to my finished look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>I have almost Marcia-Brady-straight hair, but I use a styling brush just to smooth it out a bit more and to put a slight curl into the ends.</li>
            <li>it is not that powerful and needs more time to dry the hair..</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair....and certainly gives it a boost without the old fashioned curlers...</li>
            <li>I barely have to do anything other than use this dryer, as it blow dries my hair into a great style, with ends curled somewhat under.</li>
            <li>Flat irons damage your hair, but this is much better as it is simply hot air that does not damage your hair.  </li>
            <li>A good brush drier is not easy to find.</li>
            <li>This allows me to dry and style my hair very quickly and get it done without any headaches!  </li>
            <li>More body than using just a flat iron.</li>
            <li>This new unit I purchased feels much lighter, less durable and cheaply made to be brutally honest.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, does not dry out the hair like a curling iron.</li>
            <li>This is kind of miraculous, as the Conair uses much less air than a regular hairdyer, but it works MUCH better.</li>
            <li>Instead of having some hair naturally curling under and some hair naturally curing outward, I was able to get a consisent shape so it looks neat and styled.</li>
            <li>Follow instructions and use only Low setting while in Europe, and it provides plenty of heat for good styling.</li>
            <li>I used to have lovely curls when I was younger, but now my hair neither air dries straight nor does it curl,</li>
            <li>So I switched to the second size (the smaller one) which is softer and, as it works out, a good size for me as well.</li>
            <li>I do like this except the barrel is a bit large for my higher than shoulder length hair...</li>
            <li>like my old one dries my hair very quickly, straight and smooth, rounded and full, and curled under or out, or a natural looking blend of both.</li>
            <li>I previously owned another Conair Styling Brush and it worked beautifully; however, it recently stopped working.  </li>
            <li>Although the curler blows hot air, its not a DRYER, it is used to style the hair after after it is dried.&lt;br /&gt;Versatile dual 125/250 voltage makes it easy to use universally with an inexpensive prong converter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dry most of your hair first.</li>
            <li>I think that if I was able to use the high setting at the higher voltage, things might have been different but I will never know.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t be positive.</li>
            <li>I have really long, healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use ANY styling products on my hair when I style it straight because of the Hot Air Brush.  </li>
            <li>I was so glad to see the same model just a different color, still available.  </li>
            <li>I love this for styling long hair, makes your hair shiny and bouncy without drying it out.  </li>
            <li>This unit does not have a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting, and the brushes on the roller are too long to be able to wrap the hair around the cylinder closely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Hot Air Curling Combo for years to straighten my very frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It might work great as the other reviewer&#x27;s said, but it is too big to travel with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, to my surprise the smaller attachment with brush bristles still allowed me to achieve volume and straighten my wavy fine hair (with this unit, I switched to the higher setting).</li>
            <li>I have thick curley hair and it works beautifully to create smooth large loose curls.</li>
            <li>I had to part with my old one and felt lucky to find this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I dry from the nape to the top and then use the air brush to flip the ends up or under and</li>
            <li>and this adds that extra volume we all like to have, and easy to use</li>
            <li>You will be able to use this product to A) completely dry and style your hair or B)</li>
            <li>Bought this as it was one of the only dual voltage hot air brushes available.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to get salon results on your own with a blowdryer and brush, but this appliance makes it so easy.  </li>
            <li>I found the 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel too large.</li>
            <li>The  brush was too large for what I wanted</li>
            <li>There is some sort of glitch in the product to where it shuts off every time it is turned a certain way.</li>
            <li>SERVICE was excellent.would certainly use them again.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>or I can add large curls or waves using the large barrel brush.  </li>
            <li>I would use it on my damp hair and get my hair mostly dry and smooth and then dry up the roots with a traditional hair dryer, it always came out great.</li>
            <li>chose this Conair hot air brush because it offered two brush diameters (as I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d use the larger diameter brush, given my chin length hair) and because it offers two electrical currencies (220 for travel abroad).</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried curling with it yet, but I would imagine it will create lovely loose curls.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job in half the time since it dries and curls at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I love how fast I can dry my hair with this.</li>
            <li>After towel drying hair, I always use a leave-in product (I have used very expensive variations and I am happy to report that my favorite it currently a bargain, Loreal EverPure Smooth Frizz-Free Serum).</li>
            <li>Plus, this size is too big for fine hair cut somewhat</li>
            <li>Would have given a 5 if the package had not been previously opened and taped back together; however, obviously never used and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and fairly short.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It was fine, but I&#x27;d lost the end to the larger brush, during a trip.</li>
            <li>One day the unit worked fine (no sign of any issue) and the next it would not turn on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel this got as hot as an older one I borrowed from my cousin.  </li>
            <li>Doesnt get hot like the older ones did.</li>
            <li>Creates very natural waves if used right.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little tool to have around.  </li>
            <li>Get hot with two heat setting LO or HIGH ...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how efficient this airbrush would be on very thick hair, but it does a great job of adding volume and fullness to my bob, without curling my hair.</li>
            <li>Good hair dryer, but hard to change brush heads.  </li>
            <li>This, I think, is a huge difference from the regular hair dryer method.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is fast, light, not noisy, and very simple.</li>
            <li>The cord is too short to use comfortably.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I have course hair and using this makes it silky smooth with big waves.</li>
            <li>I really like this and use it almost every day.  </li>
            <li>The heat is much gentler.</li>
            <li>I was getting ready for a trip to Europe</li>
            <li>and I really needed a dual voltage hair curler.  </li>
            <li>and this really helps to undo that.</li>
            <li>you do not burn your neck when trying to get the very ends.</li>
            <li>Gave up on completely straight years ago.</li>
            <li>I eventually realized that the hairdryer I was using was making my hair very frizzy...</li>
            <li>(1)a time saver, (2)give my hair some lift &amp; shape and (3) provide the same polished (smooth) look from ironing it.</li>
            <li>Now I am ready for the Conair 1.5.</li>
            <li>I do not like 1.25 inch for myself nearly as much because</li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I like that it has teeth as opposed to bristles because it slides through the hair much smoother and easier.  </li>
            <li>Took it on a trip to China (220v) and the dual voltage feature worked very well.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so straight and lots of volume.</li>
            <li>I really like the styling brush.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t blow much air.</li>
            <li>I really would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>After using it my hair is straight with body.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>Styles my hair like a salon and without much effort.  </li>
            <li>A very dissatisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I like this hair tool so much I purchased another one to keep in my travel case.</li>
            <li>So far I have not had success in inserting the roller into the handle.  </li>
            <li>much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Dee</li>
            <li>, I always get the same results...from cheap to expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>So I was really upset when mine was damaged by baggage handlers in route from a trip to Vegas.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>It works better than nothing, but not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It smoothes and gently curls it, but&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care for it much at all.  </li>
            <li>I does give the ends a gentle curve under that lasts.</li>
            <li>and my hair is poker straight.</li>
            <li>This supposedly &amp;#34;easy to use&amp;#34; styling tool is very ineffective.  </li>
            <li>I will never buy on line again as it costs so much money to return.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t think it should be that much money.</li>
            <li>I have medium length, very wavy and a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have that much heat.</li>
            <li>This brush does the job very well.</li>
            <li>You do have to be sure your hair is damp and not dripping wet.</li>
            <li>so this straightens it quite well without being bone straight...</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Did not have much power.  </li>
            <li>Very upset.  </li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>but I guess some people really like it that way.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very ineffective for my needs.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It does absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very convienent to travel with because it comes apart.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried blow-drying my hair straight out of the shower with this, thing, and it takes FOREVER.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair on the straight side and no body.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>The LO heat setting does not do much on hair for styling.&lt;br /&gt;Anybody buying this product for travel, be cautious about the DUAL VOLTAGE</li>
            <li>Send it back to China cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I have a substantial amount of hair and you really have to spend some time to get any result from this thing.</li>
            <li>I had a Conair Styling Brush for years that heated up really well.  </li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, since I purchased it for use when I</li>
            <li>I love that it has the two different brush types and interchange them frequently.  </li>
            <li>I found this product at least 15 years ago and have loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li>I love the use of hot air because it is so less damaging.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and other sizes, but this one is perfect for mid length, fine hair and the options of 2 sizes allow you to style hair in various ways.</li>
            <li>I received Hot Air Brush that had been used when it said it was new.</li>
            <li>Some hot curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to smooth my frizzies, but this one actually gets quite hot.</li>
            <li>High is not too High and Hot that it burns your hair.  </li>
            <li>Should have read other reviews more before buying.  </li>
            <li>but I love that I can use it one-handed and use the other hand to turn book pages or whatever.</li>
            <li>I decided to check Amazon to see if I could find one like it there, and sure enough, they had the exact same one I had been using.</li>
            <li>but I did not have the original packaging, which they said was required to return it (obviously this was used by Mrs. ).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many from other brands but none worked with me and gave me salon results as CONAIR</li>
            <li>The issue is that the brush piece is separated from the handle and cannot go back to the original form, so I cannot use it.</li>
            <li>long as I keep my hair short, this is the only hair dryer I need--and it is great for styling my hair too.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one available but I&#x27;m pleased with the previous one</li>
            <li>I was very excited about the other reviews which said they could not do without this combo dryer/styler.  </li>
            <li>I have used other curling products from Conair in the past but this is by far the best for my short-medium hair.  </li>
            <li>The one I opened has a short in it so that if the cord isn&#x27;t in the exact right position at the end of the dryer, the dryer shuts off.  </li>
            <li>The second broke right after the first use.</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace fabulous and very old similar Conair model that was held together with rubber bands by the time I had to give up on it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product to replace a Conair Hot Curling unit that was probably 10 years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a quick and easy way to dry and style at the same time</li>
            <li>my old Conair hot brush did so well.</li>
            <li>I let it cool and tried it again the following day.</li>
            <li>I returned it when I found my old style Conair hot air combo was still sold through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and it was not enough power to keep mine full.</li>
            <li>My suggestion for anyone who travels to Europe frequently is to just buy a hot air brush when you&#x27;re there and let it be your dedicated brush for travel.</li>
            <li>I actually dropped it in tub full of water and soapâ€¦</li>
            <li>I thought maybe I should use the regular hair dryer first and then smooth my hair with the new hot air brush, since it would have taken a week to get my hair from damp to dry with the hot air brush.</li>
            <li>If I style it from the top down, I never have that problem.  </li>
            <li>finding this particular model (which is an exact replacement of my old one)</li>
            <li>I have VERY straight, fine hair, so first I bend over and blow my hair almost completely dry with a regular, gun-style dryer.</li>
            <li>I think this will work great with damp hair or a little wet hair.</li>
            <li>I took the new one on vacation thinking this would be better than having the other break.</li>
            <li>live in the place where the voltage is 220 and when subjected to this voltage the brush does not work in its maximum power!</li>
            <li>I certainly do  recommend this for anyone like myself with fine hair and who  is all thumbs when it comes to working with a dryer in one hand and a curling brush in the other.</li>
            <li>My previous product was able to straighten my wavy hair as well as curl and style and this did nothing.</li>
            <li>(only difference I could see was color) that I used and loved for a few years.</li>
            <li>but Conair needs to look at how this most recent version is being made as it seems to have a critical design/maufacturing flaw in it.</li>
            <li>I have an older model that generates 1000 watts.  </li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;I also do find that after the initial curling that my hair relaxes a tiny bit through out the day, but that just makes the curl and body look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It took me FOREVER to get my hair looking somewhat decent.</li>
            <li>this method sure beats the blow dryer and brush method when you regularly conk yourself in the head...and the price was only 2/3 of what the retail market is</li>
            <li>I did find similar hot air brushes that produced hot heat w/ forceful air</li>
            <li>: This tool&#x27;s main purpose (IMO) is to replace styling your hair with a roll brush and hairdryer.</li>
            <li>: This tool&#x27;s main purpose (IMO) is to replace styling your hair with a roll brush and hairdryer.</li>
            <li>will likely order 2 more for back ups.  </li>
            <li>Only once have I gotten lucky and have it go out just before the warranty</li>
            <li>Sure enough I picked it up in the hotel lobby 2 days later on Sunday!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and getting volume into is not easy.  </li>
            <li>I have thick Asian hair, and this makes it look nice and full and wavy.  </li>
            <li>My wife had high expectations after going through the reviews for this product.</li>
            <li>What I wanted (I had high hopes):</li>
            <li>Over all I highly recommend this product to anyone...</li>
            <li>I have been using this since I was in junior high</li>
            <li>(the high setting was not an option)</li>
            <li>A lot of people complain that, for the 220V, since you can&#x27;t use it on high, it&#x27;s under-powered.</li>
            <li>and I do hope Conair (and companies in general) will consider going back to a higher standard and better quality assurance.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I will not stay running when you turn the brush in her hair and it produces almost no heat and the fan on high setting</li>
            <li>the high setting the heat is about medium.  </li>
            <li>Still, it offers something that most other brushes don&#x27;t offer:</li>
            <li>The motor is small, and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; very strongly.  </li>
            <li>I love this hot air styler and bought this extra one in case my other burns out.</li>
            <li>I used with a plug adapter and that gave the brush a little more power than using in an &amp;#34;American&amp;#34; socket that some hotels had built in.  </li>
            <li>also, I wish the turn on mechanism was a little more &amp;#34;definite&amp;#34; cuz I keep fumbling around trying to find it; otherwise, it does its job</li>
            <li>I needed a new one this time because many of the tines broke off in a tightly packed suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Hot Air Styling Brush does not have much power and so the stream of air that comes out is very low even when set on high.</li>
            <li>But I realized quickly that it is very stiff and not all that comfortable  to use.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fast and create soft curls with lots of volume.</li>
            <li>This is great product, so sad I can&#x27;t find it in the store.</li>
            <li>Setting it to European voltage really just meant that the dryer was only available to run on the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li>but i guess with my hair type ( natural, and very kinky)</li>
            <li>Conair is a great product, however my hair is difficult to curl.</li>
            <li>From what I understand, the 250V setting (probably locked on Low) will put out as much heat as the 120V does on the higher setting</li>
            <li>Trouble getting the brush attachment locked into place, so it falls out periodically, but this is still a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li>Worked very well for three months then the end cap came off during normal use and can&#x27;t be fixed.  </li>
            <li>May work OK on long hair, but not short.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Conair brushes similar in the past &amp; loved them.  </li>
            <li>Hotel hair dryers barely blow and take forever, and regular smooth curling irons always burn my fingers.</li>
            <li>This curls my hair perfectly, which is a normal texture, not thick or thin, slightly wavy.</li>
            <li>Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li>Whenever I go to a salon, they ALWAYS dry my hair starting from the bottom and working their way UP to the top.  </li>
            <li>I use it on wet and on dry hair and works defrizzes and styles nicely.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine and if left to air dry will have some natural waves to it.</li>
            <li>However - this is a critical flow going on right now that makes NO SENSE.  </li>
            <li>Works great with short or long hair, and with a little styling product (gel or mousse)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries to see if I get better style results, but I am considering sending it back.  </li>
            <li>I have owned this particular Conair Hot Curling tool for well over ten years.  </li>
            <li>The barrel is fairly large and isn&#x27;t really the thing for short hair, either.  </li>
            <li>Both items a much too large for medium and short hair</li>
            <li>Plus you keep one had free without having a brush in one hand and blower in the other.  </li>
            <li>The little screw holding the gold metal plates to the bottom ring of the brush attachment popped out causing the top piece to fall completely apart.</li>
            <li>Once this hurdle was overcome, I could not wait to try my new Styling Brush.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years now, but I have had to buy new ones quite often, as I think when you use them every day they just maybe get over heated or hair spray clogs them up or something.</li>
            <li>When I went to use the new one it popped and fizzled and smoke came out of it.</li>
            <li>I ordered it and had my new one in just five days.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t be buying a new one every two months.  </li>
            <li>Every couple of years - something happens and i have to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>I had the new one for 2 weeks and the end just broke off, so the rows of &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; slide out.  </li>
            <li>And I began the search for a new curling iron/ hair dryer combo.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought this was a new product smell</li>
            <li>but now after smelling the new Ionic brush I know its not.</li>
            <li>Quickly style or touch up already dry</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold a mirror in one hand and the airbrush in the other to detail a certain area, if necessary.</li>
            <li>As I mentioned, my product that died was very old</li>
            <li>I first owned one of these in high school, and I recently purchased a new one after seeing my old one lying in my parents&#x27; house.  </li>
            <li>I love that it gives me a salon style blowout look without having to hold a large round brush and a blow dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and still have to dry it most of the way with a hair dryer for time purposes.</li>
            <li>I do make sure my hair is almost dry before I use this, or it would take much to long.</li>
            <li>Diameter of the smaller brush is still too large for my particular hair.</li>
            <li>It worked on my first trip to Europe but burnt out on the second trip.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>The brush doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten hair.</li>
            <li>the one I&#x27;m using decides to finally poop out.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with it for such a good price!</li>
            <li>Next time I will check Amazon first and save time and fuel.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because it was the only hot air brush I could find that was dual voltage.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>The 1.5 inch hot air barrel is the feature that keeps me coming back to this item.  </li>
            <li>This is the third hot air curler I&#x27;ve purchased over 15 years.</li>
            <li>The EXACT same model I had before.  </li>
            <li>This Curling Combo is actually a blow dryer that curls while using it, and that is exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I ordered this conair hot air curling comb.</li>
            <li>This is the third Conair hot air curling iron I have purchased.</li>
            <li>My former hot air brushes were Sassoon and lasted over a year for each one, but can&#x27;t be found in stores anymore.</li>
            <li>Helen of Troy makes a similar product but it feels even cheaper and lighter and lacked force of air and hot heat.</li>
            <li>this is to replace the last hot air curler I got over 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li>This is the second one I bought because the first one broke.</li>
            <li>I finally found the exact one here on Amazon and bought it.  </li>
            <li>does not get hot enough to do anything to your hair.</li>
            <li>It MIGHT work only with really dense hair!</li>
            <li>Because it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, it takes longer to blowdry hair.</li>
            <li>If you want hot air it only works at the lowest airflow.  </li>
            <li>This one is exactly the same</li>
            <li>I bought this item for a recent vacation to London and was excited to have a dual voltage dryer to use when I travel internationally.  </li>
            <li>Carefully shape each roll to cool.  </li>
            <li>I use it daily and my hair is still healthy, so I believe it is less damaging than a normal curler.</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have dried your hair almost completely with the blow dryer prior to use as this doesn&#x27;t really work on super wet hair.  </li>
            <li>for some reason your hair isn&#x27;t shiny enough or needs a more finished look, simply run a flat iron through the top/outer layer of your hair.</li>
            <li>I found this at such a great price on Amazon... over half or less than anywhere else...</li>
            <li>My hair has volume, bounce, smooth curls and less frizz.  </li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t want to empty your pockets on a super fancy model.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t blow dry quickly because high speed is equal to the lowest speed on a normal blowdryer.</li>
            <li>As previous purchasers stated a little underpowered but works well and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>I was going to send it back, but these particular units, or any one that has the hot air blowing feature, are becoming increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li>and once I finally used the styler, it left my hair very frizzy since I had air-dried it first.  </li>
            <li>The top half either breaks off, or the device will just stop turning on all of a sudden.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can use it on both dry and wet hair, and that it is dual voltage</li>
            <li>My previous styling brush on low has more power than this one on high.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this dryer because it&#x27;s much faster than blowing my hair dry, then using a curling iron.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get enough wind power to blow a leaf, it would take half an hour or more to do what I needed.</li>
            <li>So I finally found a store with super glue and glued it back on.</li>
            <li>I sometimes blow dry my hair a bit before using this as it does take a while if you use it right out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I need something stiff and strong to get through my hair like plastic teeth.</li>
            <li>Brush is too big for short hair and iron is very hot.</li>
            <li>hair is fairly fine, somewhat wavy and drys pretty quickly, but I am not sure how this would work for thick or very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Too large to work on short hair.</li>
            <li>I wished the large toothed hair curlers would come back out.  </li>
            <li>I had the larger styling brush but it was too large for me.  </li>
            <li>device itself seems to work fine - and the results are kinda a big puffy effect, but not really curled on my hair.</li>
            <li>I have to give this 5 stars because if you have fine limp straight hair, it gives you the extra body you need.  </li>
            <li>And now I found it here for half, I am so excited.</li>
            <li>I tried many outlets that are working - it is hard to find these.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding these in the stores and was glad to see I could get them online.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I love the hard plastic bristle brush because it penetrates all my hair.</li>
            <li>Finally, this is a large and heavy hair dryer that takes up a lot of room when you are trying to pack light.</li>
            <li>The bigger barrel has hard teeth that didnt brush through my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>not very powerful and doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl my (fine) hair.</li>
            <li>Great curls and tames my crazy hair</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind buying a replacement every year, it is a great product for extra curly and difficult to style hair.</li>
            <li>That charge on top of my own postage charges makes their warranty worthless.</li>
            <li>Clearly this product is the answer to thick/wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my old one.  </li>
            <li>My old one lasted longer than 6 years.  </li>
            <li>I have medium length, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>also, this item was much cheaper at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair and is a pain to sraighten with just a dryer:</li>
            <li>It must be either old or was stored improperly.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>I ended up giving my old one to my sister.</li>
            <li>It will not heat up as much as my old one did.  </li>
            <li>I really like this item,its the only thing that works well for my hair.</li>
            <li>would recommend it &amp; it makes fixing your hair fast &amp; gives it body at the same time.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite for at least three years.</li>
            <li>I had the old purple conair model that I had for years....</li>
            <li>I tried the larger 1.5\\&quot; brush attachment brush attachment which has smooth plastic bristles and with that the hair will slide out well, but it is too big to wind up short hair.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly (frizzy) hair.  </li>
            <li>I really need a smaller or tighter curl.  </li>
            <li>It is too soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s far too noisy for the heating power it delivers and its curling, styling ability is almost nil.  </li>
            <li>my old one give out.  </li>
            <li>What a waste of money no wonder its so cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a blower and brush in one), it keeps your hair soft, and gives your hair body.  </li>
            <li>My old one went on the blink.</li>
            <li>On longer hair, I&#x27;m sure it can add waves or some curls, but it might be a secondary tool after drying.</li>
            <li>This gives me a straight look in only minutes time.  </li>
            <li>I just go easier near my head now.</li>
            <li>The lower speed is of course not as loud.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair quickly,the hair is shinny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>and I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I bought one to replace my old one that I&#x27;d had for years.</li>
            <li>one problem when making soft curls</li>
            <li>Made a whole lot cheaper than the earlier version.  </li>
            <li>Just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>also this product is not heavy at all</li>
            <li>The barrels just didn&#x27;t seem to stay locked in place, finally the whole thing broke so it ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li>I can do anything from baby-doll curls with this thing to soft shiny waves or use it to shine my hair and give it some shape after straightening.</li>
            <li>Ordered this newer generation one to replace my old Conair and let me just say, they don&#x27;t make them like they used to.  </li>
            <li>My old one died and I needed a replacement.  </li>
            <li>But I was willing to deal with that minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li>and then I curled the ends with my 20 year old Conair 1 3/4\\&quot; curling iron with plastic comb type teeth, which they stopped making over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>The effect is about the same, although I think i have more control with my round brush as a separate.  </li>
            <li>I use it after I have dried my hair most of the way with my regular hair dryer</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get your hair very straight and takes longer to dry...</li>
            <li>okay, though it took a long time to dry my hair on just low speed.  </li>
            <li>Even though the price was very cheap, I think that two uses is ridiculous .  </li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;m just trying to be careful and wrap my hair closer to the end of the barrel.</li>
            <li>The instructions advise to let hair air dry for awhile first.  </li>
            <li>I partially dry the hair with a towel first.</li>
            <li>I just let my hair air dry for about  15 minutes and then use the hot air curling Conair to finish the drying and styling.  </li>
            <li>It was too big for me to hold comfortably and the bristles were sharp on my head.  </li>
            <li>It really makes my hair soft and adds a lot of volume to my flat hair (after a relaxer).  </li>
            <li>Hot blow dry brush that delivers &amp; smoothes hair all at once.</li>
            <li>You have to dry your hair somewhat first</li>
            <li>(live in a rural area) to get a new one.</li>
            <li>Also, if you style your hair the wrong way with the conair, mistakes are super easy to fix.</li>
            <li>I use a little bit of gel first and it gives my hair so much body and fullness.</li>
            <li>If I want my hair totally straight I just go over it with flat iron.</li>
            <li>It is still wavy but with less volume (as my hair gets big on its own), it actually reminds me of a models&#x27; hair for a shampoo commercial.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t get very hot, so if you are going to use it to dry your hair, you should look for a different product.</li>
            <li>I have owned this for years, I am on my second one because I wore the first one out although they last for years.</li>
            <li>My first one died (RIP) after several years of regular use.  </li>
            <li>My last hot brush (by a different company)had lasted 10 plus years.  </li>
            <li>I have used a Conair Hot Air Styling Brush for quite a few years and it&#x27;s really my go-to hair styling tool.</li>
            <li>I have owned an older one of this same style model brand for about 7 years.  </li>
            <li>Actually, this is my second one because I lost my first one.</li>
            <li>I just threw out an older model and started using the  last one.</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought another brand is because when the first Conair one I bought, which lasted 8 YEARS, (was white) died, I could not find this one again.</li>
            <li>We grew up in the era of long natural straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Took it back to the store and now have a replacement that does EXACTLY the same thing!   </li>
            <li>and I like the way I can make my hair look decent in the middle of washings!  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for people with coarse hair.</li>
            <li>You couldn&#x27;t turn from high to low to off.</li>
            <li>It would not go to the high setting.. with the low setting it would take hours to do my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have long, poker straight hair</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair.</li>
            <li>Let me be clear that the reason that the old product lasted so long was that I rarely used it until about a year or two ago-mainly because I wasn&#x27;t using it properly and my hair was longer and styled differently.     </li>
            <li>: Use the same styling products w/ your hot air brush that you&#x27;d use w/ a flat iron--heat protector, primer, hair spray, serums, shine spray, etc.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to drag hot rollers with me.  </li>
            <li>I work full time and can&#x27;t get away without styling it everyday.  </li>
            <li>During the winter, my hair is so straight and static that the brush only makes it worse.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine thin hair, about 2\\&quot; below my ears.  </li>
            <li>I use this curling iron on a daily basis and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I got a new one as a \\&quot;back up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I will look for a similar product from a new manufacturer this time.</li>
            <li>I &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; my old one several months ago by using it incorrectly in South America on the last day of my trip, but ordered a new one as soon as I returned home!</li>
            <li>This allows one to dry the hair while pulling it straight and curling the ends.</li>
            <li>Otherwidse it will take forever to dry a whole head.</li>
            <li>Tried it with dry hair, didn&#x27;t work as much.  </li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m running low on time, I&#x27;ll use it to style the hair around my face, and it does a much nicer job than a regular hairdryer.</li>
            <li>The bristols on the smaller brush are very soft and do not grasp the hair wll.</li>
            <li>But to tell the same story, I recently goy my hair cut short and the barrels on this were completely too large.  </li>
            <li>Using not too hot air, and not hot metal, this does it all.  </li>
            <li>I was in a rush when it arrived and threw away the packaging (thinking it was like other Conair hot air brushes I have used) or I would return it.</li>
            <li>I have fine medium length hair, and it produced hardly any curl at all.  </li>
            <li>First thing to note is that if you use this item on European voltage (220/240), the dryer will not go up to \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed, it will only work on low.  </li>
            <li>After the \\&quot;10 second curl\\&quot; turn the Conair off while your hair is still \\&quot;rolled up\\&quot; and blow cool air directly onto the barrel from your dryer for a few seconds until hair is cooled then unroll.    </li>
            <li>I have to dry my hair first with a regular blowdryer and use this to fix my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little disappointed as the newer version should be as good or better than the same item that&#x27;s 10 years old.</li>
            <li>I had to reorder a new brush in early Aug 2013 because the one I had for several years finally stopped working.  </li>
            <li>This will be a fine product if you have at least shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for years on my fine delicate shoulder-length hair.  </li>
            <li>This one works just as well as the older one - hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li>My arms aren&#x27;t terribly strong, so it&#x27;s difficult to keep using it for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>This is a recent purchase to replace the older version who met its demise after almost 20 years of daily use.  </li>
            <li>I usually let it dry naturally, but this appliance is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The ring that locks the brush on is not strong enough and cracks easily with just regular use.</li>
            <li>Only has high and low.  </li>
            <li>after second use the switch broke and will not go up to high; it only works on low.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Economics aside, I didn&#x27;t find any other &amp;#34;hot air styling brushes&amp;#34; that have the hard bristles I like combined with strong, forceful air that gets hot enough to work.</li>
            <li>I generally use the brush attachment.  </li>
            <li>had purchased one like it long ago, which had worked very well and whose barrel was smaller.  </li>
            <li>and if i remember clearly, i did warn her before finally ordering it for</li>
            <li>I have only used the hair styler in the US so far.</li>
            <li>Important: do not dry completely-ends should be dry but hair should still feel very slightly damp near your scalp.</li>
            <li>As old as it was the on/off switch finally gave out, but not the styler.  </li>
            <li>My old one finally gave up and had to be discarded.</li>
            <li>I really like to use it when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 starts only because it&#x27;s really LOUD</li>
            <li>Kind of weird???  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, companies don&#x27;t make things as nice as they used to and that saying applies here too.</li>
            <li>I was able to work with it as long as I moved slowly.  </li>
            <li>If you hair is long or thick, I think you would be better off with a hairdryer.</li>
            <li>I checked several local stores to find a new one with no luck.</li>
            <li>New one looks the same, but def built differently.  </li>
            <li>The airbrush dries, but it would be a waste of time to start with the brush right after toweling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a high quality product that is somewhat hard to find and is priced very reasonably</li>
            <li>Brakes easily and not good for thicker hair</li>
            <li>I bought this because my Freida hot airbrush, with its one and a half inch brush, is not dual voltage.</li>
            <li>The first odd thing is that you have to manually switch for voltage.  </li>
            <li>I have used it when my hair is damp, but normally I blow dry my hair and then style it with this curling brush.</li>
            <li>I returned this styler after just a few uses because it gets VERY hot, even on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting, and the cord is very short.  </li>
            <li>Had looked high and low for several years hoping to find my second Conair Curling Combo.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve also used it with shoulder length or longer hair and the trick is, blow dry your hair almost dry first then use this to finish it off.</li>
            <li>Once in the UK, I had to use a coin to turn the &#x27;switch&#x27; to 250, which is pretty ridiculous, and which took way too much effort, as it was stuck.</li>
            <li>So a great little dryer for use in the US, but useless on the 250 voltage.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t complain other than the product wasn&#x27;t really made for someone like me.</li>
            <li>I find that the power steps down a bit ,but it&#x27;s adequate to properly dry my hair, taking a bit longer.</li>
            <li>My old one finally died recently, so I bought another.</li>
            <li>It gives me soft curls and waves.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this to replace the last one I owned (same model) as the plastic ring that held the two parts together had cracked.</li>
            <li>Only the smaller brush has soft bristles.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer did not dry my hair and the plastic brush teeth hurt my head.  </li>
            <li>I usually blow dry it and then flat iron it for a more finished look and to eliminate the frizz that inevitably accompanies the blow drying.  </li>
            <li>It is just hot air blowing through that transfers a little heat to the cylinder.  </li>
            <li>You need to blow dry hair with regular blow dryer till 80% dry then go in with this Conair hot brush to give hair volume, shape &amp; control without tangles.</li>
            <li>Then I found a small piece of black plastic ring on my counter top.</li>
            <li>B0009PVV40 Conair BC171CS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush, Black, 1.25 Inch]] inch at the same time I purchased this one.</li>
            <li>and I wind up with a weird looking 80s wave right at the top of my forehead (NOT COOL).</li>
            <li>I had trouble finding a dual voltage hot air curler to take on trips overseas</li>
            <li>The end knob that holds the combs broke off under the heat within the first few days.  </li>
            <li>However, I have yet to find a product that compares with my hair, and I can usually pick one up for fifteen to twenty dollars, so I feel it is well worth the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The first one broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li>Had an older model that lasted for about 15 years and was afraid I would not be able to replace it.  </li>
            <li>I use only the high heat setting because it is not very hot.</li>
            <li>I really like this hot air brush - it takes awhile to blow dry my thick wavy hair</li>
            <li>When I first turned it on, I thought that it didn&#x27;t have anywhere near enough power to dry and style my hair from a dampened state, but I was very pleased to be very wrong!  </li>
            <li>My hair is above my shoulders, so it just gives my hair a very soft, loose curl.</li>
            <li>It also feels a whole lot less damaging than straightening/curling irons.  </li>
            <li>I usually have a backup unit ready to go when the old one dies  </li>
            <li>A few months ago, I saw a hot air brush advertised in some catalog and then researched similar items at Amazon.</li>
            <li>At the end, for more body, shake your head a little upside down, fluff with fingers, and</li>
            <li>My mirror is a bit further away from the mirror that the cord likes to let me go, but other than cord length, this is a decent product.</li>
            <li>I am very bummed, just bought this less than 30 days ago, only have used it three times, went to use it this morning</li>
            <li>and this is my fourth one (mainly because I left my other one while I was travelling).</li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when my mother told me to use it (she has naturally curly fine hair), now instead of using hers</li>
            <li>When I do, I use a Conair Ion-Shine 1875 blow dryer with a Bio Ionic Extra Large round brush.  </li>
            <li>There are those of us, of a certain age, who never managed the technique of holding a hair dryer and a round brush at the same time.  </li>
            <li>In fact at first I thought it was broken as I could not move the switch to the high setting when I switched to 250.</li>
            <li>So sad because I agree that the hard bristles work great for my type of hair.</li>
            <li>the larger brush is bad and insufficient speed for optimum drying of hair</li>

            <li> This is a great styler</li>
            <li> It works great</li>
            <li> I hope that Conair fixes this problem, as the curler is great otherwise.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job.  </li>
            <li> and it smooths it out great.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these for over 10 years, and it worked great.</li>
            <li> The Great thing it support 110/220 volt&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I still use my curling iron for touch ups between washes, but the great start I get with my Conair makes the touch ups</li>
            <li> My wife seems quite happy with this item.</li>
            <li> It combs out all the tangles and locks them that way, so it leaves the hair great looking all</li>
            <li> Worked great in Ireland.  </li>
            <li> worked great to flip my bangs under.  </li>
            <li> Great if you cannot manage to use brush and hair dryer to style hair.</li>
            <li> Dual voltage makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I bought a revlon air brush that works great instead.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great -</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it is a great hair-dryer-shaper.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one - or if it just LOOKED like the one I used to have that worked great, but this did not heat up well at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for hair shoulder length and shorter.</li>
            <li> A great buy.  </li>
            <li> GREAT just what my wife wanted.</li>
            <li> Works great for travel</li>
            <li> Works great as a &amp;#34;touch</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s happy with this replacement.  </li>
            <li> The brush attachment is great, but the plastic brush attachment.....</li>
            <li> Great buy</li>
            <li> I found it on Amazon - how happy was I!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> So happy I could find it with Amazon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Itâ€™s great for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> sister, whose hair is norma, can use this styler all by itself and get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> and I love it!!</li>
            <li> It styles my hair very nice</li>
            <li> So I got on Amazon and started looking for a replacement and was very happy when I easily found one!  </li>
            <li> great gift and good price</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would work best for me</li>
            <li> I was thrilled!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li> In fact, I fall in love with it, as it was my best friend since then.</li>
            <li> you CONAIR, you&#x27;ve always been my best friend wherever I go.. : )</li>
            <li> While I rated the brush as OK, it may be perfect for those with longer hair.  </li>
            <li> they allow for more control, better/larger curl (for turning under or out) and always gives my hair the best result.</li>
            <li> Make sure your hair is in sections to get the best results.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This curling combo makes it so easy and leaves my hair in great condition!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect, easy to use styler for my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best blowdryer/curler for fine hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably have to replace it fairly soon.</li>
            <li> good price, good product.  </li>
            <li> Well, I just bought a Vidal Sassoon and it does not do a good job on my type of hair at all</li>
            <li> I had one of these and loved it.</li>
            <li> my wife is delighted with the product.</li>
            <li> Working greate, good temperature ,I like to use it.</li>
            <li> The product is good, just not what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is really a good tool for blow drying hair and not straightening or curling hair.</li>
            <li> I loved that one, it worked so well.  </li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> After this brush, IÂ´m feeling good with my hair.</li>
            <li> seem a good idea, but does not curl my hair well...</li>
            <li> You dont have to hold 2 items, but the blowing strength is not as good</li>
            <li> I am not so good with a blow dryer and brush for styling my hair</li>
            <li> it is a good product but not for me.</li>
            <li> Over all it is good item</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve loved it for 8 years</li>
            <li> My sister (Hair dresser) also had one &amp; loved it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for going on two years now, and it is still working as good as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> Good buy</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a number of years, primarily to control curl and frizz, and was very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good multipurpose tool.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very pleased - good product and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It arrived promptly, in great shape...and now, unlike the airlines, Amazon was able to replace part of my morning ritual.</li>
            <li> love it, great service</li>
            <li> I was more than happy.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the seller.</li>
            <li> I have tried it every time I have done my hair and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> She is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> It has two speeds/settings for hot air styling and works great!</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  </li>
            <li> So, as with so many items I cannot find in stores, I turned to Amazon, and they didn&#x27;t dissapoint me!</li>
            <li> But I do know I love it and use it all the time!</li>
            <li> The the best finishing touch is this Conair Hot Air Curling brush.  </li>
            <li> Had been looking everywhere for one, and so glad Amazon had it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this hair styling dryer!</li>
            <li> The hot air brush is perfect for styling and drying damp hair.</li>
            <li> It works way better than their newer model!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product!  </li>
            <li> Love this tool!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curler for years and love it!  </li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> The product is easy to take on a trip, works great.</li>
            <li> At first I was THRILLED with this product; the perfect size for me.  </li>
            <li> This Hot Air curling iron is a great price and it works great for my hair, which is on the thicker side and wavy.</li>
            <li> Works really well, one of the best dryers I&#x27;ve used and MUCH better than holding a brush and a blow dryer!</li>
            <li> Very good price and very easy and quick for styling.  </li>
            <li> Amazing body.  </li>
            <li> For me, it straightens my unruly wavy hair in a flash and smooths it nicely.</li>
            <li> I really liked the results I got from this iron.</li>
            <li> However, I do not know what kind of hair everyone else has</li>
            <li> Kind of looks</li>
            <li> If you want curlier hair, keep your hair dryer handy.</li>
            <li> Would have liked another speed choice.</li>
            <li> Currently I own three, one in my house, one at my mother&#x27;s, and I keep one in the car in case</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved this product for many years.....</li>
            <li> I already own this item.</li>
            <li> I was THRILLED to find the Conair.  </li>
            <li> I loved mine, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot of money for it.</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but won&#x27;t order another one.</li>
            <li> It needs to be warm to curl</li>
            <li> I was given one of these by my mother and liked it -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d honestly be lost if it ever went out of production bc</li>
            <li> Honestly my hair didn&#x27;t hold a curl with it.</li>
            <li> This works ok, but not as good as others I have had.</li>
            <li> Then the brush won&#x27;t stay locked and you can&#x27;t use it effectively.</li>
            <li> It is for sure for longer hair than I have, but still works good.  </li>
            <li> adds nice finish.</li>
            <li> Nice idea though...</li>
            <li> am most concerened with how the hair right around my face looks, and this dryer is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> very good hot air brush.</li>
            <li> I have used Conair hot air styling brushes for years and have always found them to be very good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if you are patient and talented you could get better results than me.</li>
            <li> Purchased it and am good to go for many more years to come.  </li>
            <li> I was happy with the iron and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use styling tool without fear of burning.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to be able to find and purchase this product.  </li>
            <li> but it made my hair fly away and full of static.  </li>
            <li> great thing about this styling device is I no longer stress over getting my style right</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is cut into a (just below) chin length bob.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to straighten your hair, turn your hair under or flip it up or out then give this a try!</li>
            <li> I had owned a Conair Hot Air Curling combo for more than 10 years and LOVED it!  </li>
            <li> If you have fine, straight hair like me and you want that perfect bob or you just want to add a whole-lotta volume to your layers, this is the gadget for you!  </li>
            <li> It was so old that I thought I would never be able to replace this wonderful product!!!  </li>
            <li> and I like it best for my own personal use.</li>
            <li> It doesnt blow very strong, handles ok.  </li>
            <li> the first use lol</li>
            <li> The hot air curling combo work great .My</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s just fine!</li>
            <li> I love this thing..so easy!</li>
            <li> Also, it never tangles with my fine hair!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made...</li>
            <li> Obviously it is very cheap construction.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li> It is an excellente product, easy to use and with amazing results.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, dries and styles quickly</li>
            <li> great product everyone should have one I just love love how my hair looks after using   conair hot air curing.</li>
            <li> The barrel is huge!  </li>
            <li> The barrel on this device is huge!  </li>
            <li> It is huge!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li> I wish Conaire could do better.</li>
            <li> Not the most powerful but your hair will look good.</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> However I find that when I use this to straighten my hair I am able to have more body and volume.  </li>
            <li> Love this dyer.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I missed my dryer more than anything else I lost.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again and am on the lookout for a comparable product but of better quality.</li>
            <li> Glad I found it on Amazon,</li>
            <li> It works like magic...</li>
            <li> Extremely satisfied.</li>
            <li> - Mrs. Steven Kellogg :)</li>
            <li> It worked okay, just took longer.  </li>
            <li> This  is the fourth or fifth replacement of this item as it is perfect for my hairstyle needs.  </li>
            <li> I love this product but when I turn it on, it smells like mildew.  </li>
            <li> I do one side at a time, working my way from top to bottom; flipping the hair over each time I straighten a portion.  </li>
            <li> well, with this brush my hair dries lovely and smooth!  </li>
            <li> Love everything about this curling iron.  </li>
            <li> If you try it, you may want your hair more damp.</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer for many years and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to order two more to keep on hand \\&quot;just in case.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Slightly better luck with the curling iron attachment.  </li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> If you have curly or frizzy hair, these are fantastic for smoothing and giving a nice shape/style.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this appliance.  </li>
            <li> If you need some volume and lift in your hair, big teeth/spiked appliances are the best!  </li>
            <li> I love Amazon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in love with it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad Conair still makes this item.</li>
            <li> had one of these for about 5 years until it broke, this one is even better.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I get faster and better results by blow-drying then using a curlng iron.</li>
            <li> As with most electronics, it eventually died.  </li>
            <li> I will purchase another one and hope to have better luck with it.</li>
            <li> I sure wish they wouldn&#x27;t stop making them.</li>
            <li> This should be a 5 because I love the results.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  </li>
            <li> and I always have problems let it ok at home.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know that all their hairdressers will give me as rewarding results until I tried this year three of their products, which are CONAIR CHV26IX, CS19JCS and CD 160DRCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s more like every 3 months now.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> so styling using this would have been awesome if it actually worked.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You might have more luck than I with this product.</li>
            <li> So glad I found it online because i went to a well-known department store and they were sold out.</li>
            <li> I call it my magic brush.  </li>
            <li> When it finally broke I was very happy to find this one on line.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I do love the dryer curler combo.</li>
            <li> I love, LOVE , Love this brush.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to do anything more to your hair.  </li>
            <li> Adds volume to top and bangs.  </li>
            <li> great price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Be sure to have your hair damp-dry before you start, or styling will take forever.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> but this is a nice alternative when I want smooth waves.  </li>
            <li> Most hotels provided hairdryers, so this was a luxury item to pack.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> If you want more lift, concentrate more on the roots,  If you want more curl, just keep rolling the ends.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the patience or dexterity to do the brush and dryer thing at the same time, so this is perfect!</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would be better, based on some of the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I really love this brush.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tool for taming my frizzy mop.  </li>
            <li> There is something MAGICAL about this product.</li>
            <li> never leave myself enough time to do my hair in the morning, but this brush is awesome as it works faster than the dryer/hand held brush method.</li>
            <li> and she love is it</li>
            <li> The best curling brush.....does not tangle and dries and styles your hair in a short time.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> No where in the description or even on the package or package insert does it say how many watts this is....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there are folks who prefer the boar bristles but,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with it as I won&#x27;t be holding brush and blowdry with my two hands anymore.</li>
            <li> I like better at close to this price,</li>
            <li> Should have paid more attention to the don&#x27;t-waste-your-money reviews</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li> Use it all the time, love it.  </li>
            <li> always make sure to put thermal protectant in hair before use.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this styling brush.</li>
            <li> I love what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> An all time favorite.  </li>
            <li> Love it that it is dryer and brush in one.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this Curling Combo in stores in my area and haven&#x27;t been able to find one.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> The handle is okay to use; but could be more ergonomic.</li>
            <li> my favorite hair tool</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I think this is a pretty nice styling tool!</li>
            <li> Love it...</li>
            <li> It takes some doing to not hurt yourself when touching them.  </li>
            <li> I like the way the plastic attachment worked on my hair more than the brush attachment.  </li>
            <li> Glad I chose this model.</li>
            <li> I love it and will always have one.</li>
            <li> It was interesting.</li>
            <li> It brought out the length of my hair giving it more body.  </li>
            <li> gave Amazon one more chance - and this one works great!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was OK.</li>
            <li> But it is OK.</li>
            <li> Love the product I gave it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it does the job perfectly!</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer/styler.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it works.</li>
            <li> Love it and will order another when the time comes</li>
            <li> I have a layered hair cut, and this gives me he right amount of curl in towards the face that I have always loved.</li>
            <li> I owned this product before and its bristles were soft and pliable yet provided perfect curl and left my hair with beautiful volume.</li>
            <li> so I was very excited to come across this.</li>
            <li> Looks high quality &amp; a great size.</li>
            <li> i think that was pretty good use out of them, though.  </li>
            <li> It lifts so your hair looks nice and full.  </li>
            <li> This is a perfect finish styler as long as u don&#x27;t use the brush bristles which can tear the ends of your hair.  </li>
            <li> , I have always loved this hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I returned this to Amazon (great Customer Service) and they sent a new one.  </li>
            <li> Plus I like how it helps my hair curl under more easily than the hair dryer/brush do.</li>
            <li> It is perfect when used after my hair is mostly dry.</li>
            <li> brush part is plastic and strong and goes through your hair much better then nylon bristles in my opinion</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m happy to own a third.</li>
            <li> It  is perfect for adding body and loose waves.  </li>
            <li> Great for quick touch-ups when you are in a hurry, a real must have!</li>
            <li> I like the barrel with the shorter bristles, it seems to work better with fine hair.</li>
            <li> more hotter heat ...for me this is just fine.</li>
            <li> This particular Conair is absolutely the best styling brush for me.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived early and this was great as we were traveling overseas and needed the 220 Volt setting.  </li>
            <li> Works great so far.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for soft look.</li>
            <li> it didnt work, ruined my hair, tangles my hair and wasnt able to get free for an hour.</li>
            <li> But I am very eager to use it soon to see how good it will work for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one inch and the 1 1/2&amp;#34; heads are easy to remove and change and have real bristles for good hair management and ease of styling.  </li>
            <li> If you want a very smooth look, after finishing each section, lightly brush and use a light hair spray.</li>
            <li> My original broke after many years of use, so I just bought another one.</li>
            <li> It is just like the other and it works great!  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy on your hair.  </li>
            <li> ends easily with a curling iron</li>
            <li> Adds body, but not as easy to operate as a straightner or curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I found it easy to use</li>
            <li> Easy to use and with the brush attachment</li>
            <li> , it tangles easily</li>
            <li> They are also so easy to use.</li>
            <li> the brush makes it easy to control.  </li>
            <li> If you want easy hair care &amp; volumn</li>
            <li> Easy purchase</li>
            <li> dressing has never been as easy.</li>
            <li> This is the answer for easy styling.  </li>
            <li> Easy to switch wattage.</li>
            <li> hair looks great, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Easy to use .</li>
            <li> It is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and make your hair shiny and curly too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy, and I don&#x27;t have to go through the process of seperating my hair before I blow it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and there were no problems with it</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to straighten your hair, turn your hair under or flip it up or out then give this a try!n through the top/outer layer of your hair.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use instead of 2 hands requiring brush and dryer.  </li>
            <li> And, it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> But this helps me, and is easy to use, works well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and does not get tangled in my hair.  </li>
            <li> The heads come on and off easily, and is made well.</li>
            <li> Easy way to style hair....</li>
            <li> Had an older version of this I loved.</li>
            <li> strongly considered taking off 1 star bc</li>
            <li> Works well, but smelled like plastic out of the box, like unusually strong.</li>
            <li> When I used it, I loved it, and bought 6, for gifts, and for my own back up, so I&#x27;ll never be without it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Even with fine hair I can&#x27;t use this to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; my hair, it works best on partially dried hair - takes me more time than blow-drying and ironing combined.</li>
            <li> This was my first product of the kind.</li>
            <li> And make sure you let the hair cool before brushing it.  </li>
            <li> If you want a more \\&quot;unkempt\\&quot; effect, after styling each section, allow hair to cool and style with your fingers, then spray.</li>
            <li> It takes a good 20 minutes to dry the hair but it leaves my hair shiny, bouncy, curled at the end beautifully and straight.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair that gets split</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I like the way this works and the heat level seems fine to me.</li>
            <li> This product does not work well on fine hair.</li>
            <li> Worked fine when turned off yesterday, but today I plug it in and nothing happens.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of medium length fine wavy hair that needs to be straightened</li>
            <li> and it was fine.</li>
            <li> I have medium fine hair and this one gives me the the lift I need as the teeth help separate my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, layered hair that is fine with some wave to it.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair and with a bit of gel ...</li>
            <li> This is fine for touch ups</li>
            <li> One was for a friend and hers is working just fine.</li>
            <li> I put one in my travel bag and it&#x27;s fine, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fine with me</li>
            <li> The power cord is fine.</li>
            <li> Works fine on 110.</li>
            <li> Amazon did replace it and the replacement one works just fine.</li>
            <li> This makes blow drying my hair really easy and hassle free.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY if you have fine hair.</li>
            <li> I was born with baby fine hair that never grew up.  </li>
            <li> I got so lucky and found this on sale!</li>
            <li> Usually I do a quick touch up with the curling iron, but most of the job is already done with just this dryer.</li>
            <li> I love the large barrel which is perfect for my long hair</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot but it works ok.</li>
            <li> this was a really good buy for me, but i must say i was hoping to have super straight hair</li>
            <li> The grip is kind of large</li>
            <li> I love this Conair Supreme Hot Air Styling Brush!  </li>
            <li> This a great curling Iron and is hard to find in the stores here, so it is nice to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want to have to deal with huge snarls while you&#x27;re using this thinger-bobber.</li>
            <li> and this saves a huge amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes my hair smooth and flowy.  </li>
            <li> and I always keep one or two spare ones available.</li>
            <li> I can smooth out the curls or roll my hair around like a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I have stick straight hair with a mind of its own and hoped this would add curls to my hair, which it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I take it with me everywhere, it has become just as important as my blow-dryer.</li>
            <li> Find a fantastic stylist and get your hair shaped in a way that you can work with it at home, using this item.  </li>
            <li> Luxurious, shiny, smooth.</li>
            <li> (3)It&#x27;s almost polished (smooth) looking about 10 minutes after using the tool.    </li>
            <li> It looks smooth and bouncy and lasts 2 days.</li>
            <li> It was cheaper ordering through Amazon with the free shipping</li>
            <li> I was so happy to find the same appliance after breaking mine, I bought three back-ups.  </li>
            <li> Great product, I have usded one about 15 years, it finally burnt out.</li>
            <li> So I finish it off with the curling brush to smooth and style it.  </li>
            <li> It saves time on my hair and leaves one hand free to drink coffee or apply makeup.</li>
            <li> Great value for the low price!</li>
            <li> so the warm air gently blows in the curl.  </li>
            <li> but my wife thought it could be more powerful.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for getting curl or body into hair while holding only one object.  </li>
            <li> setting which was available overseas</li>
            <li> I was concerned it may no longer be available.  </li>
            <li> Hoping it will always be available -just can&#x27;t find anything like it in stores.  </li>
            <li> this cheap copy is a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I was unimpressed w/ all of them and each one was made primarily of cheap plastics.</li>
            <li> it is light weight, which is why I chose it for travel...</li>
            <li> When I travel to Europe, it is great because it is double voltage.</li>
            <li> It was important</li>
            <li> This curling iron works very well on my frizzy and wavy hair smoothing it nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a comfortable handle while drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is cheap as heck and rips your hair out.  </li>
            <li> It works for my wavy hair to make it look smooth.</li>
            <li> It helps to give the volume I want and smooth where I want it.  </li>
            <li> Although I like this product, and it works great for my hair, I have found that their life expectancy is very short.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this item.  </li>
            <li> Ordered two while I can still find them available..</li>
            <li> But so far so good</li>
            <li> Basically this is one of those products that has just the right combination of components (plus a little bit of magic) that make an AWESOME styling tool.</li>
            <li> But price is right and works, I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> drop off which was amazingly easy for a full refund.  </li>
            <li> After I blow dry my hair, I use this and it smooths out my hair beautifully.  </li>
            <li> By the time I release it, my hair is dry, and the heat of the barrel acts as a curling iron, making beautiful waves.</li>
            <li> I went to take it off and the whole thing just came apart, bristles and all!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very worth your money.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular product for many, many years.  </li>
            <li> It gave my hair beautiful loose waves.  </li>
            <li> Heats quickly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My old brush had more options on it, but all I want is to dry my hair, and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy and leaves my hair with bounce and shine.  </li>
            <li> I ended up returning it, which, as always, was super easy through amazon.</li>
            <li> My hair straightens well and curls well, and I had great luck with my old hot air brush.</li>
            <li> it gets very, very hot and puts out strong, forceful air.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To add body to my very fine hair, and to get my hair to turn under, I use this Conair styler in combination with large velcro curlers.  </li>
            <li> It works good but it broke easily after only about 2 months.</li>
            <li> The curling iron attachment uses hot air rather than heat, which is much better for your hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it when it was first out on the market and after many years of satisfaction with this dryer/styler it was lost along with my luggage on a cross-country flight.  </li>
            <li> Got it today, plugged it in, styled my hair super quick!</li>
            <li> Broke my original one I&#x27;ve had for yrs.</li>
            <li> I was looking more for a hot curling brush that will straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> The top plastic end piece broke off the first time it was used.  </li>
            <li> Get the majority of the water out of hair first, and you will be ok.</li>
            <li> The most glaring difference is the smell the hot air curler give off.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for:))))</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, this hot air styling brush would be better if the teeth on the plastic bursh were longer.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air styling brush.</li>
            <li> The fist models were great and lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, shoulder-length hair, and I love this for finishing off my hair.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t get that, but if you use a great flat iron you&#x27;ll be able to do once pass over your hair and get a sleek straight look.</li>
            <li> but I am still happy with the product and it works well to blow dry</li>
            <li> I clean the lint out it lasts longest.</li>
            <li> Great for taming your hair as you blow dry.</li>
            <li> gave it four stars only because it would be nice to have more forceful air coming out of it--</li>
            <li> With the conair I can easily style that cowlick right outta my hair.</li>
            <li> your hair to a greater degree and may work well for certain hair types.</li>
            <li> I just do it on special occasions.</li>
            <li> Price is right!  </li>
            <li> I no longer have to worry about putting too much heat on my hair because this dryer provides just the right amount of heat to dry and style perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have fine, African American kinky hair that has been relaxed and this styling comb/brush is PERFECT for drying and styling!</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my hot air curling brush and although it is a simple design it is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I have several hot air brushes by Conair that are great products, but don&#x27;t have dual voltage.  </li>
            <li> These 2 in 1s  last me a good four or five years before they die</li>
            <li> I just wished that there would have been full disclosure in the item description.</li>
            <li> This product is not at all good for short hair.  </li>
            <li> I used this product at least 5X/week for 2 years and was very happy with it.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t ask any more from a hair tool.  </li>
            <li> However, it was slowly dying and I could not find one in the stores, so I was happy to find one on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> thank you so much for the merchandise, I love these curling irons, been lookin all over for them.  </li>
            <li> With just regular blowdryer, my hair would not look as good.</li>
            <li> I have REALLY thick hair &amp; it works GREAT on it!!</li>
            <li> So far so good for performance, the person I gave it to is pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> good for short hair.</li>
            <li> Prime was excellent as usual!</li>
            <li> This one in particular is very cheaply made, it took me days to get the brushes to &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; to the unit.  </li>
            <li> It feels cheaply made right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I find I can get pretty close to a blow out with this as it is so easy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for building volume and style to fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and much gentler on the hair than a hot iron.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curling hair which curls but quickly flattens on top and tends to friz.</li>
            <li> I had my last one for about TEN years, I love the beautiful voluminous curls and body that I get from this tool.</li>
            <li> This is good to use when I have a little more time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to curl my niece&#x27;s hair for special occassions and they did not have a problem withit being too hot and their hair kept the curls all day!  </li>
            <li> This curling iron \\&quot;hot air styler\\&quot; worked fine for 8 months and then died.</li>
            <li> First of all, I have fine hair but a lot of it.</li>
            <li> Worked fine in US but first use in France was a melt-down.  </li>
            <li> Problem is they do burn out quickly.  </li>
            <li> They seem to wear out quickly though.</li>
            <li> This styling brush quickly makes my hair look how I want it to look.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and curls evenly.  </li>
            <li> Never had a quick drying styling brush before.  </li>
            <li> I love it and highly recommend for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I love this dryer and would highly recommend it to anyone with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this here - can&#x27;t find it locally anymore and mine (exact model as this one) just quit after 5 years - thanks so much for having this still available!</li>
            <li> I can get my hair pretty smooth with it</li>
            <li> Really good for long hair.</li>
            <li> the multifunction blower does the job, super fast heating, the fan works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Now we live at a time when more styling devices are required.  </li>
            <li> I love and live by this tool.</li>
            <li> and I love the new one that I got.</li>
            <li> So easy to use and fast.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful tool, even if it doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I owned and LOVED a Conair hot air curler (cobalt blue)</li>
            <li> (hot!)</li>
            <li> My favorite by far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Conair Hot Air Curling Combo for years, but am having more and more of a problem finding one local.  </li>
            <li> My hair is color treated and too fine for this much heat.</li>
            <li> I have medium-short fine straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying another brand and giving this one to my daughter as she doesn&#x27;t use these very often and it was fine for her</li>
            <li> I have layered chin length, fine, straight hair and used it 5 to 6 times a week.</li>
            <li> I do have fine, straight hair which could be part of the problem</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for traveling - takes up little space and dual voltage.  </li>
            <li> Would be great if my hair were a little longer</li>
            <li> This is a great little appliance and I wouldn&#x27;t consider changing to something</li>
            <li> Not very hot good for travel in Europe</li>
            <li> This weekend doing my hair it got caught on a knot and the whole thing snapped...very cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this on Amazon as it was not available in any stores.</li>
            <li> I really miss being without it, but don&#x27;t feel comfortable buying another.</li>
            <li> I liked this styling brush but it only lasted about a year.  </li>
            <li> Do not buy...not even worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Oh, and as a side note: I recommend (1) making sure you give yourself enough time to go through the whole process (don&#x27;t rush) and (2) start with the TOP of your hair, NOT the BOTTOM.  </li>
            <li> When I use this curling brush on my hair it makes my hair smooth, soft and light.  </li>
            <li> I read the instructions carefully and used it successfully for the first week.  </li>
            <li> I am always challenged when it comes to product assembly, but I have tried and tried without success.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair look so much better than any old hair dryer and brush combo</li>
            <li> Perfect for styling thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I like my old one better but it didn&#x27;t have a voltage converter switch for Europe.</li>
            <li> I own three of them, and have bought several to give as gifts.  </li>
            <li> but the results look like you&#x27;ve had your hair blown out by a professional- love it.</li>
            <li> I would love one just like my old one</li>
            <li> I rarely ever have to do this</li>
            <li> I rarely ever have to do this</li>
            <li> The price was nice considering I was thinking I was going to have to pay over $40 for this item at a local store!</li>
            <li> Handy for second days.</li>
            <li> All in all, though, for the money it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Both brushes are useful.</li>
            <li> Maybe I can wrap a fabric softer sheet around it &amp; leave it on as a bathroom deodorizer to get my money&#x27;s worth?</li>
            <li> Buy this item at your own risk - and have a back-up plan on how you will style your hair if you plan to take this with you on vacation outside the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My other barrel styler curled my fine hair nicely</li>
            <li> I love this product for drying my hair in the US, it gives a nice soft curl and eliminates the need to use a blow dryer and a curling iron or flat iron.</li>
            <li> and i got it quickly ;)</li>
            <li> All other styling brushes I&#x27;ve used do not do as good a job on my hair.</li>
            <li> I love being able to blow dry and shape my hair into soft smooth curves with one hand.  </li>
            <li> My outlet is on my right</li>
            <li> It will take me a lot of practice to get it right.</li>
            <li> The curl is just the right amount to style my layers and it lasts all day without losing its shape.  </li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d it right away, but it didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It felt lighter and cheaper right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> this might be the right device, but I do mine while standing in the bathroom and always while in a hurry.</li>
            <li> i did not use it right away .</li>
            <li> I have a shoulder length bob haircut right now  </li>
            <li> They seem to stop working right after the warranty is up at one year.</li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair</li>
            <li> I received it, it did seem a bit crappier quality, and I was right,</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s fine, not thick.  </li>
            <li> first Styling Brush lasted more than 10 years and I used it nearly every day.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length normal to fine hair, so if yours is longer or thicker you should consider whether this will work for you.  </li>
            <li> After returning the one bought in the store since it&#x27;s curling iron &amp; not what I can use, I started to look online and found exactly the same one I own before.  </li>
            <li> My smaller brush controls the friz and keeps the top full as I like it  </li>
            <li> but my hair is not as FULL as it would be if I blow it out first however it does come out really shinny!</li>
            <li> The tines seem  sharp against the scalp and the attachment didn&#x27;t fit into the wand very easily.  </li>
            <li> Plus it is easy to pack and light enough for hand luggage too.  </li>
            <li> and you have to have your hair somewhat damp (not completely damp) for it to be effective</li>
            <li> I have very soft fine and curly hair</li>
            <li> The brush is fine, but I expected something with more</li>
            <li> I use only the plastic tine attachment because my hair is very fine  and gets tangled in brush attachments.</li>
            <li> I wish this got a little bit hotter but overall, for the price, it&#x27;s a great styling tool!</li>
            <li> It works great on mostly dried hair so you&#x27;re not applying too much heat to your hair.</li>
            <li> but it is light weight in more ways than I expected.  </li>
            <li> A great feature of the brush is that you can flip and switch and use it in either the US or several European countries.</li>
            <li> This is a great styling hot air brush ...ordered two when I seen the price on Amazon prime, their more expensive in retail stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> original package got sent to the wrong house, but amazon was very good and resent me another.</li>
            <li> I have normal, straight, medium-thick hair which \\&quot;takes\\&quot; curl easily.</li>
            <li> The new one offers a brush attachment which is great for using on the top and sides and the larger one is just right for the back.  </li>
            <li> I received this item from the seller very fast, within days of my order.  </li>
            <li> The price was very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I returned it to Amazon which gave a very fast refund.</li>
            <li> She probably used this machine for some 3-4 times before finally giving up and later on getting another similar product from the store which has come out good and effective for her.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my new hot air curling brush as it is the only way I can control my unruly hair!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(I have naturally wavy, fine hair.)</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I love how the heat is quick, so is cool down.</li>
            <li> It works great (and I like the new black color, for what that matters).  </li>
            <li> Awesome I love it Please do not stop making them!!!!I have had at least 6 of them !!!!</li>
            <li> The dryer is also loud and gets very hot quickly.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Conair for such a great product and thanks to Amazon for such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> The hot air styling brush was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> and I am glad to have it back!!</li>
            <li> The first one broke within the 1st week.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Hot Air Brush for - literally - 15 years.  </li>
            <li> I have had this item for exactly a year</li>
            <li> I had one of these exact dryers for years and broke it.  </li>
            <li> I had it exactly ONE MONTH - April 14, the exact day my 30-day return window expired - and</li>
            <li> but I have to use a blow dryer first if I don&#x27;t want to spend 45 minutes drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the Conair BC171CS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush 1.25</li>
            <li> : It seems to get too hot, even on the lower setting.</li>
            <li> I noticed zero differnce, perhaps because the higher heat of this unit cancelled out any \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; benefit for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush.  </li>
            <li> Use it almost daily to smooth my hair out!</li>
            <li> I bought my first Conair Hot Air Brush 15 years ago</li>
            <li> The brush itself doesn&#x27;t get really hot and blows out hot air like a hand held blow dryer.</li>
            <li> It is cheaply made and completely dissatisfactory.</li>
            <li> After switching the voltage from 110 to 220 while in Europe, I used the hot hair brush for about 3 minutes before it overheated.  </li>
            <li> I love my hair dryer/smoother - use it almost daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;v tried are too hot and tangled my hair.  </li>
            <li> I had a conair hot air curling combo for probably 10 years.</li>
            <li> Well this one broke the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Conair 1-1/2-Inch Hot Air Curling Combo.  </li>
            <li> I have had it for so many years and know it can&#x27;t last forever, so I&#x27;m buying another.  </li>
            <li> I did not like this hot air curling brush.  </li>
            <li> I would love to send it back.</li>
            <li> Ended up with the infinity pro hot air spin dryer.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this Hot AIr Curling brushes for 10+years.  </li>
            <li> In 2002, I bought the first hairdresser from CONAIR - hair setter.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair once a week and after washing it i put some moisturizer on my hair and then use the hot air curling brush.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these Hot Air Curling driers about 15 years ago and one day it quit working</li>
            <li> STOP WORKING AFTER FIRST USE</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace the Conair hot air styling brush that I&#x27;d had for years.</li>
            <li> The first came in and the tip kept falling off , so  the bristles would keep slinding off as well.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Most bathrooms we stayed in did not have the third prong on the adapter (the plug wasn&#x27;t grounded?)</li>
            <li> The shorter stiffer bristles are better for grabbing short hair, but both work.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted about seven years.</li>
            <li> have been trying to make my hair look the way I want it to look for years and years, and this is the first product that truly WORKS.</li>
            <li> The first one I had lasted about one year</li>
            <li> I ended up purchasing a different Conair hot styling brush which works better for my hair type.</li>
            <li> After many years it finally gave out and this was an identical replacement - just a different ( better IMO) color.</li>
            <li> : I just bought the Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush that is 1000 watts.</li>
            <li> This hot air curler smells like mold and mildew when I use it.</li>
            <li> but I can tell you exactly how it works for me and suggest what hair types and styles</li>
            <li> it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works like a hairbrush that blows hot air which eliminates the need for a hair dryer &amp; brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this curling combo to several people and they too are enjoying the use of it.</li>
            <li> This is a really neat idea but within two weeks it just quit working!</li>
            <li> I have been using this tool for years, probably since it first it the market.  </li>
            <li> One&#x27;s visibility in styling is much better than with a blow dryer, as the airbrush only requires one hand for me.</li>
            <li> Gets too hot for me...</li>
            <li> When I don&#x27;t use my hot rollers I use this.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t have to take a hair dryer, just the hot air curler.  </li>
            <li> along with initially using a blow dryer to remove most of the dampness.  </li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem exactly what I thought it would be</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty neat idea but did not give my hair</li>
            <li> and then I finish off with the Hot Air Curling Combo.  </li>
            <li> The size was exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I use the Conair hot ar curling combo every day.  </li>
            <li> Just received the Conair Hot Air curling combo.</li>
            <li> Not curls mind you, but waves, which is exactly what I want for my shoulder-length</li>
            <li> and I imagine this will not last more than a year.</li>
            <li> I like the wire bristles on the smaller barrel better, but not the size</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because I did like the way it worked the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what was this thing designed to do?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as if someone is blowing hot air out of it like with their .mouth.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I needed a hot air brush for travel to Europe.</li>
            <li> My old unit was smaller in diameter and fit my needs better.</li>
            <li> It turned out that I CHOSE too big a size for my hair, otherwise I love it.  </li>
            <li> Not too hot.  </li>
            <li> I used it the first day I was there</li>
            <li> I have been using the Conair hot air brush since it first came out.</li>
            <li> This unit has a small hair dryer which is great for drying the roots of  my fine hair with my head upside down, then I finish off the styling with the brush which is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t tangle.  </li>
            <li> I like the Conair a little better because it doesn&#x27;t overheat as easily</li>
            <li> This curling combo is simple, easy to use, does a great job in very little time.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, so it should not require a long time.  </li>
            <li> These 2 things combined make this hot air brush very unique from others and it&#x27;s the key to my finished look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> I have almost Marcia-Brady-straight hair, but I use a styling brush just to smooth it out a bit more and to put a slight curl into the ends.</li>
            <li> it is not that powerful and needs more time to dry the hair..</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair....and certainly gives it a boost without the old fashioned curlers...</li>
            <li> I barely have to do anything other than use this dryer, as it blow dries my hair into a great style, with ends curled somewhat under.</li>
            <li> Flat irons damage your hair, but this is much better as it is simply hot air that does not damage your hair.  </li>
            <li> A good brush drier is not easy to find.</li>
            <li> This allows me to dry and style my hair very quickly and get it done without any headaches!  </li>
            <li> More body than using just a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This new unit I purchased feels much lighter, less durable and cheaply made to be brutally honest.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, does not dry out the hair like a curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is kind of miraculous, as the Conair uses much less air than a regular hairdyer, but it works MUCH better.</li>
            <li> Instead of having some hair naturally curling under and some hair naturally curing outward, I was able to get a consisent shape so it looks neat and styled.</li>
            <li> Follow instructions and use only Low setting while in Europe, and it provides plenty of heat for good styling.</li>
            <li> I used to have lovely curls when I was younger, but now my hair neither air dries straight nor does it curl,</li>
            <li> So I switched to the second size (the smaller one) which is softer and, as it works out, a good size for me as well.</li>
            <li> I do like this except the barrel is a bit large for my higher than shoulder length hair...</li>
            <li> like my old one dries my hair very quickly, straight and smooth, rounded and full, and curled under or out, or a natural looking blend of both.</li>
            <li> I previously owned another Conair Styling Brush and it worked beautifully; however, it recently stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Although the curler blows hot air, its not a DRYER, it is used to style the hair after after it is dried.&lt;br /&gt;Versatile dual 125/250 voltage makes it easy to use universally with an inexpensive prong converter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dry most of your hair first.</li>
            <li> I think that if I was able to use the high setting at the higher voltage, things might have been different but I will never know.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t be positive.</li>
            <li> I have really long, healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use ANY styling products on my hair when I style it straight because of the Hot Air Brush.  </li>
            <li> I was so glad to see the same model just a different color, still available.  </li>
            <li> I love this for styling long hair, makes your hair shiny and bouncy without drying it out.  </li>
            <li> This unit does not have a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting, and the brushes on the roller are too long to be able to wrap the hair around the cylinder closely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Hot Air Curling Combo for years to straighten my very frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It might work great as the other reviewer&#x27;s said, but it is too big to travel with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, to my surprise the smaller attachment with brush bristles still allowed me to achieve volume and straighten my wavy fine hair (with this unit, I switched to the higher setting).</li>
            <li> I have thick curley hair and it works beautifully to create smooth large loose curls.</li>
            <li> I had to part with my old one and felt lucky to find this one on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I dry from the nape to the top and then use the air brush to flip the ends up or under and</li>
            <li> and this adds that extra volume we all like to have, and easy to use</li>
            <li> You will be able to use this product to A) completely dry and style your hair or B)</li>
            <li> Bought this as it was one of the only dual voltage hot air brushes available.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to get salon results on your own with a blowdryer and brush, but this appliance makes it so easy.  </li>
            <li> I found the 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel too large.</li>
            <li> The  brush was too large for what I wanted</li>
            <li> There is some sort of glitch in the product to where it shuts off every time it is turned a certain way.</li>
            <li> SERVICE was excellent.would certainly use them again.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> or I can add large curls or waves using the large barrel brush.  </li>
            <li> I would use it on my damp hair and get my hair mostly dry and smooth and then dry up the roots with a traditional hair dryer, it always came out great.</li>
            <li> chose this Conair hot air brush because it offered two brush diameters (as I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d use the larger diameter brush, given my chin length hair) and because it offers two electrical currencies (220 for travel abroad).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried curling with it yet, but I would imagine it will create lovely loose curls.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job in half the time since it dries and curls at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I love how fast I can dry my hair with this.</li>
            <li> After towel drying hair, I always use a leave-in product (I have used very expensive variations and I am happy to report that my favorite it currently a bargain, Loreal EverPure Smooth Frizz-Free Serum).</li>
            <li> Plus, this size is too big for fine hair cut somewhat</li>
            <li> Would have given a 5 if the package had not been previously opened and taped back together; however, obviously never used and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and fairly short.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It was fine, but I&#x27;d lost the end to the larger brush, during a trip.</li>
            <li> One day the unit worked fine (no sign of any issue) and the next it would not turn on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this got as hot as an older one I borrowed from my cousin.  </li>
            <li> Doesnt get hot like the older ones did.</li>
            <li> Creates very natural waves if used right.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little tool to have around.  </li>
            <li> Get hot with two heat setting LO or HIGH ...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how efficient this airbrush would be on very thick hair, but it does a great job of adding volume and fullness to my bob, without curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer, but hard to change brush heads.  </li>
            <li> This, I think, is a huge difference from the regular hair dryer method.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is fast, light, not noisy, and very simple.</li>
            <li> The cord is too short to use comfortably.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I have course hair and using this makes it silky smooth with big waves.</li>
            <li> I really like this and use it almost every day.  </li>
            <li> The heat is much gentler.</li>
            <li> I was getting ready for a trip to Europe</li>
            <li> and I really needed a dual voltage hair curler.  </li>
            <li> and this really helps to undo that.</li>
            <li> you do not burn your neck when trying to get the very ends.</li>
            <li> Gave up on completely straight years ago.</li>
            <li> I eventually realized that the hairdryer I was using was making my hair very frizzy...</li>
            <li> (1)a time saver, (2)give my hair some lift &amp; shape and (3) provide the same polished (smooth) look from ironing it.</li>
            <li> Now I am ready for the Conair 1.5.</li>
            <li> I do not like 1.25 inch for myself nearly as much because</li>
            <li> Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I like that it has teeth as opposed to bristles because it slides through the hair much smoother and easier.  </li>
            <li> Took it on a trip to China (220v) and the dual voltage feature worked very well.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so straight and lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I really like the styling brush.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t blow much air.</li>
            <li> I really would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> After using it my hair is straight with body.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> Styles my hair like a salon and without much effort.  </li>
            <li> A very dissatisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I like this hair tool so much I purchased another one to keep in my travel case.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had success in inserting the roller into the handle.  </li>
            <li> much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Dee</li>
            <li> , I always get the same results...from cheap to expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> So I was really upset when mine was damaged by baggage handlers in route from a trip to Vegas.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> It works better than nothing, but not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> It smoothes and gently curls it, but&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it much at all.  </li>
            <li> I does give the ends a gentle curve under that lasts.</li>
            <li> and my hair is poker straight.</li>
            <li> This supposedly &amp;#34;easy to use&amp;#34; styling tool is very ineffective.  </li>
            <li> I will never buy on line again as it costs so much money to return.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t think it should be that much money.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, very wavy and a lot of hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have that much heat.</li>
            <li> This brush does the job very well.</li>
            <li> You do have to be sure your hair is damp and not dripping wet.</li>
            <li> so this straightens it quite well without being bone straight...</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Did not have much power.  </li>
            <li> Very upset.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> but I guess some people really like it that way.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very ineffective for my needs.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very convienent to travel with because it comes apart.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried blow-drying my hair straight out of the shower with this, thing, and it takes FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair on the straight side and no body.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> The LO heat setting does not do much on hair for styling.&lt;br /&gt;Anybody buying this product for travel, be cautious about the DUAL VOLTAGE</li>
            <li> Send it back to China cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I have a substantial amount of hair and you really have to spend some time to get any result from this thing.</li>
            <li> I had a Conair Styling Brush for years that heated up really well.  </li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, since I purchased it for use when I</li>
            <li> I love that it has the two different brush types and interchange them frequently.  </li>
            <li> I found this product at least 15 years ago and have loved it ever since.  </li>
            <li> I love the use of hot air because it is so less damaging.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and other sizes, but this one is perfect for mid length, fine hair and the options of 2 sizes allow you to style hair in various ways.</li>
            <li> I received Hot Air Brush that had been used when it said it was new.</li>
            <li> Some hot curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to smooth my frizzies, but this one actually gets quite hot.</li>
            <li> High is not too High and Hot that it burns your hair.  </li>
            <li> Should have read other reviews more before buying.  </li>
            <li> but I love that I can use it one-handed and use the other hand to turn book pages or whatever.</li>
            <li> I decided to check Amazon to see if I could find one like it there, and sure enough, they had the exact same one I had been using.</li>
            <li> but I did not have the original packaging, which they said was required to return it (obviously this was used by Mrs. ).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many from other brands but none worked with me and gave me salon results as CONAIR</li>
            <li> The issue is that the brush piece is separated from the handle and cannot go back to the original form, so I cannot use it.</li>
            <li> long as I keep my hair short, this is the only hair dryer I need--and it is great for styling my hair too.  </li>
            <li> This is the only one available but I&#x27;m pleased with the previous one</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the other reviews which said they could not do without this combo dryer/styler.  </li>
            <li> I have used other curling products from Conair in the past but this is by far the best for my short-medium hair.  </li>
            <li> The one I opened has a short in it so that if the cord isn&#x27;t in the exact right position at the end of the dryer, the dryer shuts off.  </li>
            <li> The second broke right after the first use.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace fabulous and very old similar Conair model that was held together with rubber bands by the time I had to give up on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace a Conair Hot Curling unit that was probably 10 years old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quick and easy way to dry and style at the same time</li>
            <li> my old Conair hot brush did so well.</li>
            <li> I let it cool and tried it again the following day.</li>
            <li> I returned it when I found my old style Conair hot air combo was still sold through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and it was not enough power to keep mine full.</li>
            <li> My suggestion for anyone who travels to Europe frequently is to just buy a hot air brush when you&#x27;re there and let it be your dedicated brush for travel.</li>
            <li> I actually dropped it in tub full of water and soapâ€¦</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I should use the regular hair dryer first and then smooth my hair with the new hot air brush, since it would have taken a week to get my hair from damp to dry with the hot air brush.</li>
            <li> If I style it from the top down, I never have that problem.  </li>
            <li> finding this particular model (which is an exact replacement of my old one)</li>
            <li> I have VERY straight, fine hair, so first I bend over and blow my hair almost completely dry with a regular, gun-style dryer.</li>
            <li> I think this will work great with damp hair or a little wet hair.</li>
            <li> I took the new one on vacation thinking this would be better than having the other break.</li>
            <li> live in the place where the voltage is 220 and when subjected to this voltage the brush does not work in its maximum power!</li>
            <li> I certainly do  recommend this for anyone like myself with fine hair and who  is all thumbs when it comes to working with a dryer in one hand and a curling brush in the other.</li>
            <li> My previous product was able to straighten my wavy hair as well as curl and style and this did nothing.</li>
            <li> (only difference I could see was color) that I used and loved for a few years.</li>
            <li> but Conair needs to look at how this most recent version is being made as it seems to have a critical design/maufacturing flaw in it.</li>
            <li> I have an older model that generates 1000 watts.  </li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;I also do find that after the initial curling that my hair relaxes a tiny bit through out the day, but that just makes the curl and body look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It took me FOREVER to get my hair looking somewhat decent.</li>
            <li> this method sure beats the blow dryer and brush method when you regularly conk yourself in the head...and the price was only 2/3 of what the retail market is</li>
            <li> I did find similar hot air brushes that produced hot heat w/ forceful air</li>
            <li> : This tool&#x27;s main purpose (IMO) is to replace styling your hair with a roll brush and hairdryer.</li>
            <li> : This tool&#x27;s main purpose (IMO) is to replace styling your hair with a roll brush and hairdryer.</li>
            <li> will likely order 2 more for back ups.  </li>
            <li> Only once have I gotten lucky and have it go out just before the warranty</li>
            <li> Sure enough I picked it up in the hotel lobby 2 days later on Sunday!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and getting volume into is not easy.  </li>
            <li> I have thick Asian hair, and this makes it look nice and full and wavy.  </li>
            <li> My wife had high expectations after going through the reviews for this product.</li>
            <li> What I wanted (I had high hopes):</li>
            <li> Over all I highly recommend this product to anyone...</li>
            <li> I have been using this since I was in junior high</li>
            <li> (the high setting was not an option)</li>
            <li> A lot of people complain that, for the 220V, since you can&#x27;t use it on high, it&#x27;s under-powered.</li>
            <li> and I do hope Conair (and companies in general) will consider going back to a higher standard and better quality assurance.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will not stay running when you turn the brush in her hair and it produces almost no heat and the fan on high setting</li>
            <li> the high setting the heat is about medium.  </li>
            <li> Still, it offers something that most other brushes don&#x27;t offer:</li>
            <li> The motor is small, and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; very strongly.  </li>
            <li> I love this hot air styler and bought this extra one in case my other burns out.</li>
            <li> I used with a plug adapter and that gave the brush a little more power than using in an &amp;#34;American&amp;#34; socket that some hotels had built in.  </li>
            <li> also, I wish the turn on mechanism was a little more &amp;#34;definite&amp;#34; cuz I keep fumbling around trying to find it; otherwise, it does its job</li>
            <li> I needed a new one this time because many of the tines broke off in a tightly packed suitcase.  </li>
            <li> Hot Air Styling Brush does not have much power and so the stream of air that comes out is very low even when set on high.</li>
            <li> But I realized quickly that it is very stiff and not all that comfortable  to use.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and create soft curls with lots of volume.</li>
            <li> This is great product, so sad I can&#x27;t find it in the store.</li>
            <li> Setting it to European voltage really just meant that the dryer was only available to run on the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting.  </li>
            <li> but i guess with my hair type ( natural, and very kinky)</li>
            <li> Conair is a great product, however my hair is difficult to curl.</li>
            <li> From what I understand, the 250V setting (probably locked on Low) will put out as much heat as the 120V does on the higher setting</li>
            <li> Trouble getting the brush attachment locked into place, so it falls out periodically, but this is still a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> Worked very well for three months then the end cap came off during normal use and can&#x27;t be fixed.  </li>
            <li> May work OK on long hair, but not short.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Conair brushes similar in the past &amp; loved them.  </li>
            <li> Hotel hair dryers barely blow and take forever, and regular smooth curling irons always burn my fingers.</li>
            <li> This curls my hair perfectly, which is a normal texture, not thick or thin, slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> Other than that it works fine.</li>
            <li> Whenever I go to a salon, they ALWAYS dry my hair starting from the bottom and working their way UP to the top.  </li>
            <li> I use it on wet and on dry hair and works defrizzes and styles nicely.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine and if left to air dry will have some natural waves to it.</li>
            <li> However - this is a critical flow going on right now that makes NO SENSE.  </li>
            <li> Works great with short or long hair, and with a little styling product (gel or mousse)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries to see if I get better style results, but I am considering sending it back.  </li>
            <li> I have owned this particular Conair Hot Curling tool for well over ten years.  </li>
            <li> The barrel is fairly large and isn&#x27;t really the thing for short hair, either.  </li>
            <li> Both items a much too large for medium and short hair</li>
            <li> Plus you keep one had free without having a brush in one hand and blower in the other.  </li>
            <li> The little screw holding the gold metal plates to the bottom ring of the brush attachment popped out causing the top piece to fall completely apart.</li>
            <li> Once this hurdle was overcome, I could not wait to try my new Styling Brush.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for years now, but I have had to buy new ones quite often, as I think when you use them every day they just maybe get over heated or hair spray clogs them up or something.</li>
            <li> When I went to use the new one it popped and fizzled and smoke came out of it.</li>
            <li> I ordered it and had my new one in just five days.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t be buying a new one every two months.  </li>
            <li> Every couple of years - something happens and i have to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> I had the new one for 2 weeks and the end just broke off, so the rows of &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; slide out.  </li>
            <li> And I began the search for a new curling iron/ hair dryer combo.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought this was a new product smell</li>
            <li> but now after smelling the new Ionic brush I know its not.</li>
            <li> Quickly style or touch up already dry</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold a mirror in one hand and the airbrush in the other to detail a certain area, if necessary.</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, my product that died was very old</li>
            <li> I first owned one of these in high school, and I recently purchased a new one after seeing my old one lying in my parents&#x27; house.  </li>
            <li> I love that it gives me a salon style blowout look without having to hold a large round brush and a blow dryer at the same time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and still have to dry it most of the way with a hair dryer for time purposes.</li>
            <li> I do make sure my hair is almost dry before I use this, or it would take much to long.</li>
            <li> Diameter of the smaller brush is still too large for my particular hair.</li>
            <li> It worked on my first trip to Europe but burnt out on the second trip.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> the one I&#x27;m using decides to finally poop out.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with it for such a good price!</li>
            <li> Next time I will check Amazon first and save time and fuel.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was the only hot air brush I could find that was dual voltage.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> The 1.5 inch hot air barrel is the feature that keeps me coming back to this item.  </li>
            <li> This is the third hot air curler I&#x27;ve purchased over 15 years.</li>
            <li> The EXACT same model I had before.  </li>
            <li> This Curling Combo is actually a blow dryer that curls while using it, and that is exactly what I had wanted.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this conair hot air curling comb.</li>
            <li> This is the third Conair hot air curling iron I have purchased.</li>
            <li> My former hot air brushes were Sassoon and lasted over a year for each one, but can&#x27;t be found in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Helen of Troy makes a similar product but it feels even cheaper and lighter and lacked force of air and hot heat.</li>
            <li> this is to replace the last hot air curler I got over 10 years ago.  </li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought because the first one broke.</li>
            <li> I finally found the exact one here on Amazon and bought it.  </li>
            <li> does not get hot enough to do anything to your hair.</li>
            <li> It MIGHT work only with really dense hair!</li>
            <li> Because it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, it takes longer to blowdry hair.</li>
            <li> If you want hot air it only works at the lowest airflow.  </li>
            <li> This one is exactly the same</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a recent vacation to London and was excited to have a dual voltage dryer to use when I travel internationally.  </li>
            <li> Carefully shape each roll to cool.  </li>
            <li> I use it daily and my hair is still healthy, so I believe it is less damaging than a normal curler.</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have dried your hair almost completely with the blow dryer prior to use as this doesn&#x27;t really work on super wet hair.  </li>
            <li> for some reason your hair isn&#x27;t shiny enough or needs a more finished look, simply run a flat iron through the top/outer layer of your hair.</li>
            <li> I found this at such a great price on Amazon... over half or less than anywhere else...</li>
            <li> My hair has volume, bounce, smooth curls and less frizz.  </li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t want to empty your pockets on a super fancy model.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow dry quickly because high speed is equal to the lowest speed on a normal blowdryer.</li>
            <li> As previous purchasers stated a little underpowered but works well and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> I was going to send it back, but these particular units, or any one that has the hot air blowing feature, are becoming increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> and once I finally used the styler, it left my hair very frizzy since I had air-dried it first.  </li>
            <li> The top half either breaks off, or the device will just stop turning on all of a sudden.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can use it on both dry and wet hair, and that it is dual voltage</li>
            <li> My previous styling brush on low has more power than this one on high.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this dryer because it&#x27;s much faster than blowing my hair dry, then using a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get enough wind power to blow a leaf, it would take half an hour or more to do what I needed.</li>
            <li> So I finally found a store with super glue and glued it back on.</li>
            <li> I sometimes blow dry my hair a bit before using this as it does take a while if you use it right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I need something stiff and strong to get through my hair like plastic teeth.</li>
            <li> Brush is too big for short hair and iron is very hot.</li>
            <li> hair is fairly fine, somewhat wavy and drys pretty quickly, but I am not sure how this would work for thick or very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Too large to work on short hair.</li>
            <li> I wished the large toothed hair curlers would come back out.  </li>
            <li> I had the larger styling brush but it was too large for me.  </li>
            <li> device itself seems to work fine - and the results are kinda a big puffy effect, but not really curled on my hair.</li>
            <li> I have to give this 5 stars because if you have fine limp straight hair, it gives you the extra body you need.  </li>
            <li> And now I found it here for half, I am so excited.</li>
            <li> I tried many outlets that are working - it is hard to find these.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding these in the stores and was glad to see I could get them online.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I love the hard plastic bristle brush because it penetrates all my hair.</li>
            <li> Finally, this is a large and heavy hair dryer that takes up a lot of room when you are trying to pack light.</li>
            <li> The bigger barrel has hard teeth that didnt brush through my hair nicely.  </li>
            <li> not very powerful and doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl my (fine) hair.</li>
            <li> Great curls and tames my crazy hair</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind buying a replacement every year, it is a great product for extra curly and difficult to style hair.</li>
            <li> That charge on top of my own postage charges makes their warranty worthless.</li>
            <li> Clearly this product is the answer to thick/wavy/curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one.  </li>
            <li> My old one lasted longer than 6 years.  </li>
            <li> I have medium length, naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> also, this item was much cheaper at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and is a pain to sraighten with just a dryer:</li>
            <li> It must be either old or was stored improperly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> I ended up giving my old one to my sister.</li>
            <li> It will not heat up as much as my old one did.  </li>
            <li> I really like this item,its the only thing that works well for my hair.</li>
            <li> would recommend it &amp; it makes fixing your hair fast &amp; gives it body at the same time.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for at least three years.</li>
            <li> I had the old purple conair model that I had for years....</li>
            <li> I tried the larger 1.5\\&quot; brush attachment brush attachment which has smooth plastic bristles and with that the hair will slide out well, but it is too big to wind up short hair.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly (frizzy) hair.  </li>
            <li> I really need a smaller or tighter curl.  </li>
            <li> It is too soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s far too noisy for the heating power it delivers and its curling, styling ability is almost nil.  </li>
            <li> my old one give out.  </li>
            <li> What a waste of money no wonder its so cheap on Amazon.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s a blower and brush in one), it keeps your hair soft, and gives your hair body.  </li>
            <li> My old one went on the blink.</li>
            <li> On longer hair, I&#x27;m sure it can add waves or some curls, but it might be a secondary tool after drying.</li>
            <li> This gives me a straight look in only minutes time.  </li>
            <li> I just go easier near my head now.</li>
            <li> The lower speed is of course not as loud.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair quickly,the hair is shinny, soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> and I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I bought one to replace my old one that I&#x27;d had for years.</li>
            <li> one problem when making soft curls</li>
            <li> Made a whole lot cheaper than the earlier version.  </li>
            <li> Just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> also this product is not heavy at all</li>
            <li> The barrels just didn&#x27;t seem to stay locked in place, finally the whole thing broke so it ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> I can do anything from baby-doll curls with this thing to soft shiny waves or use it to shine my hair and give it some shape after straightening.</li>
            <li> Ordered this newer generation one to replace my old Conair and let me just say, they don&#x27;t make them like they used to.  </li>
            <li> My old one died and I needed a replacement.  </li>
            <li> But I was willing to deal with that minor inconvenience.  </li>
            <li> and then I curled the ends with my 20 year old Conair 1 3/4\\&quot; curling iron with plastic comb type teeth, which they stopped making over 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> The effect is about the same, although I think i have more control with my round brush as a separate.  </li>
            <li> I use it after I have dried my hair most of the way with my regular hair dryer</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get your hair very straight and takes longer to dry...</li>
            <li> okay, though it took a long time to dry my hair on just low speed.  </li>
            <li> Even though the price was very cheap, I think that two uses is ridiculous .  </li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;m just trying to be careful and wrap my hair closer to the end of the barrel.</li>
            <li> The instructions advise to let hair air dry for awhile first.  </li>
            <li> I partially dry the hair with a towel first.</li>
            <li> I just let my hair air dry for about  15 minutes and then use the hot air curling Conair to finish the drying and styling.  </li>
            <li> It was too big for me to hold comfortably and the bristles were sharp on my head.  </li>
            <li> It really makes my hair soft and adds a lot of volume to my flat hair (after a relaxer).  </li>
            <li> Hot blow dry brush that delivers &amp; smoothes hair all at once.</li>
            <li> You have to dry your hair somewhat first</li>
            <li> (live in a rural area) to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Also, if you style your hair the wrong way with the conair, mistakes are super easy to fix.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of gel first and it gives my hair so much body and fullness.</li>
            <li> If I want my hair totally straight I just go over it with flat iron.</li>
            <li> It is still wavy but with less volume (as my hair gets big on its own), it actually reminds me of a models&#x27; hair for a shampoo commercial.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t get very hot, so if you are going to use it to dry your hair, you should look for a different product.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for years, I am on my second one because I wore the first one out although they last for years.</li>
            <li> My first one died (RIP) after several years of regular use.  </li>
            <li> My last hot brush (by a different company)had lasted 10 plus years.  </li>
            <li> I have used a Conair Hot Air Styling Brush for quite a few years and it&#x27;s really my go-to hair styling tool.</li>
            <li> I have owned an older one of this same style model brand for about 7 years.  </li>
            <li> Actually, this is my second one because I lost my first one.</li>
            <li> I just threw out an older model and started using the  last one.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought another brand is because when the first Conair one I bought, which lasted 8 YEARS, (was white) died, I could not find this one again.</li>
            <li> We grew up in the era of long natural straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Took it back to the store and now have a replacement that does EXACTLY the same thing!   </li>
            <li> and I like the way I can make my hair look decent in the middle of washings!  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this for people with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> You couldn&#x27;t turn from high to low to off.</li>
            <li> It would not go to the high setting.. with the low setting it would take hours to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have long, poker straight hair</li>
            <li> I have long straight hair.</li>
            <li> Let me be clear that the reason that the old product lasted so long was that I rarely used it until about a year or two ago-mainly because I wasn&#x27;t using it properly and my hair was longer and styled differently.     </li>
            <li> : Use the same styling products w/ your hot air brush that you&#x27;d use w/ a flat iron--heat protector, primer, hair spray, serums, shine spray, etc.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to drag hot rollers with me.  </li>
            <li> I work full time and can&#x27;t get away without styling it everyday.  </li>
            <li> During the winter, my hair is so straight and static that the brush only makes it worse.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine thin hair, about 2\\&quot; below my ears.  </li>
            <li> I use this curling iron on a daily basis and can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I got a new one as a \\&quot;back up\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I will look for a similar product from a new manufacturer this time.</li>
            <li> I &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; my old one several months ago by using it incorrectly in South America on the last day of my trip, but ordered a new one as soon as I returned home!</li>
            <li> This allows one to dry the hair while pulling it straight and curling the ends.</li>
            <li> Otherwidse it will take forever to dry a whole head.</li>
            <li> Tried it with dry hair, didn&#x27;t work as much.  </li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m running low on time, I&#x27;ll use it to style the hair around my face, and it does a much nicer job than a regular hairdryer.</li>
            <li> The bristols on the smaller brush are very soft and do not grasp the hair wll.</li>
            <li> But to tell the same story, I recently goy my hair cut short and the barrels on this were completely too large.  </li>
            <li> Using not too hot air, and not hot metal, this does it all.  </li>
            <li> I was in a rush when it arrived and threw away the packaging (thinking it was like other Conair hot air brushes I have used) or I would return it.</li>
            <li> I have fine medium length hair, and it produced hardly any curl at all.  </li>
            <li> First thing to note is that if you use this item on European voltage (220/240), the dryer will not go up to \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed, it will only work on low.  </li>
            <li> After the \\&quot;10 second curl\\&quot; turn the Conair off while your hair is still \\&quot;rolled up\\&quot; and blow cool air directly onto the barrel from your dryer for a few seconds until hair is cooled then unroll.    </li>
            <li> I have to dry my hair first with a regular blowdryer and use this to fix my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed as the newer version should be as good or better than the same item that&#x27;s 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I had to reorder a new brush in early Aug 2013 because the one I had for several years finally stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This will be a fine product if you have at least shoulder length hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years on my fine delicate shoulder-length hair.  </li>
            <li> This one works just as well as the older one - hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> My arms aren&#x27;t terribly strong, so it&#x27;s difficult to keep using it for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This is a recent purchase to replace the older version who met its demise after almost 20 years of daily use.  </li>
            <li> I usually let it dry naturally, but this appliance is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The ring that locks the brush on is not strong enough and cracks easily with just regular use.</li>
            <li> Only has high and low.  </li>
            <li> after second use the switch broke and will not go up to high; it only works on low.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Economics aside, I didn&#x27;t find any other &amp;#34;hot air styling brushes&amp;#34; that have the hard bristles I like combined with strong, forceful air that gets hot enough to work.</li>
            <li> I generally use the brush attachment.  </li>
            <li> had purchased one like it long ago, which had worked very well and whose barrel was smaller.  </li>
            <li> and if i remember clearly, i did warn her before finally ordering it for</li>
            <li> I have only used the hair styler in the US so far.</li>
            <li> Important: do not dry completely-ends should be dry but hair should still feel very slightly damp near your scalp.</li>
            <li> As old as it was the on/off switch finally gave out, but not the styler.  </li>
            <li> My old one finally gave up and had to be discarded.</li>
            <li> I really like to use it when my hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 starts only because it&#x27;s really LOUD</li>
            <li> Kind of weird???  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, companies don&#x27;t make things as nice as they used to and that saying applies here too.</li>
            <li> I was able to work with it as long as I moved slowly.  </li>
            <li> If you hair is long or thick, I think you would be better off with a hairdryer.</li>
            <li> I checked several local stores to find a new one with no luck.</li>
            <li> New one looks the same, but def built differently.  </li>
            <li> The airbrush dries, but it would be a waste of time to start with the brush right after toweling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product that is somewhat hard to find and is priced very reasonably</li>
            <li> Brakes easily and not good for thicker hair</li>
            <li> I bought this because my Freida hot airbrush, with its one and a half inch brush, is not dual voltage.</li>
            <li> The first odd thing is that you have to manually switch for voltage.  </li>
            <li> I have used it when my hair is damp, but normally I blow dry my hair and then style it with this curling brush.</li>
            <li> I returned this styler after just a few uses because it gets VERY hot, even on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting, and the cord is very short.  </li>
            <li> Had looked high and low for several years hoping to find my second Conair Curling Combo.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve also used it with shoulder length or longer hair and the trick is, blow dry your hair almost dry first then use this to finish it off.</li>
            <li> Once in the UK, I had to use a coin to turn the &#x27;switch&#x27; to 250, which is pretty ridiculous, and which took way too much effort, as it was stuck.</li>
            <li> So a great little dryer for use in the US, but useless on the 250 voltage.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t complain other than the product wasn&#x27;t really made for someone like me.</li>
            <li> I find that the power steps down a bit ,but it&#x27;s adequate to properly dry my hair, taking a bit longer.</li>
            <li> My old one finally died recently, so I bought another.</li>
            <li> It gives me soft curls and waves.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this to replace the last one I owned (same model) as the plastic ring that held the two parts together had cracked.</li>
            <li> Only the smaller brush has soft bristles.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer did not dry my hair and the plastic brush teeth hurt my head.  </li>
            <li> I usually blow dry it and then flat iron it for a more finished look and to eliminate the frizz that inevitably accompanies the blow drying.  </li>
            <li> It is just hot air blowing through that transfers a little heat to the cylinder.  </li>
            <li> You need to blow dry hair with regular blow dryer till 80% dry then go in with this Conair hot brush to give hair volume, shape &amp; control without tangles.</li>
            <li> Then I found a small piece of black plastic ring on my counter top.</li>
            <li> B0009PVV40 Conair BC171CS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush, Black, 1.25 Inch]] inch at the same time I purchased this one.</li>
            <li> and I wind up with a weird looking 80s wave right at the top of my forehead (NOT COOL).</li>
            <li> I had trouble finding a dual voltage hot air curler to take on trips overseas</li>
            <li> The end knob that holds the combs broke off under the heat within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> However, I have yet to find a product that compares with my hair, and I can usually pick one up for fifteen to twenty dollars, so I feel it is well worth the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The first one broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Had an older model that lasted for about 15 years and was afraid I would not be able to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I use only the high heat setting because it is not very hot.</li>
            <li> I really like this hot air brush - it takes awhile to blow dry my thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> When I first turned it on, I thought that it didn&#x27;t have anywhere near enough power to dry and style my hair from a dampened state, but I was very pleased to be very wrong!  </li>
            <li> My hair is above my shoulders, so it just gives my hair a very soft, loose curl.</li>
            <li> It also feels a whole lot less damaging than straightening/curling irons.  </li>
            <li> I usually have a backup unit ready to go when the old one dies  </li>
            <li> A few months ago, I saw a hot air brush advertised in some catalog and then researched similar items at Amazon.</li>
            <li> At the end, for more body, shake your head a little upside down, fluff with fingers, and</li>
            <li> My mirror is a bit further away from the mirror that the cord likes to let me go, but other than cord length, this is a decent product.</li>
            <li> I am very bummed, just bought this less than 30 days ago, only have used it three times, went to use it this morning</li>
            <li> and this is my fourth one (mainly because I left my other one while I was travelling).</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when my mother told me to use it (she has naturally curly fine hair), now instead of using hers</li>
            <li> When I do, I use a Conair Ion-Shine 1875 blow dryer with a Bio Ionic Extra Large round brush.  </li>
            <li> There are those of us, of a certain age, who never managed the technique of holding a hair dryer and a round brush at the same time.  </li>
            <li> In fact at first I thought it was broken as I could not move the switch to the high setting when I switched to 250.</li>
            <li> So sad because I agree that the hard bristles work great for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> the larger brush is bad and insufficient speed for optimum drying of hair</li>
            <li> I agree with the other review, with a little more power and a larger brush, it could cut the time down for long think</li>
            <li> The benefit is that I can already see less frizz in my hair than with the high powered types, so it&#x27;s a trade off.</li>
            <li> so I tried to use the smaller attachment, the 1\\&quot; bristle brush, but the bristles are so stiff that after you windup the hair in a curl the hair gets stuck on the bristles and you can&#x27;t get the brush out without pulling it straight out,</li>
            <li> Just let it be messy while you dry, then fix it all up with the Hot Air Curling Combo.  </li>
            <li> Probably heats to a 100 degrees - way less than the 140 I normally need.</li>
            <li> I have had several different hot air brushes and each developed overheating problems from a few weeks to a few months after purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised at the lack of quality of this item, since I have used other Conair products for a lot of years.</li>
            <li> Even with my thin fine hair it would take forever to dry my hair on the low setting.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money if you need it to work on foreign voltage.</li>
            <li> I find that, if I do it that way, I always end up with \\&quot;kinks\\&quot; in my hair (same thing happens at the salon) and my hair ends up flat.  </li>
            <li> It feels a little lighter, and the brush is pretty rough on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I feel like I have wasted my money when I had such high hopes.</li>
            <li> I switched to 250 and discovered the high setting is disabled, so all I could use was the low setting.</li>
            <li> Today, the screw fell out of the second one - same place as the first one and again, the little piece of black plastic that the screw fit into was broken.  </li>
            <li> I ended up going out and buying another hot air curler that has only one voltage that at least I can use here in the USA.  </li>
            <li> I have fine, thick and slightly wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> The first time the dryer slowly died and this time it just suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> They could market a small, medium, and large size and also up the air flow a tad bit.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this, I use it just about everyday, and my hair isn&#x27;t burnt.</li>
            <li> The 1.5 inch hard plastic bristle brush piece was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and it is very unwieldy.</li>
            <li> Well it did not heat very well, barrel was too small.  </li>
            <li> My hair had no volume...very flat.  </li>
            <li> I find that straighteners pull my hair out and cause it to be flat and lifeless and times.  </li>
            <li> Does the job in no time flat.  </li>
            <li> Flat irons do just what they say - make it FLAT.  </li>
            <li> They are durable and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> They don&amp;#34;t seem to last all that long for me.</li>
            <li> took off a star because these things do not last long at all.</li>
            <li> I have a flat iron too</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 flat irons in the meantime and they can not take the place of this.  </li>
            <li> But for curling my long hair, I&#x27;ll use my regular curling iron for it.</li>
            <li> only wish Conair had a 2 inch model for long hair.</li>
            <li> I can eliminate the use of my flat iron or curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the results are not as long lasting as when done with a blowdrier</li>
            <li> I have short hair and if you have long hair, u may need a stronger version.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to blow out my hair and then flat iron or curl it.</li>
            <li> The newer ones don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
            <li> even its max settings the air blows so incredibly slow, and the barrel doesn&#x27;t get that hot.</li>
            <li> I cannot use the hot air curling combo because the power point is American which I stated I live in Australia so it is useless to me</li>
            <li> I have short, thick hair, and it was just too large to grasp the hair in the brush.  </li>
            <li> The hi setting is about the same as the low on my other one and it takes longer to get the same result.</li>
            <li> My hair is coming out very flat and mis-shapened.</li>
            <li> It took me less time to do it the old way with a brush and hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This one seems to have less power than my old one</li>
            <li> So the air flow is very low, and it takes forever to dry each curl.</li>
            <li> I start with a regular blow dryer to about 3/4 dry, and the switch to this one for styling.  </li>
            <li> I use a regular blow dryer and blow it until it&#x27;s almost dry, then give myself some wave with this styling brush.</li>
            <li> Only after reading the manual, I realized that the DUAL VOLTAGE is only partially functional.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that is due to a state law about warranty returns in general, or if it just is about Conair, but</li>
            <li> This dryer works well and the attachments are made well, however, the bristles on the smaller attachment are long and therefore make larger curls than expected.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about using a comb and hair dryer at the same time, which, as anyone knows, is pretty hard to do!</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of a Conair Hot Air Curling Combo and I&#x27;m surprised that the dryer on this one is so weak compared to my previous purchase.  </li>
            <li> have also had my hair all different lengths from hitting just at my shoulder to down the middle of my back and have always used this - no matter then length, it always smoothes and pefects.</li>
            <li> I have short, wiry and frizzy hair and it&#x27;s not hot enough for straightening (300 watts).</li>
            <li> I know other african american women are skpetical of this product, but i&#x27;ll tell you it works for us!!!!  </li>
            <li> Recommended for: Long Hair or Naturally Curly Hair--especially tight curls.</li>
            <li> The whole reason I bought this item is because I spend half my time in London and half my time in Austin, and the product description claims the dual voltage makes it usable worldwide.</li>
            <li> I typically use a dryer to damp dry my hair &amp; THEN I use the Styling Brush to complete my style.</li>
            <li> so I expected the same quality and results.  </li>
            <li> There were people asking how long this dryer lasts.</li>
            <li> I bought this just a few weeks ago after my old air brush died.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and curly and the \\&quot;comb-like\\&quot; strips grip it well.</li>
            <li> It works as expected, but dies suddenly.</li>
            <li> My dryer is quite a few years old and is still running.</li>
            <li> the item pictured is white with pink attachments.</li>
            <li> Long life for a brush/hairdryer combo.  </li>
            <li> It held for the week, but who knows how long.</li>
            <li> I have a long hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair and there is a lot of it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for so long</li>
            <li> I have to say I am surprised it stopped working, I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer or curling iron stop working after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Will give it to someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> When I grow my hair my long</li>
            <li> , that was strange</li>
            <li> I let my hair get nearly dry naturally, then use a little mousse along with this Conair.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy with this at all, it doesn&#x27;t blow enough hot air to dry your hair unless you have a long time.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the cord is noticeably shorter on the new one.</li>
            <li> If you want to use it only here in the USA, forget this one and buy one of the Revlon models--they work faster, tangle less, and last longer.</li>
            <li> The large brush has hard, plastic bristles and the small bush has soft, bendable bristles.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t blow hard enough or get hot enough for my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Also, it takes a long time to even get it dry and to a point of trying to curl or straighten.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed to open the box and find a white and hot pink one</li>
            <li> I recently let my hair grow longer, and with fine hair was afraid how to stlye it.</li>
            <li> and I  use a Wanpro dual voltage power strip with the proper wallplug, using the power strip for my phone, and other dual voltage electronics ( separately )</li>
            <li> No other hot air curling/styling brush like this model unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> I found this one and it has 2 brush heards, one smaller than the other.  </li>
            <li> As such, it did nothing at all to my hair except make it extremely frizzy.</li>
            <li> I tried several other brands.</li>
            <li> My only worry is that it will stop being made; can&#x27;t find it anywhere now other than online.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t blow as hard as an older version I had of this.</li>
            <li> it is not hot enough to dry my damp hair, and it is not hot enough to shape my already dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair.  </li>
            <li> It takes a very long time to dry your hair with this product.  </li>
            <li> I could sit for an hour trying to dry my hair with this.</li>
            <li> I use it to curl after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> I just let my hair dry a bit before using it.</li>
            <li> I use it on damp (or dry) hair to finish off the style.</li>
            <li> So, I dry it and straighten with this iron...</li>
            <li> It, seriously, smooths the cuticle, making my hair much shinier and smoother but with a flip at the bottom (over or under - whichever you prefer).  </li>
            <li> Then I dry my hair on the lowest heat setting</li>
            <li> NOR do you want to try and dry your hair with it.</li>
            <li> After you hair is almost dry, brush through for a sleek look, or give it a turn for body and curl.  </li>
            <li> I blow dry it until it&#x27;s almost dry</li>
            <li> It took forever to dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> It would have taken twenty minutes to dry my hair with this product.  </li>
            <li> I tried twice to dry and style with it, realized it was never going to work, and returned it.</li>
            <li> After I towel dry my hair and apply leave-in conditioner and sometimes mousse, this unit finishes the styling nicely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I get my hair mostly dry with my blow dryer and then finish off with this styling brush.</li>
            <li> Bought this to curl my daughter&#x27;s hair without having to blow dry it.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> I can shape my hair as I dry it.</li>
            <li> (I wait 20-40 minutes after toweling dry).</li>
            <li> My recommendation for this hair dry is that the customers try.</li>
            <li> It doesnt dry nor does it straighten..</li>
            <li> The second one worked, but was clumsy to use and my hair frequently got caught in the open/lock connector for changing the barrels.</li>
            <li> the longer your hair gets the more difficult it becomes to create that taught resistance that you create w/ a round brush and hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap, but I bought this a few months ago and it&#x27;s already broken.</li>
            <li> This product might work well on fine to thin hair, although it does not have enough power to really dry or straighten thick hair.</li>
            <li> Nowhere in the description did it say it was limited on the dual voltage setting.  </li>
            <li> This dryer can be used on totally wet hair, but it would take a long time to dry it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this unit will last as long as my previous ones have</li>
            <li> The other thing is I will blow dry my hair with a regular dryer until my hair is damp, not soaking wet.  </li>
            <li> The highest setting is still not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Poor quality, one attachment cracked after the first use.  </li>
            <li> the comb on the brush was broken when I received the product and it is quite hot on your head.  </li>
            <li> The item was already broken on first use.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought was broken into pieces.</li>
            <li> But I panicked today and realized I&#x27;d be lost if it finally broke down, and searched for some backups to buy.</li>
            <li> I only styled small sections on practically dry hair and left it on each section for 5 seconds (Conair recommends 10 seconds).</li>
            <li> It seems to be quieter than my Freida but also seemed to dispense less heat on both settings and especially the lower one.</li>
            <li> Again, my hair is just shoulder length, so I just brush a section of hair from the roots to the ends and roll it half to two thirds the way up, hold it for ten seconds and unroll.</li>
            <li> The brush shaft is really short, which means that you can only work small sections of hair at a time.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> But since I bought it to use when I travel, this is really not particularly helpful.</li>
            <li> Took way too long for my straight thin hair.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, so the heat and air volume was fine for me, though I could see it taking a long time to curl thick</li>
            <li> First of all, I found it very hard to handle due to the thickness of the handle.  </li>
            <li> the plastic heads are too long and too sharp.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it will be as effective at drying and styling my hair on low, but it is the least expensive dual voltage dryer/styler that I could find, so I am giving it a try.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other conair products that I have liked and I am disappointed with this one.  </li>
            <li> This hair dryer has very limited strength.</li>
            <li> Use a little mousse or gel and brush your hair out once prior to blow drying.  </li>
            <li> However, I have two kids and prefer to spend as little time on my hair in the mornings as possible.  </li>
            <li> (yes, it takes a little longer but it makes a big difference) with my regular hair dryer and a round boar bristle brush.</li>
            <li> Call me kooky, but I am going to order another, since I really love the way it makes my hair look, and hope that my bad experience won&#x27;t happen twice in a row.</li>
            <li> HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  </li>
            <li> I use this dryer brush after my hair is about half dry or almost dry.</li>
            <li> An hour was wasted attempting what should have been a simple process.  </li>
            <li> For easier rotation of unlocking function of attachments, wrap the unlocking ring with a wide rubber band.</li>
            <li> Do not use on wet hair, otherwise it will take forever.</li>
            <li> I really do not style my hair at all at this stage with the brush</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t  read the product details carefully.  </li>
            <li> That is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> The brush broke after a few uses and only 5 months of use.</li>
            <li> Not as I had expected from the description.  </li>
            <li> I expected firmer brush material.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if it tries to straighten my hair and makes it fuzzy looking.  </li>
            <li> I spent 30 minutes with this Conair brush, and my hair was frizzier than when I&#x27;d started, with no discernable shape.</li>
            <li> This product is about what I expected.  </li>
            <li> but it works as expected.</li>
            <li> and it was dead the next.</li>
            <li> Not really a lot of air flow.</li>
            <li> :  I&#x27;ve tried using this on my friend who has straight hair, thin hair</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try to use this as a \\&quot;hair dryer\\&quot; or use it to try to style really wet hair.  </li>
            <li> It had absolutely no drying power.</li>
            <li> My hair was still wet.</li>
            <li> This is the only round brush blow dryer that doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair into knots as you unroll it.  </li>
            <li> I dried it and left it in a corner and tried it a day laterâ€¦</li>
            <li> The amount of air that is blown out is minimal.</li>
            <li> I expected an interchangeable curling iron and brush but this just comes with two brushes.</li>
            <li> I have natural thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> But it broke after 5 months - the place where the top screws into the base simply snapped at the screw.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a Conair Hot Air Curling Iron that worked great, this is a completely different design and it fails miserably.  </li>
            <li> I dry my hair partially with a conventional blow dryer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not going to replace blow drying and ironing as I had hoped.  </li>
            <li> Also, it came in a plain white box with one word Conair.  </li>
            <li> should also point out that I only always use the stiff bristled brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> After washing my hair, I flip my head upside down and blow my hair with a regular blow dryer until it is just slightly damp.</li>
            <li> There are a few other styles of curling irons out there that are similar to this one, but they do not provide the curl that this iron does, and they burn.  </li>
            <li> I like the hot brushes with the hard bristle verses the brush-like bristles and have had a hard time finding them...</li>
            <li> and I use this air brush and a 4\\&quot; round brush to keep my hair from laying flat on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I Only use the big brush,  the small one is too flexible so it dos not work on my heavy hair.  </li>
            <li> I dry my hair with my blow dryer until just slightly damp, then I use my Conair to style and add curl while finishing the drying process.  </li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a release button on the brush that releases your hair which makes it a little less likely to end up with hair tangles.</li>
            <li> The one I have is a decade old and slowly wearing down.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse, so it is extremely straight and difficult to curl or style with a &#x27;regular&#x27; curling iron (even at the highest settings!)</li>
            <li> It barely curls your hair because the bristles are all hard plastic &amp;</li>
            <li> The only one downside I can think of is that if your hair is extreamly thick it may take a little time to &amp;quot;dry&amp;quot; it totally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had trouble when previous models have suddenly stopped working after about one year.  </li>
            <li> The instructions give no details on how to remove one brush and install the other.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are sharp and stab your head.  </li>
            <li> Handle is big, so if you have small hands it may be tricky for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this while my hair was cut short (chin length) and still use it now that my hair is past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> The brush doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair up like other brush-dryers do (</li>
            <li> With the other styles, you can not hold the iron in place or get too close to your head.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, as others have mentioned, there seem to be some electrical problems with the product</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Just like I expected!</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t have the dexterity to use a hair brush and hair dryer as I usually have to cut my hair from the brush in a big tangle.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I thought it would be like other style rollers, but not really!</li>
            <li> Not really a fan!</li>
            <li> Not pleased with this at all, wish I had sent it back!!</li>
            <li> My other one that I had for 8 years stopped working</li>
            <li> I have had a similar Conair product in the past</li>
            <li> I have never styled my hair mostly due to my lack of ability.</li>
            <li> I tried to switch the other attachment.</li>
            <li> Even had it continued working, I was prepared to tuck it into a bottom drawer as it had so little air power that my hair had to be almost dry before use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is medium length, gets a little frizzy when I blow dry it</li>
            <li> The previous one lasted longer, but not a whole year.  </li>
            <li> Used it back in the states once when I left my trusty Revlon brush behind--</li>
            <li> Works like it should on dry hair, however after a few minutes it begins to smell like the motor is going to burn out.</li>
            <li> I start at the bottom and work up to my part, sectioning the hair roughly and either slowly running the brush from root to end or rolling up from end to root and counting to ten.</li>
            <li> However, even if you&#x27;re on 110V, high is still so weak that it has little to no effect.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy long hair and this is the only hair dryer I can use to tame it.</li>
            <li> This provides only very low heat and airflow which makes it difficult to style and dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> The larger, hard plastic attachment hurts my scalp.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the money even though it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This Conair product is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I read through some of the reviews and found that others have had a similar complaint.  </li>
            <li> it is to late to send it back</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Also - my hair was really dried out by this - which is weird considering that it just didn&#x27;t get that hot.</li>
            <li> No power to speak of and didn&#x27;t do the job, not worth the effort to carry it on a trip.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought this curling iron years ago and loved it, but when I had to replace it it was horrible!</li>
            <li> I would hate not to be able to get one when I need it.  </li>
            <li> The forced air did not have enough hear.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these for years, and was afraid when I couldn&#x27;t find a new one at the my local stores.</li>
            <li> Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> Dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> I usually blow dry my hair and then use a straightening iron.    </li>
            <li> I hardly have to use my flat iron.</li>
            <li> The needles are very sharp and they hurt your head when using.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very sharp as well, which you may not like.</li>
            <li> I have given away other brands because they were so heavy.  </li>
            <li> I wanted a curling iron with plastic teeth but need a 1\\&quot; or less to get a curl since my hair is shorter.  </li>
            <li> No more messing with boar bristle brushes while you&#x27;re trying to blow dry!  </li>
            <li> The previous one I bought also lasted about a year.</li>
            <li> I have to wrap my hair around half the brush and hold it there with my hand</li>
            <li> My hair is finished in less time and is definitely less damaged by this product.  </li>
            <li> I received a black curling combo with gold attachments.</li>
            <li> I was unable to use it even when tried several days later.  </li>
            <li> When you use it and move your wrist, even slightly (so the cord twirls, as it&#x27;s supposed to), the unit stops working.</li>
            <li> It had black hair on the brush and was repackaged and sent to me.</li>
            <li> I like this as I can use it on slightly damp hair to style it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten this to replace my previous Revlon Select 1200 Ionic Ceramic styling brush.</li>
            <li> this funky frizzy half curl thing going on.</li>
            <li> This item works well, but takes longer to use for drying than some others because it has less power.  </li>
            <li> The volume of air this much less than the hairdryer</li>
            <li> I ordered the black and gold one shown here.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t as well made as my previous models have been.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the blower went out in a puff of smoke after less than a month of use.  </li>
            <li> My hairstyle is a bob, and my hair is straight-ish with some odd waves and medium volume.</li>
            <li> I have never had a shipment arrive on a Sunday much less at a hotel at no cost and</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it is difficult to turn the tiny indicator from 120V to 220V.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to switch back to 120V when I returned home from a recent trip.  </li>
            <li> non the less</li>
            <li> and it looks like a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> I have had this blower for a long time, at least 7 years, and it just died on me.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair but not ethnic and have always wanted a straighter style.</li>
            <li> I have THICK, LONG, CURLY hair.</li>
            <li> I have to say it lasts me about a year in a half or maybe a little longer.  </li>
            <li> it does take up a little less space than a dryer.</li>
            <li> I like this styling brush because it gives you a tight curl when you want one</li>
            <li> I then finish off by using this product as you would a curling iron, wrapping my hair up in it to the roots and then holding it tight for about 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> A little noisy but works wonders on my long, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Sadly, the new one is inferior.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it has enough power for someone with thick hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer my hair to have a little volume, movement, bounce, and shine.  </li>
            <li> In order to achieve the shiny results, you have to use this section by section, a little at a time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a faulty product, but the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; air was not hot.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!</li>
            <li> I use this curling brush when my hair is just a little damp.  </li>
            <li> Even with styling gel, I end up with a fluffy, frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> With the regular hairdryer brush technique, I can&#x27;t get the dumb cowlicks out of the front of my hair</li>
            <li> I noticed it was a little wobbly, like it wasnt fully together.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is a design flaw that will effect everyone or if it&#x27;s due to the baby-fineness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not have enough power to dry and style the hair.  </li>
            <li> No more fighting with a round brush in one hand, while wielding a heavy hair dryer in the other hand.  </li>
            <li> Very classy design, however the turn-feature than locks the barrel into place can be stiff and difficult to manipulate.</li>
            <li> The secret is, as several others have written, is to damp-dry the hair roots a little with a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> shipment on this thing was crazy fast.</li>
            <li> Even with my hair partially dried it took forever to do my hair.  </li>
            <li> they were used everyday -after</li>
            <li> It gives my hair volume and shine without alot of production, and without having to use 2 hands to style (I&#x27;ve yet to master the round brush and hand held dryer mystery)</li>
            <li> the brush can&#x27;t hold my thick hair, so it just feels like the thing is slipping around.  </li>
            <li> Once turned on, the tool lasted about one minute before it went dead.</li>
            <li> With gas prices what they are now why waste time and fuel driving all hunting for an item.</li>
            <li> but it will work for occasional use, otherwise I would be really annoyed.</li>
            <li> The broken piece came from a ring further up on the inside of the barrel, and with it gone, the bristles can&#x27;t be held in place.</li>
            <li> To sum it up, don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I primarily use the iron attachment to curl the ends of my hair in or out; I also use it towards the base of my head to give my hair volume when I want it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t buy it waste of money</li>
            <li> Yes, in that time I have had to replace the item a couple of times when they quit working after a few years of use.</li>
            <li> I got two so in case the one wears out, (and they do in a few years)</li>
            <li> The basic functionality of this equipment is poor.  </li>
            <li> Waste of $15.00.</li>
            <li> I have had a few of these</li>
            <li> If you have difficulty using a round brush in</li>
            <li> Arrived broken &amp; a total hassle to return.  </li>
            <li> Substitute this product... instead of using a round brush with your blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now</li>
            <li> It also is not to heavy.  </li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> Unit seems to work well but leaves my hair too fluffy with no defined curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with Conairs decision to short the cord by a foot!&#x27;  </li>
            <li> Dont waste your money on this</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of air brush for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> and it was completely dead.  </li>
            <li> and then I put that section onto a curler for a few minutes until the hair cools to room temperature.  </li>
            <li> Eh, wasted my money.</li>
            <li> This is an anemic blow brush, worthless, really, and I have short, quick-drying hair.  </li>
            <li> Not a very powerful fan and heater in the brush and actually turned out to be useless for my hair.</li>
            <li> Arrived in plain cardboard box.</li>
            <li> Bristles plastic and stiff.</li>
            <li> I have given up after purchasing a Hot tools dryer with equally bad results.</li>
            <li> I have long, thin hair and the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I usually use a round brush and hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> The bristle tips are very sharp to start with but do dull over time and with use.</li>
            <li> The previous model had rows of the flexible bristles &amp; rows of the hard plastic bristles.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my previous one that gave up one me after couple years of working hard for me.  </li>
            <li> The POWER TO BLOW even on the high setting is flimsily weak &amp; powerless.</li>
            <li> This unit&#x27;s one and a half inch attachment also does not have brush bristles but short hard protrusions that I find uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and it is a little hard to use.  </li>
            <li> There are only 2 settings (Hi and Lo), and the power is very weak.  </li>
            <li> Very little hair was lost.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a round heating brush in this size.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I will be replacing sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I can&#x27;t stand it and am not sure what to get next...</li>
            <li> The small one doesn&#x27;t work as well with my hair</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s about 2 or 3 inches past my shoulders).  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this model does not heat up enough to create the curl and body</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with small hands.</li>
            <li> , this is the first time It&#x27;s happened to me. :(</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this hot air curler.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the on/off switch broke the second time I used it.   </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the return window was so short (</li>
            <li> Just do small sections at a time.  </li>
            <li> So... this styling brush is totally useless, given its multiple design flaws.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> If this one fails like the last...</li>
            <li> This has been my Go-to Hair Styling Tool for the past 20 years.</li>
            <li> That product was a total fail and wouldn&#x27;t work for anyone for any purpose.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this smaller brush revolved like the larger brush but was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 8-10 years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a defective product or if they are all this way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the size curl I want, but it is very, very heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got flat irons, curling irons, curling wands, an InStyler and a Curl Secret!</li>
            <li> And a piece was broken off the head, so couldnt put the other brush on.</li>
            <li> It was flimsy and rattled due to a broken piece upon arrival.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to keep hair in the brush while styling because the gaps between the teeth are too wide, but if they were longer (or the barrel were a little wider) it would help.</li>
            <li> I am so mad because life got busy and now I can&#x27;t return the piece of junk.  </li>
            <li> the blow-dry aspect of it is a little weak.</li>
            <li> The attachments would not stay on making it a bit difficult to dry your hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair - this is pretty much useless on it!  :(</li>
            <li> even the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting hardly put out any air.  </li>
            <li> Was told by Amazon this hardly ever happens.</li>
            <li> Adds body and style to your hair without tangling in the hard bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I do not use the brush drum, just the hard bristle drum...</li>
            <li> BUT they lacked the hard bristles that are a must for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> prefer the hard, plastic bristles as opposed to the boar/nylon bristles</li>
            <li> I got it beca use it has hard plastick teeth</li>
            <li> The others blow air around the brush which makes it hard for your hair to stay wrapped around the bristles while styling.  </li>
            <li> there&#x27;s hardly any power coming out of this.  </li>
            <li> Upon examination, I noted that the piece that the little screw went into to hold the brush to the ring attachment had broken.  </li>
            <li> This lemon was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I waited in hopes that I would at least get some of my belongings back...but to no avail.</li>
            <li> Two late for a return.</li>
            <li> No, I honestly do not believe this was a user error..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I do not use this as a blow dryer as my hair is too thick.  </li>
            <li> My hair is slightly thick and curly.  </li>
            <li> (Shipping was a bit slow).</li>
            <li> anything... that would work on my thick, course and unruly hair, that I&#x27;ve fought with all my life.  </li>
            <li> That is annoying, but not the real problem.  </li>
            <li> Nothing works as well as the Conair Combo at taming my thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this product is not for you.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> I have thick hair</li>
            <li> I am caucasian and have somewhat thick and wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair</li>
            <li> I chalked it up to just plain bad luck and began to use the 2nd one that I had purchased.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for travel but not very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> :/ Not happy.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous...</li>
            <li> This exceeds the capability of the one from the mailer at a less expensive price.</li>
            <li> Came broken and it&#x27;s really hard against your head.</li>
            <li> I have another one that was getting old and bought this thinking I&#x27;d hate for them to stop making them and</li>
            <li> sounds like it is running out of power and gets weak, then burns out all together.  </li>
            <li> I am also disappointed with the design of the bristles in the smaller rollers,  I tried it just by hand to see if it was the size I needed</li>
            <li> It is a weak shadow of the tool I had.</li>
            <li> I found this brush too noisy for how weak the air output was.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this item because it barely blows - it is very weak - it takes forever to dry my thin, medium length hair...</li>
            <li> I usually just get frustrated and use my blow-dryer and round brush.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, Curly &amp;amp;</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick and wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron was very slow to heat up and did no&lt;</li>
            <li> My flyaway, somewhat thin hair looks fuller, smoother, shinier...and stays that way.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy.</li>
            <li> I took the barrel off, checked both sides and both barrel brushes but couldn&#x27;t find a broken edge.</li>
            <li> Not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> but the curls won&#x27;t hold and it does a poor job of drying the hair.</li>
            <li> This item was broken on arrival and I wonder if it was even checked before shipping it out.</li>
            <li> It is my beauty secret, if you will.</li>
            <li> but i am not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> but I hate that they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> my arms get tired ...</li>
            <li> A total piece of crap...</li>
            <li> I had one of these for 5 years and it was broken on a trip in my luggage which I understand the way they handle our luggage.</li>
            <li> I had to wrap the cord at the base with gorilla tape just to get it to make constant contact</li>
            <li> With that problem solved, the third time I used it, the metal brush portion broke off the plastic base part that locks onto the handle.  </li>
            <li> Bristles are almost sharp, and painful on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> This is a disappointing product since I have always used Conair curling brushes and irons in the past.</li>
            <li> I get really frustrated trying to handle a round brush and a hair dryer so this one meets my needs.</li>
            <li> Disappointing to say the least.  </li>
            <li> This causes my hair to bind around the knob, which is too small to hold onto, if that was their intent, making it impossible to release my hair cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> Having used this at both voltages, I was very disappointed that it has low power at either voltage and blows almost no air.  </li>
            <li> The air flow is very weak compared to all the ones I have owned before.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m really not very impressed, and will probably never use it again.  </li>
            <li> and I was unable to curl my hair with this curling brush.</li>
            <li> But, unfortunately it broke after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> i failed to noticed the power of that one..</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s difficult to roll all of the hair up into the brush and</li>
            <li> The voltage switch is difficult to operate and requires a screwdriver to change.  </li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon!  </li>
            <li> When that one died recently I decided to stick with conair, but this one is terrible.</li>
            <li> I missed the return deadline as well, so now I am stuck with this useless thing.</li>
            <li> Nothing was wrong with the packaging or the product.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I will not be using it again.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.</li>
            <li> Very poorly made.  </li>
            <li> This was a horrible excuse for a blow dryer brush.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase, sorry I bought it and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outcome has been disappointing for us.</li>
            <li> I have always like Conair products, but this one was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> but that was nothing compared to the disappointment I felt using this styling tool.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to use a blow dryer and brush to style my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very difficult to make permanent curls with this styling brush.</li>

            <li> This didn&#x27;t do the job, and I am very sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> Too bad the stores don&#x27;t sell it anymore.</li>
            <li> but I guess I have bad luck</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a curling iron/hair dryer that went bad after 13yrs, bought this one to replace it</li>

            <li> Too bad all you can get is this crap from China.</li>
            <li> However, when I started to style my hair, I was disappointed in the lack of power the product had.</li>
            <li> I Have to bend and stretch to use it now :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Perfect for my needs. Have used this product for 15 years and I love it!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has very limited strength. I could sit for an hour trying to dry my hair with this. Definitely not worth the money even though it is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I liked this styling brush but it only lasted about a year.  I got it specifically because of the dual wattage. It worked on my first trip to Europe but burnt out on the second trip.</li>
            <li> I am very bummed, just bought this less than 30 days ago, only have used it three times, went to use it this morning and it won&#x27;t turn on.  I heard a click and that was it.  I tried many outlets that are working - it is hard to find these.  Again, I am bummed.</li>
            <li> The hot air styling brush was exactly what I wanted.  It has two speeds/settings for hot air styling and works great!</li>
            <li> This is the type of hair dryer/styling brush I like to use. I got this to replace one that finally died. I was very disappointed. The hi setting is about the same as the low on my other one and it takes longer to get the same result. Also, the cord is quite short. My outlet is on my right and I use my left hand. The cord is too short to use comfortably. Needless to say, I will be replacing sooner rather than later.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my old one.  My old one lasted longer than 6 years.  I like this styling brush because it gives you a tight curl when you want one and it&#x27;s easy on your hair.  I have fine hair that gets split ends easily with a curling iron but I don&#x27;t have a problem with this air brush.</li>
            <li> The instructions give no details on how to remove one brush and install the other.  An hour was wasted attempting what should have been a simple process.  Once this hurdle was overcome, I could not wait to try my new Styling Brush.  Unfortunately, it does not have enough power to dry and style the hair.  My hair is very fine, so it should not require a long time.  The instructions advise to let hair air dry for awhile first.  I followed these instructions and once I finally used the styler, it left my hair very frizzy since I had air-dried it first.  I previously owned another Conair Styling Brush and it worked beautifully; however, it recently stopped working.  This was my replacement so I expected the same quality and results.  Sadly, the new one is inferior.</li>
            <li> Should have read other reviews more before buying.  It has almost no power.  Even with my hair partially dried it took forever to do my hair.  My hair had no volume...very flat.  I only used it twice and gave it away (charity.)</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are sharp and stab your head.  I accidentally purchased two.  The one I opened has a short in it so that if the cord isn&#x27;t in the exact right position at the end of the dryer, the dryer shuts off.  I received it the day before leaving for Europe.  I set it to work on the correct voltage, checked that often, but it would turn off and turn back on if I wiggled the cord.  Plus, this size is too big for fine hair cut somewhat short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased one like it long ago, which had worked very well and whose barrel was smaller.  This lemon was a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and have been using it for years.  I have thick Asian hair, and this makes it look nice and full and wavy.  However, these things ALWAYS break.  The top half either breaks off, or the device will just stop turning on all of a sudden.  I always need to replace it about every 1 to 2 years, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m knocking a star off.  Otherwise, I love it.</li>
            <li> This product arrived early and this was great as we were traveling overseas and needed the 220 Volt setting.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Adds body, but not as easy to operate as a straightner or curling iron.  Handle is big, so if you have small hands it may be tricky for you.  I have only used it twice, so I need to practice.  A good buy.</li>
            <li> I love this brush!  I have very fine hair and getting volume into is not easy.  When I use a blow dryer it gets frizzy!  This allows me to dry and style my hair very quickly and get it done without any headaches!  I&#x27;ve used this while my hair was cut short (chin length) and still use it now that my hair is past my shoulders.  I love that it has the two different brush types and interchange them frequently.  My mom loved how it works on my hair and now she has one too!</li>
            <li> I have very long hair.  It is very difficult to use a blow dryer and brush to style my hair.  I found this product at least 15 years ago and have loved it ever since.  It makes my hair smooth and flowy.  There were people asking how long this dryer lasts. I have to say it lasts me about a year in a half or maybe a little longer.  The other thing is I will blow dry my hair with a regular dryer until my hair is damp, not soaking wet.  This helps in the length of time it takes to do the drying.  So from start to finish, it takes about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed in this brush drier.  It does not get hot enough to do the job.  A good brush drier is not easy to find. I wish Conaire could do better.</li>
            <li> Brakes easily and not good for thicker hair</li>
            <li> I have medium length, naturally curly hair that&#x27;s fine, not thick.  I usually let it dry naturally, but this appliance is so easy to use.  The brush doesn&#x27;t tangle your hair up like other brush-dryers do (my last piece of Vidal Sasson garbage).  The curling iron attachment uses hot air rather than heat, which is much better for your hair.  Works really well, one of the best dryers I&#x27;ve used and MUCH better than holding a brush and a blow dryer!</li>
            <li> This a great curling Iron and is hard to find in the stores here, so it is nice to be able to get it online.</li>
            <li> This product might work well on fine to thin hair, although it does not have enough power to really dry or straighten thick hair. The highest setting is still not powerful enough. The brush doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to straighten hair.</li>
            <li> Use it everyday! Not the most powerful but your hair will look good. I have wavy hair and I like the front to look smoother and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for about a week, and wish I had kept looking. It&#x27;s the size curl I want, but it is very, very heavy. My arms aren&#x27;t terribly strong, so it&#x27;s difficult to keep using it for more than a few minutes. I&#x27;ll probably have to replace it fairly soon.</li>
            <li> Had looked high and low for several years hoping to find my second Conair Curling Combo.  The one I have is a decade old and slowly wearing down.  The new one offers a brush attachment which is great for using on the top and sides and the larger one is just right for the back.  My only complaint is that the cord is noticeably shorter on the new one.</li>
            <li> good price, good product.  Been using it for years and it does not dissapoint.  Too bad the stores don&#x27;t sell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I love this combo hair dryer/hair curler!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since 1995 (when they were white and purple). I use this curling iron on a daily basis and can&#x27;t live without it.  I go through one of these every two years, but I&#x27;m hooked for life.  (no...I don&#x27;t work for Conair) There are a few other styles of curling irons out there that are similar to this one, but they do not provide the curl that this iron does, and they burn.  With the other styles, you can not hold the iron in place or get too close to your head.  I&#x27;ve used this to curl my niece&#x27;s hair for special occassions and they did not have a problem withit being too hot and their hair kept the curls all day!  I have really long, healthy hair.  This iron does not damage or burn hair.  I do not use this as a blow dryer as my hair is too thick.  I use it to curl after my hair is dry.</li>
            <li> just what i wanted.  love it.  i&#x27;ve had two of these before.  they both lasted about 3 years a piece- they were used everyday -after three years each of them just wouldn&#x27;t come on one day.  i think that was pretty good use out of them, though.  i&#x27;m happy to own a third.</li>
            <li> Although this says that this item is a Curling combo I use this to straighten my hair. I find that straighteners pull my hair out and cause it to be flat and lifeless and times.  However I find that when I use this to straighten my hair I am able to have more body and volume.  I found it easy to use and it did what I wanted it to do!</li>
            <li> I bought this to use overseas with its dual voltage feature. I found the 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel too large. the brush does not curl, it smooths. I wanted a curling iron with plastic teeth but need a 1\\&quot; or less to get a curl since my hair is shorter.  Does anyone know a brand that is dual voltage air brush with a 1\\&quot; plastic tooth barrel????</li>
            <li> Love this dyer. Works very well. For easier rotation of unlocking function of attachments, wrap the unlocking ring with a wide rubber band.</li>
            <li> I have course hair and using this makes it silky smooth with big waves. Do not use on wet hair, otherwise it will take forever. Only use on damp hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best!  It gave my hair beautiful loose waves.  I can use it with damp hair too. There&#x27;s also 2 sized brushes.  Definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been using this hair dryer since about 2001. I have thick wavy long hair and this is the only hair dryer I can use to tame it. The 1.5&amp;#34; brush has rigid nylon bristles. This allows one to dry the hair while pulling it straight and curling the ends. I partially dry the hair with a towel first.I would not recommend it for fine hair. It takes a good 20 minutes to dry the hair but it leaves my hair shiny, bouncy, curled at the end beautifully and straight. These 2 in 1s  last me a good four or five years before they die and I always keep one or two spare ones available. When  I travel internationally , I use a coin to change the voltage setting to 250 and I  use a Wanpro dual voltage power strip with the proper wallplug, using the power strip for my phone, and other dual voltage electronics ( separately ) I find that the power steps down a bit ,but it&#x27;s adequate to properly dry my hair, taking a bit longer. Amazon has the best price and I am grateful that Amazon keeps this in stock.</li>
            <li> I like the way this works and the heat level seems fine to me. My mirror is a bit further away from the mirror that the cord likes to let me go, but other than cord length, this is a decent product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have been using this for years.  My hair is slightly thick and curly.  It styles my hair very nice and  makes it manageable.  Highly recommend this for people with coarse hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this just a few weeks ago after my old air brush died.  This one just doesn&#x27;t have enough power.  It doesn&#x27;t blow hard enough or get hot enough for my thick, coarse hair.</li>
            <li> great gift and good price</li>
            <li> Very good curling iron, does not tangle your hair (eventhough) I have baby fine hair....and certainly gives it a boost without the old fashioned curlers...</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this same item. I purchased it when it was first out on the market and after many years of satisfaction with this dryer/styler it was lost along with my luggage on a cross-country flight.  I waited in hopes that I would at least get some of my belongings back...but to no avail. Truth be told...I missed my dryer more than anything else I lost. So, as with so many items I cannot find in stores, I turned to Amazon, and they didn&#x27;t dissapoint me! Found the item...priced fairly, and ordered it immediately! It arrived promptly, in great shape...and now, unlike the airlines, Amazon was able to replace part of my morning ritual. Some have reviewed it as being to passive in its drying...and I would agree. It is best used to style semi-dry hair. If youre in a hurry, use this item in tandem with a hand held dryer...I just let my hair dry a bit before using it. For me, it straightens my unruly wavy hair in a flash and smooths it nicely. It gives my hair volume and shine without alot of production, and without having to use 2 hands to style (I&#x27;ve yet to master the round brush and hand held dryer mystery) Anyway, for me it is an essential part of my morning ritual...and I am glad to have it back!!</li>
            <li> love it, great service</li>
            <li> Would have given a 5 if the package had not been previously opened and taped back together; however, obviously never used and works perfectly. I love this hot air styler and bought this extra one in case my other burns out.</li>
            <li> Too large to work on short hair. The needles are very sharp and they hurt your head when using.</li>
            <li> I got so lucky and found this on sale! Yay! I have used this for years now, but I have had to buy new ones quite often, as I think when you use them every day they just maybe get over heated or hair spray clogs them up or something. I&#x27;m not really sure. But I do know I love it and use it all the time! I am horrible with a blow dryer and curling brush I just can&#x27;t figure it out! Lol&lt;br /&gt;But this thing saves the day!!! I have short hair now and it&#x27;s great but I&#x27;ve also used it with shoulder length or longer hair and the trick is, blow dry your hair almost dry first then use this to finish it off. Otherwidse it will take forever to dry a whole head.</li>
            <li> I really like this hot air brush - it takes awhile to blow dry my thick wavy hair but I love that I can use it one-handed and use the other hand to turn book pages or whatever. I get really frustrated trying to handle a round brush and a hair dryer so this one meets my needs. On the other hand, as others have mentioned, there seem to be some electrical problems with the product and I&#x27;ve gone through two of them. The first time the dryer slowly died and this time it just suddenly stopped working. Very frustrating. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again and am on the lookout for a comparable product but of better quality.</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Does the job in no time flat.  One thing....If you have very short hair, the smaller barrel won&#x27;t even go around the hair.  Other than that, it was a great buy for the money.  (Shipping was a bit slow).</li>
            <li> This curling combo is simple, easy to use, does a great job in very little time.  I let my hair get nearly dry naturally, then use a little mousse along with this Conair.  My flyaway, somewhat thin hair looks fuller, smoother, shinier...and stays that way.  I just bought a second one for back-up, no problem, given the bargain price!!!</li>
            <li> I have only used the hair styler in the US so far. I like the thicker attachment that has short plastic teeth for styling my hair. It works well on the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting.  I am planning on taking it on a trip to Europe soon where the dryer will only run on the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting at 240 volts.  I am not sure if it will be as effective at drying and styling my hair on low, but it is the least expensive dual voltage dryer/styler that I could find, so I am giving it a try.</li>
            <li> There are only 2 settings (Hi and Lo), and the power is very weak.  the brush can&#x27;t hold my thick hair, so it just feels like the thing is slipping around.  i&#x27;m really not very impressed, and will probably never use it again.  also, this item was much cheaper at my local drugstore.</li>
            <li> I really like this and use it almost every day.  The bristle tips are very sharp to start with but do dull over time and with use.</li>
            <li> Unless you have three hands, this is the best product you can use for styling hair. My hair is long and curly and the \\&quot;comb-like\\&quot; strips grip it well. I can smooth out the curls or roll my hair around like a curling iron. The heat is much gentler. This dryer can be used on totally wet hair, but it would take a long time to dry it. I use it on damp (or dry) hair to finish off the style.</li>
            <li> I was getting ready for a trip to Europe and I really needed a dual voltage hair curler.  So I found this on Amazon, and ordered it. I contacted the merchant to deliver it asap in time for my flight,   and it was delivered within two days.  I have not tried the appliance on my hair yet, since I have braids now, but I tested with the 250 voltage, and it works.  Except you can only use the Low heat/speed button with 250v setting.  But I am very eager to use it soon to see how good it will work for me.</li>
            <li> I really liked the results I got from this iron. However, after about 4 months the connector that you twist to lock the barrels in place no longer worked. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Another great styling tool.  I had to part with my old one and felt lucky to find this one on Amazon.  It is wonderful.</li>
            <li> This is a great brush air dryer.  It works well.  Glad I found it on Amazon, cause I couldn&#x27;t find one in the stores.</li>
            <li> This is not a replacement for a curling iron or steam curlers. I have stick straight hair with a mind of its own and hoped this would add curls to my hair, which it didn&#x27;t. However, it did allow me to shape my hair. Instead of having some hair naturally curling under and some hair naturally curing outward, I was able to get a consisent shape so it looks neat and styled.</li>
            <li> I have owned 4 of these in the last 8 years...I love it!! I have naturally wavy hair and is a pain to sraighten with just a dryer: So, I dry it and straighten with this iron...It works like magic...I take it with me everywhere, it has become just as important as my blow-dryer. Dont leave home without it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my Freida hot airbrush, with its one and a half inch brush, is not dual voltage. I wanted a back-up unit that was.    It seems to be quieter than my Freida but also seemed to dispense less heat on both settings and especially the lower one. This unit&#x27;s one and a half inch attachment also does not have brush bristles but short hard protrusions that I find uncomfortable. However, to my surprise the smaller attachment with brush bristles still allowed me to achieve volume and straighten my wavy fine hair (with this unit, I switched to the higher setting). So it will be quite acceptable when I travel in this country.    From what I understand, the 250V setting (probably locked on Low) will put out as much heat as the 120V does on the higher setting so I think it should work for people like me traveling in the UK too.</li>
            <li> I have owned this for years, I am on my second one because I wore the first one out although they last for years. My hair tends to wave in the back when I don&#x27;t want it to and this really helps to undo that. It makes my hair sleek but if you do want some wave you can do that too by styling it a different way. Easy to use and with the brush attachment you do not burn your neck when trying to get the very ends. I highly recommend this, I use it just about everyday, and my hair isn&#x27;t burnt.</li>
            <li> Got it today, plugged it in, styled my hair super quick! Very easy to use. Extremely satisfied. - Mrs. Steven Kellogg :)</li>
            <li> I use a hot air brush daily for styling and needed one for a recent trip overseas knowing that even with adapters/converters, hairdryers usually just burn out.  So I started the search for one with European voltage or dual voltage.  And found this one on Amazon and thought my problem was solved.  When I got it, the instructions said ONLY use it on low setting when the voltage was set for 220v.... Nowhere in the description did it say it was limited on the dual voltage setting.  It worked okay, just took longer.  I just wished that there would have been full disclosure in the item description.</li>
            <li> My wife had high expectations after going through the reviews for this product. She insisted on getting this product ordered through amazon and if i remember clearly, i did warn her before finally ordering it for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outcome has been disappointing for us. She probably used this machine for some 3-4 times before finally giving up and later on getting another similar product from the store which has come out good and effective for her.&lt;br /&gt;Feeling low and repenting my decision of buying this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased.  My first one died (RIP) after several years of regular use.  If you have fine, straight hair like me and you want that perfect bob or you just want to add a whole-lotta volume to your layers, this is the gadget for you!  Just make sure you have dried your hair almost completely with the blow dryer prior to use as this doesn&#x27;t really work on super wet hair.  The barrel is fairly large and isn&#x27;t really the thing for short hair, either.  I generally use the brush attachment.  In fact, I don&#x27;t even know where the iron attachment is at the moment.  No more messing with boar bristle brushes while you&#x27;re trying to blow dry!  (My arms are sore just thinking about that!)  Just let it be messy while you dry, then fix it all up with the Hot Air Curling Combo.  Use a little mousse or gel and brush your hair out once prior to blow drying.  You don&#x27;t want to have to deal with huge snarls while you&#x27;re using this thinger-bobber.</li>
            <li> Broke my original one I&#x27;ve had for yrs. &amp; yrs. It&#x27;s Wondereful with the size of the brush and ease of use</li>
            <li> I was looking for something... anything... that would work on my thick, course and unruly hair, that I&#x27;ve fought with all my life.  I found this at such a great price on Amazon... over half or less than anywhere else... and it was a name brand as well.  For such a small amount of money, I was definitely willing to take a chance.  When I first turned it on, I thought that it didn&#x27;t have anywhere near enough power to dry and style my hair from a dampened state, but I was very pleased to be very wrong!  No more fighting with a round brush in one hand, while wielding a heavy hair dryer in the other hand.  I will tell you that you do need a great haircut, in order to achieve your desired results.  This appliance is wonderful, but it&#x27;s not a miracle worker.  Find a fantastic stylist and get your hair shaped in a way that you can work with it at home, using this item.  If it worked for me, it will work for anyone.  God Bless you Conair!!!</li>
            <li> I like the hot brushes with the hard bristle verses the brush-like bristles and have had a hard time finding them...so when I found this one, I purchased two of them so that I would have a back-up.  The first one broke within the 1st week.  The little screw holding the gold metal plates to the bottom ring of the brush attachment popped out causing the top piece to fall completely apart. Upon examination, I noted that the piece that the little screw went into to hold the brush to the ring attachment had broken.  I chalked it up to just plain bad luck and began to use the 2nd one that I had purchased.  Today, the screw fell out of the second one - same place as the first one and again, the little piece of black plastic that the screw fit into was broken.  I bought both of these at a drugstore while we were on vacation (out of state) 5 weeks ago.  A complete waste of money!  My last hot brush (by a different company)had lasted 10 plus years.  I guess they don&#x27;t make them like they used to!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews of others and was happy about making the purchase. However, I do not know what kind of hair everyone else has but it does not work. Also, it takes a long time to even get it dry and to a point of trying to curl or straighten. Do not buy...not even worth the price.</li>
            <li> This was my first product of the kind. I loved the way this brush made my hair look! I have long, thick, curly hair but not ethnic and have always wanted a straighter style. Gave up on completely straight years ago. This makes my hair look great. It is still wavy but with less volume (as my hair gets big on its own), it actually reminds me of a models&#x27; hair for a shampoo commercial. Luxurious, shiny, smooth. Well, that is great except the thing only lasted 3 months. Two days after the last use, it just wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I tossed it, irritated and searched for a different brand. Well, I just bought a Vidal Sassoon and it does not do a good job on my type of hair at all, it tangles easily and whenever I turn it off for a minute (to untangle my hair) it stops working for about 8 minutes. Needless to say, I can&#x27;t stand it and am not sure what to get next...</li>
            <li> This  is the fourth or fifth replacement of this item as it is perfect for my hairstyle needs.  Please don&#x27;t discontinue it, EVER!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other conair products that I have liked and I am disappointed with this one.  Poor quality, one attachment cracked after the first use.  This product does not work well on fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product but when I turn it on, it smells like mildew.  It must be either old or was stored improperly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t STAND stick-straight hair.  I prefer my hair to have a little volume, movement, bounce, and shine.  Flat irons do just what they say - make it FLAT.  Can&#x27;t stand those.  I have naturally curly hair.  But, it isn&#x27;t so curly that I can&#x27;t straighten it now and then.  When I do, I use a Conair Ion-Shine 1875 blow dryer with a Bio Ionic Extra Large round brush.  I have to say, the brush DOES make a difference.  The the best finishing touch is this Conair Hot Air Curling brush.  It, seriously, smooths the cuticle, making my hair much shinier and smoother but with a flip at the bottom (over or under - whichever you prefer).  I use the bigger size of the two brushes.  The small one doesn&#x27;t work as well with my hair (it&#x27;s about 2 or 3 inches past my shoulders).  In order to achieve the shiny results, you have to use this section by section, a little at a time.  Roll it and hold it for 10 seconds.  And make sure you let the hair cool before brushing it.  I don&#x27;t use ANY styling products on my hair when I style it straight because of the Hot Air Brush.  I don&#x27;t NEED them.  So, my hair stays cleaner longer since I&#x27;m not putting \\&quot;goop\\&quot; on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Hot Air Brush for - literally - 15 years.  I simply could NOT do without it.  I must carry a spare at all times just in case the one I&#x27;m using decides to finally poop out.  ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and as a side note: I recommend (1) making sure you give yourself enough time to go through the whole process (don&#x27;t rush) and (2) start with the TOP of your hair, NOT the BOTTOM.  Whenever I go to a salon, they ALWAYS dry my hair starting from the bottom and working their way UP to the top.  I find that, if I do it that way, I always end up with \\&quot;kinks\\&quot; in my hair (same thing happens at the salon) and my hair ends up flat.  If I style it from the top down, I never have that problem.  I do one side at a time, working my way from top to bottom; flipping the hair over each time I straighten a portion.  After I&#x27;ve done both sides, I do the back the same way.des, I do the back the same way.</li>
            <li> It works as expected, but dies suddenly. I have had this item for exactly a year and i am now looking for a replacement.  The previous one I bought also lasted about a year. If you don&#x27;t mind buying a replacement every year, it is a great product for extra curly and difficult to style hair. I use it on wet and on dry hair and works defrizzes and styles nicely.</li>
            <li> This product works well, but I suggest purchasing a spare, as there is no warning when it decides to stop working!</li>
            <li> I had one of these exact dryers for years and broke it.  Had been looking everywhere for one, and so glad Amazon had it!  Makes my curly, frizzy hair manageable!</li>
            <li> This curling iron \\&quot;hot air styler\\&quot; worked fine for 8 months and then died. It is not the ground fault protector-- the reset clicks.  The thing just doesn&#x27;t go.  Worked fine when turned off yesterday, but today I plug it in and nothing happens.  This is the third one I have had.  Will see how the 12 mo guarantee works....</li>
            <li> I had one of these and loved it. I got a new one as a \\&quot;back up\\&quot;. I ended up giving my old one to my sister. When I went to use the new one it popped and fizzled and smoke came out of it. I wanted to return it but it only is returnable for 30 days. SO disappointing!</li>
            <li> Price is right!  Has worked well for me for years. Trouble getting the brush attachment locked into place, so it falls out periodically, but this is still a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used a Conair Hot Air Styling Brush for quite a few years and it&#x27;s really my go-to hair styling tool. After my last one fell apart, literally, after probably four years of daily use, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to get another one from Amazon. I had it exactly ONE MONTH - April 14, the exact day my 30-day return window expired - and the lever sliding piece that selects the power  just stopped working. I could not push it up to turn it on - like the lever was frozen in place. Call me kooky, but I am going to order another, since I really love the way it makes my hair look, and hope that my bad experience won&#x27;t happen twice in a row. Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> This is a great find.  I have long, poker straight hair and I bought this to replace a low quality travel hairdryer which I was using before.  I eventually realized that the hairdryer I was using was making my hair very frizzy... well, with this brush my hair dries lovely and smooth!  What a revelation! I love the fact that I can use it on both dry and wet hair, and that it is dual voltage so I can use it when I travel. It also feels a whole lot less damaging than straightening/curling irons.  I haven&#x27;t tried curling with it yet, but I would imagine it will create lovely loose curls.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this curling iron.  I have used other curling products from Conair in the past but this is by far the best for my short-medium hair.  It heats up fast and create soft curls with lots of volume.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that is cut into a (just below) chin length bob.  What I wanted (I had high hopes): (1)a time saver, (2)give my hair some lift &amp; shape and (3) provide the same polished (smooth) look from ironing it. I usually blow dry my hair and then use a straightening iron.    Pros: My hair does not get tangled in it (reviews below are correct)even when I roll it around the core.   Cons: (1) Even with fine hair I can&#x27;t use this to \\&quot;dry\\&quot; my hair, it works best on partially dried hair - takes me more time than blow-drying and ironing combined. Not a time saver.   (2) Style disaster. It will take me a lot of practice to get it right. My hair is coming out very flat and mis-shapened. Kind of looks like I let a first-grader do my hair.  (3)It&#x27;s almost polished (smooth) looking about 10 minutes after using the tool.    Conclusion: I&#x27;ll give it a few more tries to see if I get better style results, but I am considering sending it back.  It&#x27;s certainly not going to replace blow drying and ironing as I had hoped.  I&#x27;m sure if you are patient and talented you could get better results than me.</li>
            <li> the multifunction blower does the job, super fast heating, the fan works well and is easy to use. my wife is delighted with the product.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of a Conair Hot Air Curling Combo and I&#x27;m surprised that the dryer on this one is so weak compared to my previous purchase.  I love the large barrel which is perfect for my long hair but I have to use a blow dryer first if I don&#x27;t want to spend 45 minutes drying my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these for years, and was afraid when I couldn&#x27;t find a new one at the my local stores. They are the best for out of control, frizzy, curly hair. They are also so easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have had several different hot air brushes and each developed overheating problems from a few weeks to a few months after purchase.  The Conair is undoubtedly the worst of the lot.  It didn&#x27;t overheat; it burned out after 3 days.  Even had it continued working, I was prepared to tuck it into a bottom drawer as it had so little air power that my hair had to be almost dry before use.  I considered sending it back to Conair but you have to send them $7.50 for their return postage.  That charge on top of my own postage charges makes their warranty worthless.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to replace a Conair Hot Curling unit that was probably 10 years old. Let me be clear that the reason that the old product lasted so long was that I rarely used it until about a year or two ago-mainly because I wasn&#x27;t using it properly and my hair was longer and styled differently.     My hair is now just shoulder length, in lots of layers. My hair is very fine and if left to air dry will have some natural waves to it. It is color treated and very \\&quot;fly away\\&quot;.    I use this product as follows: After towel drying hair, I always use a leave-in product (I have used very expensive variations and I am happy to report that my favorite it currently a bargain, Loreal EverPure Smooth Frizz-Free Serum). Then I dry my hair on the lowest heat setting (yes, it takes a little longer but it makes a big difference) with my regular hair dryer and a round boar bristle brush. Important: do not dry completely-ends should be dry but hair should still feel very slightly damp near your scalp. I really do not style my hair at all at this stage with the brush it&#x27;s just that the boar bristles will mimimize breakage while creating lift when brushing the roots up and away from the scalp.     Now I am ready for the Conair 1.5. I like the barrel with the shorter bristles, it seems to work better with fine hair. THIS product will NOT make your hair curly NOR do you want to try and dry your hair with it. This product will give you volume and smoothness with ends curled under or up. I use only the high heat setting because it is not very hot. Again, my hair is just shoulder length, so I just brush a section of hair from the roots to the ends and roll it half to two thirds the way up, hold it for ten seconds and unroll. I don&#x27;t \\&quot;pull the brush\\&quot; through.    If you want a very smooth look, after finishing each section, lightly brush and use a light hair spray. If you want a more \\&quot;unkempt\\&quot; effect, after styling each section, allow hair to cool and style with your fingers, then spray. If you want curlier hair, keep your hair dryer handy. After the \\&quot;10 second curl\\&quot; turn the Conair off while your hair is still \\&quot;rolled up\\&quot; and blow cool air directly onto the barrel from your dryer for a few seconds until hair is cooled then unroll.    I also purchased the Conair BC171CS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush 1.25 [[ASIN:B0009PVV40 Conair BC171CS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush, Black, 1.25 Inch]] inch at the same time I purchased this one. As I mentioned, my product that died was very old and I wasn&#x27;t sure which one would work best for me so I just went for both of them.     I do not like 1.25 inch for myself nearly as much because: It seems to get too hot, even on the lower setting. My hair is color treated and too fine for this much heat. If you try it, you may want your hair more damp. I also do not like the size of the barrel. I have small hands and it is very unwieldy. It will \\&quot;curl\\&quot; your hair to a greater degree and may work well for certain hair types. I did not send it back but would recommend with caution.    When making this purchase on Amazon, I noted that one reviewer raved about the difference in the \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; feature. I noticed zero differnce, perhaps because the higher heat of this unit cancelled out any \\&quot;ionic\\&quot; benefit for my hair type. If I had it to do over, I would have ordered two of the 1.5 and saved one of them until the one I am currently using dies. I love it and highly recommend for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I like this hot air brush.  I have used the Helen of Troy version of this for several years and based on reviews decided to try this one.  I like the Conair a little better because it doesn&#x27;t overheat as easily; I can turn if off and on a lot when I&#x27;m styling.    I have a lot of medium length fine wavy hair that needs to be straightened and I use this air brush and a 4\\&quot; round brush to keep my hair from laying flat on my scalp.  I dry from the nape to the top and then use the air brush to flip the ends up or under and the brush makes it easy to control.  It looks smooth and bouncy and lasts 2 days.</li>
            <li> Great styling brush.  Heats quickly and easy to use. Very sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have aways relied on Conair products.  They are durable and long lasting.  I have used this particular product for many, many years.  As old as it was the on/off switch finally gave out, but not the styler.  I had to plug and unplug when in use.  Then the dreaded day came and finally my styler quit.  It was so old that I thought I would never be able to replace this wonderful product!!!  I took a shot and looked online.  I was so excted to find it on the Amazon website.  Purchased it and am good to go for many more years to come.  Thanks Conair for such a great product and thanks to Amazon for such a reasonable price!!</li>
            <li> Awesome I love it Please do not stop making them!!!!I have had at least 6 of them !!!!</li>
            <li> I have used this dryer for many years and love it. I have shoulder length hair or longer, and it has some curl and frizz. I use this dryer brush after my hair is about half dry or almost dry. I barely have to do anything other than use this dryer, as it blow dries my hair into a great style, with ends curled somewhat under. Usually I do a quick touch up with the curling iron, but most of the job is already done with just this dryer. I especially like it because I am not coordinated enough to hold a brush in one hand and a dryer in another! My dryer is quite a few years old and is still running. But I panicked today and realized I&#x27;d be lost if it finally broke down, and searched for some backups to buy. Didn&#x27;t see any in the drugstore, so thankful to find this Website. I&#x27;m about to order two more to keep on hand \\&quot;just in case.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This product is not at all good for short hair.  The barrel is huge!  I know the description gives the 1-1/2\\&quot; measurement but nowhere does it say anything about hair length recommendations.  I have to wrap my hair around half the brush and hold it there with my hand (hot!) because it doesn&#x27;t even begin to wrap enough to stay on there.  Slightly better luck with the curling iron attachment.  This will be a fine product if you have at least shoulder length hair.  Otherwise, look elsewhere.  Now I am hoping mine burns up so I can return it at Amazon&#x27;s expense instead of mine.</li>
            <li> Would have liked another speed choice. Only has high and low.  Also, wish it had a stiffer brush. Does do the job though.</li>
            <li> The whole reason I bought this item is because I spend half my time in London and half my time in Austin, and the product description claims the dual voltage makes it usable worldwide. I used it for two weeks in the States and it was fine. Once in the UK, I had to use a coin to turn the &#x27;switch&#x27; to 250, which is pretty ridiculous, and which took way too much effort, as it was stuck. Once turned on, the tool lasted about one minute before it went dead. Now I&#x27;m back in the States, and the curler is in the trash as it no longer works here either. Money down the drain.</li>
            <li> I love this. I&#x27;m so so happy. On time</li>
            <li> I am using this brush in Southamerica and it works perfect,  it is dual voltage.  I Only use the big brush,  the small one is too flexible so it dos not work on my heavy hair.  I hace a perfect hair style in minutes.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to take on a trip so that I could leave some more expensive hair styling items at home.  I was so happy with the results, I have continued to use this product at home as well.  It&#x27;s a quick and easy way to dry and style at the same time and I&#x27;m so glad that I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Works Great!  I love it!</li>
            <li> A very good buy - nothing fancy but helps achieve style faster. Use it almost daily to smooth my hair out! Can&#x27;t go wrong with it for such a good price!</li>
            <li> I bought my first Conair Hot Air Brush 15 years ago and I haven&#x27;t been without one since.  My old one finally died recently, so I bought another. If you have curly or frizzy hair, these are fantastic for smoothing and giving a nice shape/style. More body than using just a flat iron.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my hot air curling brush and although it is a simple design it is a great product.  It was cheaper ordering through Amazon with the free shipping then I would have paid to purchase it locally.  My old brush had more options on it, but all I want is to dry my hair, and this one is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding these in the stores and was glad to see I could get them online.  Flat irons damage your hair, but this is much better as it is simply hot air that does not damage your hair.  I have medium fine hair and this one gives me the the lift I need as the teeth help separate my hair.  Love, love, love this appliance.  I hope they never discontinue this.  I wished the large toothed hair curlers would come back out.  If you need some volume and lift in your hair, big teeth/spiked appliances are the best!  Give this one a try...it&#x27;s cheeper than anything else out there.</li>
            <li> I had one just like this that I had been using for years that quit. I checked several local stores to find a new one with no luck. I decided to check Amazon to see if I could find one like it there, and sure enough, they had the exact same one I had been using. I was thrilled! I ordered it and had my new one in just five days. I love Amazon. I can always find what I am looking for at great prices and no shipping charges. I&#x27;m hooked on Amazon! With gas prices what they are now why waste time and fuel driving all hunting for an item. I will not do that again. Next time I will check Amazon first and save time and fuel.</li>
            <li> This is great product, so sad I can&#x27;t find it in the store.Working greate, good temperature ,I like to use it.</li>
            <li> It is just an okay product!!! It doesn&#x27;t get your hair very straight and takes longer to dry...it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> Bought this curling iron years ago and loved it, but when I had to replace it it was horrible! I used it one time and the tip broke and fell off... Very cheaply made...Will never purchase it again...</li>
            <li> This Conair product is not worth the money. I previously owned a Conair Hot Air Curling Iron that worked great, this is a completely different design and it fails miserably.  It barely curls your hair because the bristles are all hard plastic &amp; the hair has nothing to grab on to. The previous model had rows of the flexible bristles &amp; rows of the hard plastic bristles. It also doesn&#x27;t get very hot, so if you are going to use it to dry your hair, you should look for a different product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do the job at all.</li>
            <li> All other styling brushes I&#x27;ve used do not do as good a job on my hair. My hair is fine and fairly short. Had one for years and after it died could not find one anywhere. Until checking Amazon. So happy I found it. Arrived in plain cardboard box. At this price, I should have bought two.</li>
            <li> Smells musty every time I turn it on</li>
            <li> I recently experimented with this product while visiting my mom.  I have shoulder length, layered hair that is fine with some wave to it.  I work full time and can&#x27;t get away without styling it everyday.  However, I have two kids and prefer to spend as little time on my hair in the mornings as possible.  I usually blow dry it and then flat iron it for a more finished look and to eliminate the frizz that inevitably accompanies the blow drying.  The Conair 2-in-1 is a MIRACLE product.  My hair is finished in less time and is definitely less damaged by this product.  I love the use of hot air because it is so less damaging.  The curl is just the right amount to style my layers and it lasts all day without losing its shape.  I wish someone would have turned me on to this product years ago!  I love it!</li>
            <li> The product is good, just not what I was looking for. It makes blow drying and detangling your hair at one time convenient. I was looking more for a hot curling brush that will straighten my hair. This is really a good tool for blow drying hair and not straightening or curling hair. I have natural thick wavy hair and I was unable to curl my hair with this curling brush. The brush itself doesn&#x27;t get really hot and blows out hot air like a hand held blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling brush to replace an almost identical model (only difference I could see was color) that I used and loved for a few years. Unfortunately, this model does not heat up enough to create the curl and body my old Conair hot brush did so well. I have normal, straight, medium-thick hair which \\&quot;takes\\&quot; curl easily. This is a disappointing product since I have always used Conair curling brushes and irons in the past.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t curl, but it will create a wave at ends. It doesn&#x27;t blow dry quickly because high speed is equal to the lowest speed on a normal blowdryer. I&#x27;m not in love with it but it will work for occasional use, otherwise I would be really annoyed.</li>
            <li> This product is like a toy. After using it twice, the switch broke. You couldn&#x27;t turn from high to low to off. Once you plug the thing in, it just starts blowing in one mode.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because it was the only hot air brush I could find that was dual voltage. The first odd thing is that you have to manually switch for voltage.  That is annoying, but not the real problem.  Having used this at both voltages, I was very disappointed that it has low power at either voltage and blows almost no air.  It takes a very long time to dry your hair with this product.  At the 220 setting the switch won&#x27;t even go to \\&quot;high\\&quot;, but is blocked somehow so that it can only be used at the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting.  I will continue to look for this type of product that has dual voltage and replace this as soon as I find something else.  Finally, this is a large and heavy hair dryer that takes up a lot of room when you are trying to pack light.</li>
            <li> I used this product at least 5X/week for 2 years and was very happy with it. Then in November it quit. It took me 2 weeks looking in local stores before I finally found the same product...online at Amazon and so I ordered it. I rec&#x27;d it right away, but it didn&#x27;t work. The heat and air stopped as soon as I moved the device to work with my hair. I returned it and got a replacement within 2-6 days. The second one worked, but was clumsy to use and my hair frequently got caught in the open/lock connector for changing the barrels. I was not happy. Then I found a small piece of black plastic ring on my counter top. I took the barrel off, checked both sides and both barrel brushes but couldn&#x27;t find a broken edge. When I tried to use it again, my hair got caught in it again. When I released the lock to get my hair out, the brushes fell out of the slotted barrel. The broken piece came from a ring further up on the inside of the barrel, and with it gone, the bristles can&#x27;t be held in place. It is still a Conair product, it looks like the one I used for 2 years, but it isn&#x27;t the same. It is cheaply made and completely dissatisfactory. I suspect that the product is now manufactured \\&quot;offshore\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad Conair still makes this item. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and other sizes, but this one is perfect for mid length, fine hair and the options of 2 sizes allow you to style hair in various ways.</li>
            <li> If I could give this product 0 I would.  I have owned an older one of this same style model brand for about 7 years.  If finally died.  I loved that one, it worked so well.  I was so glad to see the same model just a different color, still available.  Well it is not the same.  It will not heat up as much as my old one did.  Then there is the fact that the brush attachment which you can switch out for the smaller barrel,  it is suppose to lock in place- it does not, so without it locked in, it continually falls off!!  It felt lighter and cheaper right out of the box.  And it IS.  To sum it up, don&#x27;t waste your money.  No other hot air curling/styling brush like this model unfortunately.  I like that it has teeth as opposed to bristles because it slides through the hair much smoother and easier.  But I had to go to the store and settle for a smaller version with bristles, just to have something to use.  HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Also, it came in a plain white box with one word Conair.  Kind of weird???  That is not how they are packaged in any store.</li>
            <li> This is a recent purchase to replace the older version who met its demise after almost 20 years of daily use.  Took it on a trip to China (220v) and the dual voltage feature worked very well.</li>
            <li> Hot Air Styling Brush does not have much power and so the stream of air that comes out is very low even when set on high.</li>
            <li> the item pictured is white with pink attachments. I received a black curling combo with gold attachments. Other than that it works fine. The grip is kind of large so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for people with small hands.</li>
            <li> Another hair appliance in the trash! The larger, hard plastic attachment hurts my scalp. I have short, wiry and frizzy hair and it&#x27;s not hot enough for straightening (300 watts). The smaller brush attachment won&#x27;t penetrate/grab my frizz, and I like larger curls anyway.</li>
            <li> I really like this item,its the only thing that works well for my hair. The only problem is I&#x27;ve gone through several of them over the years. They don&amp;#34;t seem to last all that long for me.</li>
            <li> I just turned it on. The switch stopped working and now I can&#x27;t turn it off... Good product but I guess I have bad luck, this is the first time It&#x27;s happened to me. :(</li>
            <li> It smooths out my hair &amp; also adds body to it as well.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it &amp; it makes fixing your hair fast &amp; gives it body at the same time.</li>
            <li> The top plastic end piece broke off the first time it was used.  Obviously it is very cheap construction.  Avoid.</li>
            <li> My husband purchased this for me through Amazon Prime for a trip to England and Spain. I have several hot air brushes by Conair that are great products, but don&#x27;t have dual voltage.  I purchased this one because it had the dual voltage.  After switching the voltage from 110 to 220 while in Europe, I used the hot hair brush for about 3 minutes before it overheated.  I let it cool and tried it again the following day. It lasted 2 minutes before overheating and then died. I was unable to use it even when tried several days later.  Very disappointing.  Cannot comment on using this in the USA, but would definitely not purchase for use in Europe.</li>
            <li> I love my hair dryer/smoother - use it almost daily. I &amp;#34;fried&amp;#34; my old one several months ago by using it incorrectly in South America on the last day of my trip, but ordered a new one as soon as I returned home!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and coarse, so it is extremely straight and difficult to curl or style with a &#x27;regular&#x27; curling iron (even at the highest settings!) I thought I would have to have perms for the rest of my life until I found this product. I primarily use the iron attachment to curl the ends of my hair in or out; I also use it towards the base of my head to give my hair volume when I want it. Works great with short or long hair, and with a little styling product (gel or mousse) the style stays even longer. I love how the heat is quick, so is cool down. The product is easy to take on a trip, works great. Won&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite for at least three years. Using not too hot air, and not hot metal, this does it all.  After you hair is almost dry, brush through for a sleek look, or give it a turn for body and curl.  All of the others I&#x27;v tried are too hot and tangled my hair.  I was so happy to find the same appliance after breaking mine, I bought three back-ups.  Try it, you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> I have had one of these since they came out. Well actually, 2.  Long life for a brush/hairdryer combo.  I have fine hair and with a bit of gel ... Amazing body.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Works great. A little noisy but works wonders on my long, thick, wavy hair. Also used it on my two nieces (4yr, 7yrs) they both felt like barbies afterwards</li>
            <li> I had the old purple conair model that I had for years....one day it died....I use it everyday so I was in a panick....Thank-god I found the next generation on here...It&#x27;s the same just a different color and I love it!! It makes my hair so straight and lots of volume. I would recommend this to anyone!!!!</li>
            <li> had one of these for about 5 years until it broke, this one is even better.</li>
            <li> Got it for the wife after she tried several hair dryers, some at 5 times the price.  This one was the one.</li>
            <li> I really like the styling brush. It works great on mostly dried hair so you&#x27;re not applying too much heat to your hair. It&#x27;ll curl to some extent (depending on hair type of course) and I like the bigger style since I have longer hair. Very pleased with this product especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Great for taming curly hair</li>
            <li> I have had one of these for yrs. I love it. I need to get another.It is easy to use!!!</li>
            <li> I have medium-short fine straight hair.  The barrel on this device is huge!  I get faster and better results by blow-drying then using a curlng iron. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The device itself seems to work fine - and the results are kinda a big puffy effect, but not really curled on my hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like the review of the person who said she was a multi-tasker.  IF I was sitting doing something else while doing my hair this might be the right device, but I do mine while standing in the bathroom and always while in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This is a great styler and I use it EVERY morning.  Problem is they do burn out quickly.  I have to order another because it seemed like the one I have is weakening as of this morning.  That&#x27;s how it starts, sounds like it is running out of power and gets weak, then burns out all together.  I see that the last one I ordered was in March 2006, just two months ago!  It works great like I said, but I can&#x27;t be buying a new one every two months.  The previous one lasted longer, but not a whole year.  I will need to look elsewhere and get a product that has lasting power!</li>
            <li> great product everyone should have one I just love love how my hair looks after using   conair hot air curing.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed in this hot air curler.  I have fairly short hair so I tried to use the smaller attachment, the 1\\&quot; bristle brush, but the bristles are so stiff that after you windup the hair in a curl the hair gets stuck on the bristles and you can&#x27;t get the brush out without pulling it straight out, which pulls the curl out!  I tried the larger 1.5\\&quot; brush attachment brush attachment which has smooth plastic bristles and with that the hair will slide out well, but it is too big to wind up short hair.  I had trouble finding a dual voltage hot air curler to take on trips overseas so thought this would be perfect, but it doesn&#x27;t work at all for me.  I ended up going out and buying another hot air curler that has only one voltage that at least I can use here in the USA.  I would have retuned this one I bought through Amazon but I did not have the original packaging, which they said was required to return it (obviously this was used by Mrs. ).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve returned this item (twice) as it did not work properly.  When you use it and move your wrist, even slightly (so the cord twirls, as it&#x27;s supposed to), the unit stops working.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about 10 years ago and used it almost daily.  As with most electronics, it eventually died.  I searched beauty supply and department stores for a similar product, but found none.  I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon.com!  Nothing works as well as the Conair Combo at taming my thick, wavy hair.  (I use the attachment with \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; rather than the one with the bristles, since the teeth stand up to my hair). Unfortunately, the on/off switch broke the second time I used it.   I read through some of the reviews and found that others have had a similar complaint.  I hope that Conair fixes this problem, as the curler is great otherwise.  I will purchase another one and hope to have better luck with it.</li>
            <li> Worked well for a month.  Bought this in June, the HI/LO/OFF switch is now stuck on HI.  It becomes a one speed curler that will only turn off when it is unplugged.</li>
            <li> I had a conair hot air curling combo for probably 10 years. It was beginning to wiggle where the brush mets the handle so I ordered another before vacation. I took the new one on vacation thinking this would be better than having the other break. Well this one broke the first time I used it. The handle grip on the end broke off so all the bristles were falling out! Not a happy camper. So I finally found a store with super glue and glued it back on. It held for the week, but who knows how long. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you want easy hair care &amp; volumn this is the product for you. Sent when promised. Easy purchase</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they make this product anymore so when I found it on Amazon I was more than happy. This is the best curling brush out there I sure wish they wouldn&#x27;t stop making them.</li>
            <li> This is fine for touch ups but it doesn&#x27;t blow much air.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t buy it waste of money it did do any thing for me and I have thick hair. I&#x27;m so disappointed</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t blow as hard as an older version I had of this.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly (frizzy) hair.  I just let my hair air dry for about  15 minutes and then use the hot air curling Conair to finish the drying and styling.  My hair is silky and sleek.  I really would recommend this product.  Very good price and very easy and quick for styling.  I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Conair 1-1/2-Inch Hot Air Curling Combo.  Great product, I have usded one about 15 years, it finally burnt out. I found this one and it has 2 brush heards, one smaller than the other.  So easy to use and fast.  CM</li>
            <li> I have owned this particular Conair Hot Curling tool for well over ten years.  Yes, in that time I have had to replace the item a couple of times when they quit working after a few years of use. Currently I own three, one in my house, one at my mother&#x27;s, and I keep one in the car in case I forget to pack the one at home! My hair is medium length, gets a little frizzy when I blow dry it and this item smooths it out.  I have used it when my hair is damp, but normally I blow dry my hair and then style it with this curling brush. I do not go for big curls, but for smoothness and shape.</li>
            <li> This should be a 5 because I love the results. But it broke after 5 months - the place where the top screws into the base simply snapped at the screw. So sad because I agree that the hard bristles work great for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I returned this styler after just a few uses because it gets VERY hot, even on the \\&quot;low\\&quot; setting, and the cord is very short.  I don&#x27;t recommend it as a hair dryer, styler, or anything!  Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair.  I blow dry it until it&#x27;s almost dry and it looks like a frizzy mess.  So I finish it off with the curling brush to smooth and style it.  I have had it for so many years and know it can&#x27;t last forever, so I&#x27;m buying another.  I would hate not to be able to get one when I need it.  It&#x27;s also great for traveling - takes up little space and dual voltage.  A great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a curling iron/hair dryer that went bad after 13yrs, bought this one to replace it but the curls won&#x27;t hold and it does a poor job of drying the hair.</li>
            <li> I did not like this hot air curling brush.  It was too big for me to hold comfortably and the bristles were sharp on my head.  The cord was too short.  I would love to send it back.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful and easy to use. Great for quick touch-ups when you are in a hurry, a real must have!</li>
            <li> I cannot use the hot air curling combo because the power point is American which I stated I live in Australia so it is useless to me</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago and when I tried to find a replacement, I bought a $50 version and hated it.  I returned it when I found my old style Conair hot air combo was still sold through Amazon.  Finally, I can style my hair with ease again!  My hair and I thank you!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife.  She brought it home from the gym in her gym bag and the end tip broke off.  Disappointing to say the least.  I glued it back on instead of returning it.</li>
            <li> Fabulous!  So happy I found this here - can&#x27;t find it locally anymore and mine (exact model as this one) just quit after 5 years - thanks so much for having this still available!</li>
            <li> It is an excellente product, easy to use and with amazing results. I have a long hair and I always have problems let it ok at home. After this brush, IÂ´m feeling good with my hair.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t  read the product details carefully.  The  brush was too large for what I wanted so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for international travel because of the voltage option.  Setting it to European voltage really just meant that the dryer was only available to run on the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting.  It took forever to dry my hair.  Used it back in the states once when I left my trusty Revlon brush behind--even the &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting hardly put out any air.  If you have to have something for international travel, this will work, but not well.  If you want to use it only here in the USA, forget this one and buy one of the Revlon models--they work faster, tangle less, and last longer.</li>
            <li> Ouch! Bristles are almost sharp, and painful on my scalp.  I owned this product before and its bristles were soft and pliable yet provided perfect curl and left my hair with beautiful volume. I almost think this is a knock off.</li>
            <li> Purchased 2 items, one with no problems, second one would not let me lock brush to unit, received a replace item and it also will not let me connect brush to unit. After I gave up trying, it took my husband a while, but he finally got it connected, just can never change the brush on it ever again. . Was told by Amazon this hardly ever happens. Wish I would have read review before ordering.</li>
            <li> Ended up with the infinity pro hot air spin dryer.  I have a short bob.</li>
            <li> I have shorter hair and it is a little hard to use.  Would be great if my hair were a little longer</li>
            <li> I have been using this Hot AIr Curling brushes for 10+years.  Every couple of years - something happens and i have to get a new one.  That is to be expected.  However - this is a critical flow going on right now that makes NO SENSE.  I had to reorder a new brush in early Aug 2013 because the one I had for several years finally stopped working.  I had the new one for 2 weeks and the end just broke off, so the rows of &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; slide out.  I returned this to Amazon (great Customer Service) and they sent a new one.  Now, I have had the replacement items for just over 4 weeks and the SAME THING HAPPENED.  Unfortunately I am outside of my return window so I don&#x27;t know if Amazon will take it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have loved this product for many years.....but Conair needs to look at how this most recent version is being made as it seems to have a critical design/maufacturing flaw in it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t do the whole round brush and hair dryer bit. This is my solution and I love it. I&#x27;m on my third over the course of 15 years.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick, Curly &amp;amp; Frizzy.  When I use this curling brush on my hair it makes my hair smooth, soft and light.  It is the only curling iron I have ever used that made my hair feel like that.  After using it my hair is straight with body. It does a great job.  The only one downside I can think of is that if your hair is extreamly thick it may take a little time to &amp;quot;dry&amp;quot; it totally.  Over all I highly recommend this product to anyone...</li>
            <li> In 2002, I bought the first hairdresser from CONAIR - hair setter. In fact, I fall in love with it, as it was my best friend since then. I didn&#x27;t know that all their hairdressers will give me as rewarding results until I tried this year three of their products, which are CONAIR CHV26IX, CS19JCS and CD 160DRCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair dressing has never been as easy. I&#x27;ve tried many from other brands but none worked with me and gave me salon results as CONAIR, I thought the problem was with my curly hair until I tried CONAIR ones. Their products are life saving!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you CONAIR, you&#x27;ve always been my best friend wherever I go.. : )</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an african american female and my hair comes just about to my shoulders.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!  I wash my hair once a week and after washing it i put some moisturizer on my hair and then use the hot air curling brush.  It really makes my hair soft and adds a lot of volume to my flat hair (after a relaxer).  It works so well on my hair that I don&#x27;t have to get a relaxer every 4-6 weeks, it&#x27;s more like every 3 months now. I was skeptical when my mother told me to use it (she has naturally curly fine hair), now instead of using hers I have one in my household.  I know other african american women are skpetical of this product, but i&#x27;ll tell you it works for us!!!!  It has the same results as going to the dominican dubi shop and getting your hair blown out!!  TRY IT, I KNOW YOU&#x27;LL LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this product.  It saves time on my hair and leaves one hand free to drink coffee or apply makeup.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and there is a lot of it so styling using this would have been awesome if it actually worked. Not a very powerful fan and heater in the brush and actually turned out to be useless for my hair. It took me less time to do it the old way with a brush and hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The 1.5 inch hot air barrel is the feature that keeps me coming back to this item.  I&#x27;ve had trouble when previous models have suddenly stopped working after about one year.  The end knob that holds the combs broke off under the heat within the first few days.  I returned it to Amazon via UPS drop off which was amazingly easy for a full refund.  I&#x27;m still looking for one that will give me the same lift and style.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these Hot Air Curling driers about 15 years ago and one day it quit working so I purchased another one on Amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find the product locally.  Adds body and style to your hair without tangling in the hard bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer brush for a 2 week trip to Europe.  I read the instructions carefully and used it successfully for the first week.  Then it died and nothing would bring it back to life.  Unfortunately, the return window was so short (one month) that I am stuck with this piece of trash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I got a faulty product, but the \\&quot;hot\\&quot; air was not hot. It was lukewarm at best. As such, it did nothing at all to my hair except make it extremely frizzy. No curls or waves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You might have more luck than I with this product. And because Amazon allows you to return this after you&#x27;ve opened it (I&#x27;ve already spoken to a rep and created a return tag), no harm in trying. It&#x27;s just not for me.</li>
            <li> If you have thick hair, this product is not for you.  I was very excited about the other reviews which said they could not do without this combo dryer/styler.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.  First of all, I found it very hard to handle due to the thickness of the handle.  I have short, thick hair, and it was just too large to grasp the hair in the brush.  Then there was the power....or lack thereof.  I have an older model that generates 1000 watts.  This newer version was about 300 watts.  There was almost no blowing/drying power.  It would have taken twenty minutes to dry my hair with this product.  I tried twice to dry and style with it, realized it was never going to work, and returned it.</li>
            <li> This is the third hot air curler I&#x27;ve purchased over 15 years. My preference for styling is the comb attachment. I have very curly hair and it smooths it out great.  So glad I found it online because i went to a well-known department store and they were sold out.</li>
            <li> STOP WORKING AFTER FIRST USE</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace the Conair hot air styling brush that I&#x27;d had for years. My old one finally gave up and had to be discarded. I looked locally and couldn&#x27;t find one like this. This one seems to have less power than my old one but I can&#x27;t be positive. It does the job and I like it best for my own personal use. It has another attachment but I don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is the answer for easy styling.  I am all thumbs  when trying to use a brush and hair dryer. This curling combo makes it so easy and leaves my hair in great condition!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t go anywhere without it.  Styles my hair like a salon and without much effort.  I call it my magic brush.  Actually, this is my second one because I lost my first one.</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to be able to find and purchase this product.  Had an older model that lasted for about 15 years and was afraid I would not be able to replace it.  This one works just as well as the older one - hope it lasts as long.</li>
            <li> I received Hot Air Brush that had been used when it said it was new. It had black hair on the brush and was repackaged and sent to me. I will never order from amazon again.A very dissatisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I had one of these for over 10 years, and it worked great. When it finally broke I was very happy to find this one on line. The first came in and the tip kept falling off , so  the bristles would keep slinding off as well. Returned without any difficulty. Second on has some sort of malfunction. It goes on/off while in use. Seems to be related to the postion of the cord. I am returning that one as well. Hopefully this replacement will work. Otherwise I do love the dryer curler combo.</li>
            <li> I like this hair tool so much I purchased another one to keep in my travel case. It&#x27;s the perfect, easy to use styler for my hair.</li>
            <li> I like this as I can use it on slightly damp hair to style it. It gives me soft curls and waves.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this to replace the last one I owned (same model) as the plastic ring that held the two parts together had cracked. Hoping that this one will last a bit longer!</li>
            <li> The brush broke after a few uses and only 5 months of use. The issue is that the brush piece is separated from the handle and cannot go back to the original form, so I cannot use it.</li>
            <li> I already own this item. I bought this one for my daughter. She now says she can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> Hot blow dry brush that delivers &amp; smoothes hair all at once. You need to blow dry hair with regular blow dryer till 80% dry then go in with this Conair hot brush to give hair volume, shape &amp; control without tangles. I have thick wavy hair &amp; I love the hard plastic bristle brush because it penetrates all my hair. I love, LOVE , Love this brush. I bought two. I hope they never quit making it.</li>
            <li> I like this styling brush so well, I bought a second one to keep at my daughter&#x27;s home.&lt;br /&gt;As long as I keep my hair short, this is the only hair dryer I need--and it is great for styling my hair too.  After I towel dry my hair and apply leave-in conditioner and sometimes mousse, this unit finishes the styling nicely.&lt;br /&gt;(I have naturally wavy, fine hair.)</li>
            <li> I bought 3 of these. One was for a friend and hers is working just fine. I put one in my travel bag and it&#x27;s fine, too. I just threw out an older model and started using the  last one. It worked for about a week and now the switch doesn&#x27;t work.So two out of three. Disappointed.  Two late for a return. Bummer.</li>
            <li> While I rated the brush as OK, it may be perfect for those with longer hair.  I really need a smaller or tighter curl.  Nonetheless, it does exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> The Great thing it support 110/220 volt&lt;br /&gt;But You can&#x27;t Plug included Brush, So I can&#x27;t use it&lt;br /&gt;I will try another Product support 110/220 volt</li>
            <li> Works great so far.  I bought it to take on a trip and it worked well.</li>
            <li> Came broken and it&#x27;s really hard against your head. I guess thats what you get for paying $14. Not worth it!</li>
            <li> This is a repurchase.  I had the &amp;#34;original&amp;#34; for about 10 years and was heartbroken when it died.  And I began the search for a new curling iron/ hair dryer combo.  I was THRILLED to find the Conair.  The EXACT same model I had before.  This is an excellent item.  It smooths your hair so it looks shiny.  It curls so you don&#x27;t have to do anything more to your hair.  It lifts so your hair looks nice and full.  You really can&#x27;t ask any more from a hair tool.  I bought 2!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to switch wattage. Follow instructions and use only Low setting while in Europe, and it provides plenty of heat for good styling. Great value for the low price!</li>
            <li> I use this curling brush when my hair is just a little damp.  It grabs the hair and holds it well so the warm air gently blows in the curl.  It  is perfect for adding body and loose waves.  Adds volume to top and bangs.  Very easy to use and much gentler on the hair than a hot iron.</li>
            <li> So far I have not had success in inserting the roller into the handle.  I am always challenged when it comes to product assembly, but I have tried and tried without success.  I am also disappointed with the design of the bristles in the smaller rollers,  I tried it just by hand to see if it was the size I needed and it snarled my hair and got stuck.  I was in a rush when it arrived and threw away the packaging (thinking it was like other Conair hot air brushes I have used) or I would return it.</li>
            <li> Had an older version of this I loved. This item was broken on arrival and I wonder if it was even checked before shipping it out.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thick and slightly wavy hair.  Curling irons are burning and damaging my hair, even set on low heat. I can&#x27;t get my hair grown out because we have to keep trimming off the burnt/damaged ends.  I love this Conair Supreme Hot Air Styling Brush!  I dry my hair with my blow dryer until just slightly damp, then I use my Conair to style and add curl while finishing the drying process.  My hair has volume, bounce, smooth curls and less frizz.  I still use my curling iron for touch ups between washes, but the great start I get with my Conair makes the touch ups much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Dee</li>
            <li> My wife seems quite happy with this item. She used to have a similar one and it lasted for years. We&#x27;re hoping this one does the same.</li>
            <li> I have used this blow dryer/curling combo since they came out and would hate not having one.  It works great!</li>
            <li> Not as I had expected from the description.  I expected firmer brush material.  It is too soft.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price........tames frizzies!</li>
            <li> Crap... fell apart and is unusable with in a week</li>
            <li> No,NoNo it does not work, I knw it would not and I wanted to buy for my mom for the holidays so I say I will look for the reviews , for the good it did!!!</li>
            <li> when i got mine i did not use it right away . but when i did it has a short in it and it is to late to send it back</li>
            <li> Have always used this item and have preferred it over others I have tried, which I gave away. The only reason I bought another brand is because when the first Conair one I bought, which lasted 8 YEARS, (was white) died, I could not find this one again. I found it again and even though I don&#x27;t need another one, the one I have is working perfectly, I bought a backup!!! This curls my hair perfectly, which is a normal texture, not thick or thin, slightly wavy. I do not use the brush drum, just the hard bristle drum...so if anyone needs a replacement brush drum, I have two, let me know.</li>
            <li> Just like I expected!</li>
            <li> This particular Conair is absolutely the best styling brush for me.  I&#x27;ve been using it for years on my fine delicate shoulder-length hair.  I only use the roller shown attached in the photo.  The secret is, as several others have written, is to damp-dry the hair roots a little with a blow dryer.  Then I remoisten the ends with either water or a product and roll in sections with the Conair.  Carefully shape each roll to cool.  At the end, for more body, shake your head a little upside down, fluff with fingers, and Voila!&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t stop making this product, Conair.</li>
            <li> I love this for styling long hair, makes your hair shiny and bouncy without drying it out.  They seem to wear out quickly though.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I don&#x27;t have to worry about using a comb and hair dryer at the same time, which, as anyone knows, is pretty hard to do!</li>
            <li> great price and fast shipping but my wife thought it could be more powerful. I ended up buying another brand and giving this one to my daughter as she doesn&#x27;t use these very often and it was fine for her</li>
            <li> As previous purchasers stated a little underpowered but works well and does a good job.  I would recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> There are those of us, of a certain age, who never managed the technique of holding a hair dryer and a round brush at the same time.  We grew up in the era of long natural straight hair.  Now we live at a time when more styling devices are required.  This is a great tool for getting curl or body into hair while holding only one object.  Be sure to have your hair damp-dry before you start, or styling will take forever.  The motor is small, and doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;blow&amp;#34; very strongly.  Get the majority of the water out of hair first, and you will be ok.</li>
            <li> This Curling Combo is actually a blow dryer that curls while using it, and that is exactly what I had wanted. It is easy to use, does not dry out the hair like a curling iron. I can be used daily without any problems.</li>
            <li> I love and live by this tool. I have been using this since I was in junior high and I am now 27. I have a layered hair cut, and this gives me he right amount of curl in towards the face that I have always loved. It smoothes my hair, gives it bounce and body, and gives me the layered around my face look. I love it. It makes my hair look so much better than any old hair dryer and brush combo could. I have always gotten compliments on my hair, and I always attribute it to this hair tool. It is my beauty secret, if you will. It is something I will never be without. I use it daily and my hair is still healthy, so I believe it is less damaging than a normal curler. I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;I took off a star because these things do not last long at all. Some break within 2 months, some last almost a year. I&#x27;ve been using these for so long and I have gone through a tone. However, I have yet to find a product that compares with my hair, and I can usually pick one up for fifteen to twenty dollars, so I feel it is well worth the bargain.&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that I only always use the stiff bristled brush that comes with it. It combs out all the tangles and locks them that way, so it leaves the hair great looking all day.&lt;br /&gt;I also do find that after the initial curling that my hair relaxes a tiny bit through out the day, but that just makes the curl and body look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;I have also had my hair all different lengths from hitting just at my shoulder to down the middle of my back and have always used this - no matter then length, it always smoothes and pefects. It&#x27;s a wonderful tool, even if it doesn&#x27;t last long. Although, it might not last because I use it almomst daily!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I would like to point out, I often switch between different types of shampoo/conditioner, from Pantene, Tresemee, Pureology, Biolage...and no matter which type I use, I always get the same results...from cheap to expensive.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a shot for salon perfect hair!</li>
            <li> seem a good idea, but does not curl my hair well...</li>
            <li> I first owned one of these in high school, and I recently purchased a new one after seeing my old one lying in my parents&#x27; house.  It works great (and I like the new black color, for what that matters).  I have a flat iron too but this is a nice alternative when I want smooth waves.  Plus I like how it helps my hair curl under more easily than the hair dryer/brush do.</li>
            <li> Works like it should on dry hair, however after a few minutes it begins to smell like the motor is going to burn out.</li>
            <li> I had owned a Conair Hot Air Curling combo for more than 10 years and LOVED it!  So I was really upset when mine was damaged by baggage handlers in route from a trip to Vegas.  So I got on Amazon and started looking for a replacement and was very happy when I easily found one!  I am very pleased with my new hot air curling brush as it is the only way I can control my unruly hair!  I would recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Perfect for styling thin hair.  This is my wife&#x27;s second styling brush</li>
            <li> It would not go to the high setting.. with the low setting it would take hours to do my hair.  I returned it</li>
            <li> This unit does not have a &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; setting, and the brushes on the roller are too long to be able to wrap the hair around the cylinder closely. It works better than nothing, but not really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this is the best thing ever! I am pretty lazy about styling my hair but even I can manage with this. I sometimes blow dry my hair a bit before using this as it does take a while if you use it right out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Worked great in Ireland.  I used with a plug adapter and that gave the brush a little more power than using in an &amp;#34;American&amp;#34; socket that some hotels had built in.  I have long, thin hair and the &amp;#34;low&amp;#34; setting which was available overseas (the high setting was not an option) worked great to flip my bangs under.  Most hotels provided hairdryers, so this was a luxury item to pack.  The large brush has hard, plastic bristles and the small bush has soft, bendable bristles.  Most bathrooms we stayed in did not have the third prong on the adapter (the plug wasn&#x27;t grounded?) so I had to use desk plugs or plugs that lamps went intoâ€¦usually there was a mirror nearby.</li>
            <li> hair looks great, soft and smooth. I use this when my hair is damp and it&#x27;s perfect to finish up my look. love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair styler I have ever used.  It is like a brush and dryer in one.  I find I can get pretty close to a blow out with this as it is so easy. I have shoulder length hair but in summer I get an A-line cut.  Just do small sections at a time.  If you want more lift, concentrate more on the roots,  If you want more curl, just keep rolling the ends.  I got two so in case the one wears out, (and they do in a few years), I have my back up.</li>
            <li> The attachments would not stay on making it a bit difficult to dry your hair.  Very poorly made.  I returned it. I have always like Conair products, but this one was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> This product works wonder on curling or hair.  Easy to use . This product I recommend.  It is easy to work with.</li>
            <li> This was described as dual voltage for worldwide travel.  What is not stated is that it can be used only on the LOW setting in Europe.  So the air flow is very low, and it takes forever to dry each curl.</li>
            <li> Great if you cannot manage to use brush and hair dryer to style hair. Does both jobs in one. Dual voltage makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Always the best product.  Lasts forever.  Well, I thought it would.  Lasted until January when the same locking mechanism broke as did the last one.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is perfect when used after my hair is mostly dry. It smoothes and gently curls it, but&lt;br /&gt; doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little tool to have around.  Started growing hair out again and this adds that extra volume we all like to have, and easy to use</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for it much at all.  It&#x27;s almost as if it tries to straighten my hair and makes it fuzzy looking.  I didn&#x27;t know the brushes were like a brush.  I need something stiff and strong to get through my hair like plastic teeth.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and still have to dry it most of the way with a hair dryer for time purposes. I does give the ends a gentle curve under that lasts.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace fabulous and very old similar Conair model that was held together with rubber bands by the time I had to give up on it. Bought the current model but depending on how I was holding it, the power would cut out, then come on again, then cut out again. Took it back to the store and now have a replacement that does EXACTLY the same thing!   WIll the third time be charm?  Stay tuned.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron combo for a Christmas gift for my mother in December 2010.  It stopped working after the 3rd time she used it.  I&#x27;m waiting to see my mother again to return the item.  I will not buy another again, I will look for a different brand.  I have to say I am surprised it stopped working, I&#x27;ve never had a hair dryer or curling iron stop working after a few uses.  I will send it back and see what they do for me.  Since I haven&#x27;t tried, I can&#x27;t give a report.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine hair.  I have used a styling brush, with lots of bristle brushes, for years, just not this brand.  Decided to give this one a try.  This type of brush will not grasp short hair.  Even with styling gel, I end up with a fluffy, frizzy mess.  Could not give this thing away.</li>
            <li> Love this hair styling dryer! This is my third one in probably 25 years. I have a shoulder length bob haircut right now  and my hair is poker straight. I get my hair mostly dry with my blow dryer and then finish off with this styling brush. I don&#x27;t have the patience or dexterity to do the brush and dryer thing at the same time, so this is perfect! It adds bounce and body to my hair do and doesn&#x27;t tangle. I hope Conair never stops making this wonderful styling tool!</li>
            <li> Really good for long hair.</li>
            <li> So... this styling brush is totally useless, given its multiple design flaws.&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s under-powered.  A lot of people complain that, for the 220V, since you can&#x27;t use it on high, it&#x27;s under-powered. However, even if you&#x27;re on 110V, high is still so weak that it has little to no effect. My previous styling brush on low has more power than this one on high.&lt;br /&gt;2. The head ends in a knob that has a significantly smaller diameter than the brush. This causes my hair to bind around the knob, which is too small to hold onto, if that was their intent, making it impossible to release my hair cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;3. The brush shaft is really short, which means that you can only work small sections of hair at a time.&lt;br /&gt;4. Only the smaller brush has soft bristles. This combined with #2 means that I spend 2 minutes just trying to detach this thing from each section of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten this to replace my previous Revlon Select 1200 Ionic Ceramic styling brush. It was fine, but I&#x27;d lost the end to the larger brush, during a trip. I have almost Marcia-Brady-straight hair, but I use a styling brush just to smooth it out a bit more and to put a slight curl into the ends. I spent 30 minutes with this Conair brush, and my hair was frizzier than when I&#x27;d started, with no discernable shape. After having the same experience a couple of times, I finally gave up and went back to Revlon brush, using the smaller head, and, in two passes and 5 minutes, I was done.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!  This supposedly &amp;#34;easy to use&amp;#34; styling tool is very ineffective.  It&#x27;s far too noisy for the heating power it delivers and its curling, styling ability is almost nil.  Bad purchase, sorry I bought it and would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> They are the only styling brush/dryer combo I can use without literally tearing my hair out.  I just don&#x27;t have the dexterity to use a hair brush and hair dryer as I usually have to cut my hair from the brush in a big tangle.  This unit has a small hair dryer which is great for drying the roots of  my fine hair with my head upside down, then I finish off the styling with the brush which is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t tangle.  The best part is the dual voltage, I can take it anywhere in the world with an adapter plug.  Plus it is easy to pack and light enough for hand luggage too.  I use to buy these in the local retailers in CA however they have become scarce so I buy online now.  I usually have a backup unit ready to go when the old one dies  (they usually last 3-4 yrs of daily use and travel).  I would give this unit 10/10, 100%, and 5 stars!</li>
            <li> the larger brush is bad and insufficient speed for optimum drying of hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this brush as it works in both England and US.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, dries and styles quickly</li>
            <li> very good hot air brush. it&#x27;s easy to use and make your hair shiny and curly too. it&#x27;s very worth your money. the quality is more than the price!!!! love it.</li>
            <li> This product is about what I expected.  I was hoping it would be better, based on some of the reviews.  It doesnt blow very strong, handles ok.  I have very fine thin hair, about 2\\&quot; below my ears.  I usually use a round brush and hair dryer.  A must for my hair type if I want any volume.  The effect is about the same, although I think i have more control with my round brush as a separate.  I thought it would be easier to just have one tool, but not so.  You dont have to hold 2 items, but the blowing strength is not as good so it takes longer.  I have been using it for 2 weeks now - off and on.  The shorter stiffer bristles are better for grabbing short hair, but both work.  I think I will prolly make this my travel hair product b/c it does take up a little less space than a dryer.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered this conair hot air curling comb. The first one broke after a few uses. The second broke right after the first use. The hot/warm switch us the culprit. I will never buy on line again as it costs so much money to return.</li>
            <li> I have looked for this curling brush for months and finally found it here!  But, unfortunately it broke after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Not very hot good for travel in Europe</li>
            <li> My hair may be too short for this but I like it.</li>
            <li> This is the third Conair hot air curling iron I have purchased. The last two I could only find on Amazon, and I was concerned it may no longer be available.  I use only the plastic tine attachment because my hair is very fine  and gets tangled in brush attachments. I needed a new one this time because many of the tines broke off in a tightly packed suitcase.  All three are still working otherwise, and I&#x27;ve used them for years. (I keep one at another residence) I love being able to blow dry and shape my hair into soft smooth curves with one hand.  I would have given 5 stars, but it seems the quality is cheapened a bit.  The tines seem  sharp against the scalp and the attachment didn&#x27;t fit into the wand very easily.  Still I will buy another one when I need it. Hoping it will always be available -just can&#x27;t find anything like it in stores.  I certainly do  recommend this for anyone like myself with fine hair and who  is all thumbs when it comes to working with a dryer in one hand and a curling brush in the other.</li>
            <li> It does not work too well.&lt;br /&gt;It does not curl the hair the way I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
            <li> This is my second conair styling brush. The first one lasted about seven years. I really love this brush.</li>
            <li> This is the best blowdryer/curler for fine hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these 12 years ago and it still works.  However, it was slowly dying and I could not find one in the stores, so I was happy to find one on Amazon!  I have to give this 5 stars because if you have fine limp straight hair, it gives you the extra body you need.  Plus you keep one had free without having a brush in one hand and blower in the other.  I cannot get the same results with a blower and brush.  Very happy...  I received this item from the seller very fast, within days of my order.  Very satisfied with the seller.</li>
            <li> I have layered chin length, fine, straight hair and used it 5 to 6 times a week. I only styled small sections on practically dry hair and left it on each section for 5 seconds (Conair recommends 10 seconds). There was no clogging or hair buildup to cause any issue. No styling products or anything else to cause a problem. My former hot air brushes were Sassoon and lasted over a year for each one, but can&#x27;t be found in stores anymore. Thank heavens I bought another one or I would be driving a hour (live in a rural area) to get a new one. One day the unit worked fine (no sign of any issue) and the next it would not turn on. No power problems or GFCI issues in the house. If this one fails like the last... goodbye Conair. I am surprised at the lack of quality of this item, since I have used other Conair products for a lot of years.</li>
            <li> thank you so much for the merchandise, I love these curling irons, been lookin all over for them.  never happier</li>
            <li> Both items a much too large for medium and short hair Sorry I purchased it. Will give it to someone with long hair.</li>
            <li> Well it did not heat very well, barrel was too small.  The basic functionality of this equipment is poor.  I had to use up all the propane so I could throw the appliance in the garbage.  It is not returnable.  Waste of $15.00.</li>
            <li> I like my old one better but it didn&#x27;t have a voltage converter switch for Europe. It also doesn&#x27;t have a release button on the brush that releases your hair which makes it a little less likely to end up with hair tangles. Otherwise, it&#x27;s just fine!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite tool for taming my frizzy mop.  I have another one that was getting old and bought this thinking I&#x27;d hate for them to stop making them and my old one give out.  The price was very reasonable as well.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but i am not happy with this product. There is some sort of glitch in the product to where it shuts off every time it is turned a certain way. It took me FOREVER to get my hair looking somewhat decent. Not worth the money. I bought a revlon air brush that works great instead.</li>
            <li> Bought this to curl my daughter&#x27;s hair without having to blow dry it.  Looks high quality &amp; a great size.</li>
            <li> There is something MAGICAL about this product. First of all, I have fine hair but a lot of it. I used to have lovely curls when I was younger, but now my hair neither air dries straight nor does it curl, so I get this funky frizzy half curl thing going on. This styling brush quickly makes my hair look how I want it to look. You will be able to use this product to A) completely dry and style your hair or B) Quickly style or touch up already dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never leave myself enough time to do my hair in the morning, but this brush is awesome as it works faster than the dryer/hand held brush method. This is kind of miraculous, as the Conair uses much less air than a regular hairdyer, but it works MUCH better. Maybe it is the fact that the actual metal part of the conair heats up as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am most concerened with how the hair right around my face looks, and this dryer is the perfect solution. If I&#x27;m running low on time, I&#x27;ll use it to style the hair around my face, and it does a much nicer job than a regular hairdryer. With the regular hairdryer brush technique, I can&#x27;t get the dumb cowlicks out of the front of my hair and I wind up with a weird looking 80s wave right at the top of my forehead (NOT COOL). With the conair I can easily style that cowlick right outta my hair. Also, if you style your hair the wrong way with the conair, mistakes are super easy to fix. This, I think, is a huge difference from the regular hair dryer method.&lt;br /&gt;I have been trying to make my hair look the way I want it to look for years and years, and this is the first product that truly WORKS. Basically this is one of those products that has just the right combination of components (plus a little bit of magic) that make an AWESOME styling tool.</li>
            <li> I loved mine, but I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t pay a lot of money for it. 6 months of use (not even daily) and it is DOA. I&#x27;m sad. I&#x27;m looking for a replacement now.</li>
            <li> Very pleased - good product and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This broke after 3 months. I liked the product, but won&#x27;t order another one. The first one I had lasted about one year and I thought it might be just a lemon. I was wrong. Too bad all you can get is this crap from China.</li>
            <li> Got this for my mother and she love is it</li>
            <li> This item works well, but takes longer to use for drying than some others because it has less power.  The benefit is that I can already see less frizz in my hair than with the high powered types, so it&#x27;s a trade off.</li>
            <li> The volume of air this much less than the hairdryer but it works as expected.</li>
            <li> The best curling brush.....does not tangle and dries and styles your hair in a short time.  My hair is short to mid lenght.&lt;br /&gt;The thing to look for is the boar brisstles. I own three of them, and have bought several to give as gifts.  A big hit</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great - and i got it quickly ;)</li>
            <li> the comb on the brush was broken when I received the product and it is quite hot on your head.  It needs to be warm to curl but it seems to dry out the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this thing..so easy!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time. My original broke after many years of use, so I just bought another one.</li>
            <li> I have fine, naturally curly hair.  This appliance has been a godsend for me.  It&#x27;s tough to get salon results on your own with a blowdryer and brush, but this appliance makes it so easy.  I never leave home without it.  It&#x27;s quick and easy and leaves my hair with bounce and shine.  I absolutely love it.  My local stores don&#x27;t carry it, so I am overjoyed to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have had this blower for a long time, at least 7 years, and it just died on me.  I have been looking all over in stores for it. The conair website has it for $34 and I didn&#x27;t think it should be that much money. And now I found it here for half, I am so excited. This is the best blower I have ever had. I use this to straighten my hair with some body and to flip the ends up. It&#x27;s so easy, and I don&#x27;t have to go through the process of seperating my hair before I blow it. I do make sure my hair is almost dry before I use this, or it would take much to long. I have medium length, very wavy and a lot of hair.  I have been dreadfully living without it for over a month now. I purchased 2 flat irons in the meantime and they can not take the place of this.  I can&#x27;t wait until I am reunited with my blow dryer.</li>
            <li> when these go out they die instantly so i always have a spare...this method sure beats the blow dryer and brush method when you regularly conk yourself in the head...and the price was only 2/3 of what the retail market is</li>
            <li> The hot air brush is perfect for styling and drying damp hair. It leave the hair styled all day through. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it is going to work for me.  Cannot get the attachment to lock on, but can&#x27;t get it off either.  I need dual voltage.  This is too costly to send back.  In the trash it will go.</li>
            <li> I am not so good with a blow dryer and brush for styling my hair so I thought I would try this.  It&#x27;s easy to use and there were no problems with it but it made my hair fly away and full of static.  I do have fine, straight hair which could be part of the problem but I am not using this product.  I ended up purchasing a different Conair hot styling brush which works better for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I was given one of these by my mother and liked it - After many years it finally gave out and this was an identical replacement - just a different ( better IMO) color.</li>
            <li> This device has changed my life- it isn&#x27;t going to give you the tightest curl and you have to have your hair somewhat damp (not completely damp) for it to be effective but the results look like you&#x27;ve had your hair blown out by a professional- love it.</li>
            <li> I have had a few of these and I love it!!!  I ordered their newer model and ended up giving it to a friend.  I have very thick hair and it tends to be puffy and on the wavy side.  After I blow dry my hair, I use this and it smooths out my hair beautifully.  I can also flip my sides back and the bottom length under.  I hope that this isn&#x27;t going to be discontinued.  It works way better than their newer model!  Please keep making these.  I recently ordered another because it works so well!</li>
            <li> I wish this got a little bit hotter but overall, for the price, it&#x27;s a great styling tool! I&#x27;ve gotten lots if hair compliments since I started using. Creates very natural waves if used right.</li>
            <li> I owned and LOVED a Conair hot air curler (cobalt blue) 1000 watts that I bought at Target.  When the cord exterior cracked and exposed wires I had to replace it. I looked everywhere for one like it that had the comb teeth &amp; metal barrel and not a brush barrel. I ordered the black and gold one shown here. I was pretty disappointed to open the box and find a white and hot pink one but that was nothing compared to the disappointment I felt using this styling tool. No where in the description or even on the package or package insert does it say how many watts this is....ITS ONLY 300 WATTS and is in teeny tiny print that needs a magnifier to read on the UL embossing. It is a weak shadow of the tool I had. Conair why would you bother? My other barrel styler curled my fine hair nicely this does nothing. What a waste of money no wonder its so cheap on Amazon. I would love one just like my old one this cheap copy is a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I just bought the Conair BC171NCS Ceramic Ionic Hot Air Brush that is 1000 watts. What a difference. The most glaring difference is the smell the hot air curler give off. I thought this was a new product smell but now after smelling the new Ionic brush I know its not. This hot air curler smells like mold and mildew when I use it. I have to wonder if it was exposed to a flood or water problem before packaging. I will never use it again.</li>
            <li> i failed to noticed the power of that one.. it is not that powerful and needs more time to dry the hair..</li>
            <li> This has been my Go-to Hair Styling Tool for the past 20 years. I&#x27;d honestly be lost if it ever went out of production bc there&#x27;s nothing out there that works quite like it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I&#x27;ve got flat irons, curling irons, curling wands, an InStyler and a Curl Secret! I have a beauty arsenal and each tool has its day. Still, this is the one styling tool that I use each time I style my hair.  I can&#x27;t say this will work for everyone but I can tell you exactly how it works for me and suggest what hair types and styles I find it works best for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Styling Brush lasted more than 10 years and I used it nearly every day. Unfortunately, companies don&#x27;t make things as nice as they used to and that saying applies here too. This new unit I purchased feels much lighter, less durable and cheaply made to be brutally honest. Still, it offers something that most other brushes don&#x27;t offer: it gets very, very hot and puts out strong, forceful air. These 2 things combined make this hot air brush very unique from others and it&#x27;s the key to my finished look!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before finding this particular model (which is an exact replacement of my old one) I tried several other brands. I was unimpressed w/ all of them and each one was made primarily of cheap plastics. Economics aside, I didn&#x27;t find any other &amp;#34;hot air styling brushes&amp;#34; that have the hard bristles I like combined with strong, forceful air that gets hot enough to work. Helen of Troy makes a similar product but it feels even cheaper and lighter and lacked force of air and hot heat. It also has shorter bristles which made the barrel appear/feel much smaller. That product was a total fail and wouldn&#x27;t work for anyone for any purpose. I did find similar hot air brushes that produced hot heat w/ forceful air BUT they lacked the hard bristles that are a must for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the hard, plastic bristles as opposed to the boar/nylon bristles bc they allow for more control, better/larger curl (for turning under or out) and always gives my hair the best result. Both are included w/ this set which is a bonus!  I&#x27;m sure there are folks who prefer the boar bristles but, for me, it&#x27;s what sets this brush apart from the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly considered taking off 1 star bc this isn&#x27;t as well made as my previous models have been. It feels cheaply made right out of the box. I&#x27;m hoping this unit will last as long as my previous ones have and I do hope Conair (and companies in general) will consider going back to a higher standard and better quality assurance. I gave it 5 stars bc it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and is exactly what I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended for: Straightening/Turning Under Bobbed Hair and Turning in Layers That Are Tapered Around the Face&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works best for Bobs! If you have chin to shoulder length hair that you&#x27;d like to straighten and bend under or out, this should work wonders for you! If you have difficulty using a round brush in combination w/ your hair dryer then this could solve that problem. I typically use a dryer to damp dry my hair &amp; THEN I use the Styling Brush to complete my style. It works like a hairbrush that blows hot air which eliminates the need for a hair dryer &amp; brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not Recommended for: Long Hair or Naturally Curly Hair--especially tight curls. The longer the hair the more difficult I find this to use. When I grow my hair my long I don&#x27;t use this tool bc it&#x27;s difficult to roll all of the hair up into the brush and the longer your hair gets the more difficult it becomes to create that taught resistance that you create w/ a round brush and hair dryer. If you have hair below our shoulders I&#x27;d recommend another styling tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Use the same styling products w/ your hot air brush that you&#x27;d use w/ a flat iron--heat protector, primer, hair spray, serums, shine spray, etc.&lt;br /&gt;If for some reason your hair isn&#x27;t shiny enough or needs a more finished look, simply run a flat iron through the top/outer layer of your hair. I rarely ever have to do this but it helps to set frizzy hair or is helpful in humid weather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: This tool&#x27;s main purpose (IMO) is to replace styling your hair with a roll brush and hairdryer. It is very difficult to make permanent curls with this styling brush. Do not buy this if that&#x27;s your purpose. If your hair is short to medium in length hair and you&#x27;re looking for an easy way to straighten your hair, turn your hair under or flip it up or out then give this a try!n through the top/outer layer of your hair.

            <li> Honestly my hair didn&#x27;t hold a curl with it. I would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the iron and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Terrible!  Arrived broken &amp; a total hassle to return.  Ended up throwing away.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a replacement for my Jilbere including contacting the company.  A friend told me about this one and I ordered 2, will likely order 2 more for back ups.  This is a perfect finish styler as long as u don&#x27;t use the brush bristles which can tear the ends of your hair.  I recommend this unit to all my clients that have hair 4 inches or longer.  Again, this is a FINISH styler and not intended to drive your hair from the beginning.</li>
            <li> I love it!  The only difference is that the picture shows gold pieces on it and I received it with purple pieces (which wasn&#x27;t a bad thing - I didn&#x27;t mind it).  But besides that it looks just like the picture and I how it works.  It quicker than having to blow-out your hair (it&#x27;s a blower and brush in one), it keeps your hair soft, and gives your hair body.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I start with a regular blow dryer to about 3/4 dry, and the switch to this one for styling.  It also gives lift and body.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product!  I&#x27;ve been using one for 16 years now and this is my fourth one (mainly because I left my other one while I was travelling). So happy to find it on Amazon and even cheaper than Conair&#x27;s site!</li>
            <li> Took it out of the package, started to use it. I noticed it was a little wobbly, like it wasnt fully together. I went to take it off and the whole thing just came apart, bristles and all!!! And a piece was broken off the head, so couldnt put the other brush on. No, I honestly do not believe this was a user error.. Just be cautious I guess but I would not recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought this in Walmart at around $20. I am one those people that doesn&#x27;t know how to use brush and blowdry at the same time. This tool is basically just a blowdryer with attached comb, which is great! I have long straight hair. It doesn&#x27;t curl my hair nor create waves and volume as advertised but it makes my hair looks manageable. It doesn&#x27;t have that much heat. It&#x27;s fine with me coz I don&#x27;t like curling my hair often. I just do it on special occasions. I have to dry my hair first with a regular blowdryer and use this to fix my hair. With just regular blowdryer, my hair would not look as good. I think this will work great with damp hair or a little wet hair. Tried it with dry hair, didn&#x27;t work as much.  I&#x27;m satisfied with it as I won&#x27;t be holding brush and blowdry with my two hands anymore. But for curling my long hair, I&#x27;ll use my regular curling iron for it.</li>
            <li> They seem to stop working right after the warranty is up at one year. That&#x27;s why I deduct a star from the rating. I&#x27;ve bought several of them because I do like that I can shape my hair as I dry it. I&#x27;ve not found another I like better at close to this price, but I hate that they don&#x27;t last. Something happens internally and they won&#x27;t go on all of a sudden. Only once have I gotten lucky and have it go out just before the warranty so it was replaced at no cost to me. Otherwise, it is a great hair-dryer-shaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; UPDATE: 4-11-15  I bought my last one 1 yr and 1 mo ago and it quit - yep, one year is all you get. I&#x27;m trying the John Frieda model next. It has the same size 1-1/2&amp;#34; larger barrel size.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a defective one - or if it just LOOKED like the one I used to have that worked great, but this did not heat up well at all.  I have fine medium length hair, and it produced hardly any curl at all.  Also - my hair was really dried out by this - which is weird considering that it just didn&#x27;t get that hot.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer, but hard to change brush heads.  In fact I use the larger brush, and have used duct tape to keep it  from coming off.</li>
            <li> just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair</li>
            <li> This is easy to use instead of 2 hands requiring brush and dryer.  They&#x27;ve taken the work out of blowdrying ones hair. I&#x27;ve recommended this curling combo to several people and they too are enjoying the use of it.</li>
            <li> Excellent. My old one went on the blink. This brush does the job very well.</li>
            <li> This is a really neat idea but within two weeks it just quit working! I was styling my hair one second and it was dead the next.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get on to it...</li>
            <li> This is an anemic blow brush, worthless, really, and I have short, quick-drying hair.  No power to speak of and didn&#x27;t do the job, not worth the effort to carry it on a trip.  I didn&#x27;t get back from travels in time to return it to Amazon so will donate it to a charity and hope it goes to someone who&#x27;ll find a use for it.  Should have paid more attention to the don&#x27;t-waste-your-money reviews but I was so intent on finding a dual voltage appliance that I took the chance.  Dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> This dryer/curler worked well for me while it worked.  I have thin hair, so the heat and air volume was fine for me, though I could see it taking a long time to curl thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the blower went out in a puff of smoke after less than a month of use.  It has a 2 year warranty, so I called Conair for a replacement.  I was going to have to pay for return shipping plus $5 until the customer service rep heard that I was in California.  Because of that, they will reimburse me for shipping costs.  I don&#x27;t know if that is due to a state law about warranty returns in general, or if it just is about Conair, but Yay government regulation!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, the next one will last longer.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this item because it barely blows - it is very weak - it takes forever to dry my thin, medium length hair... it is light weight, which is why I chose it for travel... but it is light weight in more ways than I expected.  I do not reccomend.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it has dual voltage for international use when traveling.  If this is what you are looking for you should know that when the voltage is switched, the device only operates on the low setting.  This provides only very low heat and airflow which makes it difficult to style and dry your hair.  I have shoulder length normal to fine hair, so if yours is longer or thicker you should consider whether this will work for you.  The voltage switch is difficult to operate and requires a screwdriver to change.  The bristles are very sharp as well, which you may not like.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair so it didn&#x27;t work as well but I am still happy with the product and it works well to blow dry</li>
            <li> This is my second one, I truly like it. The brush dries and curls my hair. I could not find it until I got on amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several years and it makes styling your hair easier than using a brush and hair dryer. You do have to be sure your hair is damp and not dripping wet. I hardly have to use my flat iron. Love it. It&#x27;s great for hair shoulder length and shorter.</li>
            <li> I have been using this tool for years, probably since it first it the market.  When I travel to Europe, it is great because it is double voltage. This is the best product ever ! Thank  you Conair for continuing to market this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish Conair had a 2 inch model for long hair. They could market a small, medium, and large size and also up the air flow a tad bit.  Other than that, I have always loved this hot air brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I could never style my hair with the blowdryer and brush technique that the hair stylists use... my arms get tired ... and this saves a huge amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have very soft fine and curly hair so this straightens it quite well without being bone straight... so I still have body.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This works ok, but not as good as others I have had. I got it beca use it has hard plastick teeth and I have curly hair and this does not straighten it but it will make it wavy and easier to manage, and it curls the ends.</li>
            <li> this is to replace the last hot air curler I got over 10 years ago.  It is just like the other and it works great!  The price was nice considering I was thinking I was going to have to pay over $40 for this item at a local store!</li>
            <li> Until recently, I never knew there was an alternative to blow dryers. A few months ago, I saw a hot air brush advertised in some catalog and then researched similar items at Amazon. I&#x27;ve always found it difficult to get a reliable, repeatable result with a blow dryer, but after developing tendonitis last year in my hands, blow drying and turning a brush to obtain volume in my hair became much more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this Conair hot air brush because it offered two brush diameters (as I wasn&#x27;t sure that I&#x27;d use the larger diameter brush, given my chin length hair) and because it offers two electrical currencies (220 for travel abroad). My hairstyle is a bob, and my hair is straight-ish with some odd waves and medium volume. Each hair is coarse, but I don&#x27;t have tons of hair. I use the larger brush for drying and styling my damp hair (I wait 20-40 minutes after toweling dry). The airbrush dries, but it would be a waste of time to start with the brush right after toweling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this styling device is I no longer stress over getting my style right -- it is basically foolproof. I start at the bottom and work up to my part, sectioning the hair roughly and either slowly running the brush from root to end or rolling up from end to root and counting to ten. It is easy to hold a mirror in one hand and the airbrush in the other to detail a certain area, if necessary. One&#x27;s visibility in styling is much better than with a blow dryer, as the airbrush only requires one hand for me. I don&#x27;t know how efficient this airbrush would be on very thick hair, but it does a great job of adding volume and fullness to my bob, without curling my hair. On longer hair, I&#x27;m sure it can add waves or some curls, but it might be a secondary tool after drying.</li>
            <li> Bought a different model for my Girlfriend.  It is an excellent hair dryer.  I bought this model for my Daughter and it is a piece of Junk.  I will not stay running when you turn the brush in her hair and it produces almost no heat and the fan on high setting blows about 1/4 what my girlfriends does on low.  A total piece of crap...I will never buy one of these again</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace my previous one that gave up one me after couple years of working hard for me.  After returning the one bought in the store since it&#x27;s curling iron &amp; not what I can use, I started to look online and found exactly the same one I own before.  I can&#x27;t use styling products since they give me pimples on my face so I need to curl my hair while it&#x27;s still damp and traveling between countries, I need dual voltage.  This is the only one available but I&#x27;m pleased with the previous one so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s still around.</li>
            <li> Not as Google as I thought.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel this got as hot as an older one I borrowed from my cousin.  I&#x27;m a little disappointed as the newer version should be as good or better than the same item that&#x27;s 10 years old.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!!</li>
            <li> even its max settings the air blows so incredibly slow, and the barrel doesn&#x27;t get that hot.</li>
            <li> not very powerful and doesn&#x27;t heat up enough to curl my (fine) hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years, it&#x27;s getting more difficult to find locally. I agree with the other review, with a little more power and a larger brush, it could cut the time down for long think hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it&#x27;s still the best product on the market, after all these years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dual voltage is a bonus! Please continue to make this product - and don&#x27;t change the brush - it works!  Thanks</li>
            <li> Use it all the time, love it.  And it does not seem to be too drying to hair. always make sure to put thermal protectant in hair before use.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I bought because the first one broke. They both broke at the connection point of the brush to the dryer. The ring that locks the brush on is not strong enough and cracks easily with just regular use. Then the brush won&#x27;t stay locked and you can&#x27;t use it effectively. I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so cheap, but I bought this a few months ago and it&#x27;s already broken. I will look for a similar product from a new manufacturer this time.</li>
            <li> These last about 2years and I keep buying them for my wife.  We always have one for back-up.&lt;br /&gt;If I clean the lint out it lasts longest.</li>
            <li> I like the weight of the curling iron.  Heats up quickly and curls evenly.  A great buy.  I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Did not have much power.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair and it was not enough power to keep mine full.</li>
            <li> But to tell the same story, I recently goy my hair cut short and the barrels on this were completely too large.  Returned item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Conair Hot Air Curling Combo for years to straighten my very frizzy, curly hair. It does a great job in half the time since it dries and curls at the same time.  Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Used one for years.  Excellent flowing curl.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the smaller bristle brush. Gets too hot for me...</li>
            <li> Great for taming your hair as you blow dry. Handy for second days.</li>
            <li> It works good but it broke easily after only about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Not really a lot of air flow. I thought it would be like other style rollers, but not really! I usually just get frustrated and use my blow-dryer and round brush. I have never made it through drying and curling my hair with just this. My hair is just chin length and I still won&#x27;t get through styling with this.  Not really a fan!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this styling brush. I have fine, African American kinky hair that has been relaxed and this styling comb/brush is PERFECT for drying and styling! I no longer have to worry about putting too much heat on my hair because this dryer provides just the right amount of heat to dry and style perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these several years ago and used it all the time.  Recently, it broke while traveling and I bought a similar (different brand) item to replace it.  The similiar item did not measure up.  I finally found the exact one here on Amazon and bought it.  I could not find another to measure up to it.  The others blow air around the brush which makes it hard for your hair to stay wrapped around the bristles while styling.  The Conair one does not do that.  It made a big difference in styling my hair.  I would defintely buy this again (oh, wait!  I already did!).</li>
            <li> This is a high quality product that is somewhat hard to find and is priced very reasonably but that is not why I am writing this review. I am writing this review because of how it was delivered. I have Amazon Prime and ordered this on a Friday. It was important but I was going to be out of town and the listing said that it could be delivered on Sunday so I had it sent to the hotel. Sure enough I picked it up in the hotel lobby 2 days later on Sunday!  I have never had a shipment arrive on a Sunday much less at a hotel at no cost and even the item was a bargain.  That just really impressed me.  5 stars all around.</li>
            <li> This curling combo is GREAT!! I love what it does to my hair. I have REALLY thick hair &amp; it works GREAT on it!! Exactly what i was looking for:))))</li>
            <li> Timely delivery.  It worked in Turkey with 220V.  Bristles plastic and stiff.</li>
            <li> An all time favorite.  Love it that it is dryer and brush in one. When I don&#x27;t use my hot rollers I use this.  Conair rocks!</li>
            <li> I had one of these for 5 years and it was broken on a trip in my luggage which I understand the way they handle our luggage. So that is why I purchase this a month ago. This weekend doing my hair it got caught on a knot and the whole thing snapped...very cheaply made. Very upset.  Have to find another like this. Doesnt get hot like the older ones did.</li>
            <li> it is a good product but not for me. it does not do what i thought it would. i need a smaller barrel.</li>
            <li> The goos thing with this item, that it is dual voltage. You don&#x27;t have to worry about it when you travel abroad.&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the head well spin or rotate, but it was not. Over all it is good item and it did the job. Yes I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with this at all, it doesn&#x27;t blow enough hot air to dry your hair unless you have a long time.  Not pleased with this at all, wish I had sent it back!!</li>
            <li> GREAT just what my wife wanted.SERVICE was excellent.would certainly use them again.&lt;br /&gt;  Bob</li>
            <li> I have used Conair hot air styling brushes for years and have always found them to be very good.  This one in particular is very cheaply made, it took me days to get the brushes to &amp;#34;lock in&amp;#34; to the unit.  The air flow is very weak compared to all the ones I have owned before.  I was going to send it back, but these particular units, or any one that has the hot air blowing feature, are becoming increasingly hard to find.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for this Curling Combo in stores in my area and haven&#x27;t been able to find one. My other one that I had for 8 years stopped working and I needed another. I&#x27;ve loved it for 8 years and I love the new one that I got.</li>
            <li> I had the larger styling brush but it was too large for me.  I was hoping this smaller brush revolved like the larger brush but was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t.  I have fine, naturally curling hair which curls but quickly flattens on top and tends to friz. My smaller brush controls the friz and keeps the top full as I like it  Soo it works well for me</li>
            <li> This is good to use when I have a little more time.  It is for sure for longer hair than I have, but still works good.  Works great for travel, I don&#x27;t have to take a hair dryer, just the hot air curler.  The quality if very good.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this on Amazon as it was not available in any stores. It&#x27;s great for soft look. My favorite by far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for the past 8-10 years.  I&#x27;ve been through 3 of them and now purchasing my 4th as backup.  I have very thick and wavy hair.  This is a necessity... along with initially using a blow dryer to remove most of the dampness.  I only use the brush attachment and it truly smooths out my hair.  When I try to use a curling iron, my hair gets too curly.  This gives me a straight look in only minutes time.  And, it easy to use.  Substitute this product... instead of using a round brush with your blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I&#x27;ve tried using this on my friend who has straight hair, thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t work very well.  Clearly this product is the answer to thick/wavy/curly hair.  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine. I really like this dryer because it&#x27;s much faster than blowing my hair dry, then using a curling iron. I use a little bit of gel first and it gives my hair so much body and fullness. My hair is above my shoulders, so it just gives my hair a very soft, loose curl. Don&#x27;t expect a &#x27;curly do&#x27;. &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what I did without it ! By the way, amazon&#x27;s price is 1/2 of the Conair site price!</li>
            <li> This curling iron works very well on my frizzy and wavy hair smoothing it nicely. Some hot curling irons don&#x27;t get hot enough to smooth my frizzies, but this one actually gets quite hot.</li>
            <li> For me it is way big for the hand to hold.  I also have a problem when it stops as the wire turns, that was strange but I guess some people really like it that way.  It just doesn&#x27;t seem exactly what I thought it would be but yes I am keeping it and trying to work with it.</li>
            <li> Item as described, shipping time was excellent. So far so good for performance, the person I gave it to is pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> This curling iron was very slow to heat up and did no&lt;br /&gt;t do a very good job.</li>
            <li> after second use the switch broke and will not go up to high; it only works on low.&lt;br /&gt;I think i would have like it if it would only work!  Love it the first use lol</li>
            <li> The features look impressive, but look closer;( coming with two fairly descent brush heads. The handle is okay to use; but could be more ergonomic. The power cord is fine. So what is the problem? The POWER TO BLOW even on the high setting is flimsily weak &amp; powerless. Sent mine back in a flash. This is ridiculous...it&#x27;s very ineffective for my needs. I couldn&#x27;t get enough wind power to blow a leaf, it would take half an hour or more to do what I needed.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer did not dry my hair and the plastic brush teeth hurt my head.  I ended up returning it, which, as always, was super easy through amazon.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace the one I had before, same product, had it for years. New one looks the same, but def built differently.  It feels a little lighter, and the brush is pretty rough on my scalp. I use the bigger brush attachment. I just go easier near my head now. It still does the job, and I&#x27;d buy it again.. But  that will probably be sooner before later because I do feel the quality has diminished.</li>
            <li> This is the same air brush that I used for over 10 years.  That is why I bought this one because I thought it would last forever.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it, it did seem a bit crappier quality, and I was right, within 1 month it fell apart.  Do Not Buy This Product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty neat idea but did not give my hair the &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; I had hoped for.  Works great as a &amp;#34;touch up&amp;#34; when you don&#x27;t want to go through the wash, condition, style cycle before going out.</li>
            <li> I had my last one for about TEN years, I love the beautiful voluminous curls and body that I get from this tool. It&#x27;s basically like a salon blowout from the comfort of your home.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s happy with this replacement.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> my favorite hair tool</li>
            <li> It does absolutely nothing for my hair.  I have thick coarse hair - this is pretty much useless on it!  :(</li>
            <li> This dryer works well and the attachments are made well, however, the bristles on the smaller attachment are long and therefore make larger curls than expected.  The dryer is also loud and gets very hot quickly.  There is no separate setting for the heat, but there are two speeds.  The lower speed is of course not as loud.</li>
            <li> This styling tool doesnt work on thicker curlier hair like mine. Probably heats to a 100 degrees - way less than the 140 I normally need. Took close to 10 days to ship. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This a replacement for a similar one bought over 20 years ago that was dropped and broke open.  Although the curler blows hot air, its not a DRYER, it is used to style the hair after after it is dried.&lt;br /&gt;Versatile dual 125/250 voltage makes it easy to use universally with an inexpensive prong converter.&lt;br /&gt;The one inch and the 1 1/2&amp;#34; heads are easy to remove and change and have real bristles for good hair management and ease of styling.  My wife loves it and does not go any where without it.</li>
            <li> The item was already broken on first use. The hot air brush was not able to attach to it and keep going back to open.</li>
            <li> My recommendation for this hair dry is that the customers try. I really like to use it when my hair is wet. It dries your hair quickly,the hair is shinny, soft and manageable. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months now and I like it so far. I don&#x27;t have anything negative to say about this product.</li>
            <li> I recently let my hair grow longer, and with fine hair was afraid how to stlye it. But this helps me, and is easy to use, works well.</li>
            <li> This dryer is best because it has changable heads from brush to rubber nubs. It has a comfortable handle while drying your hair.  This is a best buy if you are searching for a great dryer.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t try to use this as a \\&quot;hair dryer\\&quot; or use it to try to style really wet hair.  I use it after I have dried my hair most of the way with my regular hair dryer and then I finish off with the Hot Air Curling Combo.  I can get my hair pretty smooth with it or I can add large curls or waves using the large barrel brush.  I do not care for the smaller brush.  I can eliminate the use of my flat iron or curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fairly fine, somewhat wavy and drys pretty quickly, but I am not sure how this would work for thick or very curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a pretty nice styling tool!</li>
            <li> When operating on 220V it turned itself off several times even though it was set properly.  Works fine on 110.</li>
            <li> Worked very well for three months then the end cap came off during normal use and can&#x27;t be fixed.  Buyer beware as this could happen to you.</li>
            <li> Love it...I bought one to replace my old one that I&#x27;d had for years. My sister (Hair dresser) also had one &amp; loved it so I got her another one for home.</li>
            <li> The size was exactly what I was looking for.  Hard to find a round heating brush in this size.  The brush attachment is great, but the plastic brush attachment.....the plastic heads are too long and too sharp.  It takes some doing to not hurt yourself when touching them.  I was able to work with it as long as I moved slowly.  I like the way the plastic attachment worked on my hair more than the brush attachment.  During the winter, my hair is so straight and static that the brush only makes it worse.  All in all, though, for the money it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Very reasonable price. Works well</li>
            <li> This is my secret weapon!  It saves me the time to put my hair in rollers.  I dry my hair partially with a conventional blow dryer and then I use this styling brush to finish my morning hair routine.  Works great for touch-ups too!</li>
            <li> Have had this for quite a while. Durable and works well...best one I,ve ever used!  Both brushes are useful. Glad I chose this model.</li>
            <li> The hot air curling combo work great .My wife was very impressed with the item . She said she would order another for a friend.</li>
            <li> I use the Conair hot ar curling combo every day.  It is easy to handle and does not get tangled in my hair.  It also is not to heavy.  I have given away other brands because they were so heavy.  I keep one  packed in my travel bag.  It is very convienent to travel with because it comes apart.  My only problem is that it is difficult to turn the tiny indicator from 120V to 220V.  I was unable to switch back to 120V when I returned home from a recent trip.  That is the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Just received the Conair Hot Air curling combo. It is huge! About 8\\&quot; long.&lt;br /&gt;It might work great as the other reviewer&#x27;s said, but it is too big to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;No where did I read about the overall length, so I had no idea it was so long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s going back and I will try and find a smaller duo that does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon Prime was excellent as usual!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for going on two years now, and it is still working as good as the day I bought it. After washing my hair, I flip my head upside down and blow my hair with a regular blow dryer until it is just slightly damp. This adds some lift to my roots. I then finish off by using this product as you would a curling iron, wrapping my hair up in it to the roots and then holding it tight for about 30 seconds. By the time I release it, my hair is dry, and the heat of the barrel acts as a curling iron, making beautiful waves. Not curls mind you, but waves, which is exactly what I want for my shoulder-length hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars only because it would be nice to have more forceful air coming out of it--the blow-dry aspect of it is a little weak. I&#x27;ve tried blow-drying my hair straight out of the shower with this, thing, and it takes FOREVER.</li>
            <li> Love this tool! I have thick curley hair and it works beautifully to create smooth large loose curls. If I want my hair totally straight I just go over it with flat iron. Overall drying time 40 min. Keep in mind I have THICK, LONG, CURLY hair. Love love love it!!</li>
            <li> Brush is too big for short hair and iron is very hot.</li>
            <li> I have had a similar Conair product in the past so I was very excited to come across this. The 1.5 inch hard plastic bristle brush piece was exactly what I was looking for. However, when I started to style my hair, I was disappointed in the lack of power the product had. My previous product was able to straighten my wavy hair as well as curl and style and this did nothing. I think that if I was able to use the high setting at the higher voltage, things might have been different but I will never know. I feel like I have wasted my money when I had such high hopes. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Purchased after one of it&#x27;s similar predecessors died (after about a year of use) and I imagine this will not last more than a year. Very classy design, however the turn-feature than locks the barrel into place can be stiff and difficult to manipulate.</li>
            <li> Like the idea but I wasn&#x27;t coordinated enough to use the spin...kept getting it tangled in my hair</li>
            <li> Works well, but smelled like plastic out of the box, like unusually strong. Great buy non the less if you don&#x27;t want to empty your pockets on a super fancy model. If it got hotter it would get five stars. But price is right and works, I&#x27;m satisfied</li>
            <li> I do like this except the barrel is a bit large for my higher than shoulder length hair...also, I wish the turn on mechanism was a little more &amp;#34;definite&amp;#34; cuz I keep fumbling around trying to find it; otherwise, it does its job and I like the way I can make my hair look decent in the middle of washings!  Also, it never tangles with my fine hair!</li>
            <li> At first I was THRILLED with this product; the perfect size for me.  But I realized quickly that it is very stiff and not all that comfortable  to use.  So I switched to the second size (the smaller one) which is softer and, as it works out, a good size for me as well.</li>
            <li> I have VERY straight, fine hair, so first I bend over and blow my hair almost completely dry with a regular, gun-style dryer. Then I finish by using the Conair Styling Brush to add volume and curl to the ends. Using it this way, it works wonderfully. BUT, my hair gets caught in the seam where the brush attaches to the handle and yanks it out by the roots. Ouch! I&#x27;m not sure if this is a design flaw that will effect everyone or if it&#x27;s due to the baby-fineness of my hair. Maybe those with thicker hair won&#x27;t have a problem. Right now I&#x27;m just trying to be careful and wrap my hair closer to the end of the barrel. But if I keep losing hair, I&#x27;ll have to get rid of it before I go bald!</li>
            <li> In 15 years this is my third one. I love it and will always have one. The heads come on and off easily, and is made well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for building volume and style to fine, limp hair.</li>
            <li> This was a horrible excuse for a blow dryer brush. It was flimsy and rattled due to a broken piece upon arrival. It had absolutely no drying power. I only purchased this because of the dual voltage for European travel. I have given up after purchasing a Hot tools dryer with equally bad results. Curly hair in Italy, here I come!</li>
            <li> The brush is fine, but I expected something with more power!&lt;br /&gt;I live in the place where the voltage is 220 and when subjected to this voltage the brush does not work in its maximum power!</li>
            <li> I love this product for drying my hair in the US, it gives a nice soft curl and eliminates the need to use a blow dryer and a curling iron or flat iron. Not sure if it has enough power for someone with thick hair. However I bought this specific model as I was headed OS and needed the dual voltage for use with 220V. When I got overseas I switched to 250 and discovered the high setting is disabled, so all I could use was the low setting. Even with my thin fine hair it would take forever to dry my hair on the low setting. In fact at first I thought it was broken as I could not move the switch to the high setting when I switched to 250. However upon moving back to 125 both settings worked. So a great little dryer for use in the US, but useless on the 250 voltage. If it weren&#x27;t for the dual voltage issue I would give it 5 stars</li>
            <li> The bigger barrel has hard teeth that didnt brush through my hair nicely.  I like the wire bristles on the smaller barrel better, but not the size</li>
            <li> The second time I used it; IT  BROKE.  The lock mechanism just broke into.  I gave it two stars because I did like the way it worked the first time I used it.  Even though the price was very cheap, I think that two uses is ridiculous .  Very disappointed!! EDITED:  Amazon did replace it and the replacement one works just fine.</li>
            <li> waste of money. does not get hot enough to do anything to your hair. I am caucasian and have somewhat thick and wavy hair. My hair straightens well and curls well, and I had great luck with my old hot air brush. I would use it on my damp hair and get my hair mostly dry and smooth and then dry up the roots with a traditional hair dryer, it always came out great. When that one died recently I decided to stick with conair, but this one is terrible. I tried it when my hair was damp, I gave up after ten minutes. My hair was still wet. I thought maybe I should use the regular hair dryer first and then smooth my hair with the new hot air brush, since it would have taken a week to get my hair from damp to dry with the hot air brush. That didn&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;So it is not hot enough to dry my damp hair, and it is not hot enough to shape my already dry hair. Exactly what was this thing designed to do? I missed the return deadline as well, so now I am stuck with this useless thing. Maybe I can wrap a fabric softer sheet around it &amp; leave it on as a bathroom deodorizer to get my money&#x27;s worth? :/ Not happy.</li>
            <li> Just amazing!!! enough with the pain of holding the blowdrier in one hand and brush in the this item has it all !!!!&lt;br /&gt;just one problem when making soft curls the results are not as long lasting as when done with a blowdrier but otherwise it is the best!!!</li>
            <li> Easy way to style hair....Good buy</li>
            <li> I  had one of these for years, and it finally bit the dust.  Bought this newer version and it literally came apart within 4 months.  Made a whole lot cheaper than the earlier version.  I really miss being without it, but don&#x27;t feel comfortable buying another.</li>
            <li> This styling tool is a staple in my bathroom. I love that it gives me a salon style blowout look without having to hold a large round brush and a blow dryer at the same time. I recommend blow drying your hair almost all the way through, and the finishing with this. Make sure your hair is in sections to get the best results.</li>
            <li> It was interesting. It works. good for short hair. I have a bob. Dry most of your hair first. adds nice finish.</li>
            <li> This broke after 6 months. Just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel but not very happy with it.  Makes my hair on the straight side and no body.</li>
            <li> this curling iron doesn&#x27;t curl anything.  there&#x27;s hardly any power coming out of this.  it&#x27;s as if someone is blowing hot air out of it like with their .mouth.</li>
            <li> It brought out the length of my hair giving it more body.  It is not applicable if you need curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have never styled my hair mostly due to my lack of ability. This tool makes it just about klutz proof. I would recommend this and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this item for a number of years, primarily to control curl and frizz, and was very happy with the results. I wanted to have a spare (just in case it got \\&quot;tired\\&quot; and didn&#x27;t perform with age) but was totally dismayed when it mysteriously disappeared from store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;When I found it on Amazon - how happy was I!!!&lt;br /&gt;But... the first one I ordered had faulty wiring (would start and stop) and since I hadn&#x27;t opened and used immediately, I was past my 30 day return window - not happy.&lt;br /&gt;I gave Amazon one more chance - and this one works great!&lt;br /&gt;Anyone know how to repair wiring in a curling brush?</li>
            <li> I bought this brush because I needed a hot air brush for travel to Europe. A great feature of the brush is that you can flip and switch and use it in either the US or several European countries. However, you have to remember to flip the switch or you will fry the machine. And you will still need a plug adaptor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this hot air styling brush would be better if the teeth on the plastic bursh were longer. It&#x27;s difficult to keep hair in the brush while styling because the gaps between the teeth are too wide, but if they were longer (or the barrel were a little wider) it would help. I found this brush too noisy for how weak the air output was. My suggestion for anyone who travels to Europe frequently is to just buy a hot air brush when you&#x27;re there and let it be your dedicated brush for travel.</li>
            <li> Diameter of the smaller brush is still too large for my particular hair. Unit seems to work well but leaves my hair too fluffy with no defined curls. I can get the same results with a blow drier.  My old unit was smaller in diameter and fit my needs better. I like this style of styling tool rather than the one that clamps on the hair. The bristles in this unit hold the hair and would work for me otherwise.</li>
            <li> This is the only round brush blow dryer that doesn&#x27;t tangle my hair into knots as you unroll it.  I love this dryer and would highly recommend it to anyone with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product, wish I had purchased it years ago!!!&#x27; Best curls in town!!</li>
            <li> It was OK. I just thought thar the device does not turn your hair while drying. But it is OK.</li>
            <li> Love this hot air styling brush. Just what I order. Love the product I gave it a 5 star.</li>
            <li> This makes blow drying my hair really easy and hassle free. this was a really good buy for me, but i must say i was hoping to have super straight hair but i guess with my hair type ( natural, and very kinky) i didn&#x27;t get that, but if you use a great flat iron you&#x27;ll be able to do once pass over your hair and get a sleek straight look. also this product is not heavy at all it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li> This is the only styling brush that works on my hair.  I have thick, wavy hair and it just glides thru my hair.  So happy I could find it with Amazon.</li>
            <li> The forced air did not have enough hear.</li>
            <li> I bought this item only because it can be used worldwide. Only after reading the manual, I realized that the DUAL VOLTAGE is only partially functional. Because when the unit is set to 220 volts, it can be used in LO heat setting only. The LO heat setting does not do much on hair for styling.&lt;br /&gt;Anybody buying this product for travel, be cautious about the DUAL VOLTAGE need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally returned it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curler for years and love it!  However ...  I&#x27;m not happy with Conairs decision to short the cord by a foot!&#x27;  Now it doesn&#x27;t reach anywhere.. I Have to bend and stretch to use it now :(</li>
            <li> I misunderstood the description to say the cylinder heated up, but it does not.  It is just hot air blowing through that transfers a little heat to the cylinder.  May work OK on long hair, but not short.  I returned it to Amazon which gave a very fast refund.</li>
            <li> Doenst the title of this review say it all? It doesnt dry nor does it straighten.. sigh.... Dont waste your money on this</li>
            <li> If this ever sold for $29.99 as stated on the website I would be floored.  It is cheap as heck and rips your hair out.  I am so mad because life got busy and now I can&#x27;t return the piece of junk.  I&#x27;ve used Conair brushes similar in the past &amp; loved them.  Not this one.  It shouldn&#x27;t be purchased... EVER.</li>
            <li> Bought this as it was one of the only dual voltage hot air brushes available.  Do not recommend!!!  Worked fine in US but first use in France was a melt-down.  Do not waste your money if you need it to work on foreign voltage.</li>
            <li> it didnt work, ruined my hair, tangles my hair and wasnt able to get free for an hour. DO NOT BUY if you have fine hair. It MIGHT work only with really dense hair!</li>
            <li> Conair is a great product, however my hair is difficult to curl.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like this.  The barrels just didn&#x27;t seem to stay locked in place, finally the whole thing broke so it ended up in the trash.</li>
            <li> I so wanted this to work but it didn&#x27;t and I am out the money becuase of course, I opened the package to try it out.  Maybe conair just has puny horsepower. This didn&#x27;t do the job, and I am very sorry I bought it.</li>
            <li> I use this basically when I travel to lighten my load.  I don&#x27;t want to drag hot rollers with me.  You have to dry your hair somewhat first or it will take you forever.  It works for my wavy hair to make it look smooth.</li>
            <li> It turned out that I CHOSE too big a size for my hair, otherwise I love it.  Never had a quick drying styling brush before.  Now I am looking for a smaller sized barrel, maybe 1 inch.</li>
            <li> I have tried it every time I have done my hair and am very satisfied.  Very little hair was lost.</li>
            <li> Dual voltage was the key to this purchase, but it meets all expectations for drying and styling hair all at once.</li>
            <li> This product should not be in the market. The first one I bought was broken into pieces.I sent it back and was replaced but same thing happen again broke into pieces&lt;br /&gt;when I tried to switch the other attachment. Send it back to China cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I have short hair and it does the job perfectly! I may try a newer stronger version of this later. But so far so good and I love it! I actually dropped it in tub full of water and soapâ€¦.well, I thought that was it and I had to throw it away...I dried it and left it in a corner and tried it a day laterâ€¦.surprisingly, it  still works perfectly ! I have short hair and if you have long hair, u may need a stronger version.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Conair Hot Air Curling Combo for years, but am having more and more of a problem finding one local.  This is a great little appliance and I wouldn&#x27;t consider changing to something else!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use styling tool without fear of burning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product. I have had two before and my last one, of three years, died finally so I went to buy a replacement but could not find one anywhere. This Hot Air curling iron is a great price and it works great for my hair, which is on the thicker side and wavy. I can do anything from baby-doll curls with this thing to soft shiny waves or use it to shine my hair and give it some shape after straightening. It&#x27;s a good multipurpose tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipment on this thing was crazy fast. I ordered it and the third day it came to me. I did a test just now to see if it works and it does. Nothing was wrong with the packaging or the product. When I need one again I will defiantly buy from this person/business again.</li>
            <li> I used this product maybe 5 times before the cord sparked and started smoking while in my hair.  Needless to say I will not be using it again.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product!  I had one of these for probably twenty years before the motor finally gave out.  Ordered this newer generation one to replace my old Conair and let me just say, they don&#x27;t make them like they used to.  I had to wrap the cord at the base with gorilla tape just to get it to make constant contact so the dryer would actually run.  With that problem solved, the third time I used it, the metal brush portion broke off the plastic base part that locks onto the handle.  I&#x27;ll be looking for another brand to try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife after she saw one like it in a mailer. This exceeds the capability of the one from the mailer at a less expensive price. She is very pleased with it. It was delivered 6 days before the scheduled delivery date.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair shiny and silky</li>
            <li> I use this after drying my medium length, semi-wavy hair.  It helps to give the volume I want and smooth where I want it.  I bought another so I have a back-up.</li>
            <li> Not too hot.  Great curls and tames my crazy hair</li>
            <li> This product was alright. My only problem is that it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. Because it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough, it takes longer to blowdry hair.</li>
            <li> The amount of air that is blown out is minimal. I have a substantial amount of hair and you really have to spend some time to get any result from this thing. If you hair is long or thick, I think you would be better off with a hairdryer. Nice idea though... I also only use one of the brushes. The comb hurts my scalp to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original package got sent to the wrong house, but amazon was very good and resent me another. I can&#x27;t complain other than the product wasn&#x27;t really made for someone like me.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair dryer/styler.  Have used this type for years</li>
            <li> I had a Conair Styling Brush for years that heated up really well.  This one doesn&#x27;t seem to get very hot but it works ok.</li>
            <li> This item does not work.  If you want hot air it only works at the lowest airflow.  Either way, it just doesn&#x27;t have the airflow or heat needed to work at all.  Not sure if I got a defective product or if they are all this way.</li>
            <li> My old one died and I needed a replacement.  This one is exactly the same and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this brand of air brush for quite a few years. I have fine, straight, shoulder-length hair, and I love this for finishing off my hair. I use a regular blow dryer and blow it until it&#x27;s almost dry, then give myself some wave with this styling brush. Although I like this product, and it works great for my hair, I have found that their life expectancy is very short. I&#x27;m on my fourth or fifth one. When I used mine yesterday, it was working when I switched it off and put it away. Tried turning it on this morning...no dice...and this has happened with every one I&#x27;ve owned. It&#x27;s almost as if they have a programmed number of on-off&#x27;s and then you&#x27;re done. I see there is a comparable product, and I&#x27;m trying something different.</li>
            <li> works well but i wish it was a bit stronger hairdryer</li>
            <li> The bristols on the smaller brush are very soft and do not grasp the hair wll.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this item.  Itâ€™s great for touch-ups.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for a recent vacation to London and was excited to have a dual voltage dryer to use when I travel internationally.  First thing to note is that if you use this item on European voltage (220/240), the dryer will not go up to \\&quot;high\\&quot; speed, it will only work on low.  But I was willing to deal with that minor inconvenience.  I used it the first day I was there and it worked okay, though it took a long time to dry my hair on just low speed.  Then I went to use it the second day and it was completely dead.  And before anyone asks, yes I did adjust the voltage on the dryer to UK voltage before I plugged it in and turned it on.  I don&#x27;t know what happened, but I ended up having to buy a local model by a different manufacturer, which I will now use when I travel internationally.  Buy this item at your own risk - and have a back-up plan on how you will style your hair if you plan to take this with you on vacation outside the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not yet tried this dryer on US voltage to see if it will still work at home, now that I&#x27;ve returned.  However, it doesn&#x27;t really matter, since I purchased it for use when I travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 12/09/2012 - I tested this at my home in the US and now the dryer works again.  But since I bought it to use when I travel, this is really not particularly helpful.</li>
            <li> I just got my shipment and was disappointed. I expected an interchangeable curling iron and brush but this just comes with two brushes.</li>
            <li> Simplified Hair Styling! I was a skeptic, but I tried it because it was made by Conair. When I used it, I loved it, and bought 6, for gifts, and for my own back up, so I&#x27;ll never be without it.&lt;br /&gt;I always used (and packed and traveled with) my 2,000w Conair hair dryer that dried my hair straight in 10 minutes, and then I curled the ends with my 20 year old Conair 1 3/4\\&quot; curling iron with plastic comb type teeth, which they stopped making over 10 years ago. Hotel hair dryers barely blow and take forever, and regular smooth curling irons always burn my fingers. This blowing curling iron with comb teeth like my old one dries my hair very quickly, straight and smooth, rounded and full, and curled under or out, or a natural looking blend of both. It is fast, light, not noisy, and very simple. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is a great styling hot air brush ...ordered two when I seen the price on Amazon prime, their more expensive in retail stores.&lt;br /&gt;The brush part is plastic and strong and goes through your hair much better then nylon bristles in my opinion, that&#x27;s why I ordered this&lt;br /&gt;model over the others.  Get hot with two heat setting LO or HIGH ...High is not too High and Hot that it burns your hair.  Some people might&lt;br /&gt;Want more hotter heat ...for me this is just fine. the high setting the heat is about medium.  Ordered two while I can still find them available..</li>
            <li> I was born with baby fine hair that never grew up.  After washing and drying my hair every morning, I use this styler to add body, and it helps.  It does not tangle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister, whose hair is norma, can use this styler all by itself and get great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To add body to my very fine hair, and to get my hair to turn under, I use this Conair styler in combination with large velcro curlers.  I heat-curl each section of hair and then I put that section onto a curler for a few minutes until the hair cools to room temperature.  This works best for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping I wouldn&#x27;t have to blow out my hair and then flat iron or curl it. It does work but my hair is not as FULL as it would be if I blow it out first however it does come out really shinny! Both attachments give a different look so try them both. I gave it 4 starts only because it&#x27;s really LOUD and I wish it had my power but I still like it.</li>
            <li> I have used these dryers for literally decades.  My only worry is that it will stop being made; can&#x27;t find it anywhere now other than online.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Eh, wasted my money. Took way too long for my straight thin hair. I was hoping for some lift at roots but did not work. Maybe works on different hair than mine?</li>
            <li> I have been using the Conair hot air brush since it first came out. I love how it works. The fist models were great and lasted a really long time. The newer ones don&#x27;t last as long. I had the gold barrel one for many years, but unfortunately it gave out. The next one I bought had a purple barrel. It only lasted a couple of years. I looked and looked for the gold barrel one but the only ones I could find were the purple ones. The picture for this is misleading.</li>
            <li> Love it and will order another when the time comes</li>
            <li> I love how fast I can dry my hair with this.</li>
    </ol>
