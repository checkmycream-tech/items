            <li>Don&#x27;t think too much more can be said about it.</li>
            <li>I love TCS.</li>
            <li>The best cleaner I have used for dental appliances,  Removed some stains that my dentist&#x27;s office couldn&#x27;t at my last cleaning.</li>
            <li>Thereproducts work the best for my partial dentures.</li>
            <li>It does that really really well!!</li>
            <li>get kind of gross by the week&#x27;s end, but it is a bit too pricey to change the solution more frequently.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is worth the money</li>
            <li>best denture cleaner on the market.is getting expensive but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m using more of the TCS product and getting 3 days less of the TCS product.</li>
            <li>only thing I really don&#x27;t like is using the same solution for a whole week, and think it would be nice to have a daily option.  </li>
            <li>All in all this is a good choice for denture cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;Since only a small amount is used from the packet at a time</li>
            <li>This special formulation is required for the type of partial I got.  </li>
            <li>,I wish it were available in a container with a lid to prevent waste from spilling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is kind of expensive</li>

            <li> I use this for other things, like cleaning the inside of a coffee thermos.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t any icky film left over like other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>

            <li> Val-Clean provided a small plastic spoon for measurement.  </li>

            <li> I needed this for my mouth guard and the site was more expensive than on here! Gotta have this because you can&#x27;t scrub guard...it needs to go into a sonic cleaner.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and keeps your Denture clean.</li>

            <li> I previously used the Val-Clean Denture Cleaner which is more expensive.  Val-Clean provided a small plastic spoon for measurement.  TCS did not but the directions are for a teaspoon which is about two-times the amount of what I used with Val-Clean.  Also, TCS recommended changing every 7 days and Val-Clean you could use from 7 to 10 days.  All in all it cleans well, is cheaper than Val-Clean but I&#x27;m using more of the TCS product and getting 3 days less of the TCS product.</li>
