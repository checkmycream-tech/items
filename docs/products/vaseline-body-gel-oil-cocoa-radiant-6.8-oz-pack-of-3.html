            <li>it makes my feel so good...</li>
            <li>think Vaseline did a good job changing the ingredients and fixing what everyone else was experiencing issues with.</li>
            <li>but otherwise.... its a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>and I am very glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with purchase, was shipped ahead of schedule, happy customer.</li>

            <li>I thought this product was amazing.</li>
            <li>Cam in perfect condition, and works very well.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I kind of liked the product.</li>
            <li>I would have avoided my own suffering and passing the suffering along, not to mention the cost.  </li>
            <li>it smooths my skin all over, conditions my cuticles as I apply it, and leaves a nice sheen on my limbs too.</li>
            <li>Great product that works awesome on the skin for dry areas.</li>
            <li>It has a wonderful, very light almond/cocoa butter scent that I find very soothing and does not give me a migraine.</li>
            <li>it leaves my skin soft and smelling delicious.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product I have ever put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feely silky smooth and smelling good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s affordable and smells lovely - a warm, cocoa butter scent, not at all obtrusive or cloying.</li>
            <li>My husband and kids love it too!d leaves a nice sheen on my limbs too.</li>
            <li>This is why I especially loved using it at night since I would wake up in the morning with baby soft skin, I&#x27;d just sit there and touch my arms over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong !</li>
            <li>Goes on easy and keeps my skin nice and hydrated.  </li>
            <li>I love it ....</li>
            <li>I have friends that use it and love it as well, too.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell, love the feel and</li>
            <li>Just an overall wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>have been using it for a year now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>The oil does not sit on top my skin, it does absorb, which I appreicate.</li>
            <li>more time today, and now my&lt;br /&gt;leg rashes have spread and I decided to look up this product.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>I also see that many others have attempted to contact Vaseline about it, and have gotten nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Today is day 3 of the rash, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting better.</li>
            <li>I thought this pesky rash was getting better, but started itching again tonite.</li>
            <li>There are many better products on the market.</li>
            <li>I truly love.</li>
            <li>Please note that I generously use many lotions and have never had this experience before.</li>
            <li>or sun-activated, so maybe it&#x27;s okay to use indoors?  </li>
            <li>He wasn&#x27;t sure what.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s to healing and feeling better for all those who have been through this nightmare.</li>
            <li>&amp; i just love it...</li>
            <li>like the Johnson and Johnson one better.  </li>
            <li>, I also found buying in bulk is so much better.  </li>
            <li>Glad to see not everyone is effected, but why take the chance?  </li>
            <li>and he got better.</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating; smells great.</li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin smooth and has an amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much better.</li>
            <li>I love using it liberally after a bath, body scrub, leg shaving and letting it soak in over night while I sleep...</li>
            <li>I love using it liberally after a bath, body scrub, leg shaving and letting it soak in over night while I sleep...</li>
            <li>I googled \\&quot;body oil skin rashes\\&quot; and found many fellow sufferers.  </li>
            <li>I wanted SOOOO very badly to love this too.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>made my skin silky, made it glow, and in a way made my skin more even toned.</li>
            <li>make sure if you buy this to do patch testing.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used it an more than a week</li>
            <li>I found this product at Target and have been very pleased with the way it slides on, dries quickly and truly</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it obsurbs quickly, because trying to get dressed in a hurry you don&#x27;t want oily residue on your nice silks and cottons.</li>
            <li>I have used this product 3-4 times and loved it at first</li>
            <li>For the first three days I loved this product.  </li>
            <li>Loved this at first.  </li>
            <li>But if you want a wonderful smelling, gel type oil that works on dry areas like elbows, ankles &amp; knees, this is the answer to your prayers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and have moderate rosacea.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft, smooth, hydrated and gives a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use products like Keri mineral oil before with no problem, but this, J&amp;J baby oil, and neutrogena&#x27;s original spray SPF break me out into what looks like a heat rash but itches like crazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Best I&#x27;ve tried so far at any price for long-lasting, really hydrated looking skin.</li>
            <li>And when I researched this I was horrified that so many people had experienced the same.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly caution use of this.</li>
            <li>The results are so fast, Ive been using it for about a week and never expected it to work this great!</li>
            <li>I fine it</li>
            <li>I was super excited to use this product!  </li>
            <li>Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced no rashes at all, and I even use this as a personal lubricant.</li>
            <li>Great smell,bad rash...noticed itchy red bumps on arms and stomach after about a week.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fortunate to not have any of the skin reactions or rashes as a result of using it</li>
            <li>and I thought the smell was fantastic and</li>
            <li>It was ok for the first 2 days, although I did feel overly greasy with it on.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job of moisturizing although it does leave a greasy film for a short while before being absorbed.</li>
            <li>as many others have mentioned, this product can cause an intense allergic skin reaction.</li>
            <li>This product is good , last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really used to love this product until I went organic.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a good nights sleep since last Friday because of the itching</li>
            <li>It is like a true gel-oil consistency in my opinion.</li>
            <li>If you have a busy, early-morning schedule that requires you dress in nice clothing, this is probably not the product to use at that time.</li>
            <li>gel oil smells great like the other CocoaRadiant products.</li>
            <li>I did have a problem with one of the lotions about a year ago; I emailed Vaseline&#x27;s customer service and they took care of it fairly quick.  </li>
            <li>I love this much better than regular lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not allergic to mineral oil which is the main ingredient, but I&#x27;m not quite sure about the rest.</li>
            <li>First, to the woman in the UK who reviewed this... it is available in the UK...</li>
            <li>It is a bit different than lotion but its works so much better!</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m not usually one for most drug store type brands.</li>
            <li>After spending who knows how much money on spa products, high priced lotions and organic oils (jojoba, etc) to soften my skin I am pleased to find that this product has effectively made my skin as soft as it was when I was a toddler.</li>
            <li>I bought this gel after seeing it in Fitness Magazine, finally found it at Walmart, have used it for a week and my skin is so soft and looks so much better, I will buy it again for sure!  </li>
            <li>so I was happy to find an oil gel that was a little lighter in texture.  </li>
            <li>which is a good thing, its well priced and I like to use it instead of a normal lotion or the Vaseline classic gel which is much thicker that this one</li>
            <li>The doctor actually said it looked liked Poison Ivy or Oak.</li>
            <li>Definately worth a try...</li>
            <li>It contains Brazil Nut oils which, after careful research, contain uroshiol oil which for many people is one of the most damndable poisons on the planet</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I already use Vaseline Cocoa Radiant Lotion and jelly with much success, and I adore the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This smells slightly of warm skin - that traditional sunny, cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li>see that it also caused a rash for many, many other customers, and had been doing so for years.</li>
            <li>I put it on after the shower and it soaks in pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other things from Palmers to Bio-oil and nothing has worked as good as this.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t appear right away</li>
            <li>I use it right after my shower and there is no need for lotion.  </li>
            <li>He puts it on in the shower right before he gets out.  </li>
            <li>My right lower leg feels like it&#x27;s burning.  </li>
            <li>I have very dry, bumpy skin, but when I use this my skin is amazingly softer &amp; smoother, the bumpy, rough skin disappears &amp; I feel a lot more confident.</li>
            <li>I highly reccommend using neutrogena light sesame oil  </li>
            <li>One would think and hope that with so many apparent problems with a product it would be pulled from the market to protect the unsuspecting public.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I might not wear this outside, but it works great for night use, especially when you use on your feet and put socks on.</li>
            <li>The results are velvety soft and silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m nearing the end of my first bottle and plan to buy another.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty upset that there was no warning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thought it was heat rash, as the temperatures have been hot here.  </li>
            <li>I did buy this product when it was first released; perhaps the ingredients changed?&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just love this product and only wish I could buy it in the UK.  </li>
            <li>The first couple of days I noticed that my skin was itching a lot.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product a week ago and after 4 days of use my arms are covered with an intense rash!</li>
            <li>This product should come with a warning to test a patch of skin first and wait a day or two.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist said that any product whose first ingredient is water is not going to help with moisturizing and hydration.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
            <li>At first I didnt know what it was</li>
            <li>that still smelled like the vaseline oil and sure enough breakout again the rash was back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>voila, the first review was referencing a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I see that many people are reporting a red rash that came up after about 3 days of using this product.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I saw this site to see that I am not the only one.</li>
            <li>I had also started noticing itchy bumps on my legs, but didn&#x27;t make the connection at first.  </li>
            <li>I admit I would&#x27;ve did a patch test if I&#x27;d read the reviews about the rash first, but I hadn&#x27;t read reviews, and didn&#x27;t know that this might do that to the skin.</li>
            <li>i tried this product many years ago and stopped because of the same thing.</li>
            <li>Other than that it smells nice</li>
            <li>I have never had a problem with any other kind of oil or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used Palmers when pregnant and many other lotions...</li>
            <li>I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product - I think the company need to do more testing on it before making it available to us unsuspecting public!!</li>
            <li>Pretty much anywhere I had used this stuff, it appeared.  </li>
            <li>skin was first just very itchy on my chest and stomach and my calves...</li>
            <li>The body oil keeps my skin moist for the entire day and it smells wonderful, but subtle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s incredibly inexpensive and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Suspected the oil but wasnt certain that was the cause until i read these reviews.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin look and feel after a shower, and the smell is light and inviting(scent doesn&#x27;t last long but not an issue for me).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the Hydrogenated Styrene/Butadiene Copolymer in it, because I&#x27;m not allergic to any of the other stuff.  </li>
            <li>Personally, I don&#x27;t seem to be allergic to it, and I love how it keeps my skin so soft!</li>
            <li>I used a tiny dab per section of my body, and it all sank right into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li>Just intense moisturization...</li>
            <li>, it leaves a very sticky residue that takes forever to sink in though</li>
            <li>Let me know, I really like the stuff.</li>
            <li>Really wish I&#x27;d read reviews before buying this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really scared that it won&#x27;t go away...</li>
            <li>You want to be careful with it and make sure it fully absorbs into your skin before putting clothing on or going to bed.</li>
            <li>If I used too much</li>
            <li>The whole family uses this...</li>
            <li>My whole family uses this body oil gel and none of us have ever had the slightest problem with it whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>As I don&#x27;t have a busy morning schedule I am able to wear old clothes for a half-hour or so until the residue soaks in completely or dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>not sure how this could cause a reaction in so many people!</li>
            <li>Like many of the other reviewers, I had an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>Nice cocoa butter smell, good oil, gelled so its less messy, and feels like you would expect \\&quot;regular\\&quot; baby oil to feel she used in the same way.  </li>
            <li>Thought it would be fantastic and really moisturising after long days in the sea and at the pool.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>You will stay silky smooth all day long.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, nor is this the first time I&#x27;ve used a Vaseline product.</li>
            <li>I tried it and it was fantastic for my dry skin.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, the steroid shot I received helped and the next day the itch was nearly all gone.  </li>
            <li>you must rub in very well (more than regular lotion) but it will leave your skin so soft hours later....</li>
            <li>My skin drinks this stuff up and it makes it feel so soft and supple for the whole day.</li>
            <li>So far, I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>Scent is important to me - I either like things totally unscented or lightly scented in a way that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the few perfumes I wear, albeit sparingly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally have allergic reactions to products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste the money going to a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>i apply it everyday &amp; love it..</li>
            <li>In the store, Johnson&#x27;s Cocoa Baby oil and this gel-oil had the exact same ingredients, so I assume it much be safer now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product three times over a 2 day period on normal and tattooed skin with no issues.</li>
            <li>I now use all natural 100% organic coconut oil which has a similar feel and great smell and is free of all artificial ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The new version, the Cocoa Radiant doesn&#x27;t contain either of those oils.</li>
            <li>First let me say I&#x27;ve never bought from this seller, I buy this product from my local walmart.</li>
            <li>This actually works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li>Was excited to use this product as I have used other body oils (Neutrogena) and&lt;br /&gt;loved them.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a body wash, but as I read further, I realized it was a body gel.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, after buying 2 bottles, I hadnt gotten around to putting the other one in the kids shower!</li>
            <li>Its a really nice product that I use for my dry skin its a little shinny but not oily</li>
            <li>Be careful- do a patch test first!</li>
            <li>Saw some people developed a rash</li>
            <li>It has a gel like consistency that is tacky to the touch, makes skin shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It did not leave an oily feel to my skin, just soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li>(if you are sensitive to poison oak</li>
            <li>WIthin three days, I had developed a rash on my arms and chest.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin and regret not researching this before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking lawyer and class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only product I have found that really  works for me.</li>
            <li>I would not classify my skin as being sensitive.</li>
            <li>locks in the natural moisture in your skin.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>After using it daily for three days I noticed my skin was visibly smoother and felt much softer.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of dryness near my knees, ankles, shoulders and elbows.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and my chest and neck area</li>
            <li>Before I bought this I read the reviews, but it didn&#x27;t deter me since the reviews about rashes are almost 4-5 years old, and from my research Vaseline changed the ingredients since then.</li>
            <li>I am surprised they have not addressed this, considering I am seeing some reviews from 2011.  </li>
            <li>and this is the only product that really moisturizes and softens my skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially terrific after leg shaving or sun exposure, very soothing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a terrific all-around body moisturizer -</li>
            <li>I woke up with butter soft skin.</li>
            <li>skin red and very irritated.</li>
            <li>The sad thing is I loved the texture of this body oil.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty rich so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>The main ingredient is mineral oil which is the same thing used in baby oil....</li>
            <li>: super greasy, slightly sticky (not a massage oil)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used just a small dab on my old surgery scars to keep them moisturized and smooth after the shower.</li>
            <li>I usually prefer lotion for more bodily coverage, but this works well for my pampering</li>
            <li>Having spent a fortune on a variety of body moisturisers from much more expensive brands, I&#x27;ve finally found a product that deals effectively with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>may be a bit much in the summer especially if you will be outside alot</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;m actually glad I&#x27;m not the only one..was especially worried since I&#x27;m pregnant and anything weird is cause for worry...</li>
            <li>First I dry body brush for about ten minutes.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and sinks in easily, but my skin reacted really badly to it.  </li>
            <li>This far exceeds the need for standard lotion.</li>
            <li>I would get something different seeing how many people have the same complaint.</li>
            <li>and on the next day my face was completely swollen...</li>
            <li>My girlfriend developed a severe and itchy rash on several occasions while using this product.  </li>
            <li>it left my skin feeling really soft after using it.</li>
            <li>Considering so many have broken out from this, I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li>This has a nice feel and smells faintly of chocolate.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be getting worse than better.  </li>
            <li>So obviously I have very sensitive skin with multiple sensitivities and allergies.</li>
            <li>I bought the Vaseline Vitalizing Gel Body Oil because I&#x27;m pregnant and noticed my skin was drier than usual.  </li>
            <li>and I note that many of these comments date back a few years!!!  </li>
            <li>Two days later, I developed a red itchy rash that was so severe</li>
            <li>/&gt;It could be the type of oil used (may form a solid in the pores, which blocks them from releasing your natural body oils and produces an immune response), or could be fragrance related.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry so many people have developed rashes after using this product.</li>
            <li>I use it directly after a shower and it does not take long for it to absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li>really helps to cut down on the itching.</li>
            <li>used this on my 6 yr old sun because he had been going in the pool a lot and his skin was dry.</li>
            <li>It can tend to feel a little greasy when you put to much on</li>
    </ol>

            <li> have fair skin, some sun damage, that is not prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> it makes my feel so good...</li>
            <li> think Vaseline did a good job changing the ingredients and fixing what everyone else was experiencing issues with.</li>
            <li> but otherwise.... its a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> and I am very glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with purchase, was shipped ahead of schedule, happy customer.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s  $6 close to $7 but for the product itself, I absolutely LOVE this stuff!</li>

            <li> I thought this product was amazing.</li>
            <li> Cam in perfect condition, and works very well.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I kind of liked the product.</li>
            <li> I would have avoided my own suffering and passing the suffering along, not to mention the cost.  </li>
            <li> it smooths my skin all over, conditions my cuticles as I apply it, and leaves a nice sheen on my limbs too.</li>
            <li> Great product that works awesome on the skin for dry areas.</li>
            <li> It has a wonderful, very light almond/cocoa butter scent that I find very soothing and does not give me a migraine.</li>
            <li> it leaves my skin soft and smelling delicious.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feely silky smooth and smelling good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s affordable and smells lovely - a warm, cocoa butter scent, not at all obtrusive or cloying.</li>
            <li> My husband and kids love it too!d leaves a nice sheen on my limbs too.</li>
            <li> This is why I especially loved using it at night since I would wake up in the morning with baby soft skin, I&#x27;d just sit there and touch my arms over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still going strong !</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and keeps my skin nice and hydrated.  </li>
            <li> I love it ....</li>
            <li> I have friends that use it and love it as well, too.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell, love the feel and</li>
            <li> Just an overall wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> have been using it for a year now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> The oil does not sit on top my skin, it does absorb, which I appreicate.</li>
            <li> more time today, and now my&lt;br /&gt;leg rashes have spread and I decided to look up this product.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I also see that many others have attempted to contact Vaseline about it, and have gotten nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Today is day 3 of the rash, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting better.</li>
            <li> I thought this pesky rash was getting better, but started itching again tonite.</li>
            <li> There are many better products on the market.</li>
            <li> I truly love.</li>
            <li> Please note that I generously use many lotions and have never had this experience before.</li>
            <li> or sun-activated, so maybe it&#x27;s okay to use indoors?  </li>
            <li> He wasn&#x27;t sure what.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s to healing and feeling better for all those who have been through this nightmare.</li>
            <li> &amp; i just love it...</li>
            <li> like the Johnson and Johnson one better.  </li>
            <li> , I also found buying in bulk is so much better.  </li>
            <li> Glad to see not everyone is effected, but why take the chance?  </li>
            <li> and he got better.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating; smells great.</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin smooth and has an amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  </li>
            <li> I like it so much better.</li>
            <li> I love using it liberally after a bath, body scrub, leg shaving and letting it soak in over night while I sleep...</li>
            <li> I love using it liberally after a bath, body scrub, leg shaving and letting it soak in over night while I sleep...</li>
            <li> I googled \\&quot;body oil skin rashes\\&quot; and found many fellow sufferers.  </li>
            <li> I wanted SOOOO very badly to love this too.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like, I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> made my skin silky, made it glow, and in a way made my skin more even toned.</li>
            <li> make sure if you buy this to do patch testing.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it an more than a week</li>
            <li> I found this product at Target and have been very pleased with the way it slides on, dries quickly and truly</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it obsurbs quickly, because trying to get dressed in a hurry you don&#x27;t want oily residue on your nice silks and cottons.</li>
            <li> I have used this product 3-4 times and loved it at first</li>
            <li> For the first three days I loved this product.  </li>
            <li> Loved this at first.  </li>
            <li> But if you want a wonderful smelling, gel type oil that works on dry areas like elbows, ankles &amp; knees, this is the answer to your prayers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and have moderate rosacea.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft, smooth, hydrated and gives a beautiful glow.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to use products like Keri mineral oil before with no problem, but this, J&amp;J baby oil, and neutrogena&#x27;s original spray SPF break me out into what looks like a heat rash but itches like crazy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve tried so far at any price for long-lasting, really hydrated looking skin.</li>
            <li> And when I researched this I was horrified that so many people had experienced the same.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly caution use of this.</li>
            <li> The results are so fast, Ive been using it for about a week and never expected it to work this great!</li>
            <li> I fine it</li>
            <li> I was super excited to use this product!  </li>
            <li> Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced no rashes at all, and I even use this as a personal lubricant.</li>
            <li> Great smell,bad rash...noticed itchy red bumps on arms and stomach after about a week.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fortunate to not have any of the skin reactions or rashes as a result of using it</li>
            <li> and I thought the smell was fantastic and</li>
            <li> It was ok for the first 2 days, although I did feel overly greasy with it on.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job of moisturizing although it does leave a greasy film for a short while before being absorbed.</li>
            <li> as many others have mentioned, this product can cause an intense allergic skin reaction.</li>
            <li> This product is good , last longer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really used to love this product until I went organic.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a good nights sleep since last Friday because of the itching</li>
            <li> It is like a true gel-oil consistency in my opinion.</li>
            <li> If you have a busy, early-morning schedule that requires you dress in nice clothing, this is probably not the product to use at that time.</li>
            <li> gel oil smells great like the other CocoaRadiant products.</li>
            <li> I did have a problem with one of the lotions about a year ago; I emailed Vaseline&#x27;s customer service and they took care of it fairly quick.  </li>
            <li> I love this much better than regular lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not allergic to mineral oil which is the main ingredient, but I&#x27;m not quite sure about the rest.</li>
            <li> First, to the woman in the UK who reviewed this... it is available in the UK...</li>
            <li> It is a bit different than lotion but its works so much better!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not usually one for most drug store type brands.</li>
            <li> After spending who knows how much money on spa products, high priced lotions and organic oils (jojoba, etc) to soften my skin I am pleased to find that this product has effectively made my skin as soft as it was when I was a toddler.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel after seeing it in Fitness Magazine, finally found it at Walmart, have used it for a week and my skin is so soft and looks so much better, I will buy it again for sure!  </li>
            <li> so I was happy to find an oil gel that was a little lighter in texture.  </li>
            <li> which is a good thing, its well priced and I like to use it instead of a normal lotion or the Vaseline classic gel which is much thicker that this one</li>
            <li> The doctor actually said it looked liked Poison Ivy or Oak.</li>
            <li> Definately worth a try...</li>
            <li> It contains Brazil Nut oils which, after careful research, contain uroshiol oil which for many people is one of the most damndable poisons on the planet</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin so soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I already use Vaseline Cocoa Radiant Lotion and jelly with much success, and I adore the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This smells slightly of warm skin - that traditional sunny, cocoa butter smell.</li>
            <li> see that it also caused a rash for many, many other customers, and had been doing so for years.</li>
            <li> I put it on after the shower and it soaks in pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things from Palmers to Bio-oil and nothing has worked as good as this.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t appear right away</li>
            <li> I use it right after my shower and there is no need for lotion.  </li>
            <li> He puts it on in the shower right before he gets out.  </li>
            <li> My right lower leg feels like it&#x27;s burning.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry, bumpy skin, but when I use this my skin is amazingly softer &amp; smoother, the bumpy, rough skin disappears &amp; I feel a lot more confident.</li>
            <li> I highly reccommend using neutrogena light sesame oil  </li>
            <li> One would think and hope that with so many apparent problems with a product it would be pulled from the market to protect the unsuspecting public.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I might not wear this outside, but it works great for night use, especially when you use on your feet and put socks on.</li>
            <li> The results are velvety soft and silky smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m nearing the end of my first bottle and plan to buy another.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty upset that there was no warning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thought it was heat rash, as the temperatures have been hot here.  </li>
            <li> I did buy this product when it was first released; perhaps the ingredients changed?&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just love this product and only wish I could buy it in the UK.  </li>
            <li> The first couple of days I noticed that my skin was itching a lot.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product a week ago and after 4 days of use my arms are covered with an intense rash!</li>
            <li> This product should come with a warning to test a patch of skin first and wait a day or two.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said that any product whose first ingredient is water is not going to help with moisturizing and hydration.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your skin smooth and soft all day.</li>
            <li> At first I didnt know what it was</li>
            <li> that still smelled like the vaseline oil and sure enough breakout again the rash was back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> voila, the first review was referencing a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I see that many people are reporting a red rash that came up after about 3 days of using this product.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I saw this site to see that I am not the only one.</li>
            <li> I had also started noticing itchy bumps on my legs, but didn&#x27;t make the connection at first.  </li>
            <li> I admit I would&#x27;ve did a patch test if I&#x27;d read the reviews about the rash first, but I hadn&#x27;t read reviews, and didn&#x27;t know that this might do that to the skin.</li>
            <li> i tried this product many years ago and stopped because of the same thing.</li>
            <li> Other than that it smells nice</li>
            <li> I have never had a problem with any other kind of oil or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Palmers when pregnant and many other lotions...</li>
            <li> I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product - I think the company need to do more testing on it before making it available to us unsuspecting public!!</li>
            <li> Pretty much anywhere I had used this stuff, it appeared.  </li>
            <li> skin was first just very itchy on my chest and stomach and my calves...</li>
            <li> The body oil keeps my skin moist for the entire day and it smells wonderful, but subtle</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s incredibly inexpensive and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Suspected the oil but wasnt certain that was the cause until i read these reviews.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin look and feel after a shower, and the smell is light and inviting(scent doesn&#x27;t last long but not an issue for me).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the Hydrogenated Styrene/Butadiene Copolymer in it, because I&#x27;m not allergic to any of the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> Personally, I don&#x27;t seem to be allergic to it, and I love how it keeps my skin so soft!</li>
            <li> I used a tiny dab per section of my body, and it all sank right into my skin quickly.</li>
            <li> Just intense moisturization...</li>
            <li> , it leaves a very sticky residue that takes forever to sink in though</li>
            <li> Let me know, I really like the stuff.</li>
            <li> Really wish I&#x27;d read reviews before buying this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really scared that it won&#x27;t go away...</li>
            <li> You want to be careful with it and make sure it fully absorbs into your skin before putting clothing on or going to bed.</li>
            <li> If I used too much</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this...</li>
            <li> My whole family uses this body oil gel and none of us have ever had the slightest problem with it whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> As I don&#x27;t have a busy morning schedule I am able to wear old clothes for a half-hour or so until the residue soaks in completely or dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure how this could cause a reaction in so many people!</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I had an allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> Nice cocoa butter smell, good oil, gelled so its less messy, and feels like you would expect \\&quot;regular\\&quot; baby oil to feel she used in the same way.  </li>
            <li> Thought it would be fantastic and really moisturising after long days in the sea and at the pool.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> You will stay silky smooth all day long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, nor is this the first time I&#x27;ve used a Vaseline product.</li>
            <li> I tried it and it was fantastic for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, the steroid shot I received helped and the next day the itch was nearly all gone.  </li>
            <li> you must rub in very well (more than regular lotion) but it will leave your skin so soft hours later....</li>
            <li> My skin drinks this stuff up and it makes it feel so soft and supple for the whole day.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> Scent is important to me - I either like things totally unscented or lightly scented in a way that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the few perfumes I wear, albeit sparingly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally have allergic reactions to products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste the money going to a dermatologist.  </li>
            <li> i apply it everyday &amp; love it..</li>
            <li> In the store, Johnson&#x27;s Cocoa Baby oil and this gel-oil had the exact same ingredients, so I assume it much be safer now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product three times over a 2 day period on normal and tattooed skin with no issues.</li>
            <li> I now use all natural 100% organic coconut oil which has a similar feel and great smell and is free of all artificial ingredients.  </li>
            <li> The new version, the Cocoa Radiant doesn&#x27;t contain either of those oils.</li>
            <li> First let me say I&#x27;ve never bought from this seller, I buy this product from my local walmart.</li>
            <li> This actually works pretty well for me.</li>
            <li> Was excited to use this product as I have used other body oils (Neutrogena) and&lt;br /&gt;loved them.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a body wash, but as I read further, I realized it was a body gel.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, after buying 2 bottles, I hadnt gotten around to putting the other one in the kids shower!</li>
            <li> Its a really nice product that I use for my dry skin its a little shinny but not oily</li>
            <li> Be careful- do a patch test first!</li>
            <li> Saw some people developed a rash</li>
            <li> It has a gel like consistency that is tacky to the touch, makes skin shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> It did not leave an oily feel to my skin, just soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I have fairly sensitive skin</li>
            <li> (if you are sensitive to poison oak</li>
            <li> WIthin three days, I had developed a rash on my arms and chest.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin and regret not researching this before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking lawyer and class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only product I have found that really  works for me.</li>
            <li> I would not classify my skin as being sensitive.</li>
            <li> locks in the natural moisture in your skin.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> After using it daily for three days I noticed my skin was visibly smoother and felt much softer.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of dryness near my knees, ankles, shoulders and elbows.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and my chest and neck area</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I read the reviews, but it didn&#x27;t deter me since the reviews about rashes are almost 4-5 years old, and from my research Vaseline changed the ingredients since then.</li>
            <li> I am surprised they have not addressed this, considering I am seeing some reviews from 2011.  </li>
            <li> and this is the only product that really moisturizes and softens my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially terrific after leg shaving or sun exposure, very soothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a terrific all-around body moisturizer -</li>
            <li> I woke up with butter soft skin.</li>
            <li> skin red and very irritated.</li>
            <li> The sad thing is I loved the texture of this body oil.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty rich so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> The main ingredient is mineral oil which is the same thing used in baby oil....</li>
            <li> : super greasy, slightly sticky (not a massage oil)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used just a small dab on my old surgery scars to keep them moisturized and smooth after the shower.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer lotion for more bodily coverage, but this works well for my pampering</li>
            <li> Having spent a fortune on a variety of body moisturisers from much more expensive brands, I&#x27;ve finally found a product that deals effectively with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> may be a bit much in the summer especially if you will be outside alot</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m actually glad I&#x27;m not the only one..was especially worried since I&#x27;m pregnant and anything weird is cause for worry...</li>
            <li> First I dry body brush for about ten minutes.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and sinks in easily, but my skin reacted really badly to it.  </li>
            <li> This far exceeds the need for standard lotion.</li>
            <li> I would get something different seeing how many people have the same complaint.</li>
            <li> and on the next day my face was completely swollen...</li>
            <li> My girlfriend developed a severe and itchy rash on several occasions while using this product.  </li>
            <li> it left my skin feeling really soft after using it.</li>
            <li> Considering so many have broken out from this, I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> This has a nice feel and smells faintly of chocolate.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be getting worse than better.  </li>
            <li> So obviously I have very sensitive skin with multiple sensitivities and allergies.</li>
            <li> I bought the Vaseline Vitalizing Gel Body Oil because I&#x27;m pregnant and noticed my skin was drier than usual.  </li>
            <li> and I note that many of these comments date back a few years!!!  </li>
            <li> Two days later, I developed a red itchy rash that was so severe</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be the type of oil used (may form a solid in the pores, which blocks them from releasing your natural body oils and produces an immune response), or could be fragrance related.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry so many people have developed rashes after using this product.</li>
            <li> I use it directly after a shower and it does not take long for it to absorb into my skin.</li>
            <li> really helps to cut down on the itching.</li>
            <li> used this on my 6 yr old sun because he had been going in the pool a lot and his skin was dry.</li>
            <li> It can tend to feel a little greasy when you put to much on</li>
            <li> Hope this helps someone, but once again, judging from these comments I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this seller &amp; try a store near you or other verified online store.</li>
            <li> , along with other family members, have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I attributed the breakout originally to dying my hair and could not explain how I broke out behind the knee under my arm under my breasts ETC.</li>
            <li> I loved how soft this made my dry skin, but it is not worth the ugly, red, bumpy rash all over my neck, chest, arms, hands, and legs.</li>
            <li> It sinks right into my skin with the small amount I use.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands constantly, so I have horribly dry and cracked hands in the winter, and this is one of the only products that keeps my hands moisturized.</li>
            <li> and this is only thing I find that works all day long.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s hard to get off my hands after I use it, but I don&#x27;t mind it that much.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that so many people had a bad reaction to this stuff.</li>
            <li> The Vaseline Cocoa Butter Gel Body Oil not only soothes severly dry skin, but it also maintains the moisture in your skin.  </li>
            <li> I am very dissatisfied with this product, and judging by all the negative reviews I am not the only one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hydrating yet the gel formula makes it far less messy than other body oil products.</li>
            <li> After my female friend saw the results of my using the product on my very dry skin, I got her a bottle too.  </li>
            <li> I experience very dry skin after shaving my legs, enough that I have gone to waxing.</li>
            <li> for a few days to let my arm rash clear up and started using the oil again</li>
            <li> I have eczema and a long history of allergies and skin issues, so it would seem like if anyone would have a reaction to it, it would be me.  </li>
            <li> But what it has done to my skin-which is normally not sensitive to lotions...</li>
            <li> Its been one week since and the rash is taking really long to go away.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m curious to know what ingredient(s) is/are in it that would cause such a reaction.</li>
            <li> : Use a little bit, just a little bit of it, it smoothes very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see this product remaining in Vaseline&#x27;s product line for very long.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin so this product works well.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry &amp; scaly.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry skin</li>
            <li> I use this daily after showering and apply minimal amount onto my still wet skin.</li>
            <li> Actually it is the first time I have broken out due to a lotion.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews so far outnumber the positive ones that eventually poor sales will likely cause its demise.</li>
            <li> I noticed the rash just today when after a hot shower..which was making the itching worse.  </li>
            <li> I went down the list of things that could have possible caused this</li>
            <li> This stuff brought me out in a hottible angry hot red rash.  </li>
            <li> After I wash my hands, I immediately squeeze a small amount of it on the back of my hand and rub (the back of)</li>
            <li> am also very surprised that this product was put on shelves and these rashes&lt;br /&gt;seem to be a common thing.  </li>
            <li> and I initially attributed it to poison ivy or some weed in my garden, but the more I thought about it, it became apparent that the awful rash only showed up on my arms and legs,</li>
            <li> Little raised red bumps.  </li>
            <li> I did some internet research and found numerous people with same complaint.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is that if you want to try this product, use it on an isolated area for a few days before using it on your entire body.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with rash, but be careful because it seems to give a lot of people rashes.</li>
            <li> Then on the 3rd day I noticed a few bumps...</li>
            <li> I am curious if this has to do with nut</li>
            <li> I am curious how I have not experienced any rashes; especially since I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the rash for a week now and its not much improved.</li>
            <li> Please be careful...</li>
            <li> the weather is harsh and this is the only product that seems to seal in moisture on my skin...........</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this, but then I broke out in a horrible red rash all over my arms and chest where I had applied it.  </li>
            <li> but Im not certain that it was the product that was the culprit since it went away within an hour</li>
            <li> I normally do not have sensitive skin, but after several days of using this I broke out into a scary rash all over my body.</li>
            <li> It does take some time to absorb, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Dry climates like Afghanistan can be hard on the skin and this is a big help.</li>
            <li> I had never had a reaction to any other moisturizer or beauty product.  </li>
            <li> Use product with extreme caution</li>
            <li> Not sure how this would work with Caucasian skins though - it might be too sticky, but for anyone with afro or mixed race skin, it&#x27;s a dream product.</li>
            <li> I will not buy any other Vaseline products until they remove this from the shelves or reformulate it, and I encourage others to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thankfully I did not use it on any other part of my body.</li>
            <li> so I kept out of the sun, had cool showers and used cold compresses.</li>
            <li> (now, I see it was due to using the product that broke me out)</li>
            <li> Also, as mentioned before my skin does not break out, and this product is oil-based so test it out on a small portion of skin before using it on your entire body.</li>
            <li> , it gets especially dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> It has nothing to do with but allergies, which are allergies to specific nut proteins - proteins which are left behind in the oil extraction process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a problem with dry skin year round</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m just hoping that it will go down over the next few days!</li>
            <li> However, after using this product only twice, a severely itchy, painful, bumpy red rash appeared the day following last use.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it smelled and felt until a horrible rash overtook my legs.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;rub in\\&quot; completely like a lotion or cream would; it does leave behind a residue.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still waiting on it going down.  </li>
            <li> And my stretch marks are about half as dark as they were.</li>
            <li> This product caused a nasty red rash after two uses that took more than a week to go away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tonight I decided to look the product up on the Internet and have been saddened and floored at how many others have had the same awful experience with rashes and itching</li>
            <li> I wish I could have read the previous reviews before using it.</li>
            <li> I onl&#x3D;saved less than a dollar.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find - at least in this formulation (as opposed to the spray) -</li>
            <li> The previous version of this product which was the Vasoline Cocoa Butter vitalizing gel, contained Brazil Nut and Almond Oil.</li>
            <li> Then, a day later, it was on the insides of my elbows and slowly moved down my forearms, then it appeared behind my knees, on my upper thighs, my lower stomach, and my hips.  </li>
            <li> Harsh water usually creates issues with dry skin.</li>
            <li> or otherwise you&#x27;ll be a shiny, gleaming mess.</li>
            <li> (I use it in the shower, it&#x27;s less messy and wont get over applied that way.).</li>
            <li> It does seem a little greasy, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it</li>
            <li> Whatever it is, I am practically drawing blood due to the excessive itching I experience.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my stretch marks from pregnancy and a few scars.</li>
            <li> I purchased a few of these</li>
            <li> of the cons.&lt;br /&gt;It is messy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to certain dyes that are in dish soaps, a particular laundry detergent, and some newspaper inks too, all of which have given me terrible rashes.</li>
            <li> I imagine I&#x27;d be a slick oily mess.</li>
            <li> OTOH, if you do have skin as dry as I do that involves red, rough, chapped patches and terrible itching, then use it at night and wear some old pajamas you don&#x27;t care anything about.</li>
            <li> But once you start to rub it in, it applies like an oil; thinner than petrolatum but thicker than a plain oil.</li>
            <li> My skin feels like chicken skin now with dozens and dozens of red, tiny, hard little bumps all over.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s little bumps all over my legs :/</li>
            <li> No fun, and from reading other reviews looks like a tough rash to get rid of.</li>
            <li> After using this product once, I got a pretty bad rash.</li>
            <li> One week later, I am itching so bad and there are all of these red blotches on my chest, stomach, and arms.  </li>
            <li> The previous negative reviews are indeed correct.  </li>
            <li> However, I am still left with scarred legs (hoping this isn&#x27;t permanent), out of $100 due to going to an Urgent Care facility and experienced a terrible, painful weekend!  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not overwhelming.     </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I broke out in a rash on the third day.  </li>
            <li> They should have a printed warning that says \\&quot;test in small spot before use if you have any sensitivity to poison oak.  </li>
            <li> Do not use until you&#x27;ve used on a small section of skin.  </li>
            <li> I am bi-racial and unless my skin is deeply moisturised it has an ashen look.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if the rash was Angry, I could not ascertain it&#x27;s emotional state.</li>
            <li> I only hope that anyone who is even thinking about using this awful product looks at the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue using this in small quantities on my surgery scars and after exfoliating.</li>
            <li> /&gt;DO NOT BUY OR TEST IN A SMALL AREA</li>
            <li> I also reacted with an angry red rash.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> However, after reading the reviews I also realize that it contributed to the nasty rash I developed starting on the back of my neck making its way down behind my knee and in every other uncomfortable spot.</li>
            <li> After two uses I broke out in an awful rash like many other reviewers here!!!!</li>
            <li> Not impressed, especially if it&#x27;s happening to lots of people it must have a serious irritant they should have realized.    </li>
            <li> After using this product for a few days last week I slowly developed a painful, horribly itchy rash that spread down the entire length of both of my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t wash it off.</li>
            <li> I have read a lot of negative responses regarding rashes.</li>
            <li> Has Vaseline responded to anyone&#x27;s complaint?</li>
            <li> It seems to be a common problem</li>
            <li> I developed a horrible, bumpy red rash on my calves and thighs.  </li>
            <li> After reading all these reviews I at least know why this is .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But thankfully my skin didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction.</li>
            <li> Also this oil is too thick for my taste.</li>
            <li> you will know what I mean.)  </li>
            <li> so I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s being discontinued.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The itch was so bad, I could barely eat, sleep or concentrate on anything.</li>
            <li> As with some of the other people who&#x27;ve written comments, I used this product for a few days and have now come out in a horrible itchy red rash all over my legs.</li>
            <li> If someone with a weakened immune system uses this product and gets a severe rash, it could result in serious health complications.</li>
            <li> Those of us who have already suffered horribly because of this product can possibly help others avoid our misery by contacting the proper authorities.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product for two days and on the third day broke out in a horrible itchy bumpy red rash.  </li>
            <li> I have no allergies or history of product reaction, and my arms and chest are currently covered with a serious ichy, painful rash from one use of this product.</li>
            <li> On the 3rd day, I had broken out in a horribly itchy, bumpy, red rash everywhere</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m headed to the dr in the morning because nothing has helped...Benadryl, Hydrocortisone cream...and the rash seems worse.  </li>
            <li> Started to get a rash on my calves, behind my knees.  </li>
            <li> so I am exhausted.  </li>
            <li> I have no known allergies and have never experienced this before from a skin product.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s gotten progressively worse each day.  </li>
            <li> , the gel is very thick and difficult to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel and developed a terrible rash in my legs arms and chest, I&#x27;ve had it for a week</li>
            <li> I am sitting here itching all over...was so not worth it!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product, until my legs broke out in a horrible annoying rash.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s horribly expensive now being $8 &amp;</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it&#x27;s been 4 days with the rash</li>
            <li> throughout the day they turned into an ANGRY, itchy rash all over my body--everywhere I had applied the product.  </li>
            <li> This feels weird on.  </li>
            <li> Next morning he woke up with a horrible rash all over his neck body and underarms.</li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> I now have clusters of horribly itchy blisters and bumps all over my legs and am starting to get them on my arms.  </li>
            <li> sad to see the issue hasn&#x27;t been resolved.</li>
            <li> I am SO itchy and have broken out in a rash!</li>
            <li> even a minor cut leaves a horrible scar.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is outrageous that Vaseline is still selling such an obviously flawed, and for some people, dangerous, product.</li>
            <li> went to my dermatologist on Monday looking for help, DESPERATE for help with the itching.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a few uses I have broke out with a horrible rash all over my arms and legs.  </li>
            <li> Dangerous rash,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still itching like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be a common theme with people using it and coming out in a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> This is miserable, and I think Vaseline needs to pull this product or at least issue a warning.</li>
            <li> but the rash is still as bad -</li>
            <li> My skin scars badly so</li>
            <li> Its been a week now and my arms are peeling really bad.</li>
            <li> Its just like the peel you get from a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> Bad itchy RASH on arms and legs.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m shocked at all the reviews concerning this.  </li>
            <li> awful rash behind  my knees, on my chest and armpits.  </li>

            <li> It has been awful, and shows no signs of going away.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this and within 3 days have gotten a terrible rash.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cam in perfect condition, and works very well.</li>
            <li> The previous negative reviews are indeed correct.  However, I used the Vaseline Cocoa Radiant Deep Conditioning Cream, not the gel.  I applied this product on July 4th. Two days later, I developed a red itchy rash that was so severe I had to go to doctor to receive a steroid shot and well as an oral steroid.  The doctor actually said it looked liked Poison Ivy or Oak. The itch was so bad, I could barely eat, sleep or concentrate on anything. Fortunately, the steroid shot I received helped and the next day the itch was nearly all gone.  However, I am still left with scarred legs (hoping this isn&#x27;t permanent), out of $100 due to going to an Urgent Care facility and experienced a terrible, painful weekend!  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone!</li>
            <li> Great product...this leaves your skin smelling delicious and well moisturized....you must rub in very well (more than regular lotion) but it will leave your skin so soft hours later....may be a bit much in the summer especially if you will be outside alot but this is the best for fall/winter and maybe spring....it leaves your skin looking and feeling great. Definately worth a try...I would purchase this 3 pack bc I love it ....[...]</li>
            <li> I looove using this at nite. First I dry body brush for about ten minutes. Then I bathe and apply this while still damp. The results are velvety soft and silky smooth skin. And it smells sooo good</li>
            <li> No rash at all.  Just intense moisturization...Best I&#x27;ve tried so far at any price for long-lasting, really hydrated looking skin.</li>
            <li> I tried this product which I used on my arms and legs.  I now have an itchy, red scaly rash all over my arms.  I have not noticed a problem on my legs, yet.  I don&#x27;t normally have allergic reactions to products. Whatever is causing this is a mystery to me.  Otherwise, I kind of liked the product. I could put oil on my body without it getting on everything else.</li>
            <li> I bought this gel after seeing it in Fitness Magazine, finally found it at Walmart, have used it for a week and my skin is so soft and looks so much better, I will buy it again for sure!  Saw some people developed a rash have had no signs of any problems, wish it came in a bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> The Vaseline Cocoa Butter Gel Body Oil not only soothes severly dry skin, but it also maintains the moisture in your skin.  This far exceeds the need for standard lotion.</li>
            <li> I broke out in a bumpy rash immediately after applying this gel. I figured that the rash was from the product and immediately jumped in the shower and tried to get it off. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn&#x27;t wash it off. This stuff is horrible!</li>
            <li> I have used this product 3-4 times and loved it at first but then I noticed raised red burning rash similar to sun allergy.   My legs and arms are covered.   Does anyone know what to use to turn this around?   Will definitely not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any rash/skin breakout problems with this product either. Hit or miss?    My skin drinks this stuff up and it makes it feel so soft and supple for the whole day. Lotion doesn&#x27;t moisturize like this gel does--it dries up in no time. The body oil keeps my skin moist for the entire day and it smells wonderful, but subtle so it&#x27;s not overwhelming.     It does seem a little greasy, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it getting on my clothes or anything. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it&#x27;s hard to get off my hands after I use it, but I don&#x27;t mind it that much.</li>
            <li> For the first three days I loved this product.  The smell reminded me of being on a beach.  Unfortunately, I broke out in a rash on the third day.  I can&#x27;t believe this reaction wasn&#x27;t discovered during product testing.  I had never had a reaction to any other moisturizer or beauty product.  Does anyone know which ingredient is causing this skin rash?</li>
            <li> This product broke me out in a rash as well - I even tried it twice to see and sure enough angry red rash across my chest. Not impressed, especially if it&#x27;s happening to lots of people it must have a serious irritant they should have realized.    Other than that it smells nice, it leaves a very sticky residue that takes forever to sink in though so I probably wouldn&#x27;t have re-purchased even without the rash. It has a gel like consistency that is tacky to the touch, makes skin shiny and soft. I might use it up on my legs as it only seems to irritate my chest area for some reason.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it smelled and felt until a horrible rash overtook my legs. Definitely test this product before using it all over your body.</li>
            <li> First let me say I&#x27;ve never bought from this seller, I buy this product from my local walmart. I&#x27;m concerned it might be this seller? Maybe a knockoff? Considering so many have broken out from this, I&#x27;ll give it 3 stars. I&#x27;ve never had any issues with this product, nor has anyone else I&#x27;ve known to use it. I feel like it&#x27;s horribly expensive now being $8 &amp; some change at Walgreens when it used to be $6 something, walmart had it at $5 something but now it&#x27;s  $6 close to $7 but for the product itself, I absolutely LOVE this stuff! I have very dry, bumpy skin, but when I use this my skin is amazingly softer &amp; smoother, the bumpy, rough skin disappears &amp; I feel a lot more confident. It&#x27;s  greasy so i&#x27;d suggest using it after you shower, throw on some sweats &amp; give it a hour or so for your skin to absorb it before going out or otherwise you&#x27;ll be a shiny, gleaming mess. Hope this helps someone, but once again, judging from these comments I wouldn&#x27;t buy from this seller &amp; try a store near you or other verified online store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years and I love it!  I have eczema and a long history of allergies and skin issues, so it would seem like if anyone would have a reaction to it, it would be me.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem, though.  I have friends that use it and love it as well, too.  I guess if you are trying it for the first time, just test it on a small area of skin and see how you react.  The main ingredient is mineral oil which is the same thing used in baby oil....not sure how this could cause a reaction in so many people!</li>
            <li> As with some of the other people who&#x27;ve written comments, I used this product for a few days and have now come out in a horrible itchy red rash all over my legs. I haven&#x27;t used the product for two days now but the rash is still as bad - so I&#x27;m just hoping that it will go down over the next few days! I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product - I think the company need to do more testing on it before making it available to us unsuspecting public!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good skin moisturizer and came across this product in the store. After reading the entire label, I purchased a bottle. That evening, I used immediately after a shower and was highly impressed. Love the smell, love the feel and what wonders it does for my skin. It did not leave an oily feel to my skin, just soft and silky.  I love the fact that it obsurbs quickly, because trying to get dressed in a hurry you don&#x27;t want oily residue on your nice silks and cottons. Just an overall wonderful product.  I have used one bottle and ordered a pack of 3 because I could not find it in the store anymore. I have read a lot of negative responses regarding rashes. On my second bottle and have yet to get a rash. No rash here. I use it all over my body, from foot to head. Again, awesome product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have eczema, this stuff applied while my skin is still damp in the shower really helps to cut down on the itching. I was surprised to see that so many people had a bad reaction to this stuff. I have fairly sensitive skin and it&#x27;s never bothered me. Maybe they changed the formulation.</li>
            <li> So far, I really like the product.  I&#x27;m nearing the end of my first bottle and plan to buy another.  It is pretty rich so a little goes a long way.  I love how it makes my skin look and feel after a shower, and the smell is light and inviting(scent doesn&#x27;t last long but not an issue for me). For the summertime, it&#x27;s spot on; wondering how it&#x27;ll hold up on \\&quot;winter\\&quot; skin.  We will c....</li>
            <li> After my female friend saw the results of my using the product on my very dry skin, I got her a bottle too.  Within 48 hours she, I, and another member of her family all had horrible rashes.  It looked like I went through a briar patch with poison oak.  Having suffered from that before, I started doing research on the product.  It contains Brazil Nut oils which, after careful research, contain uroshiol oil which for many people is one of the most damndable poisons on the planet (if you are sensitive to poison oak you will know what I mean.)  They should have a printed warning that says \\&quot;test in small spot before use if you have any sensitivity to poison oak.  Product may contain traces of uroshiol oil.\\&quot;  I would have avoided my own suffering and passing the suffering along, not to mention the cost.  Use product with extreme caution or I recommend just skipping it.  I can&#x27;t believe they marketed this knowing it has uroshiol oil in it. I&#x27;m pretty upset that there was no warning.</li>
            <li> as many others have mentioned, this product can cause an intense allergic skin reaction. I normally do not have sensitive skin, but after several days of using this I broke out into a scary rash all over my body. Also this oil is too thick for my taste. I highly reccommend using neutrogena light sesame oil  instead- have been using it for a year now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I can roll around in poison ivy and never break out, but for some reason, this stuff has caused me to have a SEVERE allergic reaction to it.  I had been using for a couple days when I noticed an itchy patch on my upper chest.  Then, a day later, it was on the insides of my elbows and slowly moved down my forearms, then it appeared behind my knees, on my upper thighs, my lower stomach, and my hips.  Pretty much anywhere I had used this stuff, it appeared.  I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s the Hydrogenated Styrene/Butadiene Copolymer in it, because I&#x27;m not allergic to any of the other stuff.  It could also be the fragrance.    I&#x27;ve read a LOT of reviews, and it seems a lot of people have gotten this rash.  I haven&#x27;t tried contacting the company yet, but I will be soon.  Not even benadryl or calamine lotion makes the rashes stop, although it does alleviate the itching some.      My suggestion is that if you want to try this product, use it on an isolated area for a few days before using it on your entire body.</li>
            <li> I gave this review one star only because it was the lowest possible review to give.  I bought the Vaseline Vitalizing Gel Body Oil because I&#x27;m pregnant and noticed my skin was drier than usual.  It was ok for the first 2 days, although I did feel overly greasy with it on.  On the 3rd day, I had broken out in a horribly itchy, bumpy, red rash everywhere I had applied the gel (which was all over my chest, belly, arms and legs).  Needless to say, it&#x27;s been 4 days with the rash and it&#x27;s hasn&#x27;t relented.   I&#x27;m headed to the dr in the morning because nothing has helped...Benadryl, Hydrocortisone cream...and the rash seems worse.  I wish I had never used this crap.  Save yourself the agony of a potential rash nightmare...I wish I did.  I did contact Vaseline through their website, but haven&#x27;t had a reply yet...don&#x27;t know if I ever will.</li>
            <li> Like others this made my wife and me break out in a rash!  Do not use until you&#x27;ve used on a small section of skin.  Then again, why risk it?</li>
            <li> This stuff brought me out in a hottible angry hot red rash.  All over neck and chest and I&#x27;m still waiting on it going down.  So itchy, even after E45 anti-itch cream and anti histamine.  BEWARE!  Smells nice and sinks in easily, but my skin reacted really badly to it.  Seems to be a common theme with people using it and coming out in a horrible rash.</li>
            <li> Horrible rash broke out after about a week of using this product.  My Doctor prescribed Prednizone for it.  Has Vaseline responded to anyone&#x27;s complaint?</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my stretch marks from pregnancy and a few scars. My skin scars badly so even a minor cut leaves a horrible scar. The results are so fast, Ive been using it for about a week and never expected it to work this great! It doesn&#x27;t heal the scar, but it lightens it up a lot. And my stretch marks are about half as dark as they were. I&#x27;ve tried other things from Palmers to Bio-oil and nothing has worked as good as this. It does take forever to absorb so you cant put it on before you go out or it leaves you looking greasy, and as for lotion it wont work, its too oily, it would get everywhere and stain. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with rash, but be careful because it seems to give a lot of people rashes.</li>
            <li> Great product that works awesome on the skin for dry areas. I purchased a few of these and I am very glad that I did. Dry climates like Afghanistan can be hard on the skin and this is a big help.</li>
            <li> If you have allergies to nuts then you may have a reaction to this stuff.  But if you want a wonderful smelling, gel type oil that works on dry areas like elbows, ankles &amp; knees, this is the answer to your prayers.  It&#x27;s also terrific when used as a massage oil...doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky or greasy. I use it every day and have had no problems - it leaves my skin soft and smelling delicious.</li>
            <li> After using this product once, I got a pretty bad rash. It didn&#x27;t appear right away so it took me a couple of days before I realized it was this. I would get something different seeing how many people have the same complaint.</li>
            <li> Pro: smells like nutella.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: super greasy, slightly sticky (not a massage oil), smell fades in 10 minutes, oh and the RASH. I&#x27;ve been able to use products like Keri mineral oil before with no problem, but this, J&amp;J baby oil, and neutrogena&#x27;s original spray SPF break me out into what looks like a heat rash but itches like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It could be the type of oil used (may form a solid in the pores, which blocks them from releasing your natural body oils and produces an immune response), or could be fragrance related. It has nothing to do with but allergies, which are allergies to specific nut proteins - proteins which are left behind in the oil extraction process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to make like a duck in a Dawn commercial and try to soak this grease off of me in the tub. Oh yeah, that&#x27;s another con- the stuff refuses to come off, except with dish soap.</li>
            <li> I do not have the rash issue everyone speaks of. This actually works pretty well for me. Regular lotion does not moisturize my skin as it should. The oil does not sit on top my skin, it does absorb, which I appreicate. I have extremely dry skin so this product works well.</li>
            <li> Loved this at first.  Then on the 3rd day I noticed a few bumps...throughout the day they turned into an ANGRY, itchy rash all over my body--everywhere I had applied the product.  This product smells great and felt great, if not a tad greasy.  But what it has done to my skin-which is normally not sensitive to lotions...it&#x27;s terrible.  I have suffered through this for 5 days now.  Horrible!  I have read tons of similar reviews!!  Vaseline needs to recall this and take a look...it shouldn&#x27;t be causing such a widespread rash reaction!!!</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;m actually glad I&#x27;m not the only one..was especially worried since I&#x27;m pregnant and anything weird is cause for worry...skin was first just very itchy on my chest and stomach and my calves...then I thought back to what I had changed and I started using this about a week ago, and only used it on my chest, stomach and calves!  I noticed the rash just today when after a hot shower..which was making the itching worse.  No fun, and from reading other reviews looks like a tough rash to get rid of.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin so soft and moisturized.  I have a problem with dry skin year round, it gets especially dry in the winter.  Baby oil leaves me too oily; Neutragena is too expensive; this Vaseline Gel Oil leaves my skin soft and smooth without costing a lot.&lt;br /&gt;As for a rash I have not had any problem.  I did have a problem with one of the lotions about a year ago; I emailed Vaseline&#x27;s customer service and they took care of it fairly quick.  I should hope they would do the same for someone with a problem with this product also.</li>
            <li> Was excited to use this product as I have used other body oils (Neutrogena) and&lt;br /&gt;loved them.  WIthin three days, I had developed a rash on my arms and chest.&lt;br /&gt;Thought it was heat rash, as the temperatures have been hot here.  Stopped using&lt;br /&gt;product for a few days to let my arm rash clear up and started using the oil again&lt;br /&gt;yesterday.  Started to get a rash on my calves, behind my knees.  Then, thinking&lt;br /&gt;I must still be getting heat rash, used product one more time today, and now my&lt;br /&gt;leg rashes have spread and I decided to look up this product.  Have found many&lt;br /&gt;reviews indicating allergic reaction.  I am curious if this has to do with nut oils.&lt;br /&gt;I am also very surprised that this product was put on shelves and these rashes&lt;br /&gt;seem to be a common thing.  Just wanted to warn potential buyers not to take&lt;br /&gt;the risk with this product.  I would recommend Neutrogena&#x27;s Body Oil or Palmers&lt;br /&gt;Body oil. I have used both with no problems.</li>
            <li> This product is good , last longer.&lt;br /&gt;NB: Use a little bit, just a little bit of it, it smoothes very well.</li>
            <li> First, to the woman in the UK who reviewed this... it is available in the UK... it&#x27;s for sale at Boots.  I really used to love this product until I went organic.  I now use all natural 100% organic coconut oil which has a similar feel and great smell and is free of all artificial ingredients.  However, this is great if you don&#x27;t have allergies or reactions to chemicals.  This has a nice feel and smells faintly of chocolate.  It&#x27;s cheaper to buy here than in a regular department store...</li>
            <li> I loved the smell of this, but then I broke out in a horrible red rash all over my arms and chest where I had applied it.  After doing some research, I see that several others have had the same problem...</li>
            <li> Honestly, I love the stuff. I am reading all of the reviews regarding rash outbreaks. I am curious how I have not experienced any rashes; especially since I have sensitive skin. I did buy this product when it was first released; perhaps the ingredients changed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients on my bottle are as follows: Mineral Oil, Hydrogenated Styrene/Butadiene Copolymer, Theobroma Cacao (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have experienced no rashes at all, and I even use this as a personal lubricant. My guess is that the ingredients have been changed at some point, but perhaps not? Let me know, I really like the stuff.</li>
            <li> I just love this product and only wish I could buy it in the UK.  Each time I visit the US, I try to stock up with as much as possible.  Having spent a fortune on a variety of body moisturisers from much more expensive brands, I&#x27;ve finally found a product that deals effectively with my dry skin.  I am bi-racial and unless my skin is deeply moisturised it has an ashen look.  Not sure how this would work with Caucasian skins though - it might be too sticky, but for anyone with afro or mixed race skin, it&#x27;s a dream product. My only regret is that I only ordered one box.  I actually thought I&#x27;d ordered 2 packs of 3!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely satisfied with purchase, was shipped ahead of schedule, happy customer.</li>
            <li> This product caused a nasty red rash after two uses that took more than a week to go away. I have never had a problem with any other kind of oil or lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that it also caused a rash for many, many other customers, and had been doing so for years. I also see that many others have attempted to contact Vaseline about it, and have gotten nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try talking to the store manager where I bought it, and see if I can get that chain to take it off the shelves. I will not buy any other Vaseline products until they remove this from the shelves or reformulate it, and I encourage others to do the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is outrageous that Vaseline is still selling such an obviously flawed, and for some people, dangerous, product. If someone with a weakened immune system uses this product and gets a severe rash, it could result in serious health complications.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of moisturizing although it does leave a greasy film for a short while before being absorbed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, nor is this the first time I&#x27;ve used a Vaseline product. No prior problems. However, after using this product only twice, a severely itchy, painful, bumpy red rash appeared the day following last use. Today is day 3 of the rash, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be getting better. Really wish I&#x27;d read reviews before buying this product. Be careful- do a patch test first!</li>
            <li> Like many of the other reviewers, I had an allergic reaction.  The first couple of days I noticed that my skin was itching a lot.  I now have raised red bumps all over my arms.  I do have sensitive skin and regret not researching this before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the gel is very thick and difficult to rub into your skin.</li>
            <li> Loved the smell and felt good. After about 4 days, my arms below my elbow looked like they broke out in hives. Its been a week now and my arms are peeling really bad. Its just like the peel you get from a bad sunburn.</li>
            <li> Its a really nice product that I use for my dry skin its a little shinny but not oily which is a good thing, its well priced and I like to use it instead of a normal lotion or the Vaseline classic gel which is much thicker that this one</li>
            <li> I purchased this product a week ago and after 4 days of use my arms are covered with an intense rash! Its been one week since and the rash is taking really long to go away. I&#x27;m currently using anti-biotic cream to help.</li>
            <li> Be very afraid of the Vasoline Cocoa Butter vitalizing gel. I have no allergies or history of product reaction, and my arms and chest are currently covered with a serious ichy, painful rash from one use of this product. I did some internet research and found numerous people with same complaint. I contacted the Vasoline company, who said they would get back to me and, of course, have never been heard from again. I&#x27;ve had the rash for a week now and its not much improved. I&#x27;m thinking lawyer and class action lawsuit.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face (gosh I wish I never did that!) and on the next day my face was completely swollen...I bought benadryl and after 2 days my face is still a bit swollen...my skin feels like sandpaper...I&#x27;m really scared that it won&#x27;t go away...my eyes are still a bit swollen...I will NEVER use this product again....Please be careful...</li>
            <li> Day 5 of RASH!! Do not use this product. I thought this pesky rash was getting better, but started itching again tonite. I used Palmers when pregnant and many other lotions...never had anything like this happen. It&#x27;s little bumps all over my legs :/ There are many better products on the market. I&#x27;m going to contact Vaseline....</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry &amp; scaly. This product works perfectly with my skin. It relieves the dryness &amp; itchiness giving my skin a younger glow. I truly love. It&#x27;s the only product I have found that really  works for me.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to use this product, until my legs broke out in a horrible annoying rash. It took about 3 days to appear. I would not classify my skin as being sensitive. Actually it is the first time I have broken out due to a lotion. Thankfully I did not use it on any other part of my body.</li>
            <li> I have never had a rash like this before and I initially attributed it to poison ivy or some weed in my garden, but the more I thought about it, it became apparent that the awful rash only showed up on my arms and legs, the only two places that I applied the Vaseline body gel oil.  It has been almost a week and it is finally starting to recede.  None of the allergy medications like Benedryl had any effect. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t waste the money going to a dermatologist.  This product should come with a warning to test a patch of skin first and wait a day or two.</li>
            <li> I loved how soft this made my dry skin, but it is not worth the ugly, red, bumpy rash all over my neck, chest, arms, hands, and legs. I would strongly caution use of this. Please note that I generously use many lotions and have never had this experience before.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist said that any product whose first ingredient is water is not going to help with moisturizing and hydration.  I found this product at Target and have been very pleased with the way it slides on, dries quickly and truly locks in the natural moisture in your skin.  The scent is cocoa butter almond so you smell like a cookie!  Love it!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend developed a severe and itchy rash on several occasions while using this product.  It seems to be either heat- or sun-activated, so maybe it&#x27;s okay to use indoors?  Still, why bother?  It seems to be a common problem--I wish she had checked out some reviews before buying this!</li>
            <li> After two uses I broke out in an awful rash like many other reviewers here!!!! Ted, bumpy, itchy, burning rash!!! DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Please please listen to me. I do not have sensitive skin. I have NEVER had a reaction to anything however this caused me WEEKS of pain.&lt;br /&gt;I used this on holiday as an after sun product. Thought it would be fantastic and really moisturising after long days in the sea and at the pool.&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days after using it my skin felt itchy. I thought it was heat rash or prickly heat so I kept out of the sun, had cool showers and used cold compresses. I also kept using this product to help. A day later I had to go to an emergency care unit in my resort. The doctor said I was having a severe allergic reaction to something. He wasn&#x27;t sure what. He thought it could be a food allergy! He have me steroid cream, a steroid injection and tablets.&lt;br /&gt;I came home and had food allergy testing, and check all products I had used. And when I researched this I was horrified that so many people had experienced the same.  Please don&#x27;t even bother trying this.</li>
            <li> After using this product for a few days last week I slowly developed a painful, horribly itchy rash that spread down the entire length of both of my arms and legs.  I am miserable!  The rash consists of hundreds and hundreds of tiny red blisters.  I haven&#x27;t had a good nights sleep since last Friday because of the itching so I am exhausted.  The rash and itching persist so for me, it&#x27;s been going on 5 days and counting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my dermatologist on Monday looking for help, DESPERATE for help with the itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tonight I decided to look the product up on the Internet and have been saddened and floored at how many others have had the same awful experience with rashes and itching and I note that many of these comments date back a few years!!!  One would think and hope that with so many apparent problems with a product it would be pulled from the market to protect the unsuspecting public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe we can make a difference in this situation if those who have had an adverse reaction to this product will notify the FDA of their experience.  Those of us who have already suffered horribly because of this product can possibly help others avoid our misery by contacting the proper authorities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The telephone number to reach the FDA is 1-888-463-6332.  Once you&#x27;ve called that number they will ask a couple of questions and then give you a number to call which will be the field office of the FDA in your geographic area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve made my call, will you do the same?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to healing and feeling better for all those who have been through this nightmare.</li>
            <li> Great smell,bad rash...noticed itchy red bumps on arms and stomach after about a week. Hoping that if I quit using it and try Benadryl and hydrocortisone cream, I can make it go away. I have no known allergies and have never experienced this before from a skin product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is in this body oil, possibly recycled insulation or composted poison ivy?  Whatever it is, I am practically drawing blood due to the excessive itching I experience.  The sad thing is I loved the texture of this body oil.  If it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, this would have been a holy grail product.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T USE IT! Bad itchy RASH on arms and legs. LASTS for DAYS:( Shame on Vaseline brand:(</li>
            <li> I thought this product was amazing. After using it daily for three days I noticed my skin was visibly smoother and felt much softer. However, after reading the reviews I also realize that it contributed to the nasty rash I developed starting on the back of my neck making its way down behind my knee and in every other uncomfortable spot. I attributed the breakout originally to dying my hair and could not explain how I broke out behind the knee under my arm under my breasts ETC. Will not be reordering. It took a month for it to go away (now, I see it was due to using the product that broke me out)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have ever put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin, some sun damage, that is not prone to breakouts. I have a lot of dryness near my knees, ankles, shoulders and elbows. I experience very dry skin after shaving my legs, enough that I have gone to waxing. After spending who knows how much money on spa products, high priced lotions and organic oils (jojoba, etc) to soften my skin I am pleased to find that this product has effectively made my skin as soft as it was when I was a toddler. It&#x27;s incredibly inexpensive and a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the cons.&lt;br /&gt;It is messy. You want to be careful with it and make sure it fully absorbs into your skin before putting clothing on or going to bed. It takes a while to do so. Also, as mentioned before my skin does not break out, and this product is oil-based so test it out on a small portion of skin before using it on your entire body.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to Vaseline cocoa butter &amp; i just love it... it makes my feel so good... i apply it everyday &amp; love it..</li>
            <li> This product is the worst thing I have ever put on my legs. Write now it&#x27;s very very red, ichy and burning. I wish I could have read the previous reviews before using it. Believe: Don&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has ever made me break out into a severe rash all over my neck and chest!  I do not have sensitive skin and my chest and neck area is covered in painful and itchy bumps!  DO NOT USE!!!</li>
            <li> I have no history of skin allergy for anything. After recurrent incidents of rashes breaking out on areas that were exposed to this stuff, I figured it out. About a 3 day onset, 3 day recovery. This stuff should be pulled. I am not sure if the rash was Angry, I could not ascertain it&#x27;s emotional state.</li>
            <li> This feels weird on.  I can&#x27;t describe it, just sticky or something. I guess it still hydrates, but I can&#x27;t wear it out anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the Johnson and Johnson one better.  Nice cocoa butter smell, good oil, gelled so its less messy, and feels like you would expect \\&quot;regular\\&quot; baby oil to feel she used in the same way.  (I use it in the shower, it&#x27;s less messy and wont get over applied that way.).</li>
            <li> Goes on easy and keeps my skin nice and hydrated.  This is my third time purchasing it. Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> After buying this product in local stores, I decided to see if I could find it on line.  Not only&lt;br /&gt;did I fine it, I also found buying in bulk is so much better.  This is an excellent gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using Vaseline Cocoa Radiant Vitalizing Gel Body Oil for some time now.  It is a excellent product.  I use it right after my shower and there is no need for lotion.  It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> After the third day of use of the Vaseline cocoa radiant I developed a horrible, bumpy red rash on my calves and thighs.  I wish I could post a picture.  It would keep anyone from using the product.  It started on a Saturday and today is Tuesday and it&#x27;s gotten progressively worse each day.  Do you think Vaseline is going to pay my co-pay when I have to see my doctor?</li>
            <li> my husband loves this product.  He puts it on in the shower right before he gets out.  He doesn&#x27;t need lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> I know there&#x27;s some controversy about this product causing rashes for some folks with skin sensitivity. Personally, I don&#x27;t seem to be allergic to it, and I love how it keeps my skin so soft! I wash my hands constantly, so I have horribly dry and cracked hands in the winter, and this is one of the only products that keeps my hands moisturized. After I wash my hands, I immediately squeeze a small amount of it on the back of my hand and rub (the back of) my hands together then voila! I don&#x27;t need to reapply lotion until I wash my hands again.</li>
            <li> I used this product for two days and on the third day broke out in a horrible itchy bumpy red rash.  It has been awful, and shows no signs of going away.  I went to the Dr. and she prescribed Triamcinolone Acetonide to stop the itch and that hasn&#x27;t even worked.  I am very dissatisfied with this product, and judging by all the negative reviews I am not the only one. I only hope that anyone who is even thinking about using this awful product looks at the reviews first.  Glad to see not everyone is effected, but why take the chance?  I am sitting here itching all over...was so not worth it!!!!!</li>
            <li> Before I bought this I read the reviews, but it didn&#x27;t deter me since the reviews about rashes are almost 4-5 years old, and from my research Vaseline changed the ingredients since then. In the store, Johnson&#x27;s Cocoa Baby oil and this gel-oil had the exact same ingredients, so I assume it much be safer now. So I decided to buy and try it out. I already use Vaseline Cocoa Radiant Lotion and jelly with much success, and I adore the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel oil smells great like the other CocoaRadiant products. It is like a true gel-oil consistency in my opinion. I&#x27;ve used just a small dab on my old surgery scars to keep them moisturized and smooth after the shower. It sinks right into my skin with the small amount I use. I also used it all over my body after exfoliating with exfoliating body gloves. I used a tiny dab per section of my body, and it all sank right into my skin quickly. If I used too much I imagine I&#x27;d be a slick oily mess. I&#x27;ve used this product three times over a 2 day period on normal and tattooed skin with no issues. I plan to continue using this in small quantities on my surgery scars and after exfoliating. I usually prefer lotion for more bodily coverage, but this works well for my pampering days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Vaseline did a good job changing the ingredients and fixing what everyone else was experiencing issues with.</li>
            <li> I will admit I did break out in a small rash when I first started to use this product but Im not certain that it was the product that was the culprit since it went away within an hour..............I have been using it and being stationed in Germany the weather is harsh and this is the only product that seems to seal in moisture on my skin...........</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Keeps your skin smooth and soft all day. It is a bit different than lotion but its works so much better!</li>
            <li> I bought this gel and developed a terrible rash in my legs arms and chest, I&#x27;ve had it for a week and it&#x27;s still going strong ! Do not recommend this product at all !</li>
            <li> I have never had a reaction from anything until I used this product.  After a few uses I have broke out with a horrible rash all over my arms and legs.  Little raised red bumps.  My right lower leg feels like it&#x27;s burning.  I thought I would just check and see if anyone else has had a problem with breaking out from using this and I&#x27;m shocked at all the reviews concerning this.  Don&#x27;t use this product!  I hope this goes away soon.  It seems to be getting worse than better.  I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have thrown it away.  I should have taken it back to the store but I didn&#x27;t think they would take it back.</li>
            <li> Dangerous rash,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this on my 6 yr old sun because he had been going in the pool a lot and his skin was dry. Next morning he woke up with a horrible rash all over his neck body and underarms. At first I didnt know what it was but I gave him a bath changed his clothes and he got better. At night he happrn to wear the same pijama from the night before that still smelled like the vaseline oil and sure enough breakout again the rash was back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY OR TEST IN A SMALL AREA FIRST.I had used thus myself and no reaction but my son did so please test before use. I feel bad for putting it on my son :(</li>
            <li> I bought this in a twin pack of the Vaseline Cocoa Butter lotion from Costco.  At first I thought it was a body wash, but as I read further, I realized it was a body gel.  I was super excited to use this product!  One week later, I am itching so bad and there are all of these red blotches on my chest, stomach, and arms.  I immediately took pictures and sent them to my daughter and she stated it looks like an allergic reaction to something.  I went down the list of things that could have possible caused this and this gel is the only thing I can pin point.  I have not changed or added anything to my beauty regimen except this gel.  I came here and voila, the first review was referencing a rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely being tossed in the trash and I am calling as well as writing to Vaseline/Unilever to complain.  I am surprised they have not addressed this, considering I am seeing some reviews from 2011.  So disappointed in this product and in Vaseline!</li>
            <li> Avoid at all costs!!!!! Product has me itching like nothing I&#x27;ve ever felt!</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle to try by my sister-in-law because it&#x27;s what she uses and she just loves it.  I tried it and it was fantastic for my dry skin. Leaves my skin feely silky smooth and smelling good. I now use all the time.</li>
            <li> After pruchasing the product, I discoverd I could have brought the item at Walmart.  I onl&#x3D;saved less than a dollar.</li>
            <li> The whole family uses this...I cant get enough of this. What i started doing was putting it the bathtub for the baths for the girls. no rash no issues and it definitely moistens the skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and within 3 days have gotten a terrible rash. After reading all these reviews I at least know why this is .&lt;br /&gt;I am furious this is still on the market. I will call the company and report to FDA also.&lt;br /&gt;I am now boycotting anything from Vaseline. DO NOT buy this oil.</li>
            <li> It is very hydrating; smells great. It penetrates the skin excellently.</li>
            <li> I see that many people are reporting a red rash that came up after about 3 days of using this product. I too have a red rash that got so severe I had to go to the doctor for it. I have contact dermatites because of it and am now on a steroid cream along with oral steriods. This $4 or so bottle of body oil has cost me over $100 to be treated for a rash that was not going away. I think it should be recalled. Not impressed!</li>
            <li> OMG, I had the same itchy, blistery, rash everywhere I put this stuff. I am so glad that I saw this site to see that I am not the only one. What do they make this stuff out of, Melted Tires?? I thought I could trust the Vaseline name. hmmmmmmmm</li>
            <li> This product work great! Harsh water usually creates issues with dry skin. This product keeps my skin smooth and has an amazing fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love love love this product.  I used baby oil gel for years so I was happy to find an oil gel that was a little lighter in texture.  I suffer with psoriasis so I have to find products that can keep my skin moisturized all day.  This works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I also reacted with an angry red rash. Have had for 5 days with no improvement. Suspected the oil but wasnt certain that was the cause until i read these reviews. Fortunately, after buying 2 bottles, I hadnt gotten around to putting the other one in the kids shower!</li>
            <li> I use this daily after showering and apply minimal amount onto my still wet skin. It leaves my skin soft, smooth, hydrated and gives a beautiful glow. No rash at all!</li>
            <li> great for heals and feet and elbows - awesome!</li>
            <li> I started using this product instead of the cooc baby oil gel. I like it so much better. I use it directly after a shower and it does not take long for it to absorb into my skin. I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin. I for one am pleased with this product!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!  I have extremely dry skin and this is the only product that really moisturizes and softens my skin.  I have not had any rash and have been using the gel oil for over a month now.  I put it on after the shower and it soaks in pretty quickly. Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This has been SUCH a \\&quot;skin saver\\&quot; for me! It IS an oil, so don&#x27;t be mislead by the word \\&quot;Gel\\&quot; in the name. The gel part gives the product a thicker consistency, so when you pour some into your hand it doesn&#x27;t act like a \\&quot;regular\\&quot; oil and run all over the place. It looks and acts like a gel. But once you start to rub it in, it applies like an oil; thinner than petrolatum but thicker than a plain oil. I&#x27;m fortunate to not have any of the skin reactions or rashes as a result of using it and I&#x27;m curious to know what ingredient(s) is/are in it that would cause such a reaction. It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;rub in\\&quot; completely like a lotion or cream would; it does leave behind a residue. If you have a busy, early-morning schedule that requires you dress in nice clothing, this is probably not the product to use at that time. OTOH, if you do have skin as dry as I do that involves red, rough, chapped patches and terrible itching, then use it at night and wear some old pajamas you don&#x27;t care anything about. It has a wonderful, very light almond/cocoa butter scent that I find very soothing and does not give me a migraine. As I don&#x27;t have a busy morning schedule I am able to wear old clothes for a half-hour or so until the residue soaks in completely or dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t see this product remaining in Vaseline&#x27;s product line for very long. The negative reviews so far outnumber the positive ones that eventually poor sales will likely cause its demise. I&#x27;m thinking of stocking up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry so many people have developed rashes after using this product. My whole family uses this body oil gel and none of us have ever had the slightest problem with it whatsoever. It seems like it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find - at least in this formulation (as opposed to the spray) - so I hope that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s being discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;I, along with other family members, have extremely sensitive skin. I&#x27;m very fair and have moderate rosacea. I&#x27;m allergic to certain dyes that are in dish soaps, a particular laundry detergent, and some newspaper inks too, all of which have given me terrible rashes. I also can&#x27;t use any chemical sunscreen formulations or my skin burns. All mascaras except one brand make my eyes burn and itch. So obviously I have very sensitive skin with multiple sensitivities and allergies. However, this product has never irritated me in the slightest. I&#x27;ve used it for years and years with no problems. It&#x27;s very hydrating yet the gel formula makes it far less messy than other body oil products. It&#x27;s affordable and smells lovely - a warm, cocoa butter scent, not at all obtrusive or cloying. It&#x27;s especially terrific after leg shaving or sun exposure, very soothing. Honestly, I&#x27;m not usually one for most drug store type brands. Maybe I&#x27;m a bit of a product snob but I know what I like and I&#x27;ve tried everything from L&#x27;Occitane to Bliss to Palmer&#x27;s to Avon and back to &amp;#34;high end&amp;#34; brands like Molton Brown, Laura Mercier, and Diptyque. Scent is important to me - I either like things totally unscented or lightly scented in a way that doesn&#x27;t interfere with the few perfumes I wear, albeit sparingly. This smells slightly of warm skin - that traditional sunny, cocoa butter smell. It isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; at all and is gender-less - it complements the Tom Ford Sandalwod perfume I sometimes wear and never competes with it. It&#x27;s just a terrific all-around body moisturizer - it smooths my skin all over, conditions my cuticles as I apply it, and leaves a nice sheen on my limbs too. I love using it liberally after a bath, body scrub, leg shaving and letting it soak in over night while I sleep...heavenly. My husband and kids love it too!d leaves a nice sheen on my limbs too. I love using it liberally after a bath, body scrub, leg shaving and letting it soak in over night while I sleep...heavenly. My husband and kids love it too!</li>
            <li> I love this much better than regular lotion.  I do not have a problem with a rash as others mentioned.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I have never, ever had a reaction to a product.  I stopped using this after about 5 uses because it was so greasy.  I had also started noticing itchy bumps on my legs, but didn&#x27;t make the connection at first.  I now have clusters of horribly itchy blisters and bumps all over my legs and am starting to get them on my arms.  I googled \\&quot;body oil skin rashes\\&quot; and found many fellow sufferers.  This is miserable, and I think Vaseline needs to pull this product or at least issue a warning.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my mother-in-law had it in her shower and I thought the smell was fantastic and it left my skin feeling really soft after using it. It does take some time to absorb, but a little goes a long way. This is why I especially loved using it at night since I would wake up in the morning with baby soft skin, I&#x27;d just sit there and touch my arms over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But after about three days of use I got it...the rash. My skin feels like chicken skin now with dozens and dozens of red, tiny, hard little bumps all over. I have no idea why either. I&#x27;m not allergic to mineral oil which is the main ingredient, but I&#x27;m not quite sure about the rest. I wanted SOOOO very badly to love this too. If Vaseline could get rid of whatever else is in there that is breaking people out then I would purchase a reformulated bottle. In the meantime I think I&#x27;ll toss the one I currently have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: There is a lot of talk about this product containing Brazil Nut oil. The previous version of this product which was the Vasoline Cocoa Butter vitalizing gel, contained Brazil Nut and Almond Oil. The new version, the Cocoa Radiant doesn&#x27;t contain either of those oils. Regardless I&#x27;m still seeing a lot of complaints about rashes from both products.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like, I love this stuff. I know some people are complaining that they had a rash/allergic reaction but I didn&#x27;t experience that at all. I didn&#x27;t do the patch test, just applied it at night all over my body before I went to sleep. I woke up with butter soft skin. No dryness and the moisture lasted for days! I admit I would&#x27;ve did a patch test if I&#x27;d read the reviews about the rash first, but I hadn&#x27;t read reviews, and didn&#x27;t know that this might do that to the skin. But thankfully my skin didn&#x27;t have any negative reaction. I&#x27;m African American with a caramel bronze tone and Cocoa Radiant made my skin silky, made it glow, and in a way made my skin more even toned. It&#x27;s kinda greasy [because it&#x27;s oil] so I might not wear this outside, but it works great for night use, especially when you use on your feet and put socks on. Little goes a long way. I would definitely purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure if you buy this to do patch testing.</li>
            <li> awful rash behind  my knees, on my chest and armpits.  haven&#x27;t used it an more than a week and I&#x27;m still itching like crazy.  skin red and very irritated. i tried this product many years ago and stopped because of the same thing. sad to see the issue hasn&#x27;t been resolved.</li>
            <li> Will never buy again!!!!!! I am SO itchy and have broken out in a rash! What a waste!</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. It keeps my skin moisturized especially in the winter. It can tend to feel a little greasy when you put to much on but otherwise.... its a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use this Cocoa gel WITH C.O. Bigelow&#x27;s Lemon butter body cream. I learned this trick from reading Allure Magazine. Take a gob of the lemon butter and mix in a squirt of the gel, blend in hands and apply liberally all over body after shower. You will stay silky smooth all day long. Guaranteed. I have lizard skin the winter and this is only thing I find that works all day long.</li>
            <li> After the second day of use I broke out in a rash all over that looks like poison oak. Two weeks later, it&#x27;s still not gone. Beware.</li>
    </ol>
