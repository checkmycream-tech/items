            <li>I Love these lashes.  </li>
            <li>I love these lashes.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping great seller.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>These are so easy to use &amp; layer for a voluminous look if you desire.</li>
            <li>It goes very quick</li>
            <li>They are convenient and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I love these lashes, it is quick and convenient to do these individuals as opposed to onsie lashes.</li>
            <li>Fabulous on your eyes.</li>
            <li>I can get a good three weeks out of the individual lashes, but a week/two with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easier to apply and more natural looking than the full lash!  </li>
            <li>Love how easy these are to apply and how natural they look compared to strip lashes.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite lashes to use because it&#x27;s a cluster of 3 instead of the single lash inserts &amp; to get a pack of 3 even better.</li>
            <li>Much easier to apply than the full length version.</li>
            <li>If you wear individual eyelashes, these are a time saver and easy to use!  </li>
            <li>Then, I apply a second layer right on top.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing false lashes for a couple of years now, and these are the best I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>I recommend using a strong glue such as duo glue as well.</li>
            <li>The single group lashes work better.</li>
            <li>very flimsy and separated just from grasping with the tweezers</li>
            <li>highly recommend !</li>
            <li>Then, I gently push them upwards to create that eye opening look.</li>
            <li>I really like the kiss lashes</li>
            <li>These are so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>some of the lashes are shorter I need them all to be the same also they didn&#x27;t  look full</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and less time consuming.</li>
            <li>Sometimes, I&#x27;ll apply a few individuals toward the end of my application (nearer the nose) to give the gradation a more natural look.  </li>
            <li>They are so much easier to apply but still gave the same realistic look as individual lashes.  </li>
            <li>The way they space the lash clusters makes it much easier than regular individual lashes to create consistency in your look.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a quick way to apply lashes and half the time.</li>
            <li>I love these because they are short enough to look natural yet thick enough to enhance your look.</li>
            <li>but the trio really didn&#x27;t work for me due to</li>
            <li>Lush and not too long!</li>
            <li>I wear them for everyday wear, not a dramatic look.</li>

            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me....very flimsy and separated just from grasping with the tweezers</li>
            <li> wonderful easy to apply</li>
            <li> good quality , and love the idea of three lashes instead of one. they blend beautifully. highly recommend !</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOVVVVEEE THESE LASHES. These are my favorite lashes to use because it&#x27;s a cluster of 3 instead of the single lash inserts &amp; to get a pack of 3 even better. These are so easy to use &amp; layer for a voluminous look if you desire. Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase these!!!</li>
            <li> I love the trio eyelashes. Saves me from trying to apply them individually. I recommend using a strong glue such as duo glue as well. I wear them for everyday wear, not a dramatic look. So glad I found them here online throughout Amazon.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to apply. The single group lashes work better.</li>
            <li> What is the point in these! When they say short they mean short, My lashes is longer then these so I wasted my money!</li>
            <li> Easier to apply and more natural looking than the full lash!  ❤️ Them!</li>
            <li> Good product, easy to apply. Merchandise was received in a timely order.</li>
            <li> I used to pay to have extensions.  These work great once you learn how to put them on.  Saves a lot of money!</li>
            <li> I love these lashes, it is quick and convenient to do these individuals as opposed to onsie lashes. Easy to apply and less time consuming.</li>
            <li> I love these because they are short enough to look natural yet thick enough to enhance your look. It takes me half the time to apply these versus the individual. I use them with the &amp;#34;Ultra Short&amp;#34; lashes, same brand.To create a dramatic look. These do not last as long as the individual lashes though. I can get a good three weeks out of the individual lashes, but a week/two with these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all fairness I do workout so that is a factor in why this may not last as long. Overall it is a quick way to apply lashes and half the time.</li>
            <li> I find these cheaper in Walgreens stores, but I wanted to leave a review here. I have been wearing false lashes for a couple of years now, and these are the best I&#x27;ve found so far. The way they space the lash clusters makes it much easier than regular individual lashes to create consistency in your look. What I do is use Ardell&#x27;s lashtite glue (wait until it&#x27;s tacky of course) and start from the outer corner of my eyes and work my way in, saving the shorter lashes for the inner corners of my eye (don&#x27;t apply too close to the corners though!) Then, I apply a second layer right on top. Then, I gently push them upwards to create that eye opening look. I get so many compliments on these lashes, I hope they never stop selling these!</li>
            <li> I really like the kiss lashes but the trio really didn&#x27;t work for me due to some of the lashes are shorter I need them all to be the same also they didn&#x27;t  look full</li>
            <li> Love how easy these are to apply and how natural they look compared to strip lashes. Lush and not too long!</li>
            <li> These were recommended to me by a makeup artist and I absolutely love them.  They are so much easier to apply but still gave the same realistic look as individual lashes.  I use DUO eyelash adhesive, starting at the outer corners of my eyes, and then apply them inward.  Sometimes, I&#x27;ll apply a few individuals toward the end of my application (nearer the nose) to give the gradation a more natural look.  Once dried, I apply a coat of mascara and I&#x27;m done!  Looks amazing.</li>
            <li> I have been using false eyelashes for about 30 years. I used the individual flares.  I found these and decided to try them. These are so much easier to use. You just need some long tweezers and glue.  Voila! You look amazing.</li>
            <li> Great concept, love these lashes I have them in small and medium. Fabulous on your eyes. I use the short ones for daily wear. They last around a week for each application. Then for more formal events I apply the medium pack. It goes very quick when applying, i use the &amp;#34;duo&amp;#34; glue so it wont pull out my lashes.  Glad someone thought of this .</li>
            <li> I Love these lashes.  I wear the short and medium. I use Ardelle lash tite glue in black.</li>
            <li> My favourite lashes, delivery was quick good price and service</li>
            <li> If you wear individual eyelashes, these are a time saver and easy to use!  I love them! but I have yet to find a really good glue that lasts more than 2 days.  I use duo black glue.</li>
            <li> works just as promised</li>
            <li> I love these lashes. They are convenient and easy to apply. They last about two weeks. Having the option for a 3 pack was perfect since they no longer sell them in my town. I had an issue with the delivery but they contacted me and resolved it. Would purchase from again! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Was supposed to be a three pack but I only received two :(</li>
            <li> Love these! My go to pick me up when i feel like i look tired - easy to apply with little room for error.</li>
            <li> These trio lashes are awesome. You can dress them up or down. You can wear a few or a lot. Very easy to apply. Fast shipping great seller.</li>
            <li> These are the best and most natural looking lashes there is for me. Much easier to apply than the full length version. Love them.</li>
