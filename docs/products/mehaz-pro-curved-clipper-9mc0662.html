            <li>Who knew a nail clipper could be so good.</li>
            <li>The curved handle allows for good control and force.</li>
            <li>in Japan, good quality.</li>
            <li>Good buying experience.  </li>
            <li>good product.</li>
            <li>works fairly well.</li>
            <li>They worked perfectly for many many years.  </li>
            <li>exceptional sharpness&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li>I would have gave more stars if it opened wider, it performs great otherwise.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this clipper.  </li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend this clipper, really a nice item at a great price!</li>
            <li>These clippers are amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great clipper that cuts smoothly through toenails.</li>
            <li>Amazing.. Just buy it..</li>
            <li>Nice clippers.  </li>
            <li>, lever does not have a good gripping surface</li>
            <li>The plastic collection bin is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The added file is nice.</li>
            <li>a nice idea.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The leverage provided by the large lever is very good and makes using the cutter (on finger nails) very easy.</li>
            <li>Not like the cheap drugstore type that don&#x27;t cut good.  </li>
            <li>A nice product for those that prefer elegant design over practicality and value.</li>
            <li>So far this has been excellent for both my toes and fingers.</li>
            <li>These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>A clipper that is super-sharp and collects the clippings for easy disposal!</li>
            <li>so you can grip them better.  </li>
            <li>After years of using cheap Walmart clippers, spending $9 on a good set seems ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe I am reviewing toenail trimmers, but I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li>a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>So glad i purchased this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found these clippers .</li>
            <li>but i figure if it catches most, or even some that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li>These are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many nail clippers</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure others have too.</li>
            <li>I do like the location of the filing surface, which is built into the clippers body, and results in better leverage &amp; control.</li>
            <li>These works better than any others I&#x27;ve had in 60 years.</li>
            <li>(to fix this I put some tape on the inside of the catcher so they would catch better.)  </li>
            <li>But with that out of the way, the clippers are not my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Much better than others we&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li>These clippers work great and the plastic catcher will collect all of your nail shrapnel until you&#x27;re ready to dump it out.</li>
            <li>They are simply the best I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>Two thumbs up :)</li>
            <li>and you could be sure that it will snap your nail off in one press.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for nail clipping.</li>
            <li>Works better without it.</li>
            <li>I like them even better than some clippers I&#x27;ve had that were made in Solingen Germany.</li>
            <li>so he has been quite pleased with these.</li>
            <li>keeps my nails from flying everywhere keeps it clean and tidy and then just dump the cut nails when done.</li>
            <li>These clippers cut precisely and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is the single best nail clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li>but I find the cheaper one more comfortable to use and</li>
            <li>The plastic cover to catch the nail droppings is hit and miss but as far as the clipper goes it is great.</li>
            <li>to strong for my soft fingernails but great for my toenails.</li>
            <li>It does take a few uses to be comfortable with these, but being able to do one more task oneself is a wonderful thing!</li>
            <li>sharp,strong easy to handle</li>
            <li>Easily removed and discarded if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>These are easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li>They cut his toe nails evenly and easily.</li>
            <li>Others have noted the cover doesn&#x27;t catch every bit of nail, and that&#x27;s true, but it catches most.  </li>
            <li>It is fine for fingernails or maybe a women&#x27;s toenails</li>
            <li>Fine clipper per se but unimpressed by feature that is supposed to catch clippings.  </li>
            <li>Strong, clean cut, easy to use</li>
            <li>Will effortlessly and accurately snip from the tiniest infant nails to any toenail that fits between the cutter opening.</li>
            <li>Huge with a lot of leverage.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>No it will cost me more for postage and tracking than what its worth.</li>
            <li>These clippers definitely fit that bill.</li>
            <li>looks great, and will likely stay sharper longer than the cheaper cutters.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t cut precise and mash my nails sometimes.  </li>
            <li>Lost old one to air travel, decided to look for a good one to replace it.</li>
            <li>It is far superior to the Tweezerman barrel spring nippers.  </li>
            <li>well made - sharp - very good quality</li>
            <li>However the $3 version also came with a similar plastic clipping holder and also had a very nice and practical non-slip sleeve over the lever.</li>
            <li>I originally ordered this clipper because I wanted the nail catcher.</li>
            <li>Cuts nail clean with any burr or leftovers.  </li>
            <li>well built, good leverage, bigger than the cheap drug store models.</li>
            <li>Best toenails that I have ever had: large sharp sturdy.</li>
            <li>This MEHAZ Professional toenail clipper is built very sturdy and fits in your hand very nicely.</li>
            <li>This Mehaz makes really nice cuts as it has  nice and sharp cutters.</li>
            <li>all the raving reviews are true.</li>
            <li>Many thanks</li>
            <li>Works great will cut through my thick toe nails easily with a snappy &amp;#34;Click &amp;#34;!</li>
            <li>He likes them very much and says that they are easy to handle.</li>
            <li>However, this product is much much better - is exactly what you need for toenails as it&#x27;s very shape, strong and durable.  </li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable for such a remarkably made</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t anticipated though, was how much effective this clipper is compared to cheap generic brands.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>This clipper works well just the right size and the blades cut clean.</li>
            <li>definitely very durable; easy to use; looks like they were constructed well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and cut very well.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found these clippers to be so much sharper than the cheap kind sold at local drug stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are solid feeling clippers, with a nice heft to them.  </li>
            <li>This was possibly the best seven bucks i&#x27;ve ever spent.  </li>
            <li>This #662 one supposed to be a toenail clipper but is the same width that a fingernail clipper I own.  </li>
            <li>Not even worth discussing it.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>One of the other clippers I purchased was twice the price and not quite as good.</li>
            <li>clippings catcher does not obscure or limit my ability to get the right cut, of my nail, in any way.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s always something not quite right with nail clippers...</li>
            <li>Used right away and would buy again.</li>
            <li>Notice how the top lever is shaped, making it easy to grip and giving the user more power to clip those thick nails.</li>
            <li>works as expected, seems super sharp, best I have ever had</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really have that problem since the cuts were pretty clean.</li>
            <li>May I suggest to those having trouble gripping their metal clippers, wrap the top and bottom parts with a non-slip tape like athletic tape or non-shiny electrical tape (this is what I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are probably a better quality of steel and may stay sharper longer than the Made in Chinese pair</li>
            <li>They could do away with that and simple sens a file of some sort with the clippers and it would be better than the set up they have now.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased and will add an extra set to keep in my office for emergencies.</li>
            <li>The top piece of metal had the Mehaz stamp on it, when the rest of it fel apart two weeks later it said made in Japan.  </li>
            <li>Best nail clipper; extended lever provides added torque for those difficult to cut nails</li>
            <li>The cover seems to catch many clippings which is a nice bonus and the filer on the back is better than the middle rail on other cutters, although you don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; tool to get the dirt from under the nail.</li>
            <li>Correct shape for my toes, easily applies force needed for thick toenails, and gathers the clippings quite effectively instead of shooting all over the room.</li>
            <li>There is a plastic casing that captures most of the clippings, and a nice emory-like patch on the underside for cleaning up the cuts, which actually works unlike other clippers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll last a long time, even if I were able to use them.  </li>
            <li>It seems that the nail clipper authorities have determined that the straight-cut or flat type are much better for you.</li>
            <li>Looks very sleek &amp; stylish in a brushed steel finish and it has a lifetime guarantee as well that I wasn&#x27;t even aware of before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>Nice, even clip and sharp blade.  </li>
            <li>Did all the positive reviewers get paid?</li>
            <li>On the positive side, when you do get it to clip, it clips well.</li>
            <li>The clippers are easy to hold and offer a firm, easy, and study \\&quot;click\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Clipped my monster big toe nail easily</li>
            <li>This cuts through easily because it&#x27;s big with a well-designed lever.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are large and work well for toenails as well as finger nails.</li>
            <li>I have relatively large hands</li>
            <li>This is the large size one, just to mention, since it&#x27;s not in description and just saying toenail in description make me doubt on the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are encased in a plastic tube that collects the nail shavings and are strong enough to clip the nail without much fuss at all.</li>
            <li>Stainless steel and a good, sharp edge are the major selling points here.</li>
            <li>I was really irritated of having my nail bits fly all the over place and stepping on them in odd areas when using generic clippers.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and make a clean smooth cut.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this as a huge improvement from the drugstore brands.</li>
            <li>I thought I was ordering the straight-edge version; so I won&#x27;t be using these very often.  </li>
            <li>Each cut very well</li>
            <li>I finally took the plastic off,  but they still don&#x27;t fit correctly to clip my toenails.  </li>
            <li>I believe that \\&quot;they\\&quot; think that a totally straight cut stops the possibility of ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>I never thought toenail clippers much mattered until I used these.</li>
            <li>but once you try it compared to a cheap generic you&#x27;ll understand.</li>
            <li>The steel shape is perfect for nail cutting.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt really serve any purpose.</li>
            <li>Good clippers, and just the right size and opening for tough toenails.</li>
            <li>They are precise, efficient and cut cleanly with little effort.</li>
            <li>clippers aren&#x27;t sharp enough, grip isn&#x27;t so good, etc.</li>
            <li>its just ok not as sharp as I would have thought..</li>
            <li>They are super-sharp, and I like the curved blade for my particular toenails - the straight ones don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li>Love these.. very sharp, i have to hide them so no one else can walk off with them.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this clipper and will never go back to generic clippers.</li>
            <li>I use Feather, which are made by Kai, double edge razor blades for my daily shave, and love them</li>
            <li>but they are NOT rustproof (which is one of the main reasons I bought them).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>High Quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Looks high quality product.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My nails are now very easy to cut, no more ripping my nails off or cuts that were incomplete.</li>
            <li>They are sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I lost, misplaced, my favorite clippers and needed a replacement.</li>
            <li>Nice looking brushed steel and very sharp.</li>
            <li>They are very sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly, with minimal effort and doesn&#x27;t leave a ragged edge to catch on your socks.</li>
            <li>the honestly chinese $2 toenail clipper I have is twice as wide and much better aligned than this one.</li>
            <li>Since the bottom portion is kind of thick, it was more difficult for me to cut my toenails short (but I probably cut my toenails shorter than many people).</li>
            <li>In other words, they are being taught that they better use the straight-cut clippers unless they open themselves up to ingrown toenail lawsuits.  </li>
            <li>Only a bit more expensive than the junk from the supermarket or the local drugstore, but clips nails so much better!</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>They make a noticeable \\&quot;clip\\&quot; sound when you press down</li>
            <li>Clean sharp cuts every time.</li>
            <li>They are not as large as some toenail clippers I have purchased, although they are larger than fingernail clippers (as expected).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This opens just large enough to cut finger nails.  </li>
            <li>Sturdy construction and super sharp.  </li>
            <li>I like products that have unexpected results.  </li>
            <li>it feels very machined, and has a very fluid feel.</li>
            <li>This happens because its falling out of the mouth of the clipper not that it&#x27;s completely ineffective.</li>
            <li>They are more expensive than drugstore clippers, but definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li>Unlike cheap generics when they aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut with one press and might even bend your nail.</li>
            <li>I think it should be fine as long as I&#x27;m careful.</li>
            <li>It opens a full .085 inch or a little over 2 mm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The spring action is the smooth, and the blades are sharp, cutting cleanly and quickly.  </li>
            <li>The little nail file on the back side is handy for smoothing any rough edges</li>
            <li>The nail catcher works really well as long as you don&#x27;t tilt the clippers downwards.</li>
            <li>The clippings catcher actually works (most of the time), but can make it hard to get to the sides of the nail.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re solidly constructed of good metal, but if they don&#x27;t work on my toenails, they&#x27;re useless to me</li>
            <li>OK maybe I am cynical a little bit but the curved clippers are getting harder and harder to find, especially in the larger toenail size, which are the perfect size for a man&#x27;s fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy again if the need arises, but I might look around to see if there are any other options first.</li>
            <li>It barely catches anything!</li>
            <li>My fingers tend to slip and I am blessed with very thick fingernails (I can lightly turn screws with them!), so trimming my fingernails or toenails with those puny clippers often results in swearing and</li>
            <li>These are very sharp and clip nails easily and are probably better than the $2 clipper you&#x27;ll get at the drug store, I do find them to be a bit awkward and sometimes clip my nails too close.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and sharp nail clipper made in Japan.</li>
            <li>I REALLY miss the nail file that you get with other clippers.</li>
            <li>and I have to be careful not to remove too much nail after clipping and using the file portion briefly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, when I cut thick nails, it will make an extra &#x27;clipping&#x27; sound when I release.  </li>
            <li>The high angle of the press lever also helps a lot, it feels so much easier to clip nails, it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty big, which I thought would be awkward to hold in my little hands, but it ended up being no trouble at all and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I dont really like how little nail you can cut off at a time.</li>

            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> Great clippers -</li>
            <li> Who knew a nail clipper could be so good.</li>
            <li> The curved handle allows for good control and force.</li>
            <li> in Japan, good quality.</li>
            <li> Good buying experience.  </li>
            <li> good product.</li>
            <li> works fairly well.</li>
            <li> They worked perfectly for many many years.  </li>
            <li> exceptional sharpness&lt;br /&gt;Best</li>
            <li> I would have gave more stars if it opened wider, it performs great otherwise.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this clipper.  </li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend this clipper, really a nice item at a great price!</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper that cuts smoothly through toenails.</li>
            <li> Amazing.. Just buy it..</li>
            <li> Nice clippers.  </li>
            <li> , lever does not have a good gripping surface</li>
            <li> The plastic collection bin is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The added file is nice.</li>
            <li> a nice idea.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The leverage provided by the large lever is very good and makes using the cutter (on finger nails) very easy.</li>
            <li> Not like the cheap drugstore type that don&#x27;t cut good.  </li>
            <li> A nice product for those that prefer elegant design over practicality and value.</li>
            <li> So far this has been excellent for both my toes and fingers.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> A clipper that is super-sharp and collects the clippings for easy disposal!</li>
            <li> so you can grip them better.  </li>
            <li> After years of using cheap Walmart clippers, spending $9 on a good set seems ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I am reviewing toenail trimmers, but I love these clippers.  </li>
            <li> a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> So glad i purchased this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these clippers .</li>
            <li> but i figure if it catches most, or even some that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> These are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many nail clippers</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure others have too.</li>
            <li> I do like the location of the filing surface, which is built into the clippers body, and results in better leverage &amp; control.</li>
            <li> These works better than any others I&#x27;ve had in 60 years.</li>
            <li> (to fix this I put some tape on the inside of the catcher so they would catch better.)  </li>
            <li> But with that out of the way, the clippers are not my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Much better than others we&#x27;ve bought before.</li>
            <li> These clippers work great and the plastic catcher will collect all of your nail shrapnel until you&#x27;re ready to dump it out.</li>
            <li> They are simply the best I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> Two thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> and you could be sure that it will snap your nail off in one press.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for nail clipping.</li>
            <li> Works better without it.</li>
            <li> I like them even better than some clippers I&#x27;ve had that were made in Solingen Germany.</li>
            <li> so he has been quite pleased with these.</li>
            <li> keeps my nails from flying everywhere keeps it clean and tidy and then just dump the cut nails when done.</li>
            <li> These clippers cut precisely and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is the single best nail clipper I have ever used.</li>
            <li> but I find the cheaper one more comfortable to use and</li>
            <li> The plastic cover to catch the nail droppings is hit and miss but as far as the clipper goes it is great.</li>
            <li> to strong for my soft fingernails but great for my toenails.</li>
            <li> It does take a few uses to be comfortable with these, but being able to do one more task oneself is a wonderful thing!</li>
            <li> sharp,strong easy to handle</li>
            <li> Easily removed and discarded if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> These are easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li> They cut his toe nails evenly and easily.</li>
            <li> Others have noted the cover doesn&#x27;t catch every bit of nail, and that&#x27;s true, but it catches most.  </li>
            <li> It is fine for fingernails or maybe a women&#x27;s toenails</li>
            <li> Fine clipper per se but unimpressed by feature that is supposed to catch clippings.  </li>
            <li> Strong, clean cut, easy to use</li>
            <li> Will effortlessly and accurately snip from the tiniest infant nails to any toenail that fits between the cutter opening.</li>
            <li> Huge with a lot of leverage.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> No it will cost me more for postage and tracking than what its worth.</li>
            <li> These clippers definitely fit that bill.</li>
            <li> looks great, and will likely stay sharper longer than the cheaper cutters.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cut precise and mash my nails sometimes.  </li>
            <li> Lost old one to air travel, decided to look for a good one to replace it.</li>
            <li> It is far superior to the Tweezerman barrel spring nippers.  </li>
            <li> well made - sharp - very good quality</li>
            <li> However the $3 version also came with a similar plastic clipping holder and also had a very nice and practical non-slip sleeve over the lever.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this clipper because I wanted the nail catcher.</li>
            <li> Cuts nail clean with any burr or leftovers.  </li>
            <li> well built, good leverage, bigger than the cheap drug store models.</li>
            <li> Best toenails that I have ever had: large sharp sturdy.</li>
            <li> This MEHAZ Professional toenail clipper is built very sturdy and fits in your hand very nicely.</li>
            <li> This Mehaz makes really nice cuts as it has  nice and sharp cutters.</li>
            <li> all the raving reviews are true.</li>
            <li> Many thanks</li>
            <li> Works great will cut through my thick toe nails easily with a snappy &amp;#34;Click &amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> He likes them very much and says that they are easy to handle.</li>
            <li> However, this product is much much better - is exactly what you need for toenails as it&#x27;s very shape, strong and durable.  </li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable for such a remarkably made</li>
            <li> What I didn&#x27;t anticipated though, was how much effective this clipper is compared to cheap generic brands.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> This clipper works well just the right size and the blades cut clean.</li>
            <li> definitely very durable; easy to use; looks like they were constructed well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and cut very well.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found these clippers to be so much sharper than the cheap kind sold at local drug stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are solid feeling clippers, with a nice heft to them.  </li>
            <li> This was possibly the best seven bucks i&#x27;ve ever spent.  </li>
            <li> This #662 one supposed to be a toenail clipper but is the same width that a fingernail clipper I own.  </li>
            <li> Not even worth discussing it.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> One of the other clippers I purchased was twice the price and not quite as good.</li>
            <li> clippings catcher does not obscure or limit my ability to get the right cut, of my nail, in any way.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s always something not quite right with nail clippers...</li>
            <li> Used right away and would buy again.</li>
            <li> Notice how the top lever is shaped, making it easy to grip and giving the user more power to clip those thick nails.</li>
            <li> works as expected, seems super sharp, best I have ever had</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really have that problem since the cuts were pretty clean.</li>
            <li> May I suggest to those having trouble gripping their metal clippers, wrap the top and bottom parts with a non-slip tape like athletic tape or non-shiny electrical tape (this is what I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are probably a better quality of steel and may stay sharper longer than the Made in Chinese pair</li>
            <li> They could do away with that and simple sens a file of some sort with the clippers and it would be better than the set up they have now.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased and will add an extra set to keep in my office for emergencies.</li>
            <li> The top piece of metal had the Mehaz stamp on it, when the rest of it fel apart two weeks later it said made in Japan.  </li>
            <li> Best nail clipper; extended lever provides added torque for those difficult to cut nails</li>
            <li> The cover seems to catch many clippings which is a nice bonus and the filer on the back is better than the middle rail on other cutters, although you don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; tool to get the dirt from under the nail.</li>
            <li> Correct shape for my toes, easily applies force needed for thick toenails, and gathers the clippings quite effectively instead of shooting all over the room.</li>
            <li> There is a plastic casing that captures most of the clippings, and a nice emory-like patch on the underside for cleaning up the cuts, which actually works unlike other clippers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll last a long time, even if I were able to use them.  </li>
            <li> It seems that the nail clipper authorities have determined that the straight-cut or flat type are much better for you.</li>
            <li> Looks very sleek &amp; stylish in a brushed steel finish and it has a lifetime guarantee as well that I wasn&#x27;t even aware of before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> Nice, even clip and sharp blade.  </li>
            <li> Did all the positive reviewers get paid?</li>
            <li> On the positive side, when you do get it to clip, it clips well.</li>
            <li> The clippers are easy to hold and offer a firm, easy, and study \\&quot;click\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Clipped my monster big toe nail easily</li>
            <li> This cuts through easily because it&#x27;s big with a well-designed lever.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are large and work well for toenails as well as finger nails.</li>
            <li> I have relatively large hands</li>
            <li> This is the large size one, just to mention, since it&#x27;s not in description and just saying toenail in description make me doubt on the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are encased in a plastic tube that collects the nail shavings and are strong enough to clip the nail without much fuss at all.</li>
            <li> Stainless steel and a good, sharp edge are the major selling points here.</li>
            <li> I was really irritated of having my nail bits fly all the over place and stepping on them in odd areas when using generic clippers.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and make a clean smooth cut.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this as a huge improvement from the drugstore brands.</li>
            <li> I thought I was ordering the straight-edge version; so I won&#x27;t be using these very often.  </li>
            <li> Each cut very well</li>
            <li> I finally took the plastic off,  but they still don&#x27;t fit correctly to clip my toenails.  </li>
            <li> I believe that \\&quot;they\\&quot; think that a totally straight cut stops the possibility of ingrown toenails.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> I never thought toenail clippers much mattered until I used these.</li>
            <li> but once you try it compared to a cheap generic you&#x27;ll understand.</li>
            <li> The steel shape is perfect for nail cutting.  </li>
            <li> It doesnt really serve any purpose.</li>
            <li> Good clippers, and just the right size and opening for tough toenails.</li>
            <li> They are precise, efficient and cut cleanly with little effort.</li>
            <li> clippers aren&#x27;t sharp enough, grip isn&#x27;t so good, etc.</li>
            <li> its just ok not as sharp as I would have thought..</li>
            <li> They are super-sharp, and I like the curved blade for my particular toenails - the straight ones don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> Love these.. very sharp, i have to hide them so no one else can walk off with them.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this clipper and will never go back to generic clippers.</li>
            <li> I use Feather, which are made by Kai, double edge razor blades for my daily shave, and love them</li>
            <li> but they are NOT rustproof (which is one of the main reasons I bought them).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> High Quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Looks high quality product.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My nails are now very easy to cut, no more ripping my nails off or cuts that were incomplete.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I lost, misplaced, my favorite clippers and needed a replacement.</li>
            <li> Nice looking brushed steel and very sharp.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly, with minimal effort and doesn&#x27;t leave a ragged edge to catch on your socks.</li>
            <li> the honestly chinese $2 toenail clipper I have is twice as wide and much better aligned than this one.</li>
            <li> Since the bottom portion is kind of thick, it was more difficult for me to cut my toenails short (but I probably cut my toenails shorter than many people).</li>
            <li> In other words, they are being taught that they better use the straight-cut clippers unless they open themselves up to ingrown toenail lawsuits.  </li>
            <li> Only a bit more expensive than the junk from the supermarket or the local drugstore, but clips nails so much better!</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> They make a noticeable \\&quot;clip\\&quot; sound when you press down</li>
            <li> Clean sharp cuts every time.</li>
            <li> They are not as large as some toenail clippers I have purchased, although they are larger than fingernail clippers (as expected).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This opens just large enough to cut finger nails.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy construction and super sharp.  </li>
            <li> I like products that have unexpected results.  </li>
            <li> it feels very machined, and has a very fluid feel.</li>
            <li> This happens because its falling out of the mouth of the clipper not that it&#x27;s completely ineffective.</li>
            <li> They are more expensive than drugstore clippers, but definitely worth it.  </li>
            <li> Unlike cheap generics when they aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut with one press and might even bend your nail.</li>
            <li> I think it should be fine as long as I&#x27;m careful.</li>
            <li> It opens a full .085 inch or a little over 2 mm.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The spring action is the smooth, and the blades are sharp, cutting cleanly and quickly.  </li>
            <li> The little nail file on the back side is handy for smoothing any rough edges</li>
            <li> The nail catcher works really well as long as you don&#x27;t tilt the clippers downwards.</li>
            <li> The clippings catcher actually works (most of the time), but can make it hard to get to the sides of the nail.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re solidly constructed of good metal, but if they don&#x27;t work on my toenails, they&#x27;re useless to me</li>
            <li> OK maybe I am cynical a little bit but the curved clippers are getting harder and harder to find, especially in the larger toenail size, which are the perfect size for a man&#x27;s fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy again if the need arises, but I might look around to see if there are any other options first.</li>
            <li> It barely catches anything!</li>
            <li> My fingers tend to slip and I am blessed with very thick fingernails (I can lightly turn screws with them!), so trimming my fingernails or toenails with those puny clippers often results in swearing and</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and clip nails easily and are probably better than the $2 clipper you&#x27;ll get at the drug store, I do find them to be a bit awkward and sometimes clip my nails too close.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and sharp nail clipper made in Japan.</li>
            <li> I REALLY miss the nail file that you get with other clippers.</li>
            <li> and I have to be careful not to remove too much nail after clipping and using the file portion briefly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, when I cut thick nails, it will make an extra &#x27;clipping&#x27; sound when I release.  </li>
            <li> The high angle of the press lever also helps a lot, it feels so much easier to clip nails, it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty big, which I thought would be awkward to hold in my little hands, but it ended up being no trouble at all and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I dont really like how little nail you can cut off at a time.</li>
            <li> What happens is when I cut thick nails, the clipper upper and lower jaw overlaps each other, and so it make an extra sound when you release it.</li>
            <li> This clipper is sturdy, heavy, and above all super sharp!</li>
            <li> They are large enough to be held by someone who has trouble with small objects, and don&#x27;t require too much dexterity to use.  </li>
            <li> The weight and size of this clipper makes it so much easier to use compared to small generics.</li>
            <li> : Nice looking, very sharp, Japanese steel&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Expensive compared to other options</li>
            <li> My parent has found these very helpful, changing from her previous plain nail scissors, which are now not usable by her.  </li>
            <li> These are sharp enough that its almost effortless to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Solid, extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> Well designed, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave my fingernails feeling weird, like other cheaper products do.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be weird at first, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying those crappy little generic clippers for way too long.  </li>
            <li> This does a fine job cutting toenails</li>
            <li> The plastic catcher though I removed as it seems to get in the way of using the edges of the blade for fine cutting but</li>
            <li> It would have been 5 if the curve was a little larger.  </li>
            <li> They are big enough and tough enough to do the work that they are required to do.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful not to cut too close and have a notch in my nail.  </li>
            <li> This product was not real.  </li>
            <li> but If you have thick mature nails I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought a smaller one with different brand and it was broken as that&#x27;s not good for toenails (much thicker).  </li>
            <li> Wide curved &amp; clean cutting jaws.</li>
            <li> Really sharp so be careful.</li>
            <li> They are sharp and cut like I&#x27;d expect clippers to cut.  </li>
            <li> These clippers are no better than the 99cent ones purchased locally.</li>
            <li> They split my nails and leave sharp edges.  </li>
            <li> sharp, and have stayed that way for awhile now</li>
            <li> So sharp that I kept nicking my skin while clipping my nails.  </li>
            <li> The fact that they&#x27;re sharp means they do the job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m prone to ingrown nails and have to be very careful around the corners; the curve on these won&#x27;t allow for that.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because the curve is a little too small for my big toe</li>
            <li> so I have had trouble in the past using smaller clippers.</li>
            <li> This thinking I believe has trickled down and through the \\&quot;rank-and-file\\&quot;</li>
            <li> a plastic casing that covers the took except for the handle that you push down.  </li>
            <li> no complaints other than catcher gets in the way a little bit.</li>
            <li> So sharp I ended up cutting myself on the first use, so I have learned to be cautious with them.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp</li>
            <li> Very sharp, does not bend the nail.  </li>
            <li> The edges of the cutter are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Cannot think of a single negative, other than it does not include a fold out tool for cleaning under the nails</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t clip my toes with the plastic nail catcher on, didn&#x27;t work for half the time anyway.</li>
            <li> The Mehaz clippers clip your nails extremely gently and they are extremely sharp cutting well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the plastic is a thin strip that grinds sharp edges of recently clipped nails.  </li>
            <li> These are very sharp and heavy duty clippers.</li>
            <li> The small generic ones are much harder to operate and when the blades are dull, you have to squeeze hard</li>
            <li> The little plastic clippings catcher just gets in the way.</li>
            <li> (If they had been just a little wider, I would have given the 5th star.)</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me you don&#x27;t want to use those little fingernail clippers at all and prefer toe nail clippers for both your hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> It cuts thick nails like cutting through soft butter, unlike the Tweezerman nippers that can&#x27;t cut through the same nail.</li>
            <li> I usually hear than on cheap nail cutters, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> The plastic bottom is a little weird but not enough for me to dislike it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t Japanese  engineers figure out to cut tough and thick toenails?  </li>
            <li> Would not hesitate to purchase again, if mine gets lost or someone &amp;#34;borrows&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is not quite figured out is the nail catcher sleeve, as it partially dumps the clippings when you need to angle downward when cutting.</li>
            <li> The cutting area is also slightly larger than one of the other brands.  </li>
            <li> Small profile.</li>
            <li> The Mehaz line of clippers is unlike any others that I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> This vendor is not reputable.</li>
            <li> He has had problems in the past</li>
            <li> I also have the nail clippers, I find them to be to small go with the toe size instead.</li>
            <li> My lost ones were the larger toenail clippers with a slightly curved cutting surface.  </li>
            <li> The space between the blades is very narrow.  </li>
            <li> I do not like fingernail trimmers, finding them too small for my clumsy fingers, so I have always used toenail clippers.  </li>
            <li> How hard can it be?  </li>
            <li> My husband uses these nail clippers for his hard to handle toe nails.</li>
            <li> My only complaint (taking off 1 star for this) is that the shape of the handle is a bit awkward to hold.</li>
            <li> This clipper makes my thick toe nail clipping a breeze.  </li>
            <li> No more nail ends flying across the room!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the nail catcher doesn&#x27;t always work especially when you&#x27;re cutting off small pieces of your nail.</li>
            <li> read a recommendation for the Mehaz fingernail clippers after losing it from being unable to find the 100 pairs I have probably purchased over the years, and the price is not much more than those in retail stores, so I figured why not splurge and see if they are all that.  </li>
            <li> they&#x27;re very hard to get out.</li>
            <li> However the opening is very narrow making it difficult to use on toe nails.  </li>
            <li> After trying several brands and having been less than enthused to downright disgusted</li>
            <li> My toenails are tough and this does the job without struggling with it.</li>
            <li> boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> which I think is why my nails feel weird after using them.</li>
            <li> His toe nails are somewhat difficult to cut</li>
            <li> My toe nails are horrible and this finally did</li>
            <li> Horrible - way to sharp - dangerous.</li>
            <li> No way will it cut toenails and even if you could get it in the cutting jaws, no leverage.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t look at it as a bad thing though.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The hubby says it is the best clipper he&#x27;s had, and he bought the one for his finger nails also.</li>
            <li> These are great clippers.  Ergonomic, and there is a sanded surface on the bottom so you can grip them better.  Lightweight.  I had to remove the catcher in order to get close enough to my nail, but this didn&#x27;t bother me as I did not purchase for this reason.  I thought I was ordering the straight-edge version; so I won&#x27;t be using these very often.  I&#x27;m prone to ingrown nails and have to be very careful around the corners; the curve on these won&#x27;t allow for that.</li>
            <li> keeps my nails from flying everywhere keeps it clean and tidy and then just dump the cut nails when done. works great</li>
            <li> These clippers are great.  Not like the cheap drugstore type that don&#x27;t cut good.  These clippers cut my nails instead of breaking my nails.  They are sharp and cut like I&#x27;d expect clippers to cut.  They have Kai written on the clippers too and made in Japan.  These clippers are large and work well for toenails as well as finger nails.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great.  Very easy to use.  These are sharp enough that its almost effortless to use.&lt;br /&gt;It wouldn&#x27;t bother me though if it didn&#x27;t have the catcher attached.</li>
            <li> Nice clippers.  After years of using cheap Walmart clippers, spending $9 on a good set seems ridiculously cheap.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I am reviewing toenail trimmers, but I love these clippers.  I do not like fingernail trimmers, finding them too small for my clumsy fingers, so I have always used toenail clippers.  My fingers tend to slip and I am blessed with very thick fingernails (I can lightly turn screws with them!), so trimming my fingernails or toenails with those puny clippers often results in swearing and injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a recommendation for the Mehaz fingernail clippers after losing it from being unable to find the 100 pairs I have probably purchased over the years, and the price is not much more than those in retail stores, so I figured why not splurge and see if they are all that.  Well, they are all that, especially these big guys.  They are not as large as some toenail clippers I have purchased, although they are larger than fingernail clippers (as expected).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are solid feeling clippers, with a nice heft to them.  The spring action is the smooth, and the blades are sharp, cutting cleanly and quickly.  So sharp I ended up cutting myself on the first use, so I have learned to be cautious with them.  There is a plastic casing that captures most of the clippings, and a nice emory-like patch on the underside for cleaning up the cuts, which actually works unlike other clippers.  Cannot think of a single negative, other than it does not include a fold out tool for cleaning under the nails (what I always assumed that thing is for, anyway!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are made in Japan, which leads me to expect they will outlast me.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These were advertised as being made in Germany.  The bottom of the clippers say Made in Japan.  DOH! Still they do what they&#x27;re supposed to do.  These clippers cut precisely and are very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Nice looking brushed steel and very sharp. A nice product for those that prefer elegant design over practicality and value. They are probably a better quality of steel and may stay sharper longer than the Made in Chinese pair I bought for a bit over $3 at the local discount store to compare them with. However the $3 version also came with a similar plastic clipping holder and also had a very nice and practical non-slip sleeve over the lever. Each cut very well but I find the cheaper one more comfortable to use and a better value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Nice looking, very sharp, Japanese steel&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Expensive compared to other options, lever does not have a good gripping surface</li>
            <li> These clippers are no better than the 99cent ones purchased locally. They split my nails and leave sharp edges.  The little plastic clippings catcher just gets in the way. Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
            <li> These clippers are amazing. The Mehaz clippers clip your nails extremely gently and they are extremely sharp cutting well. The nail catcher works really well as long as you don&#x27;t tilt the clippers downwards.</li>
            <li> They are very sharp and easy to use</li>
            <li> Strong, clean cut, easy to use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying those crappy little generic clippers for way too long.  This was possibly the best seven bucks i&#x27;ve ever spent.  Quality tool.</li>
            <li> The best clippers i ever used!  Clipped my monster big toe nail easily</li>
            <li> These clippers are made in Japan by KAI and cross branded Mehaz.  I have a KAI fingernail clipper that I bought in Tokyo ago and it is still in excellent condition after 10 years of use. It is also cross branded by Fernandes.  This #662 one supposed to be a toenail clipper but is the same width that a fingernail clipper I own.  The jaws of the clipper do not match. When it closes the lower jaw goes in front of the upper one.  I think chinese put \\&quot;Made in Japan\\&quot; stamp on these clippers.  BTW the honestly chinese $2 toenail clipper I have is twice as wide and much better aligned than this one.</li>
            <li> So glad i purchased this. Makes&lt;br /&gt;clipping your toe nails easier.</li>
            <li> How hard can it be?  The only thing toenail clipper about it, is the name on the package. Did all the positive reviewers get paid? Can&#x27;t Japanese  engineers figure out to cut tough and thick toenails?  This opens just large enough to cut finger nails.  No way will it cut toenails and even if you could get it in the cutting jaws, no leverage.&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased because of the glowing Reviews on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;  Is this a different model?  It opens a full .085 inch or a little over 2 mm.&lt;br /&gt;I need to come out of retirement and design toenail clippers.&lt;br /&gt; Am I sending it back?  No it will cost me more for postage and tracking than what its worth.</li>
            <li> The space between the blades is very narrow.  It is fine for fingernails or maybe a women&#x27;s toenails but If you have thick mature nails I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> its just ok not as sharp as I would have thought..its made in japan but not Japanese half decent steel thahts used to make it</li>
            <li> Wide curved &amp; clean cutting jaws.</li>
            <li> the best. sharp,strong easy to handle</li>
            <li> I do not like them.  I finally took the plastic off,  but they still don&#x27;t fit correctly to clip my toenails.  I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll last a long time, even if I were able to use them.  They&#x27;re solidly constructed of good metal, but if they don&#x27;t work on my toenails, they&#x27;re useless to me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I found these clippers . They&#x27;re the only ones I have ever found that can cut my Fred Flintstone sized toe nails.</li>
            <li> So far this has been excellent for both my toes and fingers. The clippings catcher actually works (most of the time), but can make it hard to get to the sides of the nail.</li>
            <li> I lost, misplaced, my favorite clippers and needed a replacement. My lost ones were the larger toenail clippers with a slightly curved cutting surface.  They worked perfectly for many many years.  I thought finding a replacement pair would be a snap.....boy was I wrong. It seems that the nail clipper authorities have determined that the straight-cut or flat type are much better for you. I believe that \\&quot;they\\&quot; think that a totally straight cut stops the possibility of ingrown toenails. This thinking I believe has trickled down and through the \\&quot;rank-and-file\\&quot; (pun intended) as i would think is mandatory curriculum in beauty collages.  In other words, they are being taught that they better use the straight-cut clippers unless they open themselves up to ingrown toenail lawsuits.  OK maybe I am cynical a little bit but the curved clippers are getting harder and harder to find, especially in the larger toenail size, which are the perfect size for a man&#x27;s fingernails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could take or leave the clipped nail catcher but i figure if it catches most, or even some that&#x27;s a plus. Easily removed and discarded if you don&#x27;t like it. However, no one has mentioned the filing bar on the back of these clippers. It is excellent!!!  Very sharp and I have to be careful not to remove too much nail after clipping and using the file portion briefly.  Anyway, I do some jeweler work and have quite a collection of pliers, and files, burs and tools and such and I can speak from experience that using properly hardened tool steel is the only way to go. These clippers definitely fit that bill.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Just got this in the mail today.  The clippers are easy to hold and offer a firm, easy, and study \\&quot;click\\&quot;.  Feels sturdy in my hand and works great!  I took off the nail catcher because I don&#x27;t like them, but my wife (I&#x27;m reviewing from her account) might want to use it.  I gave it 4 stars because the curve is a little too small for my big toe so I have to be careful not to cut too close and have a notch in my nail.  It would have been 5 if the curve was a little larger.  I think it should be fine as long as I&#x27;m careful.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, exceptional sharpness&lt;br /&gt;Best nail cutter ever had</li>
            <li> This is the single best nail clipper I have ever used. Will effortlessly and accurately snip from the tiniest infant nails to any toenail that fits between the cutter opening. Would not hesitate to purchase again, if mine gets lost or someone &amp;#34;borrows&amp;#34; it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that is not quite figured out is the nail catcher sleeve, as it partially dumps the clippings when you need to angle downward when cutting.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and sharp nail clipper made in Japan. It&#x27;s pretty big, which I thought would be awkward to hold in my little hands, but it ended up being no trouble at all and very comfortable. I use it for both my fingers and toes with ease. Since the bottom portion is kind of thick, it was more difficult for me to cut my toenails short (but I probably cut my toenails shorter than many people). The plastic catch for the nail clippings is convenient, but I don&#x27;t like how some pieces get stuck in-between the metal-- they&#x27;re very hard to get out.</li>
            <li> I can use these as a toenail clipper.  Huge with a lot of leverage.&lt;br /&gt;Much to strong for my soft fingernails but great for my toenails.</li>
            <li> I purchased four different clippers to compare and contrast.  These are my favorite.  They are very sharp and make a clean smooth cut.  The cutting area is also slightly larger than one of the other brands.  They are more expensive than drugstore clippers, but definitely worth it.  One of the other clippers I purchased was twice the price and not quite as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found these clippers to be so much sharper than the cheap kind sold at local drug stores. My nails are now very easy to cut, no more ripping my nails off or cuts that were incomplete. This MEHAZ Professional toenail clipper is built very sturdy and fits in your hand very nicely. Notice how the top lever is shaped, making it easy to grip and giving the user more power to clip those thick nails. May I suggest to those having trouble gripping their metal clippers, wrap the top and bottom parts with a non-slip tape like athletic tape or non-shiny electrical tape (this is what I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clippings catcher does not obscure or limit my ability to get the right cut, of my nail, in any way. The bottom line, these clippers exceeded my expectations thus, a 5-star rating!</li>
            <li> This is a solid nail clipper. I&#x27;ve gone through many nail clippers and I&#x27;m sure others have too. There&#x27;s always something not quite right with nail clippers...clippers aren&#x27;t sharp enough, grip isn&#x27;t so good, etc. But I think these clippers are on point.</li>
            <li> This does a fine job cutting toenails but I had to remove the plastic nail catcher because it gets in the way.  A bit pricey but it works well, looks great, and will likely stay sharper longer than the cheaper cutters.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great. I use them for my hands and feet. The plastic collection bin is a nice touch. I thought it would be weird at first, but it&#x27;s barely noticeable. My only complaint (taking off 1 star for this) is that the shape of the handle is a bit awkward to hold. It&#x27;s not like the standard garbage clippers that are sold everywhere. Stainless steel and a good, sharp edge are the major selling points here. Since I keep mine near/on the sink, rusted out clippers have been a problem. Not anymore. I&#x27;d buy again if the need arises, but I might look around to see if there are any other options first.</li>
            <li> Had no idea that a nail clipper could work so well. Cuts cleanly, with minimal effort and doesn&#x27;t leave a ragged edge to catch on your socks. Its over sized for toe nails, but there were no problems using this on fingernails. The plastic housing does catch the nail clippings, but somehow a clipping here and there still goes flying out. Only a bit more expensive than the junk from the supermarket or the local drugstore, but clips nails so much better!</li>
            <li> Best toenails that I have ever had: large sharp sturdy. I have relatively large hands so I have had trouble in the past using smaller clippers. These are easy to hold and manipulate.</li>
            <li> Wow! Lost old one to air travel, decided to look for a good one to replace it. Reviews said this was it and they are correct- wow!</li>
            <li> This clipper takes some getting used too. I couldn&#x27;t clip my toes with the plastic nail catcher on, didn&#x27;t work for half the time anyway. I REALLY miss the nail file that you get with other clippers. On the positive side, when you do get it to clip, it clips well.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and clip nails easily and are probably better than the $2 clipper you&#x27;ll get at the drug store, I do find them to be a bit awkward and sometimes clip my nails too close.  I guess there&#x27;s a learning curve for me that I&#x27;ll need to master.  I do like the location of the filing surface, which is built into the clippers body, and results in better leverage &amp; control.</li>
            <li> all the raving reviews are true. Who knew a nail clipper could be so good. Makes me wonder why I only ever bought clippers from the drug store</li>
            <li> These works better than any others I&#x27;ve had in 60 years.</li>
            <li> Very sharp, does not bend the nail.  The best I have ever owned.  The plastic cover to catch the nail droppings is hit and miss but as far as the clipper goes it is great.</li>
            <li> These have worked pretty well for the past year. No sign of rust or anything. (If they had been just a little wider, I would have given the 5th star.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had anything but a cheapo toenail clipper, so I got these.  They are super-sharp, and I like the curved blade for my particular toenails - the straight ones don&#x27;t work well for me.</li>
            <li> Horrible - way to sharp - dangerous.</li>
            <li> awesome clippers!  sharp, and have stayed that way for awhile now</li>
            <li> definitely very durable; easy to use; looks like they were constructed well. The plastic bottom is a little weird but not enough for me to dislike it.</li>
            <li> These are a god send!</li>
            <li> works as expected, seems super sharp, best I have ever had</li>
            <li> well made - sharp - very good quality</li>
            <li> Perfect tool.  Correct shape for my toes, easily applies force needed for thick toenails, and gathers the clippings quite effectively instead of shooting all over the room.</li>
            <li> Solid, extremely sharp. The curved handle allows for good control and force. The added file is nice. The plastic catcher though I removed as it seems to get in the way of using the edges of the blade for fine cutting but a nice idea.&lt;br /&gt;Made in Japan, good quality.</li>
            <li> These work alright, but I would look elsewhere.  The nail catcher is just a joke!  It barely catches anything! (to fix this I put some tape on the inside of the catcher so they would catch better.)  But with that out of the way, the clippers are not my favorite.  They don&#x27;t cut precise and mash my nails sometimes.  Also for some reason, they make two &amp;#34;clip sounds&amp;#34; which I think is why my nails feel weird after using them. But for the price, I am happy with my purchase. Would I purchase them again? Probably not.</li>
            <li> Good buying experience.  good product.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this a try on different people and varying nail sizes and thickness. I would definitely recommend this as a huge improvement from the drugstore brands. I had been using the Revlon line and the handle was about to break in two from pressing over time, so I sent it back for a replacement under their lifetime guarantee. This Mehaz makes really nice cuts as it has  nice and sharp cutters. The cover seems to catch many clippings which is a nice bonus and the filer on the back is better than the middle rail on other cutters, although you don&#x27;t have a &amp;#34;digging&amp;#34; tool to get the dirt from under the nail.</li>
            <li> This is a great clipper that cuts smoothly through toenails.</li>
            <li> Wow!  This clipper makes my thick toe nail clipping a breeze.  Many thanks</li>
            <li> Excellent construction. Very well made. Used right away and would buy again. Much better than others we&#x27;ve bought before. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me you don&#x27;t want to use those little fingernail clippers at all and prefer toe nail clippers for both your hands and feet. These clippers work great and the plastic catcher will collect all of your nail shrapnel until you&#x27;re ready to dump it out. The little nail file on the back side is handy for smoothing any rough edges but I didn&#x27;t really have that problem since the cuts were pretty clean.</li>
            <li> These are the best toenail clippers I have ever had. They are sharp and easy to use. They are encased in a plastic tube that collects the nail shavings and are strong enough to clip the nail without much fuss at all. I never thought toenail clippers much mattered until I used these. They are simply the best I&#x27;ve ever come across.</li>
            <li> Amazing.. Just buy it.. Not even worth discussing it.</li>
            <li> I bought a smaller one with different brand and it was broken as that&#x27;s not good for toenails (much thicker).  However, this product is much much better - is exactly what you need for toenails as it&#x27;s very shape, strong and durable.  You will love it.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Sturdy construction and super sharp.  So sharp that I kept nicking my skin while clipping my nails.  I don&#x27;t look at it as a bad thing though.  I like products that have unexpected results.  The fact that they&#x27;re sharp means they do the job well - I just needed to get used to them.  Two thumbs up :)</li>
            <li> Made in Japan.  High Quality.</li>
            <li> This product is well made. However the opening is very narrow making it difficult to use on toe nails.  The leverage provided by the large lever is very good and makes using the cutter (on finger nails) very easy.</li>
            <li> This clipper cuts with precision...it feels very machined, and has a very fluid feel. Small profile. I would definitely recommend this clipper!</li>
            <li> I would have gave more stars if it opened wider, it performs great otherwise.</li>
            <li> Works great will cut through my thick toe nails easily with a snappy &amp;#34;Click &amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Too notch quality like I expect from the Mehaz name.</li>
            <li> I originally ordered this clipper because I wanted the nail catcher. I was really irritated of having my nail bits fly all the over place and stepping on them in odd areas when using generic clippers. Unfortunately the nail catcher doesn&#x27;t always work especially when you&#x27;re cutting off small pieces of your nail. This happens because its falling out of the mouth of the clipper not that it&#x27;s completely ineffective. What I didn&#x27;t anticipated though, was how much effective this clipper is compared to cheap generic brands. This clipper is sturdy, heavy, and above all super sharp! They make a noticeable \\&quot;clip\\&quot; sound when you press down and you could be sure that it will snap your nail off in one press. Unlike cheap generics when they aren&#x27;t sharp enough to cut with one press and might even bend your nail. The weight and size of this clipper makes it so much easier to use compared to small generics. The high angle of the press lever also helps a lot, it feels so much easier to clip nails, it&#x27;s hard to explain but once you try it compared to a cheap generic you&#x27;ll understand. I absolutely love this clipper and will never go back to generic clippers. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> These are very sharp and heavy duty clippers. The plastic sleeve has the file patch which I don&#x27;t like at all. They could do away with that and simple sens a file of some sort with the clippers and it would be better than the set up they have now.</li>
            <li> This one of those products that just works! It is easy to use and cut very well.Buy it with confidence.</li>
            <li> Great clippers. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Cuts nail clean with any burr or leftovers.  I mostly use it for nail clipping. I think for clipping tie nails it is best to see a podiatrist.</li>
            <li> Love these.. very sharp, i have to hide them so no one else can walk off with them.</li>
            <li> well built, good leverage, bigger than the cheap drug store models.</li>
            <li> I ordered these clippers for a parent with gross motor skill deficits to use on her fingernails.  They are large enough to be held by someone who has trouble with small objects, and don&#x27;t require too much dexterity to use.  My parent has found these very helpful, changing from her previous plain nail scissors, which are now not usable by her.  I recommend these for clipping nails by someone with gross motor skill challenges.  It does take a few uses to be comfortable with these, but being able to do one more task oneself is a wonderful thing!</li>
            <li> The Mehaz line of clippers is unlike any others that I have used in the past. They are precise, efficient and cut cleanly with little effort. For a minimal increase in price, these clippers are at a professional level.</li>
            <li> Fine clipper per se but unimpressed by feature that is supposed to catch clippings.  Would, however, recommend based on clipping function.</li>
            <li> After trying several brands and having been less than enthused to downright disgusted I gave the Mehaz (made by Kai) a chance. I use Feather, which are made by Kai, double edge razor blades for my daily shave, and love them so I gave their rebranded nail clippers a chance. I am extremely pleased and will add an extra set to keep in my office for emergencies.</li>
            <li> works fairly well. no complaints other than catcher gets in the way a little bit. Works better without it.</li>
            <li> This product was not real.  The top piece of metal had the Mehaz stamp on it, when the rest of it fel apart two weeks later it said made in Japan.  This vendor is not reputable.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this clipper.  It is easy to handle and works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The service was excellent.</li>
            <li> Looks high quality product. Really sharp so be careful. This is the large size one, just to mention, since it&#x27;s not in description and just saying toenail in description make me doubt on the size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I cut thick nails, it will make an extra &#x27;clipping&#x27; sound when I release.  What happens is when I cut thick nails, the clipper upper and lower jaw overlaps each other, and so it make an extra sound when you release it. I usually hear than on cheap nail cutters, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> Very good quality.  I like them even better than some clippers I&#x27;ve had that were made in Solingen Germany. A+</li>
            <li> What can I say - best clipper I ever had - spendy but you get what you pay for - I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> This thing is the bomb.  It is made in Japan and looks it.  The edges of the cutter are very sharp.  You can&lt;br /&gt;hear a click when a nail is cut off.  The steel shape is perfect for nail cutting.  Plus the instrument comes&lt;br /&gt;with a plastic casing that covers the took except for the handle that you push down.  On the underside of&lt;br /&gt;the plastic is a thin strip that grinds sharp edges of recently clipped nails.  If, for some reason, you don&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;like the plastic casing, it just slides off the cutter.  The price is very reasonable for such a remarkably made&lt;br /&gt;instrument.  So go get one ASAP.</li>
            <li> My toenails are tough and this does the job without struggling with it.</li>
            <li> This is like the cadillace of clippers!  Looks very sleek &amp; stylish in a brushed steel finish and it has a lifetime guarantee as well that I wasn&#x27;t even aware of before purchasing.  Would certainly recommend this clipper, really a nice item at a great price!</li>
            <li> My husband uses these nail clippers for his hard to handle toe nails. He likes them very much and says that they are easy to handle. They are big enough and tough enough to do the work that they are required to do. They cut his toe nails evenly and easily. He has had problems in the past so these were a great find for him. His toe nails are somewhat difficult to cut so he has been quite pleased with these.</li>
            <li> This clipper works well just the right size and the blades cut clean. I also have the nail clippers, I find them to be to small go with the toe size instead.</li>
            <li> I dont really like how little nail you can cut off at a time. You definitely have to get used to them. Overally they do what they are supposed to do. I could also do without the nail catcher. It doesnt really serve any purpose.</li>
            <li> Good clippers, and just the right size and opening for tough toenails.</li>
            <li> My toe nails are horrible and this finally did the job.&lt;br /&gt;The clipper is well made and I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works great.  The small generic ones are much harder to operate and when the blades are dull, you have to squeeze hard and sometimes you only bend the nail.  This cuts through easily because it&#x27;s big with a well-designed lever.  Others have noted the cover doesn&#x27;t catch every bit of nail, and that&#x27;s true, but it catches most.  It throws maybe one piece every 1 or 2 times that I use it (like once in 15-20 nails).</li>
            <li> Nice, even clip and sharp blade.  Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> A clipper that is super-sharp and collects the clippings for easy disposal! No more nail ends flying across the room!</li>
            <li> Absolutely incredible.  Well designed, easy to use, doesn&#x27;t leave my fingernails feeling weird, like other cheaper products do.  Well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This cut great, and are just the perfect size I find.</li>
            <li> Great clippers - but they are NOT rustproof (which is one of the main reasons I bought them). I doubt I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from my local Beauty Supply Store.  It is far superior to the Tweezerman barrel spring nippers.  It cuts thick nails like cutting through soft butter, unlike the Tweezerman nippers that can&#x27;t cut through the same nail. It seems solid.</li>
            <li> These are by far the best clippers I&#x27;ve ever used. Clean sharp cuts every time.</li>
            <li> Best nail clipper; extended lever provides added torque for those difficult to cut nails</li>
