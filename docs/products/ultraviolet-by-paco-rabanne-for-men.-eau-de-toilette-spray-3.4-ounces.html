            <li>To me it smells like jellybeans but girls describe it as sexy and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many products through Amazon and have always preferred in which they are sellers, but this time I have my doubts about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>Love it, recommend it</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast, and arrived all in good condition.</li>
            <li>I like this perfume ,but I couldn&#x27;t find at the mall close to my apt ,so amazon helped me to buy a genuine one .Very sweet perfume .</li>
            <li>think I will buy it again right now!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not to strong or over powering.</li>
            <li>Very good everything I expected, , , ,</li>
            <li>This product has been discontinued by the manufacturer for quite some time now, though there appears to be a substantial stock still available from online marketers.</li>
            <li>This cologne is great but has a sensual tinge, so only use it in the evening.     </li>
            <li>is light smell any way ordered</li>
            <li>If you like light and fresh smells, you will love it.</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean scent!</li>
            <li>And strangely it really does attract the attention of the ladies \\&quot;more than you know!!!!!!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It still good but not in the same way it used to be years ago, maybe they changed the formula.</li>
            <li>but they were nice enough to give me full refund not including shipping, thanx</li>
            <li>but this one smells nice and isn&#x27;t too strong (unless you marinate in it, I suppose) and there is quite a decent amount to last quite awhile.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cologne by far.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very responsible, they shipped my order in one day and delivered in two days.</li>
            <li>I ordered two, and I´m very disapponted!....</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really like this scent on my hubby  &amp;#62;-(</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find this in stores very often</li>
            <li>Well, the review is true, these remaining Ultraviolets are not the same as before.  </li>
            <li>I normally get nauseus around fragrances</li>
            <li>This is my favorite perfume for years, I opened the first and note a different fragance, opened the second and the same thing!!...</li>
            <li>I expected more since I&#x27;ve used the same before.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find it on Amazon as it is becoming a little hard to find.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it because it has such a seductive aroma!</li>
            <li>I ordered this via amazon and it arrived the next day (mind you that I live in NYC).</li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Smell didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as product bought from the store</li>

            <li> I compared this product with others that should be equal and I can see that the button to spray is totally different, one is rubber with the name in embossed  while this is a rigid plastic button that makes it difficult to spray.</li>
            <li> Have been buying this for my husband for a few years now.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t bad, but they&#x27;re not what you expect.</li>

            <li> Have been buying this for my husband for a few years now. We both like the scent which lasts all day. It&#x27;s not to strong or over powering. Has a great smell that I like a lot.</li>
            <li> RECOMENDADO 1000% SALUDOS</li>
            <li> Summer scent.  Sporty and hardcore violet/lavender</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great. I&#x27;ve been complimented by both genders on how great it smells.</li>
            <li> This one goes under the radar. However it does get the ladies attention. To me it smells like jellybeans but girls describe it as sexy and masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck,&lt;br /&gt;Matthew</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend after he ran out of his previous bottle.  I normally get nauseus around fragrances but this one smells nice and isn&#x27;t too strong (unless you marinate in it, I suppose) and there is quite a decent amount to last quite awhile.</li>
            <li> They screwed me, even now the pic it has, I ordered the dark btl as it was showing it&#x27;s regular smell bit stronger n this see through btl is light smell any way ordered twice thought I would get dark blue btl but they kept sendin this but they were nice enough to give me full refund not including shipping, thanx</li>
            <li> This perfume smells so good. Although it is not so popular, I would recommend you try it. I love it. If you like light and fresh smells, you will love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product i highly recommend very good.i loved it. What we wanted. Very good everything I expected, , , ,</li>
            <li> This is a very good smell perfume, soft and sweet, to me this is the best fragrance of this brand. Shipping was very fast, and arrived all in good condition.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD, SERVICE EXCELENT</li>
            <li> Great price and product.</li>
            <li> All i can tell you is that this cologne is different, no amount of explanation can describe the smell. You just have to find out for yourself. But i can tell you one thing \\&quot;its unique\\&quot; and you will definitely be separated from the pack. And strangely it really does attract the attention of the ladies \\&quot;more than you know!!!!!!\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Un perfume serio para ocasiones formales, sumamente rico, a mi parecer un perfume tipo maderado. Excelente para cualquier tipo de regalos para un padre de familia, a mi me gusta mucho pero estoy seguro que a otros contemporaneos mios (21 años) no les agraderia por su seriedad.</li>
            <li> I compared this product with others that should be equal and I can see that the button to spray is totally different, one is rubber with the name in embossed  while this is a rigid plastic button that makes it difficult to spray. Assessing another aspect, the smell does not last as long as it does the other with which I made the comparison and have a difference in the aroma. I have purchased many products through Amazon and have always preferred in which they are sellers, but this time I have my doubts about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my brother - he loved it!!!!! Good pick! Go for it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my top favorite colognes! I would highly recommend it because it has such a seductive aroma!</li>
            <li> excellent fragrance of this perfume, no doubt buy</li>
            <li> Smell didn&#x27;t seem to last as long as product bought from the store</li>
            <li> Shipped on time, very happy with it</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the item. It was perfect for my husband&#x27;s birthday as he&#x27;s been looking fot it and he loved it. Thanks.</li>
            <li> great product , is so cool . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this order. Amazon was very responsible, they shipped my order in one day and delivered in two days. 100 % satisfaction</li>
            <li> is a product of very good quality, brand and price. I recommend it to all people who are in search of something. Besides, it is very nice, I loved it.</li>
            <li> Have been my perfume for 5 years and a lot of compliments while wearing it. I was glad to find it on Amazon as it is becoming a little hard to find.</li>
            <li> I got hundred of compliments. This is my favorite cologne by far.</li>
            <li> excelente producto....!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this in stores very often but it&#x27;s been my son&#x27;s favorite for years!  He was happy to get it for Christmas!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve come across and I always get compliments on it. Its long lasting also.</li>
            <li> I ordered two, and I´m very disapponted!....This is my favorite perfume for years, I opened the first and note a different fragance, opened the second and the same thing!!...now, I have two perfumes and I wont use them!!</li>
            <li> I expected more since I&#x27;ve used the same before. The knob to push was not in the same quality of the last one I got. And the smell of the last one is not equal as well. It still good but not in the same way it used to be years ago, maybe they changed the formula.</li>
            <li> Love it, recommend it</li>
            <li> I used &amp;#34;Ultraviolet&amp;#34; for years.  The &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; bottles don&#x27;t smell the same.  I read a review stating this, but bought three bottles anyway.  Well, the review is true, these remaining Ultraviolets are not the same as before.  They aren&#x27;t bad, but they&#x27;re not what you expect.</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean scent!</li>
    </ol>
