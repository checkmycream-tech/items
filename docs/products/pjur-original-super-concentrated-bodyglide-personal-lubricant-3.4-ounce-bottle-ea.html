I used a glob about the width of a pea on myself and it lasted far longer than i did. Even after a brief shower i could still feel a slickness on the goods. It even has a slight conditioning effect  I am a little bummed out that this cannot be used on silicon toys but it is what it is.

The bottle ends up looking like a bottle of body spray.</li>
            <li> Very smooth for use as a light body massage oil.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried various products and this is no. 1!</li>
