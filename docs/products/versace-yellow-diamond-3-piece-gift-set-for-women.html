            <li>Arrived on time and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like overly woody fragrances, but this has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>nice perfum.</li>
            <li>Smell really nice.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and really loved this price compared to in store pricing.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if AMAZON.com would have mentioned this.</li>
            <li>I love Versace&#x27;s BRIGHT CRYSTAL even more.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and fresh, perfect for summer nights out!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect gift for their loved ones.</li>
            <li>This may be my most favorite fragrance to date!  </li>
            <li>Came in box, nicely packed , quick shipping, great quality :)</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize that I smelled so aggressively, but fortunately it was in a good way.</li>
            <li>A nice refreshing scent that stays with her all day.  </li>
            <li>This is such a great value, I saw this in the discount store for twice the price and it also happens to smell great</li>
            <li>And the best part is is that it&#x27;s strong (you really don&#x27;t need more than one spray) and lasts a lot longer than most perfumes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It so many compliments at work and social settings on how wonderful I smell</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this perfume I didn&#x27;t want to run out of it.</li>

            <li>I love the smell</li>
            <li>I love to wear it, but I don&#x27;t want to leave it on others after a handshake or a hug.</li>
            <li>As a fan of florals, I find this fragrance appealing.  </li>
            <li>She is in love with it.</li>

            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>My husband bought this for me for Christmas from Amazon because I love it.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite perfume</li>
            <li>She loves it and has gotten so many compliments.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, its one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>i have all of the Versace Crystal perfume, and they&#x27;re all excellent, especially this one.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this fragrance for women.  </li>
            <li>Many compliments and fragrance stays on all day.</li>
            <li>The fragrance does not stay for more than 2 hours..</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li>I bought this at an upscale department store for soo much more.</li>
            <li>Many give me migraines.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, but could not afford to buy it in a department store.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so in love with the scent</li>
            <li>I love this perfume, and my husband does too.</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance very unique</li>
            <li>Very nice, unusual scent.</li>
            <li>but this has a nice, clean, youthful scent to it.</li>
            <li>So excited!  </li>
            <li>If you like a strong, but satisfying smell this is it.</li>
            <li>I suggest that you all pay very close attention to make sure that the product you&#x27;re trying to buy has ALL good reviews before you spend your money.</li>
            <li>I guess the reason this one was so cheap is because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s authentic.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy :)</li>
            <li>It is refreshing and light.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased that this is the original scent from Versace.  </li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend it  and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this fragrance so much because it is not over-powering but it leaves an impression wherever I go.  </li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful scent, truly for all ages.  </li>
            <li>Love the bottle but the scent is a bit too sweet for me.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel sexy and pretty!</li>
            <li>My favorite perfume next to Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and lemony and somewhat floral.  </li>
            <li>I love this fresh, floral, feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li>Very nice scent that my daughter and I will share as it is a big bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great scent, is never overwhelming and it wears nicely.  </li>
            <li>Buying it through amazon allowed me to get the perfume I love for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I love the scent from my first bottle that I brought, not through amazon.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s unique and I get tons of compliments</li>
            <li>I purchased it here sold and delivered by Amazon and have no complains, it is the original product.  </li>
            <li>WASNT THE ORIGINAL</li>
            <li>It came is a bottle with a pretty jeweled shaped top.</li>
            <li>This is a great perfume, and I honestly believe that everyone would like the way it smells.. or at least not find it offensive.</li>
            <li>Just right!  </li>
            <li>Fellas, your significant other will be happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing, received my first sample straight from Versace when the product was launched.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re debating whether to buy the Versace Bright Crystal or the Versace Diamone, Yellow.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li>Prepare yourself for greatness, and purchase this classy dame for your own pleasure.</li>
            <li>It is fresh, light and airy, just the way I like perfumes.</li>
            <li>Not any type of baby powder, old lady scent, but a nice fruity citrus scent that aims to please.  </li>
            <li>Strong at first but lasts through the day</li>
            <li>Easily one of my new favorites, smell is not overpowering and very sweet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li>pay more and get with normal scent</li>
            <li>I love this Spray and arrived very fast and reasonably priced</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li>Wonderful, long lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m willing to overlook that though!</li>
            <li>the scent sticks all day.. fresh and crisp!</li>
            <li>So fresh perfume and</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite perfume I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fresh perfume.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s spring-like, flowery, but also fresh.</li>
            <li>However, this purchase was worth the wait.</li>
            <li>SHE REALIZE RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>Light, sexy scent but lasted for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It was a little &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; (for lack of a better term ) the one time I wore it so, I will have to try it again to give it better assessment.</li>
            <li>I wore it to work my first night having it and got compliments right away.</li>
            <li>smells amazing the fragrance stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Some people have said that it dissipates quickly, mine lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li>Which is a bummer because the smell is very much a grown  woman smell.</li>
            <li>I do agree that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, but my husband, who like many hubby&#x27;s, is very picky about my perfume, love it!  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t last more than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this perfume from versace when it first came out.  </li>
            <li>Love it better than Gucci Guilty or Jimmy Choo which seem to be the ones compared to it the most.</li>
            <li>I was scared reading some of the reviews, but this item arrived on time and is exactly what&#x27;s carried in name brand department stores and is a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li>Its classy and light for any season of the year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my favorite overall.  </li>
            <li>but one thing is for sure, I will not purchase Versace in the future for this reason.</li>
            <li>Light, pretty, feminine and soft are some of the words that come to mind.  </li>
            <li>This is not the same as purchased from a reputable store.</li>
            <li>YOUR MONEY IS FAR AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL BOTTLE MY WIFE</li>
            <li>Looks nice of my vanity with my other perfumes.</li>
            <li>Most perfumes are far too musky and mature for my taste</li>
            <li>I went on a cruise and got versace samples and yellow diamond was my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>Very fresh, but very light and not very long lasting .</li>
            <li>I first spray it, YELLOW DIAMOND has a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li>:) The scent stays with you a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased this product in retail stores in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li>This is strong enough for others to notice but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>certainly you will like it.</li>
            <li>I would certainly be buying this product again before Christmas.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the fragrance, but found it had to be re-applied several times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Does not have the &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; of my usual - Bvlgari Jade or Rose Essentiale.</li>
            <li>The scent lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to fragrance.</li>
            <li>This spray was twice as much</li>
            <li>It was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;She loves it so much, she wears it whenever she goes</li>
            <li>The Versace smells much nicer.</li>
            <li>THis is the real deal</li>
            <li>Love this scent and pink crystal as well.</li>
            <li>was reasonable</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, considering a bottle this size is twice as much in the department store.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>It was very diluted .</li>
            <li>My favorite fragrance overall so far</li>
            <li>This is my new Fav!</li>
            <li>I was able to get this through Amazon for less than I paid for 1.5oz at the department store.  </li>
            <li>I wear a decent amount almost every day and have had it for over a year.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten alot of compliments and I would definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for you guys ðŸ˜Š .</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It came packaged just as it is in any high end department store.  </li>
            <li>For this low price, I was skeptical but was extremely impressed with how fast it came and that it was the EXACT bottle, packaging and quality of the Yellow Diamond</li>
            <li>normally don&#x27;t write a review unless I&#x27;m dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>smells classy/elegant and fun at the same time</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not last for long, I bought one in the freeshop and was much better.</li>
            <li>I wish I had paid better attention to the reviews before I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li>I normally order almost everything from amazon</li>
            <li>so I believe that Versace line must not last long or its targeted for consumers to go through the bottle quicker for more sales.</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence over whether to order this package that contains the lotion I say &amp;#34;DO IT!&amp;#34;  This lotion is worth spending extra.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing and not too heavy</li>
            <li>The Diamond, Yellow wins every time.</li>
            <li>Also, I looked at the merchandise closely and it was not in brand new condition.</li>
            <li>I spent the extra to get the 3.0 ounces and the lotion and am so pleased I did.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>I had Bright Crystal a few years ago, but my personal opinion is its for the younger girls.  </li>
            <li>Huge cap is a waste.</li>
            <li>This is great for coming cold weather.</li>
            <li>Smells mature without being musky.</li>
            <li>I ordered this perfume on a Tuesday afternoon and got it early Friday afternoon.</li>
            <li>really like the YELLOW DIAMOND fragrance, but</li>
            <li>I can say the same thing for Yellow Diamond, no matter how much I spray, it will dissipate within 30 min unless my sense of smell is paralyzed.</li>
            <li>My advice to you if you never had the pleasure of smelling this scent then go to a major department store and use the tester perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually strong enough to use alone, for the days you might be in a small office and don&#x27;t want to be over powering.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t long so much, but enough hours.</li>
            <li>The scent from the bottle I purchased on Amazon is so much weaker and doesn&#x27;t last for long.  </li>
            <li>I wear this daily because I&#x27;ve had complete strangers politely compliment the fragrance and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>I was a little nervous it&#x27;d be open or something would be wrong with it, but thank G-d, it came in great condition</li>

            <li> Arrived on time and smells amazing.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like overly woody fragrances, but this has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> nice perfum.</li>
            <li> Smell really nice.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and really loved this price compared to in store pricing.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if AMAZON.com would have mentioned this.</li>
            <li> I love Versace&#x27;s BRIGHT CRYSTAL even more.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and fresh, perfect for summer nights out!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect gift for their loved ones.</li>
            <li> This may be my most favorite fragrance to date!  </li>
            <li> Came in box, nicely packed , quick shipping, great quality :)</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize that I smelled so aggressively, but fortunately it was in a good way.</li>
            <li> A nice refreshing scent that stays with her all day.  </li>
            <li> This is such a great value, I saw this in the discount store for twice the price and it also happens to smell great</li>
            <li> And the best part is is that it&#x27;s strong (you really don&#x27;t need more than one spray) and lasts a lot longer than most perfumes I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It so many compliments at work and social settings on how wonderful I smell</li>

            <li> I love the smell</li>

            <li> and I love it</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me for Christmas from Amazon because I love it.  </li>

            <li> I love, love, love this fragrance for women.  </li>
            <li> Many compliments and fragrance stays on all day.</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not stay for more than 2 hours..</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance</li>
            <li> I bought this at an upscale department store for soo much more.</li>
            <li> Many give me migraines.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but could not afford to buy it in a department store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so in love with the scent</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and my husband does too.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance very unique</li>
            <li> Very nice, unusual scent.</li>
            <li> but this has a nice, clean, youthful scent to it.</li>
            <li> So excited!  </li>
            <li> If you like a strong, but satisfying smell this is it.</li>
            <li> I suggest that you all pay very close attention to make sure that the product you&#x27;re trying to buy has ALL good reviews before you spend your money.</li>
            <li> I guess the reason this one was so cheap is because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s authentic.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> It is refreshing and light.</li>
            <li> I was so pleased that this is the original scent from Versace.  </li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend it  and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this fragrance so much because it is not over-powering but it leaves an impression wherever I go.  </li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful scent, truly for all ages.  </li>
            <li> Love the bottle but the scent is a bit too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel sexy and pretty!</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume next to Bright Crystal.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and lemony and somewhat floral.  </li>
            <li> I love this fresh, floral, feminine fragrance.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent that my daughter and I will share as it is a big bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great scent, is never overwhelming and it wears nicely.  </li>
            <li> Buying it through amazon allowed me to get the perfume I love for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I love the scent from my first bottle that I brought, not through amazon.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s unique and I get tons of compliments</li>
            <li> I purchased it here sold and delivered by Amazon and have no complains, it is the original product.  </li>
            <li> WASNT THE ORIGINAL</li>
            <li> It came is a bottle with a pretty jeweled shaped top.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume, and I honestly believe that everyone would like the way it smells.. or at least not find it offensive.</li>
            <li> Just right!  </li>
            <li> Fellas, your significant other will be happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, received my first sample straight from Versace when the product was launched.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re debating whether to buy the Versace Bright Crystal or the Versace Diamone, Yellow.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much.</li>
            <li> Prepare yourself for greatness, and purchase this classy dame for your own pleasure.</li>
            <li> It is fresh, light and airy, just the way I like perfumes.</li>
            <li> Not any type of baby powder, old lady scent, but a nice fruity citrus scent that aims to please.  </li>
            <li> Strong at first but lasts through the day</li>
            <li> Easily one of my new favorites, smell is not overpowering and very sweet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so fresh and clean smelling.</li>
            <li> pay more and get with normal scent</li>
            <li> I love this Spray and arrived very fast and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and easy.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, long lasting fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to overlook that though!</li>
            <li> the scent sticks all day.. fresh and crisp!</li>
            <li> So fresh perfume and</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite perfume I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fresh perfume.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s spring-like, flowery, but also fresh.</li>
            <li> However, this purchase was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> SHE REALIZE RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> Light, sexy scent but lasted for a long time.  </li>
            <li> It was a little &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; (for lack of a better term ) the one time I wore it so, I will have to try it again to give it better assessment.</li>
            <li> I wore it to work my first night having it and got compliments right away.</li>
            <li> smells amazing the fragrance stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Some people have said that it dissipates quickly, mine lasts pretty much all day.</li>
            <li> Which is a bummer because the smell is very much a grown  woman smell.</li>
            <li> I do agree that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, but my husband, who like many hubby&#x27;s, is very picky about my perfume, love it!  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t last more than 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this perfume from versace when it first came out.  </li>
            <li> Love it better than Gucci Guilty or Jimmy Choo which seem to be the ones compared to it the most.</li>
            <li> I was scared reading some of the reviews, but this item arrived on time and is exactly what&#x27;s carried in name brand department stores and is a fraction of the cost.</li>
            <li> Its classy and light for any season of the year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite overall.  </li>
            <li> but one thing is for sure, I will not purchase Versace in the future for this reason.</li>
            <li> Light, pretty, feminine and soft are some of the words that come to mind.  </li>
            <li> This is not the same as purchased from a reputable store.</li>
            <li> YOUR MONEY IS FAR AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL BOTTLE MY WIFE</li>
            <li> Looks nice of my vanity with my other perfumes.</li>
            <li> Most perfumes are far too musky and mature for my taste</li>
            <li> I went on a cruise and got versace samples and yellow diamond was my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> Very fresh, but very light and not very long lasting .</li>
            <li> I first spray it, YELLOW DIAMOND has a strong fragrance.  </li>
            <li> :) The scent stays with you a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in retail stores in the past and loved it.</li>
            <li> This is strong enough for others to notice but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> certainly you will like it.</li>
            <li> I would certainly be buying this product again before Christmas.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the fragrance, but found it had to be re-applied several times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Does not have the &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; of my usual - Bvlgari Jade or Rose Essentiale.</li>
            <li> The scent lasted the whole day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to fragrance.</li>
            <li> This spray was twice as much</li>
            <li> It was a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;She loves it so much, she wears it whenever she goes</li>
            <li> The Versace smells much nicer.</li>
            <li> THis is the real deal</li>
            <li> Love this scent and pink crystal as well.</li>
            <li> was reasonable</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, considering a bottle this size is twice as much in the department store.</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> It was very diluted .</li>
            <li> My favorite fragrance overall so far</li>
            <li> This is my new Fav!</li>
            <li> I was able to get this through Amazon for less than I paid for 1.5oz at the department store.  </li>
            <li> I wear a decent amount almost every day and have had it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten alot of compliments and I would definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for you guys ðŸ˜Š .</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It came packaged just as it is in any high end department store.  </li>
            <li> For this low price, I was skeptical but was extremely impressed with how fast it came and that it was the EXACT bottle, packaging and quality of the Yellow Diamond</li>
            <li> normally don&#x27;t write a review unless I&#x27;m dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> smells classy/elegant and fun at the same time</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does not last for long, I bought one in the freeshop and was much better.</li>
            <li> I wish I had paid better attention to the reviews before I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I normally order almost everything from amazon</li>
            <li> so I believe that Versace line must not last long or its targeted for consumers to go through the bottle quicker for more sales.</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence over whether to order this package that contains the lotion I say &amp;#34;DO IT!&amp;#34;  This lotion is worth spending extra.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing and not too heavy</li>
            <li> The Diamond, Yellow wins every time.</li>
            <li> Also, I looked at the merchandise closely and it was not in brand new condition.</li>
            <li> I spent the extra to get the 3.0 ounces and the lotion and am so pleased I did.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> I had Bright Crystal a few years ago, but my personal opinion is its for the younger girls.  </li>
            <li> Huge cap is a waste.</li>
            <li> This is great for coming cold weather.</li>
            <li> Smells mature without being musky.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume on a Tuesday afternoon and got it early Friday afternoon.</li>
            <li> really like the YELLOW DIAMOND fragrance, but</li>
            <li> I can say the same thing for Yellow Diamond, no matter how much I spray, it will dissipate within 30 min unless my sense of smell is paralyzed.</li>
            <li> My advice to you if you never had the pleasure of smelling this scent then go to a major department store and use the tester perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually strong enough to use alone, for the days you might be in a small office and don&#x27;t want to be over powering.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t long so much, but enough hours.</li>
            <li> The scent from the bottle I purchased on Amazon is so much weaker and doesn&#x27;t last for long.  </li>
            <li> I wear this daily because I&#x27;ve had complete strangers politely compliment the fragrance and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous it&#x27;d be open or something would be wrong with it, but thank G-d, it came in great condition</li>
            <li> because different scent, but scent long time retain</li>
            <li> this perfume seems to be original,with long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> The scent will last all day long.</li>
            <li> how long it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasts long.</li>
            <li> The shipping arrived in the time range that was stated, which in my opinion was not fast enough.</li>
            <li> I previously  purchased this item 3 months ago from a major department store.</li>
            <li> BUT RECENTLY I DECIDED TO TAKE A LOOK ONLINE AND FOUND THE SAME PERFUME FOR $40 LESS</li>
            <li> One thing that I did notice about the other reviewers mentioning of some Versace perfumes the scent did not last long.</li>
            <li> Dry out is amberwood, palo santo, and</li>
            <li> SO DONT BUY THIS BECAUSE YOU WILL LOOSE</li>
            <li> I wear a few different ones</li>
            <li> Not sure why it has to be so big.</li>
            <li> I received endless comments regarding what was I \\&quot;wearing.\\</li>
            <li> Not a single complaint from me.</li>
            <li> The only thing wrong with it is that it does not last that long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Price was reasonable and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Versace</li>
            <li> It smelled almost watered down.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS WATER DOWN</li>
            <li> Also, buying through Amazon Prime was much less than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I literally get a compliment everyday about my perfume.</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves it she wears it everyday</li>
            <li> This is my everyday scent and have been wearing it for  years.</li>
            <li> I paid half of what I would have in the mall!</li>
            <li> I usually buy at Nordstrom.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the deal is</li>
            <li> My husband, who doesn&#x27;t usually notice what perfume I&#x27;m wearing, asks me each time what the name of this perfume is.  </li>
            <li> Smell is too strong, and the worst is you cannot return this product.</li>
            <li> , negative five stars for the fact</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this, not only because it retails for $90 but also because there were a few reviews about it being fake.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy, or thin, or too thick.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous thinking that it was going to be fake because I was too lazy to go to the mall.</li>
            <li> Waste of money!!!</li>
            <li> I do tend to like the fruitier perfumes (self-proclaimed Victoria&#x27;s Secret body spray addict...)</li>
            <li> After a magazine sniff, I got a full-size, not a great idea.</li>
            <li> I just smell the freesia and then on me it dries out to a very subtle woody fragrance.  </li>
            <li> So that&#x27;s 46 dollars down the drain :(  </li>
            <li> Unable to return it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with either.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Versace is one of those fragrences that you cannot go wrong with.  </li>
            <li> Buy the perfumes specifically sold by Amazon and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Cannot go wrong with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> So there goes my money. :(</li>
            <li> Give it a try, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> SO THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SELLING FAKE STUFF!!</li>
            <li> Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I could ever get sick of it!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I previously  purchased this item 3 months ago from a major department store. I had smelled the scent on a stranger on the bus and ask her for the name. I love the scent from my first bottle that I brought, not through amazon. The scent lasted the whole day.I was so pleased with this perfume I didn&#x27;t want to run out of it. So I ordered this one through Amazon because of the price, way cheaper than department stores. The scent is not at all the same and it didn&#x27;t last more than 20 minutes. I logged in to return it but it states that flammable liquids cant be returned.So there goes my money. :( My advice to you if you never had the pleasure of smelling this scent then go to a major department store and use the tester perfume. so you can have an idea of the scent and how long it last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S&lt;br /&gt;I normally don&#x27;t write a review unless I&#x27;m dissatisfied.</li>
            <li> Smells mature without being musky. I love that. I do tend to like the fruitier perfumes (self-proclaimed Victoria&#x27;s Secret body spray addict...) but I do love this one. Most perfumes are far too musky and mature for my taste but this has a nice, clean, youthful scent to it. And the best part is is that it&#x27;s strong (you really don&#x27;t need more than one spray) and lasts a lot longer than most perfumes I&#x27;ve tried. Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My wife loved this cologne and I think it smells great on her.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great Product! Totally satisfied</li>
            <li> I like this one, I just don&#x27;t love it yet.  It was a little &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; (for lack of a better term ) the one time I wore it so, I will have to try it again to give it better assessment.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells wonderful on a friend of mine. My husband purchased it for my birthday and I can&#x27;t stand the smell of myself when it&#x27;s on me. I smell like an elderly lady who bathed in it, even with one spray.  Unable to return it. Save yourself the money.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!!!!</li>
            <li> wife loves it. I dont mind it either. smells classy/elegant and fun at the same time</li>
            <li> Dont  smell at all. I even sprayed 100 times  and  the smell was  like  an alchohol .</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume on a Tuesday afternoon and got it early Friday afternoon. Shipping was fast and easy. I love the smell of this Versace perfume. I wore it to work my first night having it and got compliments right away. Definetly going to be getting Versace&#x27;s Crystal Noir and Bright Crystal perfumes as well!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this perfume from versace when it first came out.  I love the smell but it was a bit pricey for me.  Buying it through amazon allowed me to get the perfume I love for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with the fragrance, but found it had to be re-applied several times during the day.&lt;br /&gt;Does not have the &amp;#34;staying power&amp;#34; of my usual - Bvlgari Jade or Rose Essentiale. I am going back to Bvlgari.</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume, and I honestly believe that everyone would like the way it smells.. or at least not find it offensive. I&#x27;ve been asked twice by strangers what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. I didn&#x27;t realize that I smelled so aggressively, but fortunately it was in a good way. Plus it was a great price.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume next to Bright Crystal. Love it better than Gucci Guilty or Jimmy Choo which seem to be the ones compared to it the most.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this fragrance so much because it is not over-powering but it leaves an impression wherever I go.  If you love to smell good with a wonderful fragrance this perfume is for you.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance very unique</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky when it comes to fragrance. I love to wear it, but I don&#x27;t want to leave it on others after a handshake or a hug. My fragrance needs to be subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now I&#x27;m using YELLOW DIAMOND by Versace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YELLOW DIAMOND is described as having head notes of citron from diamante, pear sorbet, neroli, and bergamot.  Heart notes are nymphea, freesia, orange blossom, and mimosa.  Dry out is amberwood, palo santo, and musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first spray it, YELLOW DIAMOND has a strong fragrance.  I don&#x27;t get any of the head notes...I just smell the freesia and then on me it dries out to a very subtle woody fragrance.  As a fan of florals, I find this fragrance appealing.  I don&#x27;t like overly woody fragrances, but this has a nice scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the YELLOW DIAMOND fragrance, but I love Versace&#x27;s BRIGHT CRYSTAL even more.  I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with either.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my wife. She is in love with it. The bottle came with time to spare and in great condition. Not a single complaint from me.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for you guys ðŸ˜Š . So fresh perfume and certainly you will like it. The size is awesome ðŸ™† and good to go.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume so much. It&#x27;s so fresh and clean smelling. I literally get a compliment everyday about my perfume.</li>
            <li> the perfume smells delicious, what buy many times, in addition to the excellent price and quality of the brand, recommend it 100%</li>
            <li> nice perfum. Smell really nice. It was a gift for my mom and she love it</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom, very happy at first, but nobody notice she was using perfume she started to worry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not last for long, I bought one in the freeshop and was much better.</li>
            <li> Great smelling!  This spray was twice as much everywhere else I checked.  Get your best deals always on Amazon!</li>
            <li> After a magazine sniff, I got a full-size, not a great idea. Trial vials are best to be sure you like, It&#x27;s a nice scent, but wasn&#x27;t as yummy as the sniff-page in Style smelled.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smells great!</li>
            <li> I was scared reading some of the reviews, but this item arrived on time and is exactly what&#x27;s carried in name brand department stores and is a fraction of the cost. I am very HAPPY!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this fragrance for the first time and it is exquisite. It doesn&#x27;t long so much, but enough hours.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent! Strong at first but lasts through the day and I receive many compliments. This is my new Fav!</li>
            <li> Great price and smells great.</li>
            <li> So excited!  I paid half of what I would have in the mall!</li>
            <li> i have this and the bright crystal and they are both wonderful. the scent sticks all day.. fresh and crisp!</li>
            <li> love the fragrance, get alot of compliments!</li>
            <li> l love this fragrance.  Its classy and light for any season of the year.&lt;br /&gt;I also bought my sister on and she loves it.  Sure to catch the attention of the passers-by.</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this, women stop me and ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  It&#x27;s a great scent, is never overwhelming and it wears nicely.  I need to stop telling people what it is!</li>
            <li> This is the best scent and longest lasting I have found.  It has hints of vanilla, musk, flowers and it stays on forever it&#x27;s unique and I get tons of compliments</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, and it smells amazing! It was a reasonable price. I will recommend ordering to my friends. I will order again.</li>
            <li> wife loves it; smells wonderful. Fellas, your significant other will be happy with this purchase. i actually bought an additional bottle.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume and body lotion. I highly recommend this.Give it a try, you wont be disappointed. :) The scent stays with you a long time.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Lasts long. I get many compliments. If you like a strong, but satisfying smell this is it. My favorite fragrance overall so far and I&#x27;ve been wearing perfume for about 7yrs.</li>
            <li> I went on a cruise and got versace samples and yellow diamond was my absolute favorite. But when I got if off of amazon it didn&#x27;t smell remotely similar. It smelled almost watered down. Also, I looked at the merchandise closely and it was not in brand new condition. It looked like it had been used already. So that&#x27;s 46 dollars down the drain :(  I suggest that you all pay very close attention to make sure that the product you&#x27;re trying to buy has ALL good reviews before you spend your money.</li>
            <li> Great product works very well as advertised.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing, received my first sample straight from Versace when the product was launched.  Light, sexy scent but lasted for a long time.  I guess the reason this one was so cheap is because I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s authentic.  The scent from the bottle I purchased on Amazon is so much weaker and doesn&#x27;t last for long.  I wish I had paid better attention to the reviews before I wasted my money.  Will only purchase from Sephora from now on.  5 stars for the scent, negative five stars for the fact it doesn&#x27;t stay or seem like the authentic product.</li>
            <li> This perfume smell very good. However, just like some people you may have an allergy. Well this one did just that, I broke out with hive when I wear. Which is a bummer because the smell is very much a grown  woman smell.</li>
            <li> Love it n will order again</li>
            <li> I love this scent and really loved this price compared to in store pricing. Huge cap is a waste. Not sure why it has to be so big.</li>
            <li> smells amazing the fragrance stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Versace is one of those fragrences that you cannot go wrong with.  This smells so good and I love it and Versace bright crysal is also another one I would recommend</li>
            <li> different scent&lt;br /&gt;positive because different scent, but scent long time retain&lt;br /&gt;nobody because is different scent. pay more and get with normal scent</li>
            <li> Bought this for the holidays for my Wife and she loves it!&lt;br /&gt;She loves it so much, she wears it whenever she goes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price was reasonable and you can&#x27;t go wrong with Versace</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my favorite overall.  I wear a few different ones but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> This is a great perfume, light, feminine, just delicious!  I receive compliments every time I wear it.  I purchased it here sold and delivered by Amazon and have no complains, it is the original product.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells great. I always get compliments when I wear this. I wear a decent amount almost every day and have had it for over a year.</li>
            <li> Very fresh, but very light and not very long lasting .</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s so light and fresh, perfect for summer nights out!</li>
            <li> The Versace smells much nicer. I have them both. This one reminds me the smell of a powder scented baby wipe.</li>
            <li> this perfume seems to be original,with long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me for Christmas from Amazon because I love it.  Yellow Diamond is the most perfect fragrance when you want to feel feminine and sexy.  It&#x27;s light and lemony and somewhat floral.  Just the perfect blend!  I always receive so many compliments from men and women when I wear it and the bonus of course is my husband loves it on me.  I was so pleased that this is the original scent from Versace.  It came packaged just as it is in any high end department store.  Buy the perfumes specifically sold by Amazon and you can&#x27;t go wrong.  Love It!</li>
            <li> Loooooooove it. My ultimate fav perfume.</li>
            <li> I constantly have people asking what I&#x27;m wearing, this perfume gets the people going! Boom.&lt;br /&gt;My co-workers are always coming up to me to snag hugs and sniff my beautiful aroma.&lt;br /&gt;I apply once a day, and the smell lingers, never over-powers. Prepare yourself for greatness, and purchase this classy dame for your own pleasure. Enjoy :)</li>
            <li> my girlfriend loves it she wears it everyday</li>
            <li> Came as promised and on time. Very nice scent that my daughter and I will share as it is a big bottle.</li>
            <li> I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I love it. I would but it again!</li>
            <li> Muito bom o produto..minha esposa gostou ...achou o aroma agrad&amp;aacute;vel...est&amp;aacute; muito satisfeita....ela deseja ganhar outros produtos da versace...ficou muito feliz..</li>
            <li> This is my everyday scent and have been wearing it for  years. I don&#x27;t think I could ever get sick of it! For this low price, I was skeptical but was extremely impressed with how fast it came and that it was the EXACT bottle, packaging and quality of the Yellow Diamond I usually buy at Nordstrom. This is by far my favorite perfume I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> THIS PERFUME IS WATER DOWN SO DONT BUY THIS BECAUSE YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR MONEY IS FAR AWAY FROM THE ORIGINAL BOTTLE MY WIFE ALWAYS HAD THIS PERFUME AND WE ALWAYS USED TO BUY FROM MACYS OR SEFORA BUT RECENTLY I DECIDED TO TAKE A LOOK ONLINE AND FOUND THE SAME PERFUME FOR $40 LESS I WAS LIKE THIS IS A DONE DEAL SO I BOUGHT IT AND WHEN I GAVE IT TO MY WIFE SHE REALIZE RIGHT AWAY IT WASNT THE ORIGINAL THEN SHE ASKED ME WHERE DID I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I HAVE TO GET MY MONEY BACK SO THEN I TOLD HER IT WAS FROM AMAZON AND SHE WAS SO DISSAPOINTED SO THANK YOU AMAZON FOR SELLING FAKE STUFF!!</li>
            <li> I normally order almost everything from amazon but I had a coupon and rewards dollars to Ulta so I purchased the Yellow Diamond. One thing that I did notice about the other reviewers mentioning of some Versace perfumes the scent did not last long. I can say the same thing for Yellow Diamond, no matter how much I spray, it will dissipate within 30 min unless my sense of smell is paralyzed. I trust that Ulta would not sell knock-off perfumes so I believe that Versace line must not last long or its targeted for consumers to go through the bottle quicker for more sales. Not sure what the deal is but one thing is for sure, I will not purchase Versace in the future for this reason. Love the scent though....</li>
            <li> This is a delightful perfume. It came is a bottle with a pretty jeweled shaped top. Looks nice of my vanity with my other perfumes. The fragrance is awesome! It is fresh, light and airy, just the way I like perfumes. I would strongly recommend it  and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> People always asking me what cologne I have on. love this.</li>
            <li> Beautiful!  If you are on the fence over whether to order this package that contains the lotion I say &amp;#34;DO IT!&amp;#34;  This lotion is worth spending extra.  It&#x27;s actually strong enough to use alone, for the days you might be in a small office and don&#x27;t want to be over powering. or of course get your perfume layering in.  It isn&#x27;t greasy, or thin, or too thick.  It&#x27;s the Goldilocks of lotions. Just right!  If you are giving this as a gift please. please buy this one as the box is gorgeous and it&#x27;s well presented.  If it&#x27;s for you, then you deserve to have it all.  I had forgotten I spent the extra to get the 3.0 ounces and the lotion and am so pleased I did. THis is the real deal and it&#x27;s fresh perfume.  I will be buying this again if it isn&#x27;t all sold out.  YES PLEASE!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I missed out on this one!  This is such a beautiful scent, truly for all ages.  I had Bright Crystal a few years ago, but my personal opinion is its for the younger girls.  Light, pretty, feminine and soft are some of the words that come to mind.  I do agree that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long, but my husband, who like many hubby&#x27;s, is very picky about my perfume, love it!  He says h still smells it on me at the end of the day.  Compliments come from men, woman and children!  This may be my most favorite fragrance to date!  And I&#x27;ve owned hundreds!!!!  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> You will love this beautiful scent&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s refreshing and not too heavy</li>
            <li> Very nice, unusual scent. It&#x27;s spring-like, flowery, but also fresh. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume! Came in box, nicely packed , quick shipping, great quality :)</li>
            <li> Love this scent and pink crystal as well.</li>
            <li> Received and love the Fragrance, shipped on a timely manner. Very happy with order will order from Amazon again.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Laurie Martinez</li>
            <li> I price checked several stores and websites prior to purchasing this for my daughter and it was several dollars cheaper.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this through Amazon for less than I paid for 1.5oz at the department store.  This is a great perfume and my wife loves it.  A nice refreshing scent that stays with her all day.  Not any type of baby powder, old lady scent, but a nice fruity citrus scent that aims to please.  Cannot go wrong with this purchase at all.</li>
            <li> Love it! It&#x27;s my favorite perfume and I always get compliments !</li>
            <li> I love this fresh, floral, feminine fragrance. The scent will last all day long. If you&#x27;re debating whether to buy the Versace Bright Crystal or the Versace Diamone, Yellow. The Diamond, Yellow wins every time.</li>
            <li> Easily one of my new favorites, smell is not overpowering and very sweet.  Got a great deal from Amazon! Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about buying this, not only because it retails for $90 but also because there were a few reviews about it being fake. If it is, it smells so good I don&#x27;t even care. Some people have said that it dissipates quickly, mine lasts pretty much all day. Buy it!!!</li>
            <li> Smelled like a million bucks!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. She loves it and has gotten so many compliments. I may have to sneak and give it a try myself.</li>
            <li> Happy with how the product came- I was a little nervous it&#x27;d be open or something would be wrong with it, but thank G-d, it came in great condition and I&#x27;m really happy with it :).</li>
            <li> This is an absolutely great buy and a favorite of both my daughter and myself!</li>
            <li> Great price and I bez smellin good! Lol</li>
            <li> I wear this perfume to work; All my coworkers love this scent on me! I will definitely by more!The price was reasonable</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, its one of my favorites. i have all of the Versace Crystal perfume, and they&#x27;re all excellent, especially this one. Can&#x27;t beat the price, considering a bottle this size is twice as much in the department store. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous thinking that it was going to be fake because I was too lazy to go to the mall. It turns out it was delivered on time as promised and it smells great. I&#x27;ve gotten alot of compliments and I would definitely come back for more.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this fragrance for women.  It so many compliments at work and social settings on how wonderful I smell and I&#x27;m always ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  I would certainly be buying this product again before Christmas.</li>
            <li> Awesome fragrance. Many compliments and fragrance stays on all day. Love it!!! Second bottle.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment.  This is not the same as purchased from a reputable store.</li>
            <li> Smell is too strong, and the worst is you cannot return this product. It would have been nice if AMAZON.com would have mentioned this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume!!  Every time I wear it everyone else seems to love it as well because I always get compliments regarding how I smell so good!</li>
            <li> I love this Spray and arrived very fast and reasonably priced</li>
            <li> The fragrance does not stay for more than 2 hours.. Waste of money!!! Buy something cheaper.</li>
            <li> This is great for coming cold weather. It is great!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I cannot rave enough!  It smells wonderfully. I received endless comments regarding what was I \\&quot;wearing.\\&quot; Comments came from both men and women of various ages and race.</li>
            <li> I wear this daily because I&#x27;ve had complete strangers politely compliment the fragrance and ask what I&#x27;m wearing. Also, buying through Amazon Prime was much less than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> My wife likes it. So thats a plus</li>
            <li> My wife smells so good!!!</li>
            <li> My wife said that is best deal she has ever seen on a perfume purchase this size.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance and I always find it cheaper on Amazon. Will order again!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, long lasting fragrance.  Everywhere I go people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.  It&#x27;s amazing!  My husband, who doesn&#x27;t usually notice what perfume I&#x27;m wearing, asks me each time what the name of this perfume is.  He really likes it. Makes me feel sexy and pretty!</li>
            <li> Really sweet and refreshing smell !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this at an upscale department store for soo much more. But i am inlove with this scent. Everyone walks by and sniffs me asks what it is and sniffs again. The scent lasts all day. I am very sensitive to smells. Many give me migraines. This is strong enough for others to notice but not overpowering. I swear it is a must buy!</li>
            <li> Love the bottle but the scent is a bit too sweet for me.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, but could not afford to buy it in a department store. This is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product in retail stores in the past and loved it. When this productarrived I could tell instantly that it was not the same. It was very diluted . I was si dissapointed.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is 6***********I can go on and on....if you want head turns ..use this piece of fragrance...if have tried Tom Ford Vera wag...chance chanel. Euphoria  and I have settled for Versace diamond for life...nothing in the mkt equals to this perfume nothing matches this  yellow diamond Versace. .it dopest..</li>
            <li> This fragrance is so beautiful! It is refreshing and light. It is perfect for me, since I work in the healthcare field and don&#x27;t want to annoy my patients with a strong odorous perfume. The only thing wrong with it is that it does not last that long. I&#x27;m so in love with the scent I&#x27;m willing to overlook that though!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume, and my husband does too. I am very satisfied with my purchase. The shipping arrived in the time range that was stated, which in my opinion was not fast enough. However, this purchase was worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in time and fully sealed. Great buy for the price. Would buy again. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a perfect gift for their loved ones.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and smells amazing. Great pricing and availability.</li>
            <li> This is such a great value, I saw this in the discount store for twice the price and it also happens to smell great and it is my favorite perfume!</li>
            <li> smells sooooo good and great price!!</li>
