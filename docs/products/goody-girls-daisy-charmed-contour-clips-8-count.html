            <li>How much clearer could the description be.  </li>

            <li>The clips are okay, although I did not realize how small they were.</li>

            <li>Will not let them near my kids.</li>

            <li> They&#x27;re the right size for a small head</li>
            <li> Got for my 15 month old who has pretty thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I was very hesitant about the clips being small and that she might put them in her mouth; however, they stay in snugly</li>
            <li> Some of the clips were missing when I received my order and most of the ones that were there were broken.</li>
            <li> I clearly didn&#x27;t read the details or other reviews of these miniscule clips before purchasing and these are waaaaaaay to small to hold my 2 1/2 year old daughter&#x27;s bangs back.  </li>
            <li> she has short 1 and half inch wisps of hair near the front and back of her hair- regular clips would look odd being put up so close to the front</li>
            <li> They are much much smaller than expected as well.</li>
            <li> Both our children have thin, fine, baby hair, but these were pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> too small to use for a little baby (they might easily swallow) and too small for toddler hair</li>
            <li> are very small about 15mm long and 3-4mm high.</li>
            <li> These clips are too small for my 15 months old hair.  </li>
            <li> but they&#x27;re too small for my 13 month old hair</li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t snap closed.  </li>
            <li> I expected these to be small, but they are really very tiny.</li>
            <li> Unlike other hair accessories, she doesn&#x27;t pull these clips out because she doesn&#x27;t even feel them in her hair.  </li>
            <li> Also I sometimes feel like a klutz trying to manipulate these small clips as compared to the next size up.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not  too big nor too small.</li>
            <li> They stay in place and they are small enough not to hurt their heads.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize they would be small enough for a barbie doll.</li>
            <li> These are very tiny clips and they are hard to find in a lot of stores.</li>
            <li> but these are smaller than paper clips and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> If your child has normal to thick hair DO NOT buy these, but if your child has fine/thin hair that is hard to do, these barretts will do the trick.</li>
            <li> and I can even put her down for a nap without any worry that she will take them out.</li>
            <li> They are, indeed very small, the actual measurement is 2cm.  </li>
            <li> but they hold a bit less hair</li>
            <li> I would say they are no longer than a half inch.</li>
            <li> Bad quality need super clue</li>
            <li> Waste of $</li>
            <li> have wasted money on those clips guarantee to hold.  </li>
            <li> Although they are so small they probably would only lodge in their throat and not really choke them but scary.</li>
            <li> A little small for function.</li>
            <li> Approximately 1/3&amp;#34; long</li>
            <li> I guess they would work well for a baby with very little hair</li>
            <li> Maybe I read the description wrong, but these are so tiny.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t even feel it going on and even if she did, it would be too small for her to find.  </li>
            <li> these are ridiculously small.</li>
            <li> These are quite small.</li>
            <li> These are too small for kids who still put things in their mouth.</li>
            <li> They are so small though, you will lose them all the time.  </li>
            <li> So tiny that they are mostly useless.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the product at all.</li>
            <li> The picture is a little misleading, as the clips are so small that it is difficult to get them to clip in your hair.</li>
            <li> These are very small and can be swallowed, not recommend it ?</li>
            <li> these are very very small</li>
            <li> This are so small they are useless.  </li>
            <li> It just looked awful when all her hair was broken off at one certain spot on her head.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s wrong with people?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to puch close with wiggly tot</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Maybe I read the description wrong, but these are so tiny.  They are for baby fine hair and are less than an inch long.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my toddler who wants nothing to do with barrettes/clips in her hair.  The moment I put anything in her hair she pulls it off immediately...NOT the case with these tiny clips!  Finally something that works!  She doesn&#x27;t even feel it going on and even if she did, it would be too small for her to find.  They are about 1/2&amp;#34; and they stay on!  Perfect for keeping her bangs out of the way.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s wrong with people?  MINI!  These are mini hair clips.  How much clearer could the description be.  My 3 year old has very fine hair and not much of it and these clips hold her hair well.  They couldn&#x27;t be much smaller so if you&#x27;re kiddo has anything but fine hair and a good amount of it, these are not for you.  I am buying the 3 pack because they do sometimes fall out at preschool.  At .31 cents per piece dont expect them to last forever.</li>
            <li> These clips are very small but they work great for my baby with very little hair. The big clips just fall right out</li>
            <li> Very cute. They are extremely tiny, so please pay attention to the size-- if your daughter has more than a few wisps of hair, these won&#x27;t work! But they are perfect for almost-bald babies :)</li>
            <li> Bad quality need super clue</li>
            <li> Will totally fit into a 2 year old&#x27;s nose and not be easily removed.</li>
            <li> Really tiny and cute Barrett&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> These little clips are adorable! They come in lots of colors so you can match any outfit. The reason I gave it 3 stars was because it always seemed to pull out my daughters hair. Other than that I liked them. It just looked awful when all her hair was broken off at one certain spot on her head.</li>
            <li> Cute and stay in very well on my  babies fine silky hair!</li>
            <li> these are ridiculously small. Waste of $</li>
            <li> These hold my daughter&#x27;s baby fine hair great.  She has been wearing them for several months now.  Unlike other hair accessories, she doesn&#x27;t pull these clips out because she doesn&#x27;t even feel them in her hair.  I was very hesitant about the clips being small and that she might put them in her mouth; however, they stay in snugly and I can even put her down for a nap without any worry that she will take them out.</li>

            <li> The clips are okay, although I did not realize how small they were. The picture is a little misleading, as the clips are so small that it is difficult to get them to clip in your hair.</li>
            <li> These clips have nice grips on them to help them stay in. However, they are super small so they don&#x27;t hold much hair. My daughter is 18 months &amp; I can&#x27;t even use them to hold the hair off her face.</li>
            <li> These are very tiny clips and they are hard to find in a lot of stores. They are perfect for my daughters hair she has short 1 and half inch wisps of hair near the front and back of her hair- regular clips would look odd being put up so close to the front so its either these or a headband when hair is pulled back.</li>
            <li> These clips are too small for my 15 months old hair.  They won&#x27;t snap closed.  Will probably just keep them for her dolls in the future.</li>
            <li> These are quite small. I knew that when I got them but they hold a bit less hair then I thought they might (otherwise would have been 5-star). Also I sometimes feel like a klutz trying to manipulate these small clips as compared to the next size up. Yet the 16-count package and good assortment of colors is great -- and the clips do stay put even in fine hair.</li>
            <li> Got for my 15 month old who has pretty thin hair.  They are perfect, but for others might be a little too small.  They are maybe 3/4 inch, but do snap and seem to stay in good.</li>
            <li> Super tiny. They work, for the most part, but they are smaller than small.</li>
            <li> I expected these to be small, but they are really very tiny. Both our children have thin, fine, baby hair, but these were pretty much useless. Can make a cute addition/accessory, but we still needed an actual bigger hair clip to do the holding.</li>
            <li> These are so tiny. They look cute since they are so subtle but they are really teeny tiny.</li>
            <li> Very cute but very small. Only used it for a short while. It&#x27;s a choking hazard now that baby has figured out how to remove clips from her hair.</li>
            <li> The pink is not distinguishable from the red, but everything else is amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my toddler daughter for her bangs.  They are, indeed very small, the actual measurement is 2cm.  They work perfectly when she has very little hair, and it&#x27;s very fine!</li>
            <li> These are teensy, and have barely any strength. My daughter has fine hair and they fell out immediately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agree that they&#x27;d be a choking hazard for younger children.</li>
            <li> These are too small for kids who still put things in their mouth. Although they are so small they probably would only lodge in their throat and not really choke them but scary. Will not let them near my kids. Very pretty and cute, maybe for dolls in a few years! I should have read the reviews but I think I just saw them and bought without checking as they reall all are very small about 15mm long and 3-4mm high.</li>
            <li> These are tiny.  Here&#x27;s a very simple test to know if these are for you -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is your daughter a baldie?  Have you dealt with jokes about whether she&#x27;d ever get hair, and you were just hoping there would be *something* by her first birthday? Is the idea of owning a hairbrush for your daughter laughable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These clips will work for those first wisps.  These are made for those babies who could never wear the baby clips marketed to babies.  These are for baldies.  If you can actually run a hairbrush through your daughter&#x27;s hair, these aren&#x27;t for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wasted money on those clips guarantee to hold.  The tiniest clips at the newborn sections of the baby stores would never stay in my daughter&#x27;s hair.  But these do.  They are so small though, you will lose them all the time.  They are so so tiny.  They have to be if they&#x27;re able to grasp a tiny little wisp of 10 or 20 hairs.</li>
            <li> A little small for function. Better for accessorizing.</li>
            <li> These clips are very tiny</li>
            <li> very very very tiny. too small to use for a little baby (they might easily swallow) and too small for toddler hair</li>
            <li> Love!! These are perfect for my baby&#x27;s hair. They are tiny which is nice. I wish I could find them in different colors.</li>
            <li> This are so small they are useless.  Buy somethings else. Approximately 1/3&amp;#34; long</li>
            <li> Very cute. Purchased for my toddler Grand daughter. Perfect for very fine hair. Fast and easy for wiggly child. Fast shipping. Great price.</li>
            <li> So tiny that they are mostly useless.</li>
            <li> pretty small hair clips.  I wasn&#x27;t able to use them much.</li>
            <li> too tiny! but maybe good for dolls or tiny braids.</li>
            <li> Very tiny about 1.6cm But it&#x27;s perfect for my daughter who has very little hair.she looks cute with it.</li>
            <li> So cute! My 5 month old has tons of hair, and the regular barrettes looked gigantic in her hair. These were just the right size!</li>
            <li> Love the size but having a hard time snapping closed because of own lack of experience I think. I&#x27;m afraid to puch close with wiggly tot</li>
            <li> I clearly didn&#x27;t read the details or other reviews of these miniscule clips before purchasing and these are waaaaaaay to small to hold my 2 1/2 year old daughter&#x27;s bangs back.  I guess they would work well for a baby with very little hair but I would then be concerned about the chocking hazard.  I will be returning them for a better size since I do think Goody makes a decent product.</li>
            <li> I was not pleased with the product at all. Some of the clips were missing when I received my order and most of the ones that were there were broken. The few I could actually use in my daughter&#x27;s hair didn&#x27;t snap close very well and wouldn&#x27;t stay in her hair at all. They are much much smaller than expected as well. I usually have good luck with Goody products, but not this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say Amazon&#x27;s customer service was excellent on refunding my money for this product quickly. Love their customer service.</li>
            <li> These barretts are perfect for my 3 yr old who has hair so fine and thin she sometimes resembles a dandelion as it is going to seed.  Because of this normal barretts fall right out of her hair.  These are tiny (be forewarned) so they stay in her hair perfectly.  If your child has normal to thick hair DO NOT buy these, but if your child has fine/thin hair that is hard to do, these barretts will do the trick.</li>
            <li> need to use 2 clips to keep bangs off forehead. 1 is too small even for my baby girl&#x27;s fine hair.</li>
            <li> I got these for holding up a small section of my bangs on humid days and it does the trick perfectly. They are smaller than any I have ever seen but they work just as well. I would say they are no longer than a half inch.</li>
            <li> These mini hair clips are just what I needed for my daughters hair. They&#x27;re not  too big nor too small. They&#x27;re the right size for a small head</li>
            <li> These clips are very useful for my little Shih Tzu doggies. They stay in place and they are small enough not to hurt their heads.</li>
            <li> These are very small and can be swallowed, not recommend it ? I will not return them but also I am not keeping them.</li>
            <li> I love those barretts because they are small and light enough for my 15m daughter, so she does not feel them and can&#x60;t take them off. They are perfect for her light, gentle hair and they come in nice colors. Very good purchase</li>
            <li> Too little and wouldn&#x27;t stick to my baby&#x27;s very fine locks.  The product came on time and was in good packaging but these are smaller than paper clips and hard to work with.</li>
            <li> these clips work just fine, just keep in mind they are very very small about the size of a thumbtack.the quality is fine and has a nice outer rubber covering but they&#x27;re too small for my 13 month old hair it would be perfect for a newborn</li>
            <li> these are very very small</li>
            <li> good size for baby and weight is good for baby hair</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize they would be small enough for a barbie doll.</li>
