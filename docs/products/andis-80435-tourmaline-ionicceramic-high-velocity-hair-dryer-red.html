    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>After reading the reviews I thought this was the perfect hair dryer</li>
            <li>Hair dryer excellent.  </li>
            <li>Company excellent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
            <li>I loved the power and heat, but it died on me in October!</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>I thought I was getting a great dryer(glad</li>
            <li>It has great power</li>
            <li>that, it&#x27;s a great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this dryer!!</li>
            <li>The three speeds are nice!  </li>
            <li>It feels good to hold.  </li>
            <li>I thought that I had a good hair dryer til I used and Andis 1600 watt at a hotel ...</li>
            <li>I love this blow dryer!</li>
            <li>Lovely hair dryer!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a shame because this dryer is amazing.</li>
            <li>I decided that an 1875 watt high velocity hair dryer would be awesome and it is :-)</li>
            <li>If that were redesigned, it would be a near perfect dryer!</li>
            <li>I researched for the best moderately priced ionic ceramic hair dryer and decided on this Andis 80435.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brand of hairdryer....</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could get it repaired</li>
            <li>I love it if they could fix that flaw</li>
            <li>I guess I can&#x27;t blame my frizzies on a hair dryer -- I will continue to blame genetics instead! :)</li>
            <li>I love the speeds on this, and the heat settings.</li>
            <li>Yes, the velocity is good, and better than most hair dryers, but still not as high as I&#x27;d like.  </li>
            <li>But it was a good price and appears to work well and be of good quality, so overall, I am fine with it.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too easy to inadvertently change them just by holding the handle.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to get such good quality from this dryer.  </li>
            <li>and it dries much more quickly.  </li>
            <li>Nice hair dryer, works well and dries fast.  </li>
            <li>Primary issue is that I would prefer a sliding switch on the handle instead of the raised rocker switches.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very appreciative that Andis replaced the hair dryer for free, but I will need to find another hair dryer that is quieter similar to the Andis Elevate model.</li>
            <li>it is the rocker switches are right where you  hold the dryer, and it is so easy to flip them and change the settings.</li>
            <li>This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly, price was right, and I like the color.  </li>
            <li>I knew I wanted to replace it with the same kind.</li>
            <li>Have owned for several years, Made a good choice,&lt;br /&gt;Works very well.</li>
            <li>Such a shame that the issue with the wires getting frayed cannot be remedied because other than that flaw, it is a very good hair dryer!    </li>
            <li>I went home and looked on Amazon and purchased this dryer right away.</li>
            <li>It is light weight, quiet and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I like this hair dryer very much, but the air velocity is not quite as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used it the hair dryer got so hot</li>
            <li>It drys your hair really fast!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After about 3 months I noticed that the handle became so hot by the switches that I dropped the dryer (on a client).</li>
            <li>It still makes a considerable amount of noise, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like a screaming banshee.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t look so much for wattage but am more interested in airflow, and this baby fits the bill for drying hair quickly as well as other body parts.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After the cord on my first one frayed, I tried three other dryers and this is still my favorite.  </li>
            <li>so I use the dryer to get the straight hair look.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s almost cheaper to just replace the whole thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe my expectations are too high!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also more quiet than her old hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>I read all the reviews for the Andis Tourmaline Ionic/Ceramic High Velocity hair dryer and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>I must have received a dud, because even with the heat setting and fan setting both on &amp;#34;high,&amp;#34; the air coming out of the dryer could only be considered warm -- definitely not hot.  </li>
            <li>It had the same features except it was super noisy loud!    </li>
            <li>I got this because my professional hairdryer is much hotter.  </li>
            <li>The ONLY good thing I can say about it is that I have two small sections of hair that always seem to frizz no matter what I do, and they didn&#x27;t seem to frizz after using this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And because I need to wake up very early in the morning for work, the high setting is too loud and wakes up my husband!    </li>
            <li>and I am getting a new one - not one that is supplied by our salon either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>It dries as well as a professional hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud, but not the quietest.  </li>
            <li>The blowdryer helps keep my hair soft and shiny, too.  </li>
            <li>like this product - much quieter than last dryer I had</li>
            <li>dryer, on high, gets really hot and clients complained that the dryer was too hot felt that their ears got</li>
            <li>The buttons are arranged nicely to not interfere with the handling, and my hair is smooth and soft after I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>The soft coating on the handle is also starting to peel and melt from the handle</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft instead of straw</li>
            <li>Since this one has the high air output, I don&#x27;t need the heat to get my hair dry.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sort of thick, but very fine, so it doesn&#x27;t really seem like thick</li>
            <li>Second issue is that I would prefer a shorter, larger diameter snout so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to hold it as far away.</li>
            <li>, I was quite surprised that the hairdryer and both attachments were loose in the box.  </li>
            <li>I actually look forward to drying my hair everyday because it takes so much less time and leaves my hair smooth and silky every time.</li>
            <li>I first used an Andis hair dryer in a hotel I was staying at and couldn&#x27;t believe that it cut my drying time in half and did not make it dry and frizzy like some hotel dryers.</li>

            <li> I seriously absolutely love this dryer, but it&#x27;s frustrating to have to replace it over a silly design flaw -- somehow the wiring in where the cord attaches to the dryer shorts out after a while.  </li>

            <li> I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t make my hair less frizzy as promised in the description.  </li>
            <li> another reviewer noted, the switches to control the fan speed and heat level are in a poor location.  </li>

            <li> very disappointed!</li>

            <li> My hair dryer of 10 years finally burned out. I researched for the best moderately priced ionic ceramic hair dryer and decided on this Andis 80435. What a difference!!!! I have naturally curly hair so I use the dryer to get the straight hair look. I also have friz if I don&#x27;t add some sort of hair product. This dryer has reduced the friz! I spend less time drying with the high velocity feature and it is on the quiet side. I love this dryer!! I received it in just a few days from Beauty Supply 4less. I recommended this product to my friends.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I thought this was the perfect hair dryer but I was wrong. The first day I used it the hair dryer got so hot I thought it was going to burn my scalp. The hair dryer is smaller than I thought but it is poweful. I have long hair and it created these huge tangles that are painful to brush out. I have never ever had a hair dryer that did that to my hair. I will not be using this dryer anymore. very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Hair dryer excellent.  Company excellent.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, so one less thing to trouble about</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brand of hairdryer.... my other one finally burned up after 2 yrs. of constant use. I knew I wanted to replace it with the same kind. It drys your hair really fast!</li>
            <li> October 2014 Review: Within 2 years, the hair dryer wires at the base of the unit frayed and started to sizzle and turn off and on as the wires reconnected at a certain angle. I got a back-up dryer and was using that one and then bought an inexpensive Revlon dryer. It had the same features except it was super noisy loud!    I decided to write to customer service for Andis and they replied and even though my 1-year warranty expired and they said that improper storage of the dryer might cause the wires to get frayed, they sent me a one-time replacement hair dryer. The same model was out of stock and I received a similar model, the Andis Pro-Dry+. I tried it out and it was SO LOUD and NOISY on the high setting that I have to use the low setting which takes longer to dry my thick hair. And because I need to wake up very early in the morning for work, the high setting is too loud and wakes up my husband!    I&#x27;m very appreciative that Andis replaced the hair dryer for free, but I will need to find another hair dryer that is quieter similar to the Andis Elevate model. Such a shame that the issue with the wires getting frayed cannot be remedied because other than that flaw, it is a very good hair dryer!    2012 Review:  I read all the reviews for the Andis Tourmaline Ionic/Ceramic High Velocity hair dryer and decided to try it.  I am very satisfied with this hair dryer!  It is light weight, quiet and easy to use.  The buttons are arranged nicely to not interfere with the handling, and my hair is smooth and soft after I&#x27;m done.  The three speeds are nice!  I have a lot of hair and it is thick, but this dryer dries my hair in no time with no frizz.  I would recommend this dryer!</li>
            <li> I first used an Andis hair dryer in a hotel I was staying at and couldn&#x27;t believe that it cut my drying time in half and did not make it dry and frizzy like some hotel dryers. I have long thick hair so it&#x27;s always a challenge. I went home and looked on Amazon and purchased this dryer right away. I actually look forward to drying my hair everyday because it takes so much less time and leaves my hair smooth and silky every time.</li>
            <li> as a hair stylist that uses dryers on a regular basis I have tried all different brands and this dryer caught my eye. I like the Andis name for clipper blades and trimmers and... I thought I was getting a great dryer(glad I did not pay anything for this dryer cause I got it thru my points from work)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For drying hair on 6-10 clients a day this dryer is the wrong one to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for one week the attachments would no longer stay on the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer, on high, gets really hot and clients complained that the dryer was too hot felt that their ears got burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After about 3 months I noticed that the handle became so hot by the switches that I dropped the dryer (on a client). this happened again yesterday for the second time (this time I had glove on my hand so I turned the dryer off and used a co-stylist&#x27;s dryer to finish the client. The soft coating on the handle is also starting to peel and melt from the handle overheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer did not shut down from overheating either time(as the manual said it would) and I feel that it will cause a fire. I do not smell the overheating smell but do feel the heat of the burning handle! NOT GOOD! also the paint peels off this dryer when it is placed into the dryer holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer is going into the garbage and I am getting a new one - not one that is supplied by our salon either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this is a waste of money DO NOT BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I got this because my professional hairdryer is much hotter.  I though it was damaging my hair.  I was thrilled to get such good quality from this dryer.  It dries as well as a professional hairdryer.  It feels good to hold.  It is easy to use.  I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned and I love it!  I have long, thick wavy hair and it blowdries it in half the time without burning or overheating my hair.  It has great power and I like the medium heat setting. It&#x27;s not too loud, but not the quietest.  The blowdryer helps keep my hair soft and shiny, too.  After the cord on my first one frayed, I tried three other dryers and this is still my favorite.  Inexpensive too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: As this is the second one I&#x27;ve owned, I&#x27;ve noticed they have an expiration date of about a year, give or take a few months.  I seriously absolutely love this dryer, but it&#x27;s frustrating to have to replace it over a silly design flaw -- somehow the wiring in where the cord attaches to the dryer shorts out after a while.  I&#x27;m sure I could get it repaired but it&#x27;s almost cheaper to just replace the whole thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame because this dryer is amazing. Always dries my super thick &amp; course long hair in half the normal time without burning or overheating it. I love it if they could fix that flaw it&#x27;d be perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice hair dryer, works well and dries fast.  Seems to be &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; in style and weight.  I was a little disappointed that it didn&#x27;t make my hair less frizzy as promised in the description.  It looked slightly less frizzy, but nowhere near what I expected from reading the description.  But it was a good price and appears to work well and be of good quality, so overall, I am fine with it.  I guess I can&#x27;t blame my frizzies on a hair dryer -- I will continue to blame genetics instead! :)</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer for my wife.  She loves it!  When her hair is longer, she typically straightens it.  This hair dryer makes it quite a bit easier to do so.  It&#x27;s also more quiet than her old hair dryer.  It still makes a considerable amount of noise, but it doesn&#x27;t sound like a screaming banshee.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly, price was right, and I like the color.  Primary issue is that I would prefer a sliding switch on the handle instead of the raised rocker switches.  Can&#x27;t wrap my hand around the handle without changing a setting.  Bit awkward to hold accordingly.  Second issue is that I would prefer a shorter, larger diameter snout so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to hold it as far away.</li>
            <li> like this product - much quieter than last dryer I had and it dries much more quickly.  also, it doesn&#x27;t get so hot that it burns my scalp like others I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Purchased this on Thursday and it was delivered Sunday (yesterday).  Used it for the first time today.  What a disappointment.  The ONLY good thing I can say about it is that I have two small sections of hair that always seem to frizz no matter what I do, and they didn&#x27;t seem to frizz after using this dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted, the switches to control the fan speed and heat level are in a poor location.  It&#x27;s too easy to inadvertently change them just by holding the handle.  Happened to me with both the fan and heat several times while I was drying my hair today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really looking forward to taking less time to dry my hair, but, alas, that wasn&#x27;t to be.  I must have received a dud, because even with the heat setting and fan setting both on &amp;#34;high,&amp;#34; the air coming out of the dryer could only be considered warm -- definitely not hot.  So, it took every bit as long to dry my hair today as it has taken with my old dryer.  My hair isn&#x27;t particularly long (above the shoulders).  It&#x27;s sort of thick, but very fine, so it doesn&#x27;t really seem like thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was quite surprised that the hairdryer and both attachments were loose in the box.  I expected there to be some sort of internal packaging holding the components in place, but there wasn&#x27;t any at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, well.  Time to save up for a Harry Josh dryer, I guess.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer in February 2012. I loved the power and heat, but it died on me in October! I will not purchase this brand again.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer! It dried my hair in half the time is usually takes me to dry my hair and my hair was shiny and bouncy. It left my hair soft instead of straw like, I have medium texture-below shoulder hair.</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer very much, but the air velocity is not quite as advertised.  Yes, the velocity is good, and better than most hair dryers, but still not as high as I&#x27;d like.  Maybe my expectations are too high!  I do plan on purchasing another one of these for my cottage.  The only thing I do not like about it is the rocker switches are right where you  hold the dryer, and it is so easy to flip them and change the settings. That is annoying, but not a deal buster.  If that were redesigned, it would be a near perfect dryer!</li>
            <li> Smooth,quiet, lots of settings. Have owned for several years, Made a good choice,&lt;br /&gt;Works very well. Has a very long power cord. has an air filter that works well.</li>
            <li> I thought that I had a good hair dryer til I used and Andis 1600 watt at a hotel ... My hair dried in a fraction of the time and no frizz.  I decided that an 1875 watt high velocity hair dryer would be awesome and it is :-)</li>
            <li> Well made and quiet dryer.  My gf loves it.</li>
            <li> Lovely hair dryer! No problems!</li>
            <li> I love the speeds on this, and the heat settings. I blowdry my hair everyday so it was ruined by all the heat of my previous blowdryer. Since this one has the high air output, I don&#x27;t need the heat to get my hair dry.</li>
            <li> I am stationed in Korea where the electric is 220, I need to use an inverter for this.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, it&#x27;s a great hair dryer. I don&#x27;t look so much for wattage but am more interested in airflow, and this baby fits the bill for drying hair quickly as well as other body parts.&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
