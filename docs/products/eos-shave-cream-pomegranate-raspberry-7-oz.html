            <li>This product smells awesome.</li>
            <li>I think the unscented version would be awesome for camping!</li>
            <li>this is the best shave cream i have ever used .</li>
            <li>and the scent is WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>All the EOS shave creams are wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Before finding this product, the best shaving trick I had was using coconut oil.</li>
            <li>The pomegranate raspberry smells the best!</li>
            <li>This is the best shaving cream I have ever used!</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t get a very good shave.</li>
            <li>However, since it is cream, not gel, its not that great for shaving in the shower.</li>
            <li>That said I am always on the lookout for great shaving products that are still within budget.</li>
            <li>I decided to try it since it smelled great and had a lotion like consistency.</li>
            <li>and it is great.</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>EOS is always great.</li>
            <li>I bought this shaving cream on a whim one day and am really happy that I did.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome, and when used correctly provides amazing results.</li>
            <li>After I shaved my legs were so moisturized, this was really great.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li>IT IS AMAZING!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best :)  </li>
            <li>smells so good and arrived in a great condition</li>
            <li>Smells good.</li>
            <li>I am vegan and have been in search of a good shaving cream that is not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>It smells good - but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li>Smells good, like bubble gum.  </li>
            <li>This cream smells good &amp; moisturizes the skin however</li>
            <li>I knew that wasn&#x27;t a good long-term solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The biggest problem is that it clogs up my razor, and i dont get very many uses out of my razors.</li>
            <li>I have to say I absolutely love this shaving cream!</li>
            <li>The product itself is also lotion-like and smooths on nicely but don&#x27;t expect lather.</li>
            <li>But honestly?</li>
            <li>after visit a niece, and seeing this in her bathroom, I asked her about it, and went out to buy my own.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought that the scent would be too strong but it was perfect.</li>
            <li>Plus, I had to use A LOT more of this product compared to something like Skintimate.</li>
            <li>and it works like magic.</li>
            <li>Like the title says, I LOVE this shave cream.  </li>
            <li>, it cost a lot more and it also cost me in having to replace my razors sooner.  </li>
            <li>Love the packaging.</li>
            <li>Also, I use a \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; razor, because they&#x27;re consistently better (Schick Hydro 5).</li>
            <li>I love EOS products and added the shaving cream to the list.</li>
            <li>It also smells so much better than most shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK</li>
            <li>It smells OK and does moisturize my legs.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing (like a pink starburst!); and feels wonderful to my legs when shaving.</li>
            <li>The Pomegranate Raspberry is very sweet and fruity</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing easier or more comfortable to shave with now than Zipp Mist.</li>
            <li>This is a great shave cream if you have sensitive skin like me.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it at first bc</li>
            <li>but so far I am happy</li>
            <li>and I had to take even more time to clean the tub.</li>
            <li>I was able to rinse my razor clean with no issue.  </li>
            <li>it leaves SOME buildup in the razor i use (Venus) and can easily see where i did not shave or not, i bought this in target and</li>
            <li>The best shaving creme ever hands down</li>
            <li>My legs feel dry even after applying an incredible amount of lotion to soothe the burn.</li>
            <li>does* give a great shave, but has a few issues: it hardens unless really warm</li>
            <li>I tried this out because it was actually free.  </li>
            <li>and this stuff didn&#x27;t make my skin as smooth as when I use Coochy Cream.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this by mail.</li>
            <li>it also works fabulously.</li>
            <li>As mentioned, it leaves your skin SMOOTH and hydrated with no irritation.  </li>
            <li>With this product you just put a light mist on your face.</li>
            <li>Zipp Mist has all the qualities that you want for a smooth comfortable shave it has products that soften your hair it also has ingredients that protect and care for your skin and</li>
            <li>Not only do you get a great, close shave, you also eliminate razor bumps and nicks.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who likes smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to start using this shave cream.</li>
            <li>goes a long ways too if you don&#x27;t get pump happy.  </li>
            <li>So, I was really excited to use this since its an eos product.</li>
            <li>Then, all the gunk gets stuck in your razor and doesnt seem to clean out.</li>
            <li>their are special oils to help your razor glide over your face.  </li>
            <li>Ok, that might sound gross, but it worked fine for me!  </li>
            <li>I ended up using much more product than I think I normally use.</li>
            <li>The smell was very good, a small amount will do you with a warm wet razor, no cuts just smooth</li>
            <li>Plus, when you shave dry, you can just reuse the cream you used on one spot and wipe it on a different spot! :D</li>
            <li>I love it worked wonders on my lovely dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>This a shave cream that is worth the effort to order.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li>This shaving cream has consistently given me a really close shave (probably the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had) and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>You can also shave either wet or DRY with this product which works great when you are in a hurry!</li>
            <li>They do the job better than most shaving creams and you get less chemicals in your shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>I will note I was using a BRAND NEW schick hydro razor which are THE best for achieving a long lasting close shave.</li>
            <li>While some of the complaints may be true for those particular people, I had no problems with this shave cream.  </li>
            <li>but wouldn&#x27;t be my first pick.irst pick.</li>
            <li>And I was able to shave without having to go over multiple times.</li>
            <li>First time I used it with Schick hydro which I was using for the first time too, so I thought maybe it was the razor.</li>
            <li>The first shave I had 4 nicks(which</li>
            <li>I have not had a nick or cut since I first started shaving.</li>
            <li>I figured I would just use more product next time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually more like lotion than a traditional shaving cream/foam.</li>
            <li>I ordered in bulk and never plan to use another shave cream unless they stop making it haha!</li>
            <li>This is hands down my very very favorite shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used in my 33 years.</li>
            <li>feels nice and leaves your skin soft without feeling like there is any extra residue.</li>
            <li>I was a bit leery to try it that way at first, but it worked really well</li>
            <li>(although I did notice other scents received more positive reviews somehow, despite having nothing to do with the scent.</li>
            <li>Again, very time consuming.</li>
            <li>and this really moisturizes and doesnt cause me to break out.</li>
            <li>so much I look like</li>
            <li>so any moisture my skin wants to cling to gets stripped away by the elements before shaving can have its turn.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li>haha)    </li>
            <li>haha  </li>
            <li>but when i did, i was very dissapointed...</li>
            <li>works very well for me</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>very organic.</li>
            <li>Very frusturating.    </li>
            <li>cost twice as much as Skintimate.</li>
            <li>and I understand that others really like it, but for me it causes too much itch</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t lather and I was using sooo much, but</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;ve had with so many other products.  </li>
            <li>I like the option of shaving dry (though i have yet to try it out) and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>My ONLY issue, is that once I used almost all of the product up (and I couldn&#x27;t pump anymore out of the bottle), I unscrewed the top, and found there was still a decent amount left, stuck to the sides.  </li>
            <li>Would recommend for anyone looking for a quality shaving cream priced decently.</li>
            <li>This, to me, is AMAZING, because I have had countless issues shaving WET with other shaving cream/gel products my entire life, and this one makes me legs SUPER smooth, and NOT dry/itchy/irritated</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>After all the time it took me to shave using this product, I can&#x27;t imagine people&#x27;s hot water bills who regularly use this product!!</li>
            <li>I have a small shower stall to work with so anything that requires being tipped over or twisting is a pain in the foot (gotta love dropping slippery cans and bottles on the toes).</li>
            <li>Now I consistently get a close shave, and don&#x27;t have ingrown hairs or noticeable red spots all over my shins.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also completely dulled a new blade after using it twice.</li>
            <li>but I would probably try a different one next time--this one is a bit too sweet for my liking.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product, at least until i find a better, cruelty-free alternative.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have always had sensitive skin and my legs</li>
            <li>It might be more expensive than the dollar store brands, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it help my skin stay smooth with no razor burn, it also lasts a lot longer than any other shaving cream I have used.</li>
            <li>After clogging up a few razors and throwing them away after just one or two uses, I found that running the razor under hot water for a few seconds after shaving really helps clean it up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not good either.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a new product called Zipp Mist it is different than any type of shaving lotion.  </li>
            <li>I bought a new Gillette razor blade and a bottle of this on the same day.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive and I live in a windy, dry area</li>
            <li>Plus, everyone&#x27;s complaining about how expensive this product is, I feel like you get MORE bang for your buck this way!    </li>
            <li>Because this product shaves well dry (I do recommend a fresh razor if you are going dry)</li>
            <li>I spent years suffering from razor burn and super dry skin.</li>
            <li>Apparently EOS has a vanilla version, a lavender version, melon version and a couple of others.</li>
            <li>It was formulated for people with sensitive skin and uses only skin care products.</li>
            <li>and now I have no plans of going back to the old way.</li>
            <li>Other creams leave ingrown hairs with red bumps, but this was the first time with no cuts or bumps in a while.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use nice shaving cream, my legs get bad razor burn, despite expensive razors, so I am always on the prowl for something that is amazing.</li>

            <li> Again, very time consuming.</li>
            <li> and this really moisturizes and doesnt cause me to break out.</li>
            <li> so much I look like</li>
            <li> so any moisture my skin wants to cling to gets stripped away by the elements before shaving can have its turn.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> haha)    </li>
            <li> haha  </li>
            <li> but when i did, i was very dissapointed...</li>
            <li> works very well for me</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> very organic.</li>
            <li> Very frusturating.    </li>
            <li> cost twice as much as Skintimate.</li>
            <li> and I understand that others really like it, but for me it causes too much itch</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t lather and I was using sooo much, but</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;ve had with so many other products.  </li>
            <li> I like the option of shaving dry (though i have yet to try it out) and it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li> My ONLY issue, is that once I used almost all of the product up (and I couldn&#x27;t pump anymore out of the bottle), I unscrewed the top, and found there was still a decent amount left, stuck to the sides.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend for anyone looking for a quality shaving cream priced decently.</li>
            <li> This, to me, is AMAZING, because I have had countless issues shaving WET with other shaving cream/gel products my entire life, and this one makes me legs SUPER smooth, and NOT dry/itchy/irritated</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> After all the time it took me to shave using this product, I can&#x27;t imagine people&#x27;s hot water bills who regularly use this product!!</li>
            <li> I have a small shower stall to work with so anything that requires being tipped over or twisting is a pain in the foot (gotta love dropping slippery cans and bottles on the toes).</li>
            <li> Now I consistently get a close shave, and don&#x27;t have ingrown hairs or noticeable red spots all over my shins.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also completely dulled a new blade after using it twice.</li>
            <li> but I would probably try a different one next time--this one is a bit too sweet for my liking.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product, at least until i find a better, cruelty-free alternative.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have always had sensitive skin and my legs</li>
            <li> It might be more expensive than the dollar store brands, but it is worth it.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it help my skin stay smooth with no razor burn, it also lasts a lot longer than any other shaving cream I have used.</li>
            <li> After clogging up a few razors and throwing them away after just one or two uses, I found that running the razor under hot water for a few seconds after shaving really helps clean it up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not good either.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a new product called Zipp Mist it is different than any type of shaving lotion.  </li>
            <li> I bought a new Gillette razor blade and a bottle of this on the same day.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive and I live in a windy, dry area</li>
            <li> Plus, everyone&#x27;s complaining about how expensive this product is, I feel like you get MORE bang for your buck this way!    </li>
            <li> Because this product shaves well dry (I do recommend a fresh razor if you are going dry)</li>
            <li> I spent years suffering from razor burn and super dry skin.</li>
            <li> Apparently EOS has a vanilla version, a lavender version, melon version and a couple of others.</li>
            <li> It was formulated for people with sensitive skin and uses only skin care products.</li>
            <li> and now I have no plans of going back to the old way.</li>
            <li> Other creams leave ingrown hairs with red bumps, but this was the first time with no cuts or bumps in a while.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use nice shaving cream, my legs get bad razor burn, despite expensive razors, so I am always on the prowl for something that is amazing.</li>
            <li> once I realized it only takes a very thin layer to cover your entire leg I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> And NO my skin is not super sensitive!</li>
            <li> It does clog the razor quickly, because it is so thick, but I recommend this to people with very dry skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty thick stuff.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s not the red bumps, it&#x27;s the scaly dry skin.</li>
            <li> Then I used it with a brand new blade on my usual Venus embrace, and it still left me itchy.</li>
            <li> No nicks or cuts, and as someone with very dry skin, this actually moisturizes my skin leaving no irritation bumps or anything.</li>
            <li> It took me twice as long to shave as I kept having to go over spots and reapply this product.</li>
            <li> Just a few pumps from the lotion-like dispenser is far easier.</li>
            <li> When I shaved it took me over twice as long because the shaving cream kept clogging up the blades.</li>
            <li> I have used it couple of times now, hoping it wud be less itchy but its the same - I will be switching back to gillette.</li>
            <li> I always feel like when I use this that my shave doesn&#x27;t last as long as with other products.</li>
            <li> My legs were very soft for the remainder of the day, but the hair growth seemed to appear sooner than usual</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it &#x27;wet,&#x27; and two pumps works for each leg from mid thigh down.</li>
            <li> B0032ANCZK Skintimate Moisturizing Shave Cream, Dry Skin, 6-Ounces Cans (</li>
            <li> What sold me on it as a product I will continue to use is the dry shaving option.</li>
            <li> - You can SHAVE DRY with it, just like it says on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have never used it to shave on dry skin, but I have used it plenty while in the shower</li>
            <li> I have been using the Skintimate dry skin shaving cream, but it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> i have exstremly sensitive skin , i usually get shaving rash .</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little more expensive than other drug store products, and it can clog up your razor a bit.</li>
            <li> and I have used it about every other day for the last few weeks with the same razor.</li>
            <li> it will leave you cut, dry, and burning!</li>
            <li> I typically get about 10 uses out of razors but when using EOS shave cream, I can only use the razor 1 or 2 times bc</li>
            <li> (and I have average to thick hair, definitely not thin)    </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s expensive, and worse--I had started attracting sugar ants to my shower because of the sweet smell!</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time because a little goes a long way--usually just one or two pumps per leg works well for</li>
            <li> minus the slippery shower floor.</li>
            <li> Because it wasn&#x27;t slippery or lathery I expected my legs (etc.)</li>
            <li> As someone with very dry skin, shaving more than once or twice a week (even with heavy duty moisturizing) can be painful.</li>
            <li> only bad thing I can say about this shaving cream is that it clogs up razors quickly.</li>
            <li> I cannot use anything other than this, as other gels/creams/lotions make my legs itch</li>
            <li> Cost twice as much as other shave creams.      </li>
            <li> to hate this product but my legs in particular felt really</li>
            <li> The product is not worth the money or the time.</li>
            <li> when i use this or any other EOS shave cream , i don&#x27;t get a shaving rash !</li>
            <li> I wanted to add a positive review here, as this particular item seems to be getting a lot of negative ones :(</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is one of the only ones i have found, and one of the only ones that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg.</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem to give me less bumps or a smoother result.</li>
            <li> I am definitely convinced now that it is the eos shaving creme that is causing me this most horrible and widespread itching.  </li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t keep your razor for long periods of time - it gets dull and the blades are ruined if it falls or you drop it.</li>
            <li> And a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> But other than that, no complaints!!</li>
            <li> DONT WASTE YOU TIME AND MONEY ON THIS.</li>
            <li> it is 3$ for one so dont waste your money here</li>
            <li> I have to go bk over areas where hair was left behind.  </li>
            <li> It seemed like a had shaved a few days ago when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You really only need a REALLY thin layer to make your skin slick-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad really because after the few horrible hours of itchy, my legs did feel really moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time!</li>
            <li> and I was gifted with evil hairy genetics</li>
            <li> I had to put at Least one star</li>
            <li> I used it twice and is really not good.  </li>
            <li> This product is straight up and utterly awful.</li>
            <li> something is wrong with me from scratching incessantly.</li>
            <li> It is a terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> In my 10 years of shaving I have never encountered a product so disappointing.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve worked that problem out, I haven&#x27;t been wasting razors like crazy.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent isn&#x27;t bad</li>
            <li> But I was so disappointed - my legs were so itchy after using it -</li>
            <li> I hate shaving.</li>
            <li> Hate it with a passion.</li>
            <li> and i absolutely hate it.</li>
            <li> Too bad you can&#x27;t smell them before buying!</li>
            <li> Terrible.</li>
            <li> Worst shaving cream ever!</li>
            <li> i use a shick razor and it was the worst shave ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried this out because it was actually free.  I used it twice and is really not good.  I have very sensitive skin and this stuff didn&#x27;t make my skin as smooth as when I use Coochy Cream.  Also, it didn&#x27;t help the razor to glide well and I had to use a lot for just one shave.  It&#x27;s not terrible, but it&#x27;s not good either.</li>
            <li> Terrible. I bought some from target. It was like lotion. It doesn&#x27;t get foamy either, it just runs in and absorbs like lotion.</li>
            <li> Does the job. I always feel like when I use this that my shave doesn&#x27;t last as long as with other products. It&#x27;s pretty thick stuff. Smells good.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this by mail. What a waste of time! It took me twice as long to shave as I kept having to go over spots and reapply this product. I ended up using much more product than I think I normally use. It also left a film on my razor so I couldn&#x27;t just rinse the hair off the razor, I had to wipe it off! Again, very time consuming. After I was done, I realized that this product left an oily residue all over my tub and I had to take even more time to clean the tub. My legs were very soft for the remainder of the day, but the hair growth seemed to appear sooner than usual so I did not get to close of a shave with it. After all the time it took me to shave using this product, I can&#x27;t imagine people&#x27;s hot water bills who regularly use this product!!</li>
            <li> I am vegan and have been in search of a good shaving cream that is not tested on animals. Unfortunately, this is one of the only ones i have found, and one of the only ones that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. I like the option of shaving dry (though i have yet to try it out) and it smells fantastic. However, since it is cream, not gel, its not that great for shaving in the shower. The biggest problem is that it clogs up my razor, and i dont get very many uses out of my razors. I dont think this works as well as a gel shaving cream, but it works well enough, and you have to give them points for not testing on animals. I will continue to use this product, at least until i find a better, cruelty-free alternative.</li>
            <li> This product smells awesome. it also works fabulously. I have really sensitive skin and this really moisturizes and doesnt cause me to break out. I am definately buying again!</li>
            <li> This is hands down my very very favorite shave cream I&#x27;ve ever used in my 33 years. I cannot use anything other than this, as other gels/creams/lotions make my legs itch so much I look like something is wrong with me from scratching incessantly. This stuff smells amazing (like a pink starburst!); and feels wonderful to my legs when shaving. It keeps my legs hydrated and yummy! You can also shave either wet or DRY with this product which works great when you are in a hurry! My local stores stopped carrying it - so now I&#x27;m buying it online because I have to have this!</li>
            <li> I hate shaving. Hate it with a passion. My skin is very sensitive and I live in a windy, dry area so any moisture my skin wants to cling to gets stripped away by the elements before shaving can have its turn. That said I am always on the lookout for great shaving products that are still within budget. I&#x27;d recently seen EOS Ultra Moisturizing Shave Cream in magazine advertisements and made a note to try it if I could ever find it. A couple of weeks ago I came across it in a chain store so I snapped up a bottle of the Pomegranate Raspberry. I was hoping they had an unscented version but that was the only scent offered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly I have to say I looooove the pump. I have a small shower stall to work with so anything that requires being tipped over or twisting is a pain in the foot (gotta love dropping slippery cans and bottles on the toes). Just a few pumps from the lotion-like dispenser is far easier. The product itself is also lotion-like and smooths on nicely but don&#x27;t expect lather. This formula has a similar texture to [[ASIN:B0032ANCZK Skintimate Moisturizing Shave Cream, Dry Skin, 6-Ounces Cans (Pack of 6)]] minus the slippery shower floor. Because it wasn&#x27;t slippery or lathery I expected my legs (etc.) to hate this product but my legs in particular felt really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why would I recommend this product? What sold me on it as a product I will continue to use is the dry shaving option. I don&#x27;t always have time to hit the shower for a shave and I was gifted with evil hairy genetics (imagine having five o&#x27;clock shadow in your armpits... e[...] Because this product shaves well dry (I do recommend a fresh razor if you are going dry) it&#x27;s already let me touch up in the afternoon before going out sleeveless in the evening. I think the unscented version would be awesome for camping! Apparently EOS has a vanilla version, a lavender version, melon version and a couple of others. The Pomegranate Raspberry is very sweet and fruity which I did like but wouldn&#x27;t be my first pick.irst pick.</li>
            <li> Worst shaving cream ever! It&#x27;s like using lotion which ends up clogging up your blades so you don&#x27;t get a very good shave. I had to throw my razor away after using this product. Plus, I had to use A LOT more of this product compared to something like Skintimate.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</li>
            <li> As someone with very dry skin, shaving more than once or twice a week (even with heavy duty moisturizing) can be painful. With this product I didn&#x27;t cut or nick myself, nor did I get any razor burn. I&#x27;ve only used it &#x27;wet,&#x27; and two pumps works for each leg from mid thigh down. You really only need a REALLY thin layer to make your skin slick- and it works like magic. And it&#x27;s so moisturizing that I don&#x27;t necessarily need to put any lotion on after I shave.     Yes, it&#x27;s a little more expensive than other drug store products, and it can clog up your razor a bit. But honestly? This is the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten and I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to add a positive review here, as this particular item seems to be getting a lot of negative ones :( (although I did notice other scents received more positive reviews somehow, despite having nothing to do with the scent. haha)    Anyway. Like the title says, I LOVE this shave cream.  While some of the complaints may be true for those particular people, I had no problems with this shave cream.  I was able to rinse my razor clean with no issue.  And I was able to shave without having to go over multiple times. (and I have average to thick hair, definitely not thin)    I think that this product shines in two areas:    - You can SHAVE DRY with it, just like it says on the bottle.  This, to me, is AMAZING, because I have had countless issues shaving WET with other shaving cream/gel products my entire life, and this one makes me legs SUPER smooth, and NOT dry/itchy/irritated like I&#x27;ve had with so many other products.  Plus, when you shave dry, you can just reuse the cream you used on one spot and wipe it on a different spot! :D hahah  Ok, that might sound gross, but it worked fine for me!  Plus, everyone&#x27;s complaining about how expensive this product is, I feel like you get MORE bang for your buck this way!    - As mentioned, it leaves your skin SMOOTH and hydrated with no irritation.  I cannot say this about a LOT of shaving creams/gels.  If it&#x27;s not the red bumps, it&#x27;s the scaly dry skin. Lotion almost always needed to be applied after.  With this product no lotion is necessary!!      My ONLY issue, is that once I used almost all of the product up (and I couldn&#x27;t pump anymore out of the bottle), I unscrewed the top, and found there was still a decent amount left, stuck to the sides.  So I had to manually scrape out the remnants with the pump and wipe it off on my leg. haha  But other than that, no complaints!!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a new product called Zipp Mist it is different than any type of shaving lotion.  It was formulated for people with sensitive skin and uses only skin care products. With this product you just put a light mist on your face. It helps your razor just glide over your face while you shave.  Zipp Mist has all the qualities that you want for a smooth comfortable shave it has products that soften your hair it also has ingredients that protect and care for your skin and their are special oils to help your razor glide over your face.  There&#x27;s nothing easier or more comfortable to shave with now than Zipp Mist.</li>
            <li> I came across this shaving cream at Target. I decided to try it since it smelled great and had a lotion like consistency. I have to say I absolutely love this shaving cream! I have never used it to shave on dry skin, but I have used it plenty while in the shower and it is great. No nicks or cuts, and as someone with very dry skin, this actually moisturizes my skin leaving no irritation bumps or anything. It does clog the razor quickly, because it is so thick, but I recommend this to people with very dry skin!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to start using this shave cream. but when i did, i was very dissapointed... i use a shick razor and it was the worst shave ever. you can still see the hair and it has razor bumps. DONT WASTE YOU TIME AND MONEY ON THIS.</li>
            <li> works very well for me</li>
            <li> Great product. Fast shipping. Thanks.</li>
            <li> it leaves SOME buildup in the razor i use (Venus) and can easily see where i did not shave or not, i bought this in target and it is 3$ for one so dont waste your money here</li>
            <li> this is the best shave cream i have ever used . and i have tried everything ! i have exstremly sensitive skin , i usually get shaving rash . when i use this or any other EOS shave cream , i don&#x27;t get a shaving rash !</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best :)  I have literally tried them all.  goes a long ways too if you don&#x27;t get pump happy.  and the scent is WONDERFUL! very organic.</li>
            <li> I thought i would splurge and buy this shaving cream and i absolutely hate it. I have to pump 6 times to cover my leg. And then it doesnt even lather up! Then, all the gunk gets stuck in your razor and doesnt seem to clean out. Doesnt seem to give me less bumps or a smoother result.</li>
            <li> So, I was really excited to use this since its an eos product. But I was so disappointed - my legs were so itchy after using it - I had to put a lot of lotion all over my legs after this because they kept itching. It smells good - but that&#x27;s about it. I have used it couple of times now, hoping it wud be less itchy but its the same - I will be switching back to gillette.</li>
            <li> PROS: Smells good, like bubble gum.  Moisturizing.    CONS: Clogs up razors.  I have to go bk over areas where hair was left behind.  Cost twice as much as other shave creams.      This cream smells good &amp; moisturizes the skin however, it cost a lot more and it also cost me in having to replace my razors sooner.  I typically get about 10 uses out of razors but when using EOS shave cream, I can only use the razor 1 or 2 times bc it&#x27;s clogged up.    Becuase the razor gets clogged up, it misses patches of hair that sometimes I don&#x27;t realize till I&#x27;m out of the shower.  Very frusturating.    The product is not worth the money or the time.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging. The smell was very good, a small amount will do you with a warm wet razor, no cuts just smooth legs.&lt;br /&gt;+ packaging&lt;br /&gt;+ lotion feel&lt;br /&gt;+ smell&lt;br /&gt;-  cost twice as much as Skintimate.</li>
            <li> All the EOS shave creams are wonderful.  They do the job better than most shaving creams and you get less chemicals in your shaving cream.  I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> Oh god my legs feel like they have a 1000 needles in them, they are so itchy after shaving with this product even after I put lotion on them. I have shaved with this product 4 or five times now and every time it has left me itchy. First time I used it with Schick hydro which I was using for the first time too, so I thought maybe it was the razor. Then I used it with a brand new blade on my usual Venus embrace, and it still left me itchy. So this time I shaved with my razor with no shaving cream, then I put the eos on afterwards, and it still made me itch! I am definitely convinced now that it is the eos shaving creme that is causing me this most horrible and widespread itching.  It&#x27;s too bad really because after the few horrible hours of itchy, my legs did feel really moisturized and soft. But I feel that I should also mention that there were still nicks and razor bumps. I guess this is something that reacts differently for everyone and I understand that others really like it, but for me it causes too much itch so I threw mine away and won&#x27;t be using it again.</li>
            <li> This product is straight up and utterly awful. The first shave I had 4 nicks(which the bottle claims to prevent)- I have not had a nick or cut since I first started shaving. I will note I was using a BRAND NEW schick hydro razor which are THE best for achieving a long lasting close shave. I figured I would just use more product next time. So for the second shave I went from 2 pumps per leg, to 5. I still got nicks AND the worst razor burn of my life. My legs feel dry even after applying an incredible amount of lotion to soothe the burn. I am beyond words with this shaving cream. It is a terrible waste of money. I just want to warn all you women out there it will leave you cut, dry, and burning! And NO my skin is not super sensitive! In my 10 years of shaving I have never encountered a product so disappointing. I had to put at Least one star but it deserves 0.</li>
            <li> EOS is always great. Super fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Before finding this product, the best shaving trick I had was using coconut oil. Which *does* give a great shave, but has a few issues: it hardens unless really warm, it&#x27;s messy, it&#x27;s expensive, and worse--I had started attracting sugar ants to my shower because of the sweet smell! I knew that wasn&#x27;t a good long-term solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up finding a travel sample of EOS shave cream I&#x27;d received as a gift or something, and decided to give it a try. Goodness gracious, the difference! No shaving cream comes close to the smoothness I achieve using this product (pun intended). I bought a three-pack of the regular size so I won&#x27;t run out, because I don&#x27;t plan on using anything else to shave my legs from now on!</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving cream on a whim one day and am really happy that I did. It&#x27;s actually more like lotion than a traditional shaving cream/foam. In fact, you don&#x27;t even have to rinse it off after using it, so you&#x27;re not stuck shaving in the shower! I was a bit leery to try it that way at first, but it worked really well and now I have no plans of going back to the old way. This shaving cream has consistently given me a really close shave (probably the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had) and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. It also lasts a long time because a little goes a long way--usually just one or two pumps per leg works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I can say about this shaving cream is that it clogs up razors quickly. After clogging up a few razors and throwing them away after just one or two uses, I found that running the razor under hot water for a few seconds after shaving really helps clean it up. Now that I&#x27;ve worked that problem out, I haven&#x27;t been wasting razors like crazy. Also, the scent isn&#x27;t bad but I would probably try a different one next time--this one is a bit too sweet for my liking. Too bad you can&#x27;t smell them before buying!</li>
            <li> This is a great shave cream if you have sensitive skin like me. Not only do you get a great, close shave, you also eliminate razor bumps and nicks. For those who say that it clogs up their razors: rinse your razor after one or two strokes, and change your razor often! You shouldn&#x27;t keep your razor for long periods of time - it gets dull and the blades are ruined if it falls or you drop it. I spent years suffering from razor burn and super dry skin. Now I consistently get a close shave, and don&#x27;t have ingrown hairs or noticeable red spots all over my shins. Also, I use a \\&quot;men&#x27;s\\&quot; razor, because they&#x27;re consistently better (Schick Hydro 5). This product is awesome, and when used correctly provides amazing results.</li>
            <li> This a shave cream that is worth the effort to order.  It might be more expensive than the dollar store brands, but it is worth it.  And a little goes along way.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it at first bc it didn&#x27;t lather and I was using sooo much, but once I realized it only takes a very thin layer to cover your entire leg I absolutely love it. I have always had sensitive skin and my legs itch from shaving constantly, but that has stopped since I started using EOS. I ordered in bulk and never plan to use another shave cream unless they stop making it haha! The pomegranate raspberry smells the best! PS I have seen some reviews say it ruined their razor but I have had no issues with that and I have used it about every other day for the last few weeks with the same razor.</li>
            <li> The best shaving creme ever hands down</li>
            <li> This is the best shaving cream I have ever used! It definitely has shea butter in it. After I shaved my legs were so moisturized, this was really great. At first, I thought that the scent would be too strong but it was perfect. I have been using the Skintimate dry skin shaving cream, but it doesn&#x27;t work. This truly works, the covering isn&#x27;t a lie. Other creams leave ingrown hairs with red bumps, but this was the first time with no cuts or bumps in a while.</li>
            <li> I did not try it yet but so far I am happy smells so good and arrived in a great condition</li>
            <li> I bought a new Gillette razor blade and a bottle of this on the same day. When I shaved it took me over twice as long because the shaving cream kept clogging up the blades. (I have used the same blades for a while so I knew it was not them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the shave I got was not close. It seemed like a had shaved a few days ago when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also completely dulled a new blade after using it twice. So on the same day I threw out the bottle and the blade.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use nice shaving cream, my legs get bad razor burn, despite expensive razors, so I am always on the prowl for something that is amazing. after visit a niece, and seeing this in her bathroom, I asked her about it, and went out to buy my own. IT IS AMAZING! Not only does it help my skin stay smooth with no razor burn, it also lasts a lot longer than any other shaving cream I have used. I have dated the bottles on the day I started using them, and some have lasted up to three months. I would recommend this to anyone who likes smooth skin.</li>
            <li> I love EOS products and added the shaving cream to the list. I love it worked wonders on my lovely dry winter skin. It also smells so much better than most shaving cream. feels nice and leaves your skin soft without feeling like there is any extra residue. Would recommend for anyone looking for a quality shaving cream priced decently.</li>
            <li> This is a shaving lotion not a shaving cream.  It&#x27;s OK but I prefer shaving creams to lotions.  It smells OK and does moisturize my legs.</li>
