            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect sexy-woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>

            <li>This perfume is amazing!</li>
            <li>I love this perfume and Amazon for selling it at a great price!  </li>
            <li>I think this one smells best as the perfume, because after wearing the lotion for a while it seemed to me that the scent turned into a more flowery scent that reminded me of the body shops Neroli Jasmine scent.</li>
            <li>Really nice!</li>
            <li>The plus here is Amazon is a great place to find these at a good price.</li>
            <li>People would be just standing beside me and be like \\&quot;What smells so good?</li>
            <li>It is a fairly inexpensive perfume compared to department store fragrances.</li>
            <li>But I chose to try this because my Granddaughter uses it all the time, and I loved the smell.</li>
            <li>and I loved it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this perfume!</li>
            <li>Love this scent!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It smells absolutely amazing with the advertised musky scent and the floral.</li>
            <li>What kind of perfume is that?\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This whole line is awesome.</li>
            <li>This is a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>Most all the Bath &amp; Body fragrances are good.  </li>
            <li>After I layered it with some citrus oil I liked it much better.</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like the original at bath and body and the best part</li>
            <li>:) )</li>
            <li>AND WHILE I STILL LOVE THE SCENT...</li>
            <li>I have had many people ask me what it is</li>
            <li>that is why I love shopping through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I smelled this perfume in bath and body works and was IN LOVE with it, but it was $30</li>
            <li>It is perfect for a romantic day/night out with your man.</li>
            <li>/&gt;My favorite by Bath and Body works is still the Sensual Amber though.</li>
            <li>I love this scent since it came out.</li>
            <li>Love the aroma.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite perfume for years.  </li>
            <li>However, there was a lovely scent coming from the store; I was drawn in, and asked the saleswoman what the fragrance in the oil burner was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>yes it was cheap, but it still suxs !</li>
            <li>Bought this for my daughter for Christmas as this is her favorite perfume.  </li>
            <li>STILL SEARCHING FOR A GREAT NEW SCENT TO WEAR.</li>
            <li>&quot; The bottle was not tampered with in any way and came in the original box :)THIS IS AN UPDATE..</li>
            <li>THE SCENT FADES AWAY VERY QUICKLY</li>
            <li>but itâ€™s works fine at night</li>
            <li>and i absolutely fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li>So i ordered the perfume here at a great price and it arrived 3 days later to my home!  </li>
            <li>it not only smells great</li>
            <li>Exactly what i was looking for!!</li>
            <li>It came in so fast, I didn&#x27;t have to wait more than three days after ordering.</li>
            <li>Okay, before you diss me about \\&quot;not liking the smell because it really smells</li>
            <li>this does not smell strong and the scent disappears super fast.</li>
            <li>This is a lovely new fragrance out by Bath and Body Works.</li>
            <li>good,\\&quot; think what I have to say first!</li>
            <li>I own the entire line, shower gel, body cream, body mist, cologne etc.</li>
            <li>Anyway i would most definitely recommend this perfume to ANYONE!</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>Last fairly long for an EDT, scent is great for night but a bit too musky/sweet for day.</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t going to try this scent out.</li>
            <li>This smelled so good i stocked enough to last me a year.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is so soft and sensual...not too bold, but yet very alluring.</li>
            <li>oh and you really should get the lotion too...</li>
            <li>I had to ask what it was because the smell was familiar but different.</li>
            <li>The eau de toilette of Twilight Woods has a very sweet warm smell to it that is toned down by the woodsy smell and lightened slightly with a touch of an apricot-like scent.</li>
            <li>For summer I use Gilly Hicks&#x27;s La Perouse or similar refreshing scent like Christian Dior&#x27;s Remember Me and then switch to this when Fall comes!</li>
            <li>the mature or familiar part somhow reminded me of white diamonds.</li>
            <li>My goodness, do I love the dark spiciness of this one!  </li>
            <li>i was looking for something new...</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;This is our new scent,</li>
            <li>So if your looking for other romantic scents, I highly suggest those. :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the exact same thing as the stuff off of the bath and body works website, but waaaay cheaper.</li>
            <li>So after using Victoria&#x27;s Secret dream angel collection for the past 2 years, either that or White Diamonds which tends to be very strong but smells good...</li>
            <li>and when I tell them Twilight Woods from Bath and Body Works they seem surprised.</li>
            <li>This bottle lasts a long long time and the bottle is surprisingly VERY big for the price!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a must-have! :)</li>
            <li>so it catches the eye of every 13 year old mall dweller that passes BBW?\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on this cologne it was unbelievable!</li>
            <li>I was a little worried about buying it, but it&#x27;s sooo worth it!</li>
            <li>I had just seen Twilight (the film) a week prior to my first mall visit when this was released, and suddenly I see a perfume called Twilight Woods.</li>
            <li>Twilight Woods, i believe, can work for all ages of women from 20 to 80, because it smells mature and young at the same time</li>
            <li>I would recommend wearing light amounts because a little goes a long way, and it lasts forever.  </li>
            <li>Definitely lots of different types of earthy notes, balanced out by the soft florals.</li>
            <li>I guess that is where the other reviewer considered it mature yet young.</li>
            <li>But apparently, I got an email saying that \\&quot;the last bottle broke\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I really really believe this is not a original perfume.</li>
            <li>i had this perfume few times in the past purchased directly from Bath &amp; Body and it smelled really strong for such a long time.</li>

            <li> It seems to be a bit bolder when it is layered with the other products such as the body wash and body lotion.</li>
            <li> The other part was woodsy and sensual.</li>

            <li> The smell is very casual and mild..</li>
            <li> i would like it to be a little stronger</li>
            <li> However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this during the summer because it&#x27;s a little on the heavy side of eau de toilette.</li>
            <li> However, that wasnt a bad thing im just really into sensual, darker</li>
            <li> I am not able to wear lots of perfumes, I have a reaction to them.</li>
            <li> my girl use it occasionally, the bad thing was that is no compatible whit</li>
            <li> I always used the flash for this scent because the eau de toilette was always too expensive in the Bath and Body Works store for me ($30 per bottle) but then I saw this on amazon</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed..</li>

            <li> I absolutely love this perfume! I own the entire line, shower gel, body cream, body mist, cologne etc. The eau de toilette of Twilight Woods has a very sweet warm smell to it that is toned down by the woodsy smell and lightened slightly with a touch of an apricot-like scent. It is a very complex and mature scent. I got so many compliments on this cologne it was unbelievable! People would be just standing beside me and be like \\&quot;What smells so good? oh its you! What kind of perfume is that?\\&quot;. This smelled so good i stocked enough to last me a year. Twilight Woods, i believe, can work for all ages of women from 20 to 80, because it smells mature and young at the same time (gosh I hope that made sense! :) ) Anyway i would most definitely recommend this perfume to ANYONE!</li>
            <li> So after using Victoria&#x27;s Secret dream angel collection for the past 2 years, either that or White Diamonds which tends to be very strong but smells good...i was looking for something new...my sister in law bought me the Twilight Woods lotion and body soap and i absolutely fell in love with it!  So i ordered the perfume here at a great price and it arrived 3 days later to my home!  The smell is very casual and mild..i would like it to be a little stronger but i think it&#x27;s because when you put it on after a while..you get used to it..because my husband says he can still smell it when i can&#x27;t.  oh and you really should get the lotion too...it not only smells great but it&#x27;s like silk on your skin..I love this perfume and Amazon for selling it at a great price!  To add a note\\&quot; The bottle was not tampered with in any way and came in the original box :)THIS IS AN UPDATE..I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW AND WHILE I STILL LOVE THE SCENT...IT DOES NOT LAST.  THE SCENT FADES AWAY VERY QUICKLY WHICH IS A SHAME BECAUSE IT SMELLS SO GOOD :(  STILL SEARCHING FOR A GREAT NEW SCENT TO WEAR.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is so soft and sensual...not too bold, but yet very alluring. I have had many people ask me what it is I have on...and when I tell them Twilight Woods from Bath and Body Works they seem surprised. It is a fairly inexpensive perfume compared to department store fragrances. It seems to be a bit bolder when it is layered with the other products such as the body wash and body lotion. It is a very popular item at Bath and Body Works because they are always out of it...they had been out of it everywhere for months. I found it through Amazon...that is why I love shopping through Amazon. I can always find what I am looking for, especially if whatever it is I am looking for is out of the stores...I can almost guarantee Amazon will have it. ;-)</li>
            <li> This perfume is amazing! it&#x27;s the exact same thing as the stuff off of the bath and body works website, but waaaay cheaper. It came in so fast, I didn&#x27;t have to wait more than three days after ordering. I was a little worried about buying it, but it&#x27;s sooo worth it!</li>
            <li> Okay, before you diss me about \\&quot;not liking the smell because it really smells good,\\&quot; think what I have to say first! I smelled this perfume in bath and body works and was IN LOVE with it, but it was $30 so I decided to get this in Amazon.com instead. But apparently, I got an email saying that \\&quot;the last bottle broke\\&quot;. I was so disappointed..</li>
            <li> This is a lovely new fragrance out by Bath and Body Works. It is perfect for a romantic day/night out with your man. I think this one smells best as the perfume, because after wearing the lotion for a while it seemed to me that the scent turned into a more flowery scent that reminded me of the body shops Neroli Jasmine scent. However, that wasnt a bad thing im just really into sensual, darker scents.&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people are buying this one, so it seems to be quite the hit for Bath and Body works.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite by Bath and Body works is still the Sensual Amber though. And the Japanese Cherry Blossum. So if your looking for other romantic scents, I highly suggest those. :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this perfume for several years. Receive lots of complements on it. Was skeptical coming from an outside site but was pleasantly surprised. Would recommend this shipper.</li>
            <li> So a college student was wearing this on my bus and I&#x27;m 49. I had to ask what it was because the smell was familiar but different. I guess that is where the other reviewer considered it mature yet young. I feel like the mature or familiar part somhow reminded me of white diamonds. The other part was woodsy and sensual. Anyhow, I will buy this soon.</li>
            <li> I love this scent since it came out. I get a lot of people stop and ask me what I perfume I have on. This whole line is awesome. ;-)</li>
            <li> Love this scent! Really nice!</li>
            <li> Love the aroma. Gave it to my daughter for Christmas and she also loves it! I will purchase again for myself.</li>
            <li> my girl use it occasionally, the bad thing was that is no compatible whit her PH but itâ€™s works fine at night</li>
            <li> My goodness, do I love the dark spiciness of this one!  I looked all around Mall of America for something like this and this was perfect! I would recommend wearing light amounts because a little goes a long way, and it lasts forever.  It&#x27;s been my favorite perfume for years.  It&#x27;s great for nights out.</li>
            <li> I am not able to wear lots of perfumes, I have a reaction to them. But I chose to try this because my Granddaughter uses it all the time, and I loved the smell. So deciced to try it on myself,&lt;br /&gt;and it is great. No reaction.</li>
            <li> I always used the flash for this scent because the eau de toilette was always too expensive in the Bath and Body Works store for me ($30 per bottle) but then I saw this on amazon and I was like I have to have this! It smells absolutely amazing with the advertised musky scent and the floral. However, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this during the summer because it&#x27;s a little on the heavy side of eau de toilette. For summer I use Gilly Hicks&#x27;s La Perouse or similar refreshing scent like Christian Dior&#x27;s Remember Me and then switch to this when Fall comes! This bottle lasts a long long time and the bottle is surprisingly VERY big for the price!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s a must-have! :)</li>
            <li> Last fairly long for an EDT, scent is great for night but a bit too musky/sweet for day. After I layered it with some citrus oil I liked it much better.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i was looking for!!</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t going to try this scent out. I had just seen Twilight (the film) a week prior to my first mall visit when this was released, and suddenly I see a perfume called Twilight Woods. \\&quot;Really?\\&quot; my mind said. \\&quot;Cashing in on the word \\&quot;twilight\\&quot; so it catches the eye of every 13 year old mall dweller that passes BBW?\\&quot; However, there was a lovely scent coming from the store; I was drawn in, and asked the saleswoman what the fragrance in the oil burner was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;This is our new scent, Twilight Woods,\\&quot; she told me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle of body mist without even spraying it on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect sexy-woodsy scent. Definitely lots of different types of earthy notes, balanced out by the soft florals. I would even classify it as unisex. On me this fragrance goes on and stays on. It doesn&#x27;t fade until I wash it off. It&#x27;s become my default fragrance; when I don&#x27;t know what to wear, I spritz this on, and I never regret it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice scent.  It does remind me of woods.  Most all the Bath &amp; Body fragrances are good.  The plus here is Amazon is a great place to find these at a good price.</li>
            <li> I love it! It smells exactly like the original at bath and body and the best part is that it&#x27;s cheaper. Also, it says on for a while. I put it on once in the morning and eventually I don&#x27;t smell it but I always have people commenting about the smell. Great product!</li>
            <li> I really really believe this is not a original perfume. i had this perfume few times in the past purchased directly from Bath &amp; Body and it smelled really strong for such a long time. this does not smell strong and the scent disappears super fast. yes it was cheap, but it still suxs !</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter for Christmas as this is her favorite perfume.  What a great deal!  Might be last season&#x27;s product design but it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I did not receive my purchase due to an error from the seller. I was trying to purchase this because someone had bought this fragrance for me last Christmas and I loved it. I would not purchase from this seller again.</li>
