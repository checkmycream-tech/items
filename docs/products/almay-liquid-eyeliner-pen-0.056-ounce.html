            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide a nice line.</li>

            <li>This is definitely one of the best liquid eyeliners I have ever gotten.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different kinds and this is the best.</li>
            <li>More like a marker.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>The fine point makes it very easy to do a smooth, neat line.  </li>
            <li>it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bought the brown liner and find it incredibly easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>I have searched for years and years for an easy way to apply eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the quality (brand new- in package) and it was shipped appropriately.</li>
            <li>This eyeliner goes on really smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>and it still works just fine.</li>
            <li>The felt pen glides gracefully when you draw a line on your palm side-up hand, BUT, and a huge</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
            <li>I first bought this product at a grocery store a couple of years ago on closeout mostly because of the low price - and ended up LOVING it!</li>
            <li>It dabs away cleanly if you make a mistake.  </li>
            <li>The eyeliner goes on smoothly and is very forgiving.  </li>
            <li>, I ordered some more for my adult daughter to try out.</li>
            <li>But worth it.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love this eye liner, though I confess:  I&#x27;ve used no other liquid liner pen.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>Love, love this eyeliner - have been searching for a long time for one that was easy to use, lasted a long time and stayed on for extended periods of time.  </li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li>I have to go over the eye lid (top) several times.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find it so cheap here, because I thought it was GONE.</li>
            <li>It smudges easily and stays on for barely 2 hours.</li>
            <li>The Almay eyeliner pen enables me to put on a line which is straight and looks correct, the first time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a simple and easy process.</li>
            <li>it is fast deliver.</li>
            <li>Thanks to this seller for having some of&lt;br /&gt;them.</li>
            <li>She really really really really likes this product.</li>
            <li>I like this eyeliner because it really does function like a felt tip pen.</li>
            <li>It also stays for a long time, doesn&#x27;t smear easy.</li>
            <li>It is not opaque the slightest bit, it is more of a light grey than black.</li>
            <li>She spoke so highly of it</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this to others -</li>
            <li>One was dried out but the other very good - thin nice line that can be thickened as desired and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It comes out sparsely and uneven on both top and bottom.  </li>
            <li>It took some time to get used to it, since I am fairly new to liquid eyeliners.</li>
            <li>It lasts plenty long enough and is easy to wash away at night.</li>
            <li>I kept trying it over and over because at first I thought it was me and not the actual product.  </li>
            <li>As my eyelashes were suddenly disappearing, I needed something to replace them, naturally and effortlessly.</li>
            <li>After looking all over the town where she lives, then later in my town clear across country, I looked it up online and bought several tubes of it for her.</li>

            <li> The black pen she has/had lasted her for 4-5 years of near daily use.</li>
            <li> No harsh dark line that ages you.</li>
            <li> Not a bad liquid eyeliner, although not a great one either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve this tube for 6 months, and with daily use, it&#x27;s just beginning to seem dry, though the tip hasn&#x27;t shown wear at all.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to handle and I like that the line it makes can be very thin.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is stiff and hard and it&#x27;s kind of hard to out on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Assuming they will disappear all together  before long.  </li>
            <li> not very pigmented or fluid.</li>
            <li> The only drawback I find is that as the day wears on the liner flakes off and you end up with black specks on your face.</li>
            <li> Not a smart marketing strategy.</li>
            <li> I bought this by mistake years ago, but then switched from the other eyeliner I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
            <li> While I have not been a fan of Almay, I will now consider this brand for other items based on the quality and reliability of this item.  </li>
            <li> I love liquid eyeliner, but HATE using the brush.</li>
            <li> It glides on just right and doesnt smudge like crazy.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the black color of this brand and style, and couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore.</li>
            <li> The line above and below eyes is subtle and looks a bit like kohl.  </li>
            <li> I wanted an eyeliner that was not as black brown as what I use.  </li>
            <li> I smudge the line a little before it dries, which gives me the look I want.</li>
            <li> It also burned my eyes a little bit/</li>
            <li> Though the cap is difficult to open, I suppose I&#x27;d rather it be too tight than loose and leaking.  </li>
            <li> This one was not easy to apply.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not looking for a 60&#x27;s style heavy line, just a subtle darkening on the lid</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s not too thick.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; was very hard and hurt my eye just applying it!</li>
            <li> l bought the wrong color.</li>
            <li> but I want an eyeliner and this Almay is amazingly HORRIBLE.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> it is fast deliver. it is easy to use. dont forget to choose the color. l bought the wrong color. lt is my fault the store is good,</li>
            <li> My favorite of all the eyeliners</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> Looks like a washable crayola marker when you put it on. The &amp;#34;brush&amp;#34; is stiff and hard and it&#x27;s kind of hard to out on.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tip&amp;#34; was very hard and hurt my eye just applying it! It is not opaque the slightest bit, it is more of a light grey than black. It smudges easily and stays on for barely 2 hours. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I can no longer find this liquid eyeliner in stores so I suppose Almay has discontinued it.&lt;br /&gt;I considered it too be the best eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used. Doesn&#x27;t run or fade. I bought 3 pens&lt;br /&gt;Assuming they will disappear all together  before long.  Thanks to this seller for having some of&lt;br /&gt;them.</li>
            <li> This product has been my mother-in-law&#x27;s FAVORITE EYELINER, but she was unable to find it in stores. After looking all over the town where she lives, then later in my town clear across country, I looked it up online and bought several tubes of it for her. She was so eased. She has enough of thi discontinued product to last her for years now. She spoke so highly of it, I ordered some more for my adult daughter to try out. Thanks, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I ordered 2. One was dried out but the other very good - thin nice line that can be thickened as desired and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice liner and the width of the line is perfect for me. The only drawback I find is that as the day wears on the liner flakes off and you end up with black specks on your face.</li>
            <li> Love this felt-tip liner. Goes on easily and doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive eyes. I smudge the line a little before it dries, which gives me the look I want.</li>
            <li> But worth it.  I bought this by mistake years ago, but then switched from the other eyeliner I&#x27;d been using.  Now this has been discontinued, so I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when it&#x27;s mo longer findable!</li>
            <li> I got just what I wanted and for a great price, too. I am very pleased with the quality (brand new- in package) and it was shipped appropriately.</li>
            <li> I Love this. I wish it came in more colors, if it did I would buy them all!!  Goes on smooth and stays on.</li>
            <li> Best pen liner I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> Very good product, recommended 100 %.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide a nice line. I have to go over the eye lid (top) several times. I have since stopped using it.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using the black color of this brand and style, and couldn&#x27;t find it in the store anymore. She really really really really likes this product. While getting her some on here, I saw there was a brown color also, and she said she&#x27;d like to try it. She has been using it quite a bit and likes it. The black pen she has/had lasted her for 4-5 years of near daily use. It lasts all day, and doesn&#x27;t need to be reapplied. She would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Not a bad liquid eyeliner, although not a great one either. It took some time to get used to it, since I am fairly new to liquid eyeliners. The two stars are given for the perceived attempt by the company to manipulate my feedback by offering a &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34; for a five-star rating. Not a smart marketing strategy.</li>
            <li> This would be the best eyeliner I ever used! It glides on just right and doesnt smudge like crazy. I make the perfect cat eye in one swipe instead of multiple applications. I love the fact that the eyeliner is hypoallergenic and doesnt bother my eyes it is allergy season after all lol. I got the eyeliner from grocery outlet for about $2.99 but if they runout off stock i&#x27;ll be sure to purchase it from amazon :)</li>
            <li> I forgot how long-lasting and accurate an eyeliner can be, until I tried this excellent liquid one from Almay.  While I have not been a fan of Almay, I will now consider this brand for other items based on the quality and reliability of this item.  I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely one of the best liquid eyeliners I have ever gotten. It goes on perfectly. It also stays for a long time, doesn&#x27;t smear easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Almay liquid eyeliner pen now for about a week.  The felt pen glides gracefully when you draw a line on your palm side-up hand, BUT, and a huge BUT it is exceedingly difficult to draw a line on top of your lid or for that matter bottom of eye lid.  It comes out sparsely and uneven on both top and bottom.  I kept trying it over and over because at first I thought it was me and not the actual product.  Now if you wanted to draw lines on your face, hands, wrists, etc. this is the pen for YOU but I want an eyeliner and this Almay is amazingly HORRIBLE. I don&#x27;t comprehend the five (5) stars for this gastly felt eyeline.  Perhaps I received a &#x27;lemon&#x27; in this product but I am reluctant to absorb that idea as a fact. If anyone out there agrees with me - please let me know.</li>
            <li> I bought the brown liner and find it incredibly easy to apply.  The line above and below eyes is subtle and looks a bit like kohl.  No harsh dark line that ages you.</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner, though I confess:  I&#x27;ve used no other liquid liner pen.  Though the cap is difficult to open, I suppose I&#x27;d rather it be too tight than loose and leaking.  The eyeliner goes on smoothly and is very forgiving.  It dabs away cleanly if you make a mistake.  The fine point makes it very easy to do a smooth, neat line.  It seems to last quite a while, as well.  I&#x27;ve this tube for 6 months, and with daily use, it&#x27;s just beginning to seem dry, though the tip hasn&#x27;t shown wear at all.  Definitely would get it again.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner goes on really smooth and easy to apply. I have tried many different kinds and this is the best. It also makes the best cat eye look by drawing as straight line. I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this eyeliner because it really does function like a felt tip pen. It&#x27;s easy to handle and I like that the line it makes can be very thin. Also the pigment liner itself is a good consistency - it&#x27;s not too thick. I&#x27;m not looking for a 60&#x27;s style heavy line, just a subtle darkening on the lid and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> Love, love this eyeliner - have been searching for a long time for one that was easy to use, lasted a long time and stayed on for extended periods of time.  This one is the best I have ever purchased.  Would highly recommend this to others - well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have searched for years and years for an easy way to apply eyeliner.  Now I&#x27;ve found it!  The Almay eyeliner pen enables me to put on a line which is straight and looks correct, the first time.  I can even do this in the car (at a stoplight, of course).  And it doesn&#x27;t stretch my eyelid like some eyeliner pencils or similar products. It&#x27;s just a simple and easy process. By the way, I&#x27;ve had my current pen for over 2 months and it still works just fine.</li>
            <li> not very pigmented or fluid. More like a marker.</li>
            <li> I wanted an eyeliner that was not as black brown as what I use.  This one was not easy to apply.  It did not adhere to my skin like the brank I am used too.  It also burned my eyes a little bit/</li>
            <li> Love it. Goof-proof for an otherwise no-makeup gal like me. As my eyelashes were suddenly disappearing, I needed something to replace them, naturally and effortlessly. This fits the bill. It&#x27;s not waterproof so it doesn&#x27;t last forever, but I like that. It lasts plenty long enough and is easy to wash away at night.</li>
            <li> I first bought this product at a grocery store a couple of years ago on closeout mostly because of the low price - and ended up LOVING it! I love liquid eyeliner, but HATE using the brush. This stuff goes on nicely, blends with powder eyeshadow nicely, and lasts all day. It lasted me WAY longer than I thought it would (I don&#x27;t use much, obviously). I was pleasantly surprised to find it so cheap here, because I thought it was GONE. I guess in two or three years I will have to find a substitute, but till then, I&#x27;m THRILLED!</li>
