    <ol>
            <li>They looked beautiful!  </li>
            <li>THE BARGAIN DRUG STORE BRANDS FOR $5 WORKS BETTER THAN THIS!!!!!!  </li>
            <li>This is the best Mascara that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I was impressed with the way it made my lashes longer and longer with each application!   </li>
            <li>This stuff is great</li>
            <li>this is a great mascara.</li>
            <li>how Great it that??</li>
            <li>great lash than I did with Fiberwig.</li>
            <li>This mascara is great because it atcually lengthens your lashes.</li>
            <li>This is a great mascara.</li>
            <li>Warm Water!  </li>
            <li>my lashes are not longer, thicker or more beautiful than when donned with a drug store brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that I did.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I love this mascara!  </li>
            <li>This product is phenomenal!</li>
            <li>The one nice thing is that it does come off with water and doesn&#x27;t flake</li>
            <li>It stays put, but you can wash it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>I liked the product, but after 2 days my eyes started to swell</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>So,right then and there I ordered the Fiberwig,and received it nicely packaged in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t real thrilled with it at first</li>
            <li>I am always on the look out for the best new thing when it comes to mascara.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice sophisticated look.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the best mascara out there!  </li>
            <li>It washes of easily and doesn&#x27;t come off until I take it off!</li>
            <li>Lash Perfection by MAX (waterproof) does a better job.  </li>
            <li>If you want to spend more money</li>
            <li>DIORSHOW WATERPROOF mascara is much better than Imju Fiberwig mascara.</li>
            <li>if i use another mascara on top of the Fiberwig, i get the look i want.</li>
            <li>and I ordered several at a time, it is the best I have ever used</li>
            <li>and I have been using mascara for many years.</li>
            <li>if you want more lashes just apply more, the more you apply the longer and thicker</li>
            <li>I have tried just about every lengthening mascara out there, and have paid top dollar.  </li>
            <li>While I have found some good ones (I like Diorshow and Fresh Supernova)</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT WAS OK..</li>
            <li>BUT I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT MORE OF A CHANCE AND DIDN&#x27;T</li>
            <li>but I have become to really LOVE it</li>
            <li>Now if only the Company that makes \\&quot;Fiberwig\\&quot; will make an eyeliner that will stay on till you take it off that would be great!</li>
            <li>i shelled out! :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy to report that even though the product contains actual fibers that you can see, it never smears or flakes</li>
            <li>Pretty good product but the fibers got in my eyes</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about \\&quot;raccoon\\&quot; eyes during the day and it makes my lashes long and beautiful!</li>
            <li>my husband, who is pretty oblivious to most things, noticed the difference in the appearance of my lashes and thought they looked nice.</li>
            <li>The good results were that my eyelashes never clumped together, you can build on it (the more you put on, the longer your lashes get) and I achieved nice, very long lashes.</li>
            <li>but, on the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily and doesn&#x27;t seem to clump a lot.</li>
            <li>She called me to tell me about how wonderful it was, and dosen&#x27;t give black rings around the eyes, stays on till you take it of with ....</li>
            <li>When I saw the reviews on this product I thought yea right!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a true fan of it.</li>
            <li>flakes and washes off so easily with warm water and my facial cleanser!  </li>
            <li>comes off pretty easy and does not run.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands of mascara and have never been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Could have gotten a better deal by a long shot and better product at Wal-Mart for one forth of the price.</li>
            <li>even after all the tears, my mascara still looked fresh.</li>
            <li>Thank you for such a good product that really does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li>worth the 20$</li>
            <li>And it washes off easily with my normal nightime face cleanser.</li>
            <li>Used it right away,and My daugher was right...</li>
            <li>The mascara slides off in pieces when I remove it with hot water.  </li>
            <li>Will know better next not to listen and belive guests at the Rachel Ray show!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I wear contacts and have somewhat sensitive eyes, however mascaras usually do not bother (tried many) and neither does powder or shimmer or anything like that.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use any other kind of mascara.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary: Good results, long lashes without the glue, but only if your eyes can handle it.</li>
            <li>, I really don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have really sparse eyelashes, so this really makes them stand out.  </li>
            <li>this product really does not impress me.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference if i just used the dior show on</li>
            <li>I get as much out of Cover Girl</li>
            <li>This mascara makes my lashes look so much fuller</li>
            <li>Although it lasts a long time, it is remarkably easy to remove.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like any other, but the more you apply, the thicker they get.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried just about all of the normal ones in the stores, but this beats them all!</li>
            <li>Also - I have very sensitive eyes - with contacts, and this mascara has never bothered me at all!</li>
            <li>This is a product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The Imju Fiberwig Mascara has too many little specks and NOT for people wearing contact lenses.</li>
            <li>The key to it that I have found is once you get one of the fibers to adhere to one of your own lashes, leave it alone until it dries and THEN go back and apply a second layer of color.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price, and really is like getting false eyelashes in a bottle, and love the look.     </li>
            <li>However, they look natural, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I have found that I don&#x27;t particularly like about</li>
            <li>I had really high hopes for this mascara after seeing it in multiple fashion &amp; beauty magazines.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t that much different than the Arbonne Lash Colour that I normally use.  </li>
            <li>I was thinking, this better be good for it is expensive for us poor working girls.  </li>
            <li>I am 49 and have little short light lashes.</li>
            <li>but you have to get a warm wash cloth and work at it, slowly remove black fibers with wash cloth.</li>
            <li>This product goes on very easily and made my lashes look very thick and long.  </li>
            <li>Its not quite as amazing as fake eyelashes, but it does look more natural and is way easier to put on than a fake set.   </li>
            <li>Faced Lash Injection as it has a heavier, more dramatic appearance.</li>
            <li>The only flaws I would say that this mascara has is that the shade of black could have been darker and I wish it would make my lashes look fuller as much as it makes them look longer.</li>

            <li> the only strange thing about this mascara is the way it comes off.</li>
            <li> AND I HOPE THAT SOME OTHER POOR HARD WORKING SINGLE MOTHER WHO DOESN&#x27;T MIND PAYING FOR A SO CALLED GOOD ITEM</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a strange stringy consistency when i remove it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, although I did find it to be expensive, plus the shipping makes it even more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I did wish it came in brown-black though, as it only comes in black.</li>
            <li> No rubbing, which means less wrinkles later on.</li>
            <li> also, if i don&#x27;t use a second mascara, little bits of the fibers tend to fall off.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about this mascara is that it never is in stock at my local Sephora retail outlet, so I need to order it online.</li>
            <li> I will try and find it elsewhere other than ordering it.</li>
            <li> I have even left it on for a few days adding a little or curling lashes.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that the brush did not often have thick areas on it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin very small eyes and no matter what, after a while, I would end up with black on my upper eye and bottom.    </li>
            <li> If you want dramatic looking eyes start early with layers and just keep adding.</li>
            <li> I like the look of false eyelashes (don&#x27;t really need them, but they are a fun night time look) and hate messing with the glue (makes my eyes water).  </li>
            <li> I wear it all day and never have that dark circle look from mascara!</li>
            <li> if they could get it to apply a little bit thinner i would give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> I wore it to a movie and got teary-eyed and did a little bit of crying</li>
            <li> I use this mascara everyday without worrying about flakes or raccoon eyes.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to take my lenses out after a few hours of wearing this.</li>
            <li> I wash my face as usual, but I just don&#x27;t rub my lashes when washing.  </li>
            <li> i usually have raccoon eyes by the time i get home from work, but this mascara stayed put!</li>
            <li> I use it as a second coat, after another mascara serves as a \\&quot;base coat.\\&quot;  The fibers attach to the coated lashes, creating a dramatic effect for my deep-set eyes.</li>
            <li> This product did nothing - very disappointing - expensive and certainly not worth it!  </li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!</li>
            <li> in addition, it&#x27;s very difficult to take off with eye make up remover.</li>
            <li> However this product bothered my eyes sooo badly, I had to take my contacts out</li>
            <li> i am somewhat disappointed with the mascara</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT</li>
            <li> VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Pretty good product but the fibers got in my eyes so I didn&#x27;t re-purchase.</li>
            <li> This mascara adds length without smudging, smearing or clumping. I wear contacts and Fiberwig has not caused any irritation or discomfort. Although it lasts a long time, it is remarkably easy to remove.  I use this mascara everyday without worrying about flakes or raccoon eyes. It gives a nice sophisticated look.  For evening, I like Too Faced Lash Injection as it has a heavier, more dramatic appearance.</li>
            <li> Someone is giving deceptive information about the Imju Fiberwig mascara.  I have tried everything on the market and this one can&#x27;t compare to the lowest price mascaras on the market!  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one.  The one nice thing is that it does come off with water and doesn&#x27;t flake but my lashes don&#x27;t look any fuller/thicker.  I have put multiple layers on and I still can&#x27;t get the look they claim!  Lash Perfection by MAX (waterproof) does a better job.  If you want to spend more money DIORSHOW WATERPROOF mascara is much better than Imju Fiberwig mascara.</li>
            <li> I had really high hopes for this mascara after seeing it in multiple fashion &amp; beauty magazines. I bought it and I used it 4 times in a week (I work at a beauty store). I wear contacts and have somewhat sensitive eyes, however mascaras usually do not bother (tried many) and neither does powder or shimmer or anything like that.  I like the look of false eyelashes (don&#x27;t really need them, but they are a fun night time look) and hate messing with the glue (makes my eyes water).  The good results were that my eyelashes never clumped together, you can build on it (the more you put on, the longer your lashes get) and I achieved nice, very long lashes. It stays put, but you can wash it off with warm water. However this product bothered my eyes sooo badly, I had to take my contacts out 2 out of the 4 times I wore it, and this has never happened with another mascara. My eyes were itchy, red and watery. I couldn&#x27;t wait to take my lenses out after a few hours of wearing this. I could have some allergy from something in it, I really don&#x27;t know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: Good results, long lashes without the glue, but only if your eyes can handle it.</li>
            <li> When I saw the reviews on this product I thought yea right!  But after using it I was wowed!  I can&#x27;t believe what a difference it made in my lashes.  I looked like I had falsies on!  They looked beautiful!  Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> i am somewhat disappointed with the mascara but, on the plus side, it doesn&#x27;t smudge easily and doesn&#x27;t seem to clump a lot. if i use another mascara on top of the Fiberwig, i get the look i want. also, if i don&#x27;t use a second mascara, little bits of the fibers tend to fall off. my husband, who is pretty oblivious to most things, noticed the difference in the appearance of my lashes and thought they looked nice.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I ordered the Imju Fiberwig mascara and I ordered several at a time, it is the best I have ever used and I have been using mascara for many years. I am 49 and have little short light lashes. This stuff is great if you want more lashes just apply more, the more you apply the longer and thicker they get. It doesn&#x27;t run or smudge I even swim with it on &amp; shower it does come off with water but you have to get a warm wash cloth and work at it, slowly remove black fibers with wash cloth. It looks like you are removing all your lashes. So no smudging while washing either. I use to spend a fortune on lash extensions now I don&#x27;t need too. If you want dramatic looking eyes start early with layers and just keep adding. I have even left it on for a few days adding a little or curling lashes. I wash my face as usual, but I just don&#x27;t rub my lashes when washing.  LOVE IT! Belinda</li>
            <li> this is a great mascara. i usually have raccoon eyes by the time i get home from work, but this mascara stayed put! i worked 10 hours and then went to a wake. even after all the tears, my mascara still looked fresh. the only strange thing about this mascara is the way it comes off. it&#x27;s a strange stringy consistency when i remove it. it&#x27;s unlike any mascara that i&#x27;ve ever used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i will definitely buy fiberwig again!</li>
            <li> I liked the product, but after 2 days my eyes started to swell so I had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I was thinking, this better be good for it is expensive for us poor working girls.  I heard about it on Rachel Ray&#x27;s show from Lara and she raved about it so, I had to try it.  It goes on like any other, but the more you apply, the thicker they get.  No clumps, NEVER flakes and washes off so easily with warm water and my facial cleanser!  I wear it all day and never have that dark circle look from mascara! I&#x27;ve tried just about all of the normal ones in the stores, but this beats them all!</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other kind of mascara. It washes of easily and doesn&#x27;t come off until I take it off!</li>
            <li> I have tried just about every lengthening mascara out there, and have paid top dollar.  While I have found some good ones (I like Diorshow and Fresh Supernova) none of them work as well as this one. I use it as a second coat, after another mascara serves as a \\&quot;base coat.\\&quot;  The fibers attach to the coated lashes, creating a dramatic effect for my deep-set eyes. This mascara doesn&#x27;t clump! I am a contact lens wearer and never am bothered by the mascara shedding flakes or fibers. The mascara slides off in pieces when I remove it with hot water.  My only complaint about this mascara is that it never is in stock at my local Sephora retail outlet, so I need to order it online.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WAS OK..BUT I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT MORE OF A CHANCE AND DIDN&#x27;T</li>
            <li> I love this mascara!  I have really sparse eyelashes, so this really makes them stand out.  However, they look natural, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting.  There&#x27;s no clumping whatsoever!  I would recommend this macara to anyone.  I did wish it came in brown-black though, as it only comes in black.</li>
            <li> save your money.  this product really does not impress me.  my lashes are not longer, thicker or more beautiful than when donned with a drug store brand.</li>
            <li> FALSE ADVERTISEMENT! VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!  THE BARGAIN DRUG STORE BRANDS FOR $5 WORKS BETTER THAN THIS!!!!!!  IT IS NOT MASCARA. IT DIDN&#x27;T DO ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT AND I HOPE THAT SOME OTHER POOR HARD WORKING SINGLE MOTHER WHO DOESN&#x27;T MIND PAYING FOR A SO CALLED GOOD ITEM DON&#x27;T GET RIPPED OFF LIKE I DID!   ABSOLUETLY DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this product, although I did find it to be expensive, plus the shipping makes it even more expensive.  I will try and find it elsewhere other than ordering it.</li>
            <li> Do not understand what the big deal was with this product. Could have gotten a better deal by a long shot and better product at Wal-Mart for one forth of the price. Will know better next not to listen and belive guests at the Rachel Ray show!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> this product didn&#x27;t deliver how i hoped.  i use it in combination with dior show and it didn&#x27;t make much of a difference if i just used the dior show on it&#x27;s own.  in addition, it&#x27;s very difficult to take off with eye make up remover. i&#x27;ll use the rest of the product, but i won&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t that much different than the Arbonne Lash Colour that I normally use.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received several compliments about the length of my lashes already!  The key to it that I have found is once you get one of the fibers to adhere to one of your own lashes, leave it alone until it dries and THEN go back and apply a second layer of color.  The only thing I have found that I don&#x27;t particularly like about it is that it isn&#x27;t waterproof.  I wore it to a movie and got teary-eyed and did a little bit of crying and it came off.  I haven&#x27;t tried applying any waterproof mascara over it yet to see how that works.  It takes some time and practice getting used to it.  I wasn&#x27;t real thrilled with it at first but I have become to really LOVE it and I will order it again!!</li>
            <li> This is the best Mascara that I have ever used.  I have always had a problem with \\&quot;racoon eyes\\&quot; when it comes to mascara,even the waterproof.     I have combination skin very small eyes and no matter what, after a while, I would end up with black on my upper eye and bottom.    My daughter went to NY this past summer for the first time to visit her friend. While there in NY she went to \\&quot;Sephora\\&quot;, and my dauther was telling the sales woman about the \\&quot;Mascara Problem\\&quot; that we both have.      The Sales woman recommended the \\&quot;Fiberwig\\&quot; product,and so my daugher bought it,and tried it for a week. She called me to tell me about how wonderful it was, and dosen&#x27;t give black rings around the eyes, stays on till you take it of with .... Get this.... Warm Water!  It rolls off, how Great it that??? It is!    So,right then and there I ordered the Fiberwig,and received it nicely packaged in a timely manner. Used it right away,and My daugher was right... It says on  all day till I take it off.  This is what I am going to only be using now. It is well worth the price, and really is like getting false eyelashes in a bottle, and love the look.     Thank you for such a good product that really does what it says it will do. Now if only the Company that makes \\&quot;Fiberwig\\&quot; will make an eyeliner that will stay on till you take it off that would be great!</li>
            <li> This product did nothing - very disappointing - expensive and certainly not worth it!  I get as much out of Cover Girl great lash than I did with Fiberwig.</li>
            <li> I am a mascara junky. I am always on the look out for the best new thing when it comes to mascara. This mascara is great because it atcually lengthens your lashes. After two swipes you have dramaticaly longer lashes. The only flaws I would say that this mascara has is that the shade of black could have been darker and I wish it would make my lashes look fuller as much as it makes them look longer. Sometimes I&#x27;ll layer it over another mascara to make them fuller and longer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best mascara out there!  I don&#x27;t have to worry about \\&quot;raccoon\\&quot; eyes during the day and it makes my lashes long and beautiful! Also - I have very sensitive eyes - with contacts, and this mascara has never bothered me at all!</li>
            <li> The Imju Fiberwig Mascara has too many little specks and NOT for people wearing contact lenses.</li>
            <li> This product goes on very easily and made my lashes look very thick and long.  I only apply one coat but more coats will make your eyes very dramatic.  I will buy this again when I run out.  A must have in your makeup bag!</li>
            <li> This is a great mascara. I was impressed with the way it made my lashes longer and longer with each application!   Its not quite as amazing as fake eyelashes, but it does look more natural and is way easier to put on than a fake set.   My only wish is that the brush did not often have thick areas on it. if they could get it to apply a little bit thinner i would give it 5 stars.  comes off pretty easy and does not run. worth the 20$ i shelled out! :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands of mascara and have never been satisfied.  After seeing a demonstration of Fiberwig Mascara from Sephora on the Today Show I decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;m very glad that I did. This mascara makes my lashes look so much fuller and I&#x27;m very happy to report that even though the product contains actual fibers that you can see, it never smears or flakes and it doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes. I wear contacts so some mascaras have caused problems.  This product is phenomenal! And it washes off easily with my normal nightime face cleanser. No rubbing, which means less wrinkles later on. This is a product that I would highly recommend. I&#x27;m a true fan of it.</li>
