            <li>Its the best. .I</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Perfect size for putting on lipstick or gloss from a pot or pallette.</li>
            <li>Perfect!  </li>
            <li>THis works great!  </li>
            <li>I can use my lip balm a couple of weeks longer, and am very happy about that :)!!!</li>
            <li>&amp; it&#x27;s great that it retracts</li>
            <li>and I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>Did not make me happy.</li>
            <li>Nice plus!</li>
            <li>Trying to dig out the remainder of a favorite lipstick and this is excellent!</li>
            <li>Good device and good brush</li>
            <li>good size for travel.</li>
            <li>Good shipping.</li>
            <li>What good is having an antibacterial brush if you have to wash the darn thing</li>
            <li>Good for pot</li>
            <li>I like the design of the retractable, and it goes on smooth, the brush is perfectly curved.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a nice lip brush...</li>
            <li>A lid would be nice, for purse.</li>
            <li>The nice quality brush ejects and retracts into the shaft very easily, and there is no cap to bother with.  </li>
            <li>The price is a bit high but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>You will love this lip brush.</li>
            <li>Someone said they didn&#x27;t like it because stuff got in the top from their purse.  </li>
            <li>Works ok tho.  </li>
            <li>Love this brush.</li>
            <li>Although the brush is retractable, there is nothing covering the opening that the brush retracts into, so although the brush is retracted, you will most defiantly get dirt and anything else inside of your purse stuck in there with the brush.</li>
            <li>Love it - -</li>
            <li>I put it in a carrying case in my purse and it stays very clean, no problem.  </li>
            <li>Love how compact and easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>This brush is really well made, the brush isn&#x27;t falling apart and best of all it is soft and supple.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy and convenient</li>
            <li>Makes application easy and retracts for convenient purse storage.</li>
            <li>Light weight and easy to retract.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing how much longer lip color lasts when you use a lip brush.</li>
            <li>I now own several so that I always have one handy when needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I received quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through several different lip brushes and I have to say, this one is much more attractive and durable than all the rest.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed!  </li>
            <li>Even though the end is open, it&#x27;s really nice to not have to fumble with a cap when you want to put your lipstick on.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft but stiff, perfect for lip looks.</li>
            <li>Like this very much.  </li>
            <li>I found this brush to be well made and very reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Was stiff at first but is great and soft now.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it isn&#x27;t really needed.</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast.  </li>
            <li>I really like this lip brush.</li>
            <li>I keep lipstick in a small case in my car for touch-ups and this slips nicely in beside the tube.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and wide, but not too wide, so that I use very little lipstick to get a nice layer on my lips.  </li>
            <li>I need to purchase a few more.</li>
            <li>I love the way that it retracts - just pull it open and push it closed.</li>
            <li>Love this little brush!</li>
            <li>The brush is indeed very soft and it applies lipstick evenly.</li>
            <li>Surprised it doesn&#x27;t it have a cap on it.</li>
            <li>When closed, will fit anywhere, even those tiny pockets they put in dress pants that will barely hold a lip balm.</li>
            <li>so there&#x27;s no mess.</li>
            <li>At first when I bought it the brush part was stiff, but as I keep brushing the stiffness went away.</li>

            <li> and it doesnt shed its bristles, which can get annoying when you have to pick a brush bristle off your lip.</li>

            <li> Just what I was looking for. I keep lipstick in a small case in my car for touch-ups and this slips nicely in beside the tube.  The lipstick case has a cover, so I actually like that the brush does not have a covering to deal with while driving.</li>
            <li> Its the best. .I like it. ..</li>
            <li> I bought this to get the remnants of my Sugar lip balm.  This brush is really well made, the brush isn&#x27;t falling apart and best of all it is soft and supple.  Light weight and easy to retract.  You will love this lip brush.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy and convenient</li>

            <li> This is a nice lip brush...good size for travel. It is amazing how much longer lip color lasts when you use a lip brush. Good shipping. I will order another to carry in my handbag.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through several different lip brushes and I have to say, this one is much more attractive and durable than all the rest. Makes application easy and retracts for convenient purse storage. Will buy again!</li>

            <li> Love this little brush! It&#x27;s so convenient to use &amp; it&#x27;s great that it retracts so there&#x27;s no mess. The brush is soft but stiff, perfect for lip looks.</li>
            <li> The bristles are a little stiff. Am used to the Revlon brush. Works ok tho.  Surprised it doesn&#x27;t it have a cap on it. Maybe it isn&#x27;t really needed.</li>
            <li> Works well and can&#x27;t beat the price. Love how compact and easy it is to use.  Delivery was fast.  Will be purchasing another one soon.</li>
            <li> Was stiff at first but is great and soft now.  I received quickly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this lip brush. Everytime I will use it, the brush always goes down in the tube. This lip brush should have something to hold the brush to prevent from sliding down the tube while using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this lip brush. I dont put it in my purse, just keep it home as it retracts but doesnt  have a cap. It&#x27;s just what I wanted though and it doesnt shed its bristles, which can get annoying when you have to pick a brush bristle off your lip. Will definitely purchase again when I need a replacement.</li>
            <li> Love this brush. I need to purchase a few more. I&#x27;m glad I found exactly what I needed. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. The price is a bit high but it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this retractable lip brush and was excited to finally find a brush with antibacterial properties, however I was quickly disappointed when I received the brush. Although the brush is retractable, there is nothing covering the opening that the brush retracts into, so although the brush is retracted, you will most defiantly get dirt and anything else inside of your purse stuck in there with the brush. What good is having an antibacterial brush if you have to wash the darn thing everytime you use it...bad design...this gets one star for effort.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have owned a lot of lip brushes, and this is one beats the others. The nice quality brush ejects and retracts into the shaft very easily, and there is no cap to bother with.  I would say this brush is a bargain and I am quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I found this brush to be well made and very reasonably priced.  I now own several so that I always have one handy when needed.</li>
            <li> A lid would be nice, for purse. Works well,just what you need. Good for pot glosses.thank you J.happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love it - - I like the design of the retractable, and it goes on smooth, the brush is perfectly curved. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I needed!  Trying to dig out the remainder of a favorite lipstick and this is excellent!</li>
            <li> Not very impressed but it&#x27;s serving a purpose.  Still in search for another brush. It was packaged like it came from a Walgreens.  Did not make me happy. I could have went to the store myself</li>
            <li> THis works great!  I love that it retracts so the tip doesn&#x27;t get dirty.  The lip balm I like to get is $30, and I hated that I couldn&#x27;t get to the part that gets left inside the bottom of the stick!!  I can use my lip balm a couple of weeks longer, and am very happy about that :)!!!</li>
