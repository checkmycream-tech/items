            <li>IT WAS WONDERFUL FOR HIM.&lt;br /&gt;HIS</li>
            <li>very good for working hands</li>
            <li>The socks aren&#x27;t an ideal solution, in part because they can fall off and also he doesn&#x27;t like the feeling of his moist fingers rubbing together.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase,</li>
            <li>Great Can&#x27;t find anywhere else</li>
            <li>Great price and well made.</li>
            <li>very nicely manufactured, good quality.</li>
            <li>These gloves are as listed, have been great for applying lotion or moisturizer to my hands at night, they fit great!</li>
            <li>I especially liked the product I received, which was Diane cotton gloves, which I liked better than the Cara ones I had used before.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>They fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>these fit great!  </li>
            <li>He is very pleased with these gloves.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with these gloves.</li>
            <li>they are nice.</li>
            <li>i wear them to keep my hands warm while reading or watching television.</li>
            <li>very cheap material.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be buying more of these.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying more than one pair.</li>
            <li>I slather my hand with Eucerin cream and put the glove on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I plan to order more of these.</li>
            <li>The top of the glove did not come close to touching my skin.</li>
            <li>If I had to repurchase, I would spend up to $1.00 for these; nothing more.</li>
            <li>look when marching or handling precious collections.</li>
            <li>That being said, I am pleased with these gloves.</li>
            <li>I will be able to reuse mine over and over at night.</li>
            <li>make sure it&#x27;s oily hand cream.  </li>
            <li>This misses a lot of the reapplication which is most helpful, but if you reapply to you hands anytime you get up at night, you&#x27;ll get there.  </li>
            <li>And, lastly, the best way to treat your hands is to do the 12x/day applications AND wear the gloves all day; this is the gold treatment and most intensive way to repair your hands and go about your at-home, in-home activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they will stretch a bit, but dragging them on rubs off the oil from the fingertips around the fingernails, where I need the most help.  </li>
            <li>The fit is great and they wash easily and look good as new.</li>
            <li>Fabric is substantial and item arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>I should have gotten a large but I&#x27;m still very pleased with these gloves.</li>
            <li>My wife said she would sew some elastic thread into the cuffs after they&#x27;ve been washed, so we think they&#x27;ll work fine.</li>
            <li>These work well and fit my hands fine.</li>
            <li>They are stretch gloves which supposedly fit all sizes.</li>
            <li>They just barely fit on my hands.</li>
            <li>the &amp;#34;one size fits most&amp;#34; will fit him well.</li>
            <li>I wish they made them in a size to fit a man.  </li>
            <li>Work great with my medical requirements.</li>
            <li>I bought these to keep my hands moisturized while sleeping,however I find them so comfortable and toasty</li>
            <li>Comes in original box.</li>
            <li>Good cotton gloves - could be a little bit larger for the XL size, but a very good thickness and quality material..</li>
            <li>and now you have a good chance of equally that 12x/day regimen.</li>
            <li>Remember folks, SOFT and strong hands are the most preferred for massage, too.</li>
            <li>They seem to be high quality (much better than the ones I saw in drug stores).</li>
            <li>These gloves are well worth it.</li>
            <li>The work good, the size is great; a bit &#x27;big&#x27;, but the fingers are long enough that I don&#x27;t feel</li>
            <li>AND IT CLEARED HIS FINGERS RIGHT UP.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have very large hands at all....</li>
            <li>fit is better than any other one I have bought.</li>
            <li>The Cara Cotton Gloves are exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Affordable and exactly what I needed to help keep my hands moisturized overnight.</li>
            <li>next time I&#x27;ll do a better job shopping around.</li>
            <li>The picture associated with these gloves are a far cry from how the gloves actually fit.</li>
            <li>i would order more, but larger than rated.&lt;br /&gt;nice</li>
            <li>The gloves fit as if I put the left glove on my right hand and vice-versa.</li>
            <li>To the first point; I start treating my hands better starting in the Fall - by October in New England.  </li>
            <li>The packages stated that the gloves were large in size.  </li>
            <li>One caveat, the XL feels like a large.</li>
            <li>I wear between medium and large gloves (I work at a hospital) and needed these to help with hand healing cream.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fitting is ok, but loose at the edge</li>
            <li>Now with the combination of the scrip and gloves his hands heal much faster.</li>
            <li>If there was any shrinkage it wasn&#x27;t significant enough to even notice.  </li>
            <li>If it is NOT oil hand cream (Nivea original, or similar), you are just hamstringing you efforts from the start.  </li>
            <li>Kind of freaks out my office mates when I put these on, but they provide enough dexterity to use my keyboard after applying large amounts of udder cream for my dry hands.</li>
            <li>They stretch and are soft and comfortable but a bit short for a man&#x27;s hand.</li>
            <li>These advertised that they were suitable for men as well, however they are almost too small for my lady hands.</li>
            <li>I have large hands and needed the extra large size.  </li>
            <li>Bought these for a 6&#x27;3 Hockey Goalie to wear inside his normal gloves - package that arrives clearly states \\&quot;one size fits most\\&quot;, not XL.  </li>
            <li>Treat your hands at night, while they are usually not doing anything, and cover them with these gloves</li>
            <li>My right hand became extremely dry and cracked after an injury</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for large gloves for moisturizing while I sleep, as opposed to the smaller ones that I can find everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>These gloves are not extra large.</li>
            <li>The extra large are not very extra large.</li>
            <li>tight fitting, thin, but stitching is better than others.  </li>
            <li>These are soft, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider these extra large.  </li>
            <li>My hands was soft after two nights.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They were marked as a Men&#x27;s XL, which they were not.</li>
            <li>Further, it is a barrier to contact irritants which get the whole histamine response going causing swelling and itching and redness.</li>
            <li>Mine are exactly what I expected them to be.</li>
            <li>nice quality thick enough&lt;br /&gt;Husbands hands very dry and crack A and D and gloves did trick</li>
            <li>The extra large is a bit large for me although probably tight for someone with real big hands.</li>
            <li>up and do not dry in dryer</li>
            <li>For folks who&#x27;s skin on fingers and hands chaps and cracks in the dry, winter months or by too frequent hand washing or occupational exposures.</li>

            <li> As expected not a great fit, the thumb and pinky finger are cut the same</li>
            <li> I keep them on as long as possible thru the night.</li>
            <li> I have very long slim hands, so these were larger than I anticipated, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I machine washed the glove and then stretched it back into shape and lay it flat to dry.</li>
            <li> Over the counter large size in local drug stores are a bit too small for average man sized hands.</li>
            <li> The gloves were cheap and I recognize that the quality will match the price, but these gloves still failed to meet my lowered expectations.</li>
            <li> Stretched out after a single use.</li>
            <li> The seller has other listings which offer specific sizes for the gloves.  </li>
            <li> I needed them to assist in healing dry, cracked finger tips.</li>
            <li> I had lost hope in my dry hands and peeling skin around the cuticles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the more expensive gloves.</li>
            <li> The gloves were far to small.  </li>
            <li> As others have said, the gloves are loose at the wrist.</li>
            <li> While I was weary of this product due to other reviews, I figured my husbands hands aren&#x27;t too big and</li>
            <li> so it is less likely to crack.  </li>
            <li> Packaging size &amp;#34;one size fits most.&amp;#34; They are uncomfortably tight and short on my hands.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for gloves which wouldn&#x27;t be so tight and so short in length, so they wouldn&#x27;t wipe off all the cream on my hands when I put these on at night time.  </li>
            <li> As a medium sized hand guy, these were tight in the fingers and short on the palm.  </li>
            <li> I ordered XL and these were just a little too big, but that works well because sometimes my hands are swollen.  </li>
            <li> not quite what I expected but works for what I need them for</li>
            <li> Very loose at the age.&lt;br /&gt;always</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get them on my hands, and my hands are not large.  </li>
            <li> Looking at the other cotton gloves that come by 8, 10, 12 pairs</li>
            <li> They also have not gotten &amp;#34;soggy&amp;#34; like some of the other gloves that I have worn.</li>
            <li> Regular cotton gloves that you get at the store are too small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d go XL for the average guy&#x27;s hands.  </li>
            <li> Prescriptions had done very little relieve the pain from dry, cracked, peeling fingers.</li>
            <li> these gloves are about a half inch short on my fingers and at least an inch to 2 inches from my wrist.</li>
            <li> 1 * less for sizing.</li>
            <li> There are three treatment points I have to stress - 1) start before the dry season, if it&#x27;s seasonal 2) apply at least 12 times a day and 3)</li>
            <li> A little small for XL that is why I give them 4 of 5 stars, but other thent that, they did the trick!</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hands become so cracked in the winter that he sleeps with heavy cream on them and wears socks on his hands to bed.</li>
            <li> They do not fit well</li>
            <li> Oil reduces moisture loss from skin and softens outer, dead layers of skin</li>
            <li> If you have small hands</li>
            <li> Gloves are way to small for his hands.  </li>
            <li> The material is thin and not very absorbent.</li>
            <li> Gloves are very thin; do not expect for them to last  </li>
            <li> if by &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; they mean CHILDREN, then they are probably correct.  </li>
            <li> Gloves are very small not XL as described.</li>
            <li> They run small and are poorly cut (in terms of finger length), but they do the job.</li>
            <li> When they arrived, the gloves were very small.</li>
            <li> no good..</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son who has a bad problem with dry and cracked hands.  </li>
            <li> As the title says this is a Rip-Off!</li>
            <li> disappointing.</li>
            <li> All this &#x27;penetrates&#x27; description in hand cream advertising is crap.  </li>

            <li> I recently bought cotton gloves at two different pharmacies.  The packages stated that the gloves were large in size.  I couldn&#x27;t get them on my hands, and my hands are not large.  The Cara Cotton Gloves are exactly what I wanted. They fit perfectly. The order arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Affordable and exactly what I needed to help keep my hands moisturized overnight. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the more expensive gloves. This does the trick niceky</li>
            <li> yes they&#x27;re good, but that price is for ONE PAIR!!  yikes.  next time I&#x27;ll do a better job shopping around.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as the gel gloves.</li>
            <li> The work good, the size is great; a bit &#x27;big&#x27;, but the fingers are long enough that I don&#x27;t feel restricted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a medium hand, but I guess and XL length finger. ?!? Who does the sizing anyway?</li>
            <li> As expected not a great fit, the thumb and pinky finger are cut the same</li>
            <li> very nicely manufactured, good quality.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Can&#x27;t find this size in cvs Walgreens etc</li>
            <li> If you have small hands you&#x27;ll like these gloves. But they&#x27;re not Cara Cotton Gloves and they&#x27;re not XL. Amazon shouldn&#x27;t allow this mis-labeling.</li>
            <li> Looking at the other cotton gloves that come by 8, 10, 12 pairs I assumed these were the same.  THIS PRICE IS FOR ONE PAIR OF CHINESE MADE GLOVES.  The gloves are well made but not THAT well made to command $5.55 a pair!  As the title says this is a Rip-Off!</li>
            <li> These gloves are marketed as XL.  They are not.  They are stretch gloves which supposedly fit all sizes. They just barely fit on my hands.</li>
            <li> Gloves are very small not XL as described. Packaging size &amp;#34;one size fits most.&amp;#34; They are uncomfortably tight and short on my hands. They were bought for my husband.</li>
            <li> These gloves are as listed, have been great for applying lotion or moisturizer to my hands at night, they fit great! Awesome..</li>
            <li> I especially liked the product I received, which was Diane cotton gloves, which I liked better than the Cara ones I had used before.&lt;br /&gt;Good price.</li>
            <li> They run small and are poorly cut (in terms of finger length), but they do the job. This XL fits my L sized hand.  Buy 1-2 sizes bigger than what you need.</li>
            <li> These are soft, but I wouldn&#x27;t consider these extra large.  I was hoping for gloves which wouldn&#x27;t be so tight and so short in length, so they wouldn&#x27;t wipe off all the cream on my hands when I put these on at night time.  I won&#x27;t be buying more of these.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying more than one pair. I like them they are nice.</li>
            <li> Kind of freaks out my office mates when I put these on, but they provide enough dexterity to use my keyboard after applying large amounts of udder cream for my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I ordered XL and these were just a little too big, but that works well because sometimes my hands are swollen.  These are just what I was looking for. My right hand became extremely dry and cracked after an injury and I was looking for white cotton gloves to wear at night.  I slather my hand with Eucerin cream and put the glove on top of it.  The glove protects the sheets and bed clothes and allows my hand to soak up the cream.  I machine washed the glove and then stretched it back into shape and lay it flat to dry. If there was any shrinkage it wasn&#x27;t significant enough to even notice.  I plan to order more of these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for large gloves for moisturizing while I sleep, as opposed to the smaller ones that I can find everywhere else.  I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase, these fit great!  They also have not gotten &amp;#34;soggy&amp;#34; like some of the other gloves that I have worn.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my husband who has eczema on his hands. Regular cotton gloves that you get at the store are too small. Prescriptions had done very little relieve the pain from dry, cracked, peeling fingers. Now with the combination of the scrip and gloves his hands heal much faster.</li>
            <li> While I was weary of this product due to other reviews, I figured my husbands hands aren&#x27;t too big and the &amp;#34;one size fits most&amp;#34; will fit him well. When they arrived, the gloves were very small.</li>
            <li> One size fits &amp;#34;most&amp;#34;....if by &amp;#34;most&amp;#34; they mean CHILDREN, then they are probably correct.  I couldn&#x27;t even get these things on my hand....and I don&#x27;t have very large hands at all....</li>
            <li> Great Can&#x27;t find anywhere else</li>
            <li> Too small&lt;br /&gt;Order up and do not dry in dryer&lt;br /&gt;Very nice quality thick enough&lt;br /&gt;Husbands hands very dry and crack A and D and gloves did trick</li>
            <li> Bought these for a 6&#x27;3 Hockey Goalie to wear inside his normal gloves - package that arrives clearly states \\&quot;one size fits most\\&quot;, not XL.  Gloves are way to small for his hands.  disappointing.</li>
            <li> very good for working hands</li>
            <li> The size offered by the seller was XL.  I have large hands and needed the extra large size.  When the product arrived, the package listed the size as &amp;#34;one size fits most,&amp;#34; which is not what I ordered.  The gloves were far to small.  I called the seller and got a recording.  I left a message, but the seller has yet to return my call.  The seller has other listings which offer specific sizes for the gloves.  If you order a specific size, be prepared to get the &amp;#34;one size fits most&amp;#34; gloves.</li>
            <li> not quite what I expected but works for what I need them for</li>
            <li> finally fits a man&#x27;s hand and holds the medication against the skin</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s hands become so cracked in the winter that he sleeps with heavy cream on them and wears socks on his hands to bed. The socks aren&#x27;t an ideal solution, in part because they can fall off and also he doesn&#x27;t like the feeling of his moist fingers rubbing together. These work perfectly for him. They stay on all night and keep his fingers separated. He is very pleased with these gloves.</li>
            <li> The gloves were cheap and I recognize that the quality will match the price, but these gloves still failed to meet my lowered expectations. The gloves fit as if I put the left glove on my right hand and vice-versa. When I switch gloves, the problem still persisted. The top of the glove did not come close to touching my skin. The picture associated with these gloves are a far cry from how the gloves actually fit. If I had to repurchase, I would spend up to $1.00 for these; nothing more.</li>
            <li> As ordered. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Lather on your stuff and wear these, and even the over washed parents&#x27; hands will heal. One caveat, the XL feels like a large.</li>
            <li> A little small for XL that is why I give them 4 of 5 stars, but other thent that, they did the trick! My hands were very chapped and just one night with a heavy ointment and these gloves and my hands are already looking better!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Stretched out after a single use.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with these gloves. They seem to be high quality (much better than the ones I saw in drug stores). I needed them to assist in healing dry, cracked finger tips. Used in conjunction with Lotil cream, I think these may do the trick.</li>
            <li> tight fitting, thin, but stitching is better than others.  i would order more, but larger than rated.&lt;br /&gt;nice look when marching or handling precious collections.</li>
            <li> As others have said, the gloves are loose at the wrist. My wife said she would sew some elastic thread into the cuffs after they&#x27;ve been washed, so we think they&#x27;ll work fine.</li>
            <li> Over the counter large size in local drug stores are a bit too small for average man sized hands. None had any larger. I recommend the XL size. These work well and fit my hands fine.</li>
            <li> Great price and well made. XL is like a Medium size. They stretch and are soft and comfortable but a bit short for a man&#x27;s hand. That being said, I am pleased with these gloves. Fabric is substantial and item arrived very quickly. Comes in original box. 1 * less for sizing.</li>
            <li> I had lost hope in my dry hands and peeling skin around the cuticles. I put on Neosporin or Aquaphor Healing Ointment an put on gloves and go to sleep. I keep them on as long as possible thru the night. They work!</li>
            <li> Good cotton gloves - could be a little bit larger for the XL size, but a very good thickness and quality material..</li>
            <li> These gloves are not extra large. I had to return them. I wear between medium and large gloves (I work at a hospital) and needed these to help with hand healing cream. I&#x27;ll be using cotton socks instead I guess.</li>
            <li> I used these at bedtime with lotion. My hands was soft after two nights.</li>
            <li> fit is better than any other one I have bought. Thank you</li>
            <li> I bought these for my son who has a bad problem with dry and cracked hands.  He is using them and they may be doing the trick - he wears them at night and lotions up his hands.  I wish they made them in a size to fit a man.  But they are working.</li>
            <li> very cheap material. Very loose at the age.&lt;br /&gt;always hangs out.. no good..&lt;br /&gt;Fitting is ok, but loose at the edge</li>
            <li> these gloves are about a half inch short on my fingers and at least an inch to 2 inches from my wrist. They do not fit well</li>
            <li> I got these gloves for my husband to be to wear at night to hydrate his hands. These advertised that they were suitable for men as well, however they are almost too small for my lady hands.</li>
            <li> These gloves are well worth it. Mine are exactly what I expected them to be. I will be able to reuse mine over and over at night. I sleep with mine on. The extra large is a bit large for me although probably tight for someone with real big hands. I should have gotten a large but I&#x27;m still very pleased with these gloves.</li>
            <li> Work great with my medical requirements. The fit is great and they wash easily and look good as new. Thank you for this item.</li>
            <li> The extra large are not very extra large. The material is thin and not very absorbent. If you have big hands you may want to stay away.</li>
            <li> Gloves are very thin; do not expect for them to last  long.&lt;br /&gt;They were marked as a Men&#x27;s XL, which they were not.</li>
            <li> I bought these to keep my hands moisturized while sleeping,however I find them so comfortable and toasty i wear them to keep my hands warm while reading or watching television. I have very long slim hands, so these were larger than I anticipated, but I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I SENT THESE TO MY SON, HE HAD CRACKED FINGER TIPS, HE USED THEM AT BED TIME WITH THE CREAM THAT I ORDERED AND IT CLEARED HIS FINGERS RIGHT UP. IT WAS WONDERFUL FOR HIM.&lt;br /&gt;HIS FINGERS ACTUALLY HURT HIM.</li>
            <li> For folks who&#x27;s skin on fingers and hands chaps and cracks in the dry, winter months or by too frequent hand washing or occupational exposures. There are three treatment points I have to stress - 1) start before the dry season, if it&#x27;s seasonal 2) apply at least 12 times a day and 3) make sure it&#x27;s oily hand cream.  Dealing with these in reverse order.  If it is NOT oil hand cream (Nivea original, or similar), you are just hamstringing you efforts from the start.  You can use vegetable oil or baby oil or mineral oil (unscented baby oil) or Crisco or whatever.  The test of this being an oil-base or a water-base cream is to slather your hands liberally with it and then, after 5 minutes, try to turn a door knob.  If you can&#x27;t - that&#x27;s an oil!  Do not use anything else.  You only rehydrate you skin from within, from the living layers; you only repair the chap and cracks from within, from the living layers.  All this &#x27;penetrates&#x27; description in hand cream advertising is crap.  What do hands submerged in washwater all day look like - prunes.  That&#x27;s not &#x27;hydration&#x27;.  Oil reduces moisture loss from skin and softens outer, dead layers of skin so it is less likely to crack.  The skin &#x27;rehydrates&#x27; from within.  Further, it is a barrier to contact irritants which get the whole histamine response going causing swelling and itching and redness. Back to point #2.  Yeah, you don&#x27;t like the feel of the oil on your hands and you KNOW you cannot get this on your hands 12 times a day and actually DO something.  I confess, I made up that number 12; I cannot do that 12x/day either.  SO, here&#x27;s where the gloves come into play.  Treat your hands at night, while they are usually not doing anything, and cover them with these gloves and now you have a good chance of equally that 12x/day regimen. This misses a lot of the reapplication which is most helpful, but if you reapply to you hands anytime you get up at night, you&#x27;ll get there.  The gloves keep the hand oil on your hands and not rubbing off on the sheets (AND you can still turn doorknobs in emergency exit events!).  Yeah, initially, they&#x27;ll be sucking up some of the hand oils, but do not wash them, and eventually they will be saturated enough so they not longer pull oil off your hands. To the first point; I start treating my hands better starting in the Fall - by October in New England.  It&#x27;s easier to prevent the chapping and cracking than to repair it. So, stay ahead of the problem.  And, lastly, the best way to treat your hands is to do the 12x/day applications AND wear the gloves all day; this is the gold treatment and most intensive way to repair your hands and go about your at-home, in-home activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  The only details I need with these items are the product code or glove sizing that Cara prints on their product packaging.  I bought \\&quot;Code No. 86\\&quot; (also the last numbers on the UPC) which are \\&quot;L 8 1/2 - 9 1/2\\&quot; size.  I have not seen &#x27;mens&#x27; or &#x27;womens&#x27; description on packaging.  As a medium sized hand guy, these were tight in the fingers and short on the palm.  Not a big deal and they will stretch a bit, but dragging them on rubs off the oil from the fingertips around the fingernails, where I need the most help.  I&#x27;d go XL for the average guy&#x27;s hands.  Remember folks, SOFT and strong hands are the most preferred for massage, too.</li>
