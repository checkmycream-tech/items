            <li>Overall wonderful product.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>I am at a point in my life now where I&#x27;m able to afford having it as my acne butt kicker.</li>
            <li>I had thought about purchasing it, but after reading some reviews, thought better of it.</li>
            <li>Sincerely,  Mz.</li>
            <li>He enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product before and it was okay,</li>
            <li>I know people this has worked great for so, it really depends on your skin type.</li>
            <li>this product is ok</li>
            <li>Make sure you use it either once or twice a day.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It was not a satisfactory solution  but it was the most expedient</li>
            <li>I love proactiv</li>
            <li>It caused more problems than they had before.  </li>
            <li>BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 15 OR MORE YEARS NOW.</li>
            <li>I need to order more.</li>
            <li>its cool and amazing.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty decent complexion, but I wanted the flawless look that the commercials promise.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin type these products keep the oil to a minimum due to these good results I am happy I purchased these products.</li>
            <li>Yeah, they did offer a 60 day money back full refund, which would be great if you COULD READ THE RECEIPT!  </li>
            <li>she&#x60;s been using it 2 times a day wow great skin</li>
            <li>, i&#x27;m very glad I found out about what&#x27;s in it and stopped using it because I am a very pissed off consumer...</li>
            <li>Proactiv is the best acne care product hands down.</li>
            <li>This proactive thing is all brand new,  looks good</li>
            <li>I read the fine print and noticed it</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyione trying to clear up light to severe acne as it has worked for me from day one and it also works for both of my sisters (one has very fair skin and one is darkly tanned, it works great on both) and my mom (who has skin like mine).</li>
            <li>I also had huge, visible pores on my cheeks and Proactiv did help minimize those as well.</li>
            <li>So I got it for free.</li>
            <li>Plus the price fits my budget very well!!!</li>
            <li>It worked really great as long as she used it as recommended.  </li>
            <li>so I made sure I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>unique order placement for a trial.</li>
            <li>also tried using the refining mask as spot treatment as many other people recommended that to be the most effective way to use the system.</li>
            <li>During the day I would use their super light moisturizer and did the mask 3 times each week (putting it on all over my face and letting it set for 20 minutes before rinsing).</li>
            <li>and they talked about how it works on every kind of skin and that it will completely get rid of blemishes and pimples.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice she had larger pores - but she&#x27;s happy with the results and wants to re-order when this runs out.</li>
            <li>It does a quick fade, f.y.i.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy some more in the future</li>
            <li>First, the shipping wasnt very fast, and then when it did arive, it was packaged from Proactiv along with a welcome letter letting me know Id be receiving regular shipments now.  </li>
            <li>I ordered my daughter this product for that very reason, and also because she doesnt run our of proactiv very quick.</li>
            <li>This skin-care product isn&#x27;t any more effective than any of the ones you can buy in the drugstore - like Neutrogena, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear, or any other benzoyl peroxide-based solution, and they will hound you with junk mail for the rest of your life.</li>
            <li>Drink lots of water , eat right and exercise all helps as well.</li>
            <li>Go figure though, right?</li>
            <li>Am I right, or am I right?    </li>
            <li>Proactiv literally vanished all my pimples and very much improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>excelente very fast, me llego hasta panama.</li>
            <li>I typically only have one or two spots here and there, and it&#x27;s mostly hormones causing those once a month.</li>
            <li>If you have a friend who has this product I would try theirs first to see if it works for you before investing.ou have to call their customer service line.</li>
            <li>If you have a friend who has this product I would try theirs first to see if it works for you before investing.</li>
            <li>so I was aware the sizing was listed as 2 oz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  </li>
            <li>The facial wash does help prevent most breakouts.</li>
            <li>the bottles are very smell!.</li>
            <li>Thanks Biore for making this product!</li>
            <li>After a month or two, maybe more, I began to notice the acne coming back.</li>
            <li>next time I&#x27;ll know better.</li>
            <li>That will be better, won&#x27;t it?\\&quot;    Stick with products from your local drugstore, that understand how to treat customers.</li>
            <li>However, they still sent me the 90-day supply package and charged $33 dollars for the first month.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It was much smaller all most like a travel sizes.</li>
            <li>After a good long while of having clear skin, I thought maybe my face was &#x27;cured&#x27; and I could stop using it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the seller - super fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>If you order directly from Proactiv or any suppliers make sure you are very clear about what you are buying and keep records of all transactions and conversations.</li>
            <li>I called at 7pm and got a live person rather quick</li>
            <li>I called at 7pm and got a live person rather quick</li>
            <li>I have only been using the proactiv kit for two weeks so far the results are amazing</li>
            <li>I cant use this crap so I for sure dont want to pay for any more of it!!!!</li>
            <li>I saw positive results within one week.  </li>
            <li>I only had two problems with this set; the lids on the bottles tend to break easily</li>
            <li>The solution must just have been too strong for my skin, because my skin became all red and irritated after using it, breaking out across my forehead and around my chin area.</li>
            <li>No other acne product gets my skin as clean as this.</li>
            <li>has greatly reduced the black and white heads on their forehead, nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li>This stuff keeps my face nice and dry (because I have an oily face) and my skin was clear in a week of using this stuff every night.</li>
            <li>It was is a huge money for anyone, and especially for unemployed college graduate...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not so much the product but the process that really puts the work in.</li>
            <li>So try this product it works very well.</li>
            <li>I used it for a week straight</li>
            <li>and i really don&#x27;t see much improvement at all.</li>
            <li>google \\&quot;Proactiv/e unauthorized charges\\&quot; and you will see that this is a modern SCAM across the nation.</li>
            <li>It came straight to my house.</li>
            <li>I ordered it either over the phone or online from the website, I don&#x27;t really recall.</li>
            <li>I am fortunate that we only bought 1 and were NOT set up on an automatic system for re-order.</li>
            <li>She said they would only issue a refund if we filled out an affidavit so the post office could investigate that they had delivered a ninety day supply we were getting billed for instead of a thirty day supply.  </li>
            <li>I SEE A PIMPLE READY TO POP UP</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve still seen a big improvement in the past month, and I&#x27;m going to order more  :)</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>But again I could see this working for someone with mild acne but not moderate to intense acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when I got the bigger sizes with the bill in the mail, I was like, cool</li>
            <li>plus I work in a Kitchen near fryers and under hot and sweaty conditions</li>
            <li>a over the counter product did a much better job without the big COSTS, or several steps.</li>
            <li>It is so- sad that these ads go to such a great lengths and appeals for products that just don&#x27;t cut it!  </li>
            <li>I only have mild acne</li>
            <li>not sure if my son has seen any results yet, but it was worth the try and easy to purchase on amazon</li>
            <li>We highly recommend this 30 day supply, if you are considering to trial this product , try it this way-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them for all ethnicity.</li>
            <li>It is as effective, as any other benzoyl peroxide treatment which you can get from your pharmacy for as low as $2</li>
            <li>I made sure she used it as directed with little to no results after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>HOW FAST IT MADE MY FACE CLEAR UP.  </li>
            <li>And more are appearing everyday.</li>
            <li>I gave this a four stars, simply because it came fast, and had exactly what it promised.</li>
            <li>i thought maybe by continous using it acne will appear more and will go away after few weeks</li>
            <li>Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  </li>
            <li>I pushed the date back as far as it would go 16 weeks as I didn&#x27;t want them sending me new product right away</li>
            <li>My skin was very sensitive during this time</li>
            <li>But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
            <li>Mine is obviously VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li>However, the size didn&#x27;t last me exact 30 days.</li>
            <li>have used Clean &amp; Clear acne facial wash and mark treatment products for several years.</li>
            <li>AND THE MASK MAKES YOU ACNE CLEAR UP WITHIN HOURS.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my thirteen year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE.    </li>
            <li>I really wanted to give this a treatment a solid chance</li>
            <li>Some articles I read says it takes about 6 months for the marks to fade naturally through metabolism.  </li>
            <li>The old stuff worked for me, so why change it?</li>
            <li>Do NOT USE on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>my face is clearer, smoother and soft.</li>
            <li>Whichever, joining the club regularly would have cost 1/2 as much.  </li>
            <li>This buy it for my godson, and served much to the problem of your face, happy with the results, the only negative is that the bottles are quite small.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m confident I have ordered the same 30-day kit in the past (from amazon.com, proactiv.com, and QVC.com) and received a kit with 4 oz.</li>
            <li>He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something</li>
            <li>you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li>but you can do the same thing with Apricot Scrub, Oxy pads, and any high end lotion.</li>
            <li>and like I&#x27;m some teen in high school all over again.</li>
            <li>I tried putting it on at night as the last step of the system and it would make the white heads larger the next day and the larger red pimples more inflamed.</li>
            <li>I still continued to get new white heads and large red pimples the entire time.</li>
            <li>She was having some serious  breakouts and having tried SO- many things for my own skin, I was skeptical of what the ads touted but gave it a try.</li>
            <li>so I just used it every other day and now my face is starting to get pretty clear.</li>
            <li>it did take a little while to really see good results, so as long as things aren&#x27;t getting worse don&#x27;t give up too soon.</li>
            <li>I bought this product at a booth in our local mall for my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>there are two full size bottles and a small trial bonus.</li>
            <li>My small bumps that didn&#x27;t come to a head were minimized so I could see this working for someone with mild acne.</li>
            <li>As an adult I have new onset acne and have tried every acne product imaginable with no positive outcome.  </li>
            <li>When I pointed out that the post office could scarcely be expected to note how much product was in a sealed box she relented and agreed to stop the billing for any future charges.</li>
            <li>The mark treatment does help reduce the severity of breakouts but not so much for fading the dark marks on my skin.</li>
            <li>Proactiv must have some special ingredients not found in other acne treatment products that you buy off the shelf, especially for repairing the dark marks.</li>
            <li>When using twice a day this product didnt dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I was always scared that it would dry my skin out I guess, but I have stuck to the same routine both day and night and my face is almost completely clear.</li>
            <li>I have not experienced any dry skin as many reviews i have read.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I would recommend this to anyione trying to clear up light to severe acne as it has worked for me from day one and it also works for both of my sisters (one has very fair skin and one is darkly tanned, it works great on both) and my mom (who has skin like mine).</li>
            <li> I also had huge, visible pores on my cheeks and Proactiv did help minimize those as well.</li>
            <li> So I got it for free.</li>
            <li> Plus the price fits my budget very well!!!</li>
            <li> It worked really great as long as she used it as recommended.  </li>
            <li> so I made sure I followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> unique order placement for a trial.</li>
            <li> also tried using the refining mask as spot treatment as many other people recommended that to be the most effective way to use the system.</li>
            <li> During the day I would use their super light moisturizer and did the mask 3 times each week (putting it on all over my face and letting it set for 20 minutes before rinsing).</li>
            <li> and they talked about how it works on every kind of skin and that it will completely get rid of blemishes and pimples.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice she had larger pores - but she&#x27;s happy with the results and wants to re-order when this runs out.</li>
            <li> It does a quick fade, f.y.i.</li>
            <li> I love it and will buy some more in the future</li>
            <li> First, the shipping wasnt very fast, and then when it did arive, it was packaged from Proactiv along with a welcome letter letting me know Id be receiving regular shipments now.  </li>
            <li> I ordered my daughter this product for that very reason, and also because she doesnt run our of proactiv very quick.</li>
            <li> This skin-care product isn&#x27;t any more effective than any of the ones you can buy in the drugstore - like Neutrogena, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear, or any other benzoyl peroxide-based solution, and they will hound you with junk mail for the rest of your life.</li>
            <li> Drink lots of water , eat right and exercise all helps as well.</li>
            <li> Go figure though, right?</li>
            <li> Am I right, or am I right?    </li>
            <li> Proactiv literally vanished all my pimples and very much improved the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> excelente very fast, me llego hasta panama.</li>
            <li> I typically only have one or two spots here and there, and it&#x27;s mostly hormones causing those once a month.</li>
            <li> If you have a friend who has this product I would try theirs first to see if it works for you before investing.ou have to call their customer service line.</li>
            <li> If you have a friend who has this product I would try theirs first to see if it works for you before investing.</li>
            <li> so I was aware the sizing was listed as 2 oz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  </li>
            <li> The facial wash does help prevent most breakouts.</li>
            <li> the bottles are very smell!.</li>
            <li> Thanks Biore for making this product!</li>
            <li> After a month or two, maybe more, I began to notice the acne coming back.</li>
            <li> next time I&#x27;ll know better.</li>
            <li> That will be better, won&#x27;t it?\\&quot;    Stick with products from your local drugstore, that understand how to treat customers.</li>
            <li> However, they still sent me the 90-day supply package and charged $33 dollars for the first month.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> It was much smaller all most like a travel sizes.</li>
            <li> After a good long while of having clear skin, I thought maybe my face was &#x27;cured&#x27; and I could stop using it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend the seller - super fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> If you order directly from Proactiv or any suppliers make sure you are very clear about what you are buying and keep records of all transactions and conversations.</li>
            <li> I called at 7pm and got a live person rather quick</li>
            <li> I called at 7pm and got a live person rather quick</li>
            <li> I have only been using the proactiv kit for two weeks so far the results are amazing</li>
            <li> I cant use this crap so I for sure dont want to pay for any more of it!!!!</li>
            <li> I saw positive results within one week.  </li>
            <li> I only had two problems with this set; the lids on the bottles tend to break easily</li>
            <li> The solution must just have been too strong for my skin, because my skin became all red and irritated after using it, breaking out across my forehead and around my chin area.</li>
            <li> No other acne product gets my skin as clean as this.</li>
            <li> has greatly reduced the black and white heads on their forehead, nose and cheeks.</li>
            <li> This stuff keeps my face nice and dry (because I have an oily face) and my skin was clear in a week of using this stuff every night.</li>
            <li> It was is a huge money for anyone, and especially for unemployed college graduate...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not so much the product but the process that really puts the work in.</li>
            <li> So try this product it works very well.</li>
            <li> I used it for a week straight</li>
            <li> and i really don&#x27;t see much improvement at all.</li>
            <li> google \\&quot;Proactiv/e unauthorized charges\\&quot; and you will see that this is a modern SCAM across the nation.</li>
            <li> It came straight to my house.</li>
            <li> I ordered it either over the phone or online from the website, I don&#x27;t really recall.</li>
            <li> I am fortunate that we only bought 1 and were NOT set up on an automatic system for re-order.</li>
            <li> She said they would only issue a refund if we filled out an affidavit so the post office could investigate that they had delivered a ninety day supply we were getting billed for instead of a thirty day supply.  </li>
            <li> I SEE A PIMPLE READY TO POP UP</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve still seen a big improvement in the past month, and I&#x27;m going to order more  :)</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> But again I could see this working for someone with mild acne but not moderate to intense acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when I got the bigger sizes with the bill in the mail, I was like, cool</li>
            <li> plus I work in a Kitchen near fryers and under hot and sweaty conditions</li>
            <li> a over the counter product did a much better job without the big COSTS, or several steps.</li>
            <li> It is so- sad that these ads go to such a great lengths and appeals for products that just don&#x27;t cut it!  </li>
            <li> I only have mild acne</li>
            <li> not sure if my son has seen any results yet, but it was worth the try and easy to purchase on amazon</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this 30 day supply, if you are considering to trial this product , try it this way-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them for all ethnicity.</li>
            <li> It is as effective, as any other benzoyl peroxide treatment which you can get from your pharmacy for as low as $2</li>
            <li> I made sure she used it as directed with little to no results after a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> HOW FAST IT MADE MY FACE CLEAR UP.  </li>
            <li> And more are appearing everyday.</li>
            <li> I gave this a four stars, simply because it came fast, and had exactly what it promised.</li>
            <li> i thought maybe by continous using it acne will appear more and will go away after few weeks</li>
            <li> Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  </li>
            <li> I pushed the date back as far as it would go 16 weeks as I didn&#x27;t want them sending me new product right away</li>
            <li> My skin was very sensitive during this time</li>
            <li> But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
            <li> Mine is obviously VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li> However, the size didn&#x27;t last me exact 30 days.</li>
            <li> have used Clean &amp; Clear acne facial wash and mark treatment products for several years.</li>
            <li> AND THE MASK MAKES YOU ACNE CLEAR UP WITHIN HOURS.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my thirteen year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE.    </li>
            <li> I really wanted to give this a treatment a solid chance</li>
            <li> Some articles I read says it takes about 6 months for the marks to fade naturally through metabolism.  </li>
            <li> The old stuff worked for me, so why change it?</li>
            <li> Do NOT USE on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> my face is clearer, smoother and soft.</li>
            <li> Whichever, joining the club regularly would have cost 1/2 as much.  </li>
            <li> This buy it for my godson, and served much to the problem of your face, happy with the results, the only negative is that the bottles are quite small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confident I have ordered the same 30-day kit in the past (from amazon.com, proactiv.com, and QVC.com) and received a kit with 4 oz.</li>
            <li> He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something</li>
            <li> you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  </li>
            <li> but you can do the same thing with Apricot Scrub, Oxy pads, and any high end lotion.</li>
            <li> and like I&#x27;m some teen in high school all over again.</li>
            <li> I tried putting it on at night as the last step of the system and it would make the white heads larger the next day and the larger red pimples more inflamed.</li>
            <li> I still continued to get new white heads and large red pimples the entire time.</li>
            <li> She was having some serious  breakouts and having tried SO- many things for my own skin, I was skeptical of what the ads touted but gave it a try.</li>
            <li> so I just used it every other day and now my face is starting to get pretty clear.</li>
            <li> it did take a little while to really see good results, so as long as things aren&#x27;t getting worse don&#x27;t give up too soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a booth in our local mall for my 12 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li> there are two full size bottles and a small trial bonus.</li>
            <li> My small bumps that didn&#x27;t come to a head were minimized so I could see this working for someone with mild acne.</li>
            <li> As an adult I have new onset acne and have tried every acne product imaginable with no positive outcome.  </li>
            <li> When I pointed out that the post office could scarcely be expected to note how much product was in a sealed box she relented and agreed to stop the billing for any future charges.</li>
            <li> The mark treatment does help reduce the severity of breakouts but not so much for fading the dark marks on my skin.</li>
            <li> Proactiv must have some special ingredients not found in other acne treatment products that you buy off the shelf, especially for repairing the dark marks.</li>
            <li> When using twice a day this product didnt dry out my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I was always scared that it would dry my skin out I guess, but I have stuck to the same routine both day and night and my face is almost completely clear.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any dry skin as many reviews i have read.  </li>
            <li> at first my face was a little dry when using it</li>
            <li> but since the product picture was of a larger (double) kit and the price was very close to what I have paid in the past for that larger kit, I bought it.  </li>
            <li> one child has too sensitive skin for this to work on, but the other couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> So overall I could see this working for mild acne but for people with moderate acne or worse, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> So overall I could see this working for mild acne but for people with moderate acne or worse, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it</li>
            <li> Just got a small issue:&lt;br /&gt;the shipping was not as fast as what i thought, it takes 10 days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and have had moderate acne since I was a teen and nothing ever really works long term.</li>
            <li> What I do is to use Proactiv for a month to get rid of the stubborn dark marks and use regular acne facial washes regularly to prevent future breakouts.</li>
            <li> Its been only a 5 days and no new zits have came in yet.</li>
            <li> For example, the toner feels no different than other regular toners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tries using it only once a day</li>
            <li> The only thing I hate more then this product is the customer service associated with this product!</li>
            <li> I only wash my face once a day, and sometimes I use my other cleansers instead of this.  </li>
            <li> I was also disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t offered any kind of refund or option to send the product back for a partial refund as their ads and web site state they offer this.</li>
            <li> I was also disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t offered any kind of refund or option to send the product back for a partial refund as their ads and web site state they offer this.</li>
            <li> but I have heard of other people who have had the same problem.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product has so many bad reviews after using a bunch of zit creams proactive has been the only one that has worked.</li>
            <li> but when I switched to once a day it stopped being dry.</li>
            <li> It also made my neck dry.</li>
            <li> It made my face so dry it hurt.</li>
            <li> Anyway, when I got the thirty day trial I was surprised to see that the bottles were small.</li>
            <li> I only use it every other day because I&#x27;m scared it will dry my face out, but I will not be using the other steps.</li>
            <li> It must be something beyond the active ingredient because the active ingredient in Proactive is the same as that in other acne treatments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My teenaged son has had a bad case of acne for more than a year now.  </li>
            <li> but I expected it to be, but hoped it would ease up over time,</li>
            <li> My skin dried out and turned red and flaky...</li>
            <li> A few years later I found out that proactiv contains \\&quot;Benzoyl</li>
            <li> it dried out and made my skin red.  </li>
            <li> but it didnt replenish my skin as i expected.</li>
            <li> I tried to go in right away to post-pone my re-ordering options and it wouldn&#x27;t allow me to do soon until product was delivered (which they delivered to the wrong address-my billing address-yet they sent to invoice to the shipping address).</li>
            <li> After using it for several weeks now, we&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement in our son&#x27;s acne, but nothing</li>
            <li> I had to apply lotion two to three times a day and applying makeup was near impossible either because it hurt too much to touch my skin or it was too flaky to keep on.</li>
            <li> My card hasn&#x27;t been charged yet for additional shipments (as I&#x27;ve heard happen to other people)</li>
            <li> My card hasn&#x27;t been charged yet for additional shipments (as I&#x27;ve heard happen to other people)</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be getting such small bottles-</li>
            <li> It did dry out my skin a little when i was using it twice a day</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is worse, being left on hold for about half an hour last week by their customer support hotline and eventually giving up!  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money or time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the time...</li>
            <li> That would have been a hassle NOT worth having.  </li>
            <li> Do not throw your money out of the window, look at the active ingredient and buy the same stuff for less!!!  </li>
            <li> Still have black head issues though</li>
            <li> The bottles on the other hand were about half the size!</li>
            <li> Well, after a month of using it, my face is a mess.</li>
            <li> Oh and all the hype about the &#x27;New and improved Proactiv&#x27; product is just silly.</li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t have acne, but it cleared up the little bumps...</li>
            <li> I saw little to no results with this product.</li>
            <li> AND IT WAS GONE IN A FEW HOURS.  </li>
            <li> wasted on chasing a dream promised by the ads.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe i wasted my money on this</li>
            <li> I bought a few sets on behalf my sister and co-works....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately when you buy from the company directly, they automatically set you up to be shipped and billed for the product after the thirty days or for some, sixty days.</li>
            <li> and as you can see, this stuff is not cheap.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been a few years</li>
            <li> I hope my review helps you avoid this trouble.</li>
            <li> It did not work, and it dried my face out.</li>
            <li> Seriously, i&#x27;ve asked at least 6 times now to be removed from their mailing lists and they still constantly send me solicitations.</li>
            <li> Watch out amazon customers this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a bad experience on this site...</li>
            <li> It was extremely painful and for the first couple of days I looked like a had a sunburn on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like nothing we tried worked, so after hearing several friends recommend Proactiv, we decided to take the plunge and buy a 2-month supply, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive.  </li>
            <li> After the first day or two I had dry flaky skin and the skin under my eyes was scabby and very painful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if you have to use all three.</li>
            <li> 1)It was a waste of money!</li>
            <li> In fact, I ended up using the bottles past the thirty day mark</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift &amp; not sure if they used it yet</li>
            <li> EVERYDAY!</li>
            <li> So it wasn&#x27;t as frustrating for me as I&#x27;ve seen for other people.</li>
            <li> let&#x27;s put some REAL facts behind it!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using proactiv for at least a month now.</li>
            <li> My complaint is not about the product but the sizing.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv does this to the majority of their customers and their customer service is rude and disrespectful when you call them up for an explanation.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a common reaction</li>
            <li> type of deceptive business practices are troublesome to say the least.</li>
            <li> Just cost to d... much for this crap.</li>
            <li> I do not use all the steps anymore &amp; the &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34; of green tea lotion does not help, it made it worse.</li>
            <li> My acne had cleared up tremendously, but I didn&#x27;t have it too horribly to begin with.    </li>
            <li> Looking forward to seeing people realize how bad benzoyl peroxide is for them so they can actually use products that work...</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t make it bad enough</li>
            <li> Or having the line answer by some incompetent yo-yo</li>
            <li> My total loss was $82 :(.</li>
            <li> and it kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> I was not happy with the results with this.</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager I had the worse acne.</li>
            <li> PLEASE.Dont touch your face after using this product and dont over use it which can make acne worse.</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager I tried proactiv out because \\&quot;Everyone was doing it\\&quot; and i got worse results...</li>
            <li> Thanks for a horrible product proactiv!</li>
            <li> but instead my face got worse..</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> but you need to keep using it or else it fails.....</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work out this time.</li>
            <li> i decided to order it because it sells way to expensive here ............</li>
            <li> My daughter was not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> It was also difficult to cancel.</li>
            <li> and I found it difficult sometimes to squeeze the product out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out $40 for a 30 day supply (after shipping) which isn&#x27;t awful, but not cheap for something that didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m out $40 for a 30 day supply (after shipping) which isn&#x27;t awful, but not cheap for something that didn&#x27;t work for me.    </li>
            <li> I have really bad acne</li>
            <li> Now there are acne on my face that won&#x27;t come out, they stay under my skin and create this really ugly, purple bumps.    </li>
            <li> but since I am in my mid-twenties I am sick of any acne at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy someone can do this without your consent!</li>
            <li> Was very unhappy with the purchases.</li>
            <li> I hate having acne</li>
            <li> I was not at all educated about this auto ship crap and thank goodness</li>
            <li> Buying this is the worst decision I have ever made, but just because it gives me severe acne but because even after 2 weeks of not using the product (and anything else, just wash my face and apply lotion)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s outrageous that they do that.    </li>
            <li> , it just makes me feel horrible</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have never had an acne problem.  As an adult I have new onset acne and have tried every acne product imaginable with no positive outcome.  After 1 week of using Proactive my skin has cleared up 100%.</li>
            <li> not sure if my son has seen any results yet, but it was worth the try and easy to purchase on amazon</li>
            <li> This is good but you can do the same thing with Apricot Scrub, Oxy pads, and any high end lotion. it&#x27;s not so much the product but the process that really puts the work in.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my thirteen year old daughter.  It worked really great as long as she used it as recommended.  Sometimes she would forget to use it and I could tell the difference.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I saw positive results within one week.  I also have not had any breakouts since using it.  I have not experienced any dry skin as many reviews i have read.  Proactiv is definately a product i will continue using.</li>
            <li> I AM VERY IMPRESSED ON HOW FAST IT MADE MY FACE CLEAR UP.  MY FACE ISN&#x27;T GREASY ANY LONGER AND THE MASK MAKES YOU ACNE CLEAR UP WITHIN HOURS.  I EVEN HAD A PIMPLE ON MY LEG AND I PUT SOME ON IT AND IT WAS GONE IN A FEW HOURS.  I WOULD RECOMMENDED THIS PRODUCT TO YOUNG AND OLD ALIKE.    VERY SATISFIED CUSTOMER!!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I haven&#x27;t used it as directed.  I only wash my face once a day, and sometimes I use my other cleansers instead of this.  But I&#x27;ve still seen a big improvement in the past month, and I&#x27;m going to order more  :)</li>
            <li> Before trying Proactiv I only had acnee on my chin, but after a month of using it, I have acnee ALL OVER MY FACE. I have never had such severe acnee before in my entire life. Not even when I hit puberty. Now there are acne on my face that won&#x27;t come out, they stay under my skin and create this really ugly, purple bumps.    Proactiv says if you&#x27;re allergic to hydroxyl peroxide, it&#x27;s okay. Keep using it, you&#x27;ll have SOME break out but after that your skin will readjust to the medicine and your acne will subside visibly. Well, after a month of using it, my face is a mess. Now I can&#x27;t go back to when I was a month ago. Buying this is the worst decision I have ever made, but just because it gives me severe acne but because even after 2 weeks of not using the product (and anything else, just wash my face and apply lotion) my acne still does not go away. And more are appearing everyday. I wish I could upload a photo of me before and after using proactiv, you&#x27;d see why I want to throttle this company.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this product has so many bad reviews after using a bunch of zit creams proactive has been the only one that has worked. Its been only a 5 days and no new zits have came in yet. It did dry out my skin a little when i was using it twice a day but when I switched to once a day it stopped being dry. So try this product it works very well. MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!!!</li>
            <li> We highly recommend this 30 day supply, if you are considering to trial this product , try it this way-it&#x27;s inexpensive and convincing!</li>
            <li> I gave this a four stars, simply because it came fast, and had exactly what it promised. The proactiv system however did NOT work for my skin. I have a pretty decent complexion, but I wanted the flawless look that the commercials promise. The solution must just have been too strong for my skin, because my skin became all red and irritated after using it, breaking out across my forehead and around my chin area. I typically only have one or two spots here and there, and it&#x27;s mostly hormones causing those once a month. This product ruined my skin for over a month. I used it for a week straight and it kept getting worse. Once I stopped using it, my skin cleared up almost immediately. Not worth the money or time wasted on chasing a dream promised by the ads.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are so critical of this product.  it cleared up my skin dramatically in just a matter or 1 week!  it&#x27;s amazing and i have no blemishes anymore.  plus, i got some freebies with this purchase.  highly recommend the seller - super fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> I tried this product out of desperation. I&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s and have had moderate acne since I was a teen and nothing ever really works long term. I really wanted to give this a treatment a solid chance so I made sure I followed the directions exactly. I washed my face twice a day with step one and followed it with step two each time. During the day I would use their super light moisturizer and did the mask 3 times each week (putting it on all over my face and letting it set for 20 minutes before rinsing). I used the product precisely for two weeks and didn&#x27;t have very good results. My small bumps that didn&#x27;t come to a head were minimized so I could see this working for someone with mild acne. I still continued to get new white heads and large red pimples the entire time. My skin was very sensitive during this time but I expected it to be, but hoped it would ease up over time, it didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried using the refining mask as spot treatment as many other people recommended that to be the most effective way to use the system. I was not happy with the results with this. I tried putting it on at night as the last step of the system and it would make the white heads larger the next day and the larger red pimples more inflamed. But again I could see this working for someone with mild acne but not moderate to intense acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think their automatic re-ordering is rather shady as there is no way to opt out of the automatic re-ordering when placing your first order. I tried to go in right away to post-pone my re-ordering options and it wouldn&#x27;t allow me to do soon until product was delivered (which they delivered to the wrong address-my billing address-yet they sent to invoice to the shipping address). I pushed the date back as far as it would go 16 weeks as I didn&#x27;t want them sending me new product right away (it defaulted to 2 weeks from when my initial order was place, but my kit was supposed to last 90 days!). They do not allow you to cancel your account online, you have to call their customer service line. I called at 7pm and got a live person rather quick and I explained my dissatisfaction with the product and that I wanted to cancel the account. She stated she would cancel the account but wouldn&#x27;t give me any sort of cancellation number. I asked if I would receive notice of the cancellation and was told I would be mailed one, but haven&#x27;t received it yet. My card hasn&#x27;t been charged yet for additional shipments (as I&#x27;ve heard happen to other people) but I&#x27;ll be watching it for the next 16 weeks to see if they try to continue my account. I was also disappointed that I wasn&#x27;t offered any kind of refund or option to send the product back for a partial refund as their ads and web site state they offer this. I&#x27;m out $40 for a 30 day supply (after shipping) which isn&#x27;t awful, but not cheap for something that didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I&#x27;m going back to the dermatologist to try again. So overall I could see this working for mild acne but for people with moderate acne or worse, I wouldn&#x27;t buy it/sign up for their program. If you have a friend who has this product I would try theirs first to see if it works for you before investing.ou have to call their customer service line.

            <li> I have been using Proactiv for years. When I was a teenager I had the worse acne. Proactiv literally vanished all my pimples and very much improved the texture of my skin. I also had huge, visible pores on my cheeks and Proactiv did help minimize those as well. It is very gentle and does not irritate my extremely sensitive skin. It even smells good! I would recommend this to anyione trying to clear up light to severe acne as it has worked for me from day one and it also works for both of my sisters (one has very fair skin and one is darkly tanned, it works great on both) and my mom (who has skin like mine). Overall wonderful product.</li>
            <li> This proactiv kit has been great! I had never used proactiv before now, and I don&#x27;t know why! I was always scared that it would dry my skin out I guess, but I have stuck to the same routine both day and night and my face is almost completely clear. I will definitely keep buying proactiv!</li>
            <li> I have been using proactiv for at least a month now.I dont have severe acne but I was having some issues with acne because of hormones. My honest opinion is that this stuff works for me. Follow the instructions PLEASE.Dont touch your face after using this product and dont over use it which can make acne worse.Drink lots of water , eat right and exercise all helps as well. When using twice a day this product didnt dry out my sensitive skin. I use the mask 3 times a week as well.The only downside to this product is the size for the price ..... it  costs me 30 dollars a month and i run out of the toner quicker than anything else. However, I would gladly pay for this product because it works for me . Otherwise I would probably spend more than 30 dollars a month trying to find something that works.</li>
            <li> This skin-care product isn&#x27;t any more effective than any of the ones you can buy in the drugstore - like Neutrogena, Clearasil, Clean &amp; Clear, or any other benzoyl peroxide-based solution, and they will hound you with junk mail for the rest of your life. Seriously, i&#x27;ve asked at least 6 times now to be removed from their mailing lists and they still constantly send me solicitations. NOT WORTH IT!!!!!</li>
            <li> My complaint is not about the product but the sizing.  I&#x27;m confident I have ordered the same 30-day kit in the past (from amazon.com, proactiv.com, and QVC.com) and received a kit with 4 oz. of cleanser, 4 oz. of toner, 2 oz. of lotion and a bonus 1 oz. of mask.    I did read the product features so I was aware the sizing was listed as 2 oz. of cleanser, 2 oz. of toner, 1 oz. of lotion and 1 oz. of mask - but since the product picture was of a larger (double) kit and the price was very close to what I have paid in the past for that larger kit, I bought it.  I regret doing so because I would consider these bottles travel size.    I would not order the kit again at this price/size.</li>
            <li> My teenaged son has had a bad case of acne for more than a year now.  We&#x27;ve tried a variety of different medicines, one of which actually made his acne worse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like nothing we tried worked, so after hearing several friends recommend Proactiv, we decided to take the plunge and buy a 2-month supply, even though it&#x27;s a little expensive.  After using it for several weeks now, we&#x27;ve seen a very slight improvement in our son&#x27;s acne, but nothing major.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We finally got fed up with all of the over the counter stuff and decided to visit our pediatrician.  He told us that our son had 3-4 level acne on the Pillsbury scale which classifies the severity of acne from 1 to 4.  Our doctor said that what&#x27;s in Proactiv isn&#x27;t really that much different than what&#x27;s in most of the other over the counter products.  He also said that the main reason people who used it showed some improvement is because it motivated people to be regular in their acne hygiene routine - something teens are notorious for not being faithful with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, apparently the latest research shows that in severe cases of acne there is bacteria under the skin that must be treated by antibiotics and that treating it superficially isn&#x27;t likely to help much.  So now we&#x27;re moving from using Proactiv to using prescription antibiotics and some stronger prescription acne medicines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish us luck!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a less severe case of acne, then Proactiv might be for you: the main thing is to use it consistently.  But if you have a severe case, it&#x27;s not likely to help very much, and you&#x27;ll probably have to get a prescription for something stronger.</li>
            <li> I watched all the commercials about proactive and they talked about how it works on every kind of skin and that it will completely get rid of blemishes and pimples. since i been using proactive i&#x27;ve gotten a couple pimples and i really don&#x27;t see much improvement at all.</li>
            <li> not enough of a supply for the money. go see a doctor. go see a movie. go home. go away</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager I tried proactiv out because \\&quot;Everyone was doing it\\&quot; and i got worse results... My skin dried out and turned red and flaky... A few years later I found out that proactiv contains \\&quot;Benzoyl Peroxide\\&quot; which is in my opinion way too toxic to include in a skin care product... if you do research on benzoyl peroxide I think that you will agree that it&#x27;s not something to put on your face.  Anyways... it dried out and made my skin red.  Didn&#x27;t help my acne at all and just put benzoyl peroxide on my skin.... Thanks for a horrible product proactiv! Looking forward to seeing people realize how bad benzoyl peroxide is for them so they can actually use products that work... Can&#x27;t believe i wasted my money on this, i&#x27;m very glad I found out about what&#x27;s in it and stopped using it because I am a very pissed off consumer... They shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to include BP in cosmetic products.     Basically, don&#x27;t use it... Do your research and you will find better acne erasing advice out there on youtube or google... Just please do your research.</li>
            <li> I ordered a ONE TIME ONLY order of this product through their website at [...].&lt;br /&gt;At the time, I wrote in the comments \\&quot;This is a one time, unique order placement for a trial. Not to become a multiorder or anything resembling that\\&quot;. I proceeded to take screen shots for documentation and placed the $19.95 order\\&quot;. On April 30th, I see that my credit card has been charged -again- without my authorization and consent for a SECOND ORDER of product in the amount of $27.94!!.&lt;br /&gt;Upon checking (google \\&quot;Proactiv/e unauthorized charges\\&quot; and you will see that this is a modern SCAM across the nation. Proactiv does this to the majority of their customers and their customer service is rude and disrespectful when you call them up for an explanation. So BEWARE. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</li>
            <li> I bought a few sets on behalf my sister and co-works....It works to some extent but you need to keep using it or else it fails.....</li>
            <li> The product itself is excellent and this is a perfect size for some one who isn&#x27;t too sure about the proactive system and wants to try it out. Great for travel too. People could tell a difference in my skin within days</li>
            <li> Proactiv must have some special ingredients not found in other acne treatment products that you buy off the shelf, especially for repairing the dark marks. It must be something beyond the active ingredient because the active ingredient in Proactive is the same as that in other acne treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Clean &amp; Clear acne facial wash and mark treatment products for several years. The facial wash does help prevent most breakouts. The mark treatment does help reduce the severity of breakouts but not so much for fading the dark marks on my skin. The Proactiv kit outperforms both.  After about 3 weeks, the acne marks on my face were dramatically reduced. Some articles I read says it takes about 6 months for the marks to fade naturally through metabolism.  I wonder if there&#x27;s something in Proactiv that helps accelerate the metabolism of the skin. I&#x27;m not sure if you have to use all three. For example, the toner feels no different than other regular toners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is the price and of course their sales rep pushes you to get on their automatic re-order list. What I do is to use Proactiv for a month to get rid of the stubborn dark marks and use regular acne facial washes regularly to prevent future breakouts.</li>
            <li> love it! at first my face was a little dry when using it so I just used it every other day and now my face is starting to get pretty clear. Still have black head issues though</li>
            <li> This was a great price to pay for a starter kit. It came straight to my house. However, the size didn&#x27;t last me exact 30 days.</li>
            <li> This buy it for my godson, and served much to the problem of your face, happy with the results, the only negative is that the bottles are quite small.</li>
            <li> I bought this before i bought this and was pissed! 1)It was a waste of money! 2)All the bottles are very smell!. Just cost to d... much for this crap. It&#x27;s not worth the time... really!     !!!!! ALL YOU NEED TO BUY IS Biore Detoxifying Daily scrub! and get what it says to use a spf. or like me a good oil free lotion!  You don&#x27;t have to use it every day, and I seen resuets in just one week of use! And it says use 3 times a week.I only use it twice a week.  Hello guy here!! I love this stuff...Thanks Biore for making this product!</li>
            <li> Proactiv doesn&#x27;t work for all. It is a great product when it works. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work out this time.</li>
            <li> I actually bought this product a few years ago after hearing so much about it. I guess one of the commercials finally roped me in. I ordered it either over the phone or online from the website, I don&#x27;t really recall. Anyway, when I got the thirty day trial I was surprised to see that the bottles were small. Go figure though, right? It&#x27;s a trial. So it wasn&#x27;t as frustrating for me as I&#x27;ve seen for other people. In fact, I ended up using the bottles past the thirty day mark and then some. I only used it once a day. It didn&#x27;t show immediate results but I kept with it, and after about two to three weeks started seeing definite results. My acne had cleared up tremendously, but I didn&#x27;t have it too horribly to begin with.    Unfortunately when you buy from the company directly, they automatically set you up to be shipped and billed for the product after the thirty days or for some, sixty days. So when I got the bigger sizes with the bill in the mail, I was like, cool but I&#x27;m not paying you guys because I didn&#x27;t order it again. So I got it for free. It&#x27;s outrageous that they do that.    After a good long while of having clear skin, I thought maybe my face was &#x27;cured&#x27; and I could stop using it. (Plus I began to run out and as you can see, this stuff is not cheap. I definitely did not have the money to continue using it, so I stopped.) BIG mistake. After a month or two, maybe more, I began to notice the acne coming back. I tried over the counter products but nothing worked. So now, reluctantly, I am going back. I am at a point in my life now where I&#x27;m able to afford having it as my acne butt kicker. Thankfully. I hate having acne, it just makes me feel horrible and like I&#x27;m some teen in high school all over again. No thank you!    Oh and all the hype about the &#x27;New and improved Proactiv&#x27; product is just silly. I had thought about purchasing it, but after reading some reviews, thought better of it. The old stuff worked for me, so why change it? Am I right, or am I right?    Sincerely,  Mz. Anne.</li>
            <li> Bought this sample pack for my daughter. She doesn&#x27;t have acne, but it cleared up the little bumps...future blackheads? And she said her pores are smaller. I didn&#x27;t notice she had larger pores - but she&#x27;s happy with the results and wants to re-order when this runs out. I want to try the fade cream that was included, but haven&#x27;t done so yet.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift &amp; not sure if they used it yet but the product that came is much much smaller then what the picture shows. The height of the product is just taller then a pen cap.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a booth in our local mall for my 12 year old daughter.  She was having some serious  breakouts and having tried SO- many things for my own skin, I was skeptical of what the ads touted but gave it a try. I made sure she used it as directed with little to no results after a couple of weeks. She was given L&#x27;OREAL 360 cleanser by a friend and the improvement is amazing!! Imagine that....a over the counter product did a much better job without the big COSTS, or several steps. I am fortunate that we only bought 1 and were NOT set up on an automatic system for re-order. That would have been a hassle NOT worth having.  It is so- sad that these ads go to such a great lengths and appeals for products that just don&#x27;t cut it!  They ALL tout how great they are, rated #1, ect ect... let&#x27;s put some REAL facts behind it!!! Not America&#x27;s next model, o.k. OH Yeah, they did offer a 60 day money back full refund, which would be great if you COULD READ THE RECEIPT!  It does a quick fade, f.y.i. [[ASIN:B001SA5DZS Proactiv 4 Pc Kit 30 Day Supply]]</li>
            <li> I was trying to save money by purchasing the 4 Pc Kit online. I never thought I would be getting such small bottles-next time I&#x27;ll know better. Oh well-</li>
            <li> I too ordered this product hoping that something would finally work. I only have mild acne but since I am in my mid-twenties I am sick of any acne at all. After the first day or two I had dry flaky skin and the skin under my eyes was scabby and very painful. I don&#x27;t know if this is a common reaction but I have heard of other people who have had the same problem. I have never had a reaction to a skin product like I did with Proactiv. It was extremely painful and for the first couple of days I looked like a had a sunburn on my face. It also made my neck dry. I had to apply lotion two to three times a day and applying makeup was near impossible either because it hurt too much to touch my skin or it was too flaky to keep on. I tries using it only once a day but I continued having the same problems. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what is worse, being left on hold for about half an hour last week by their customer support hotline and eventually giving up!  Or having the line answer by some incompetent yo-yo giving you the third degree (\\&quot;Why did you order it if you were going to decide to return it!\\&quot;)  You will feel you are caught in some nightmare where Alice in Wonderland meets Kafka.    Another great line: \\&quot;If you don&#x27;t like our product, we can send it to you every six months instead of every month.  That will be better, won&#x27;t it?\\&quot;    Stick with products from your local drugstore, that understand how to treat customers.</li>
            <li> Proactiv 4 pc kit 30 day supply:  I gave it as a gift for a friend&#x27;s teen age son... He enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and it was okay, but it&#x27;s been a few years so I thought I&#x27;d give it a second chance. It made my face so dry it hurt. I do not use all the steps anymore &amp; the &amp;#34;free gift&amp;#34; of green tea lotion does not help, it made it worse. However, I do like the face wash. That seems to be the only product out of this kit that I will use. I only use it every other day because I&#x27;m scared it will dry my face out, but I will not be using the other steps. I have never had my face feel like that... it was awful. I know people this has worked great for so, it really depends on your skin type. Mine is obviously VERY sensitive.</li>
            <li> i finish the product but it didn&#x27;t work at all..i thought maybe by continous using it acne will appear more and will go away after few weeks but instead my face got worse..im so embarrassed to go out ..so dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Proactiv is just another fad that is pushed through all sorts of media and imposed through auto-delivery systems. It is as effective, as any other benzoyl peroxide treatment which you can get from your pharmacy for as low as $2 a tube (I even managed to find oxy cream at our dollar store, and it gave me the same result). Do not throw your money out of the window, look at the active ingredient and buy the same stuff for less!!!  My experience with proactiv charges was a NIGHTMARE. Within two weeks after the trial package arrived, I called customer service and cancelled all future deliveries. However, they still sent me the 90-day supply package and charged $33 dollars for the first month. So I called again and cancelled the account, and they advised me to mail the package back, and so I did, with the tracking number (which cost me $10). You cannot imagine my surprise when after a month not even I got my refund, but another $19 charge from them! When I called to find out what happened, they said that they did not receive the package, and will not refund any money. Now I did not have a package or my money! My total loss was $82 :(. It was is a huge money for anyone, and especially for unemployed college graduate... Finally, after total of over 3h on a phone with them, time and money spend on shipping the package, and a lot of nerves racked, I got $72 back.   I hope my review helps you avoid this trouble. Shop your local pharmacy!</li>
            <li> The product was recieved in a timely manner which was great. The bottles on the other hand were about half the size!</li>
            <li> this product is ok but i have to say it&#x27;s does nothing like the commercials say. it does help with blackhead if you have them but it didnt replenish my skin as i expected.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome! Make sure you use it either once or twice a day. EVERYDAY! I love this stuff it works wonderfully. I have really bad acne plus I work in a Kitchen near fryers and under hot and sweaty conditions and I wear a hat which does not help my forehead at all. This stuff keeps my face nice and dry (because I have an oily face) and my skin was clear in a week of using this stuff every night. I love it and will buy some more in the future &#x3D;) Plus the price fits my budget very well!!!</li>
            <li> I hate this product! It made my face break out in a rash after just 2 days of using it!!! The only thing I hate more then this product is the customer service associated with this product! I was not at all educated about this auto ship crap and thank goodness I read the fine print and noticed it but when calling the number givin that says call this number to cancel or change auto ship they gave me the run around. They hung up on me 3 times then on the forth I was transfered then sent to an answering machine. I cant use this crap so I for sure dont want to pay for any more of it!!!!</li>
            <li> Do NOT USE on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> one child has too sensitive skin for this to work on, but the other couldn&#x27;t be happier. they asked to be put on the automatic mailing program so they never run out. has greatly reduced the black and white heads on their forehead, nose and cheeks. it did take a little while to really see good results, so as long as things aren&#x27;t getting worse don&#x27;t give up too soon.</li>
            <li> My wife bought what she thought was a 30 day supply for a friend in Mexico. After the initial shipment she got a second package. When she called to inquire they told her it was a subscription type service and they intended to keep shipping product every thirty to ninety days depending on her order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She told them to cancel the order and they claimed they had. They gave her a cancellation number. Thirty days later they billed her credit card again.  When we called to complain the customer service representative said the billing was spread over three months. She said they would only issue a refund if we filled out an affidavit so the post office could investigate that they had delivered a ninety day supply we were getting billed for instead of a thirty day supply.  When I pointed out that the post office could scarcely be expected to note how much product was in a sealed box she relented and agreed to stop the billing for any future charges. It was not a satisfactory solution  but it was the most expedient so we took it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type of deceptive business practices are troublesome to say the least. If you order directly from Proactiv or any suppliers make sure you are very clear about what you are buying and keep records of all transactions and conversations.</li>
            <li> excelente very fast, me llego hasta panama. muy rapido y seguro, lo recomiendo. muy confiable mucha garantia.&lt;br /&gt;excelente precio. mucha calidad.</li>
            <li> Was very unhappy with the purchases. It was smaller then what it shown on the site. I&#x27;ll never purchases from this user again.</li>
            <li> i havent even used it two weeks and its already working forgot how great it works i bought it before at home(trinidad)but i decided to order it because it sells way to expensive here ............</li>
            <li> I love proactiv but, this seller scammed me big time! After receiving it in the mail I not only realized that the product was a &amp;#34;trial size&amp;#34; not a 30 day supply whatsoever. If that doesn&#x27;t make it bad enough I was signed into a recurring payment plan with proactiv from this purchase too! Who says I have the money in my account for a recurring payment! It&#x27;s crazy someone can do this without your consent! Watch out amazon customers this is the first time I&#x27;ve ever had a bad experience on this site...</li>
            <li> Bought this product for my granddaughters&amp; they loved it......cleared up their skin very nicely!  Recommend this kit for all that have acne skin problems!  ;-)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my twin granddaughters and neither one could use it.  It caused more problems than they had before.  I should not have purchased it.</li>
            <li> Ifyour buying on amazon because you wish to purchase Proactiv but want to avoid signing up for a monthly membership---R U N!!! I ordered my daughter this product for that very reason, and also because she doesnt run our of proactiv very quick. First, the shipping wasnt very fast, and then when it did arive, it was packaged from Proactiv along with a welcome letter letting me know Id be receiving regular shipments now.  Really???&lt;br /&gt;Guess who wont be buying this product on amazon ever again, and cancelling their credit card? Me.</li>
            <li> what can i say i have a pretween and she&#x60;s breaking out she wanted this so got for and she&#x60;s been using it 2 times a day wow great skin</li>
            <li> It did not work, and it dried my face out. would not recommend to anyone,  I will not try again,</li>
            <li> My daughter was not impressed with this product. It made her face quite red almost looked like she had a sunburn. I saw no difference in her acne either, nor did she.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the proactiv kit for two weeks so far the results are amazing my face is clearer, smoother and soft. I have oily skin type these products keep the oil to a minimum due to these good results I am happy I purchased these products. I highly recommend them for all ethnicity.</li>
            <li> awsome my kids loved it</li>
            <li> I paid over $30 for the &amp;#34;trial&amp;#34; sizes of Proactiv.  Not at all what it was portrayed as, as you can see from the picture there are two full size bottles and a small trial bonus.</li>
            <li> The size on the picture is not the size that came in the mail to me. It was much smaller all most like a travel sizes.</li>
            <li> This proactive thing is all brand new,  looks good and i got some gifts inside. its cool and amazing. Just got a small issue:&lt;br /&gt;the shipping was not as fast as what i thought, it takes 10 days here.&lt;br /&gt;Im about to start it tonight, hope it will work XD</li>
            <li> BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR ABOUT 15 OR MORE YEARS NOW. THE ON THE SPOT TREATMENT IS AWESOME. I SEE A PIMPLE READY TO POP UP AND THE NEXT DAY IT IS GONE. I COULD NOT RECOMMEND PROACTIV ENOUGH. YOU MUST USE IT EVERY NIGHT- ALL 3 STEPS AND USE THE MASK AS AN ON THE SPOT TREATMENT.</li>
            <li> The quanity did not last 30 days. I saw little to no results with this product. I have since then switched to another brand of acne treatment.</li>
            <li> Product is what it is but the auto shipping was not mentioned or not noticed.  Whichever, joining the club regularly would have cost 1/2 as much.  It was also difficult to cancel.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the best acne care product hands down. No other acne product gets my skin as clean as this. I only had two problems with this set; the lids on the bottles tend to break easily and I found it difficult sometimes to squeeze the product out.</li>
            <li> My daughter has some acne problems. Now her face looks like it did before teenage years. I need to order more.</li>
            <li> Item works like a charm when used as instructed. I have had no issues with this product. I will be purchasing again.</li>
