    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>This product is excellent and arrived in very good time.</li>
            <li>Good size for travel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a lack of experience with curling her hair than the iron itself.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely easy to hold in your hand because it has a thicker handle.  </li>
            <li>Heated quickly!</li>
            <li>As expected, very good quality product .</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t hold any kind of curl very well.</li>
            <li>I love how the iron really does heat up in 30 seconds and the quality of the curling iron is great, but there&#x27;s a major design flaw with the temperature dial.</li>
            <li>Also, the tip of the curling irons can get very hot.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as listed, and came quickly...</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair love the big curls it gives me!</li>
            <li>just as expected, good product fast delivery</li>
            <li>and it heats up very fast.</li>
            <li>Its heat is consistent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really efficient</li>
            <li>I bought this for my friend&#x27;s daughter, so these are her thoughts on it:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not an iron that for a quick &#x27;do&#x27; before school, although she&#x27;s only 14 and looking at things on Pinterest.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like this product because the setting is on the handle close to your fingers so that every time you curl, you move the setting.</li>
            <li>It gets hot, and creates a smooth wide edge curve but not a solid curl...</li>
            <li>If you have longer hair and you try to hold on to the tip for support, the tips get so hot that you will definitely burn your fingers.</li>
            <li>For some reason the curl isn&#x27;t as strong or tight as my old Revlon iron.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to discover it supported 110v - 240v which meant I could use it</li>
            <li>The heat control is right under the clamp causing it to be turned up and down as you roll your hair.</li>
            <li>I like the pink color and works really well.</li>

            <li> still keeping because it does the trick just  enough for me which is to smith out the ends of my layered long hair.</li>
            <li> however the curl doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron about 2 weeks ago because it said it made curls that last really long</li>
            <li> I read other reviews and there are a lot of similar issues with this curling iron.</li>
            <li> but what I noticed is that the new ones are extremely clumsy.  </li>
            <li> I like it , the down side is where the shut off button is in a location that you click it off by accident just by where it is located.&lt;br /&gt;Works well other than that.</li>
            <li> very careful!</li>
            <li> The handles are too thin which makes control very difficult; especially if you don&#x27;t want to get burned.  </li>
            <li> Also, some of them are so poorly designed that as you spin the curling iron around the hair, you can either accidentally hit the off/on switch or change the temperature.  </li>
            <li> The on off button is in a place that keeps getting clicked off when I am curling my hair - it is in a bad spot on the curling iron - no easy way to avoid it</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong one.</li>
            <li> Curling irons can be dangerous and difficult to control in your hand.</li>
            <li> I wish I read up before losing my poor hair :(</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed</li>
            <li> Burned a chunk of hair off :(</li>

            <li> For some reason the curl isn&#x27;t as strong or tight as my old Revlon iron.  It gets hot, and creates a smooth wide edge curve but not a solid curl...still keeping because it does the trick just  enough for me which is to smith out the ends of my layered long hair. And the temperature knob moves a lot.</li>
            <li> I like it , the down side is where the shut off button is in a location that you click it off by accident just by where it is located.&lt;br /&gt;Works well other than that.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t hold any kind of curl very well. Save your money for a more expensive one that works.</li>
            <li> The on off button is in a place that keeps getting clicked off when I am curling my hair - it is in a bad spot on the curling iron - no easy way to avoid it</li>
            <li> As expected, very good quality product .</li>
            <li> I love how the iron really does heat up in 30 seconds and the quality of the curling iron is great, but there&#x27;s a major design flaw with the temperature dial. Every time I move to a different angle my hand hits the iron, so it ends up changing the heat setting. If I need another iron, I&#x27;ll be looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend&#x27;s daughter, so these are her thoughts on it:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not an iron that for a quick &#x27;do&#x27; before school, although she&#x27;s only 14 and looking at things on Pinterest. It&#x27;s more of a lack of experience with curling her hair than the iron itself.</li>
            <li> Exactly as listed, and came quickly... however the curl doesn&#x27;t last long. Kinda disappointed</li>
            <li> I ordered the wrong one. I needed the one inch. I don&#x27;t particularly like this product because the setting is on the handle close to your fingers so that every time you curl, you move the setting. So you need to adjust it after every curl.</li>
            <li> I like the pink color and works really well.</li>
            <li> just as expected, good product fast delivery</li>
            <li> Good size for travel.</li>
            <li> The heat control is right under the clamp causing it to be turned up and down as you roll your hair.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to discover it supported 110v - 240v which meant I could use it right away.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really efficient and it doesn&#x27;t over heat your hair.</li>
            <li> Worked well. Heated quickly! Very happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> Curling irons can be dangerous and difficult to control in your hand. I had gone to ULTA Beauty Supply to find one but what I noticed is that the new ones are extremely clumsy.  The handles are too thin which makes control very difficult; especially if you don&#x27;t want to get burned.  Also, the tip of the curling irons can get very hot.  If you have longer hair and you try to hold on to the tip for support, the tips get so hot that you will definitely burn your fingers. Also, some of them are so poorly designed that as you spin the curling iron around the hair, you can either accidentally hit the off/on switch or change the temperature.  With all of this being said, this curling iron has NONE of these issues.  Its heat is consistent.  The controls are out of the way so that you don&#x27;t accidentally change settings or turn it off.  It is extremely easy to hold in your hand because it has a thicker handle.  I love this curling iron.  I think you will, too.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and arrived in very good time.</li>
            <li> Burned a chunk of hair off :( I had this curling iron for about a year. Today it overheated and took out a chunk of my hair before I had a chance to react. The temp must have gone up in a matter of seconds. I spend a lot of time and money on my hair so this just blows. I read other reviews and there are a lot of similar issues with this curling iron. I wish I read up before losing my poor hair :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be very careful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron about 2 weeks ago because it said it made curls that last really long and it heats up very fast. Well, it does neither. I will probably just give it to goodwill and count it as a lesson learned since I have already thrown the packaging away. I am very disappointed at the quality of this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t fry my hair love the big curls it gives me!</li>
