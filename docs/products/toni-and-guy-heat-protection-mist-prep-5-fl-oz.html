            <li>This may not be the best product</li>
            <li>and I was fairly impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my hair in wonderful condition.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the product</li>
            <li>love them!!!</li>
            <li>but it is a very good product.</li>
            <li>That aside, this conditioner is quite good, and if you&#x27;re a fan of musky scent and don&#x27;t mind the price, this would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li>The smell was great and it made my hair feel manageable and silky after.</li>
            <li>conditioner feels great.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re prone to tangling, this probably is not going to be the best choice, but you can get by if you&#x27;re more liberal with the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found it to be pleasant.  </li>
            <li>Gives you body and feels good on your hair.</li>
            <li>I used both these Cleanse Shampoo and Conditioner for damaged hair from Toni &amp; Guy together to give the product line a fair shake</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really loved the Toni&amp;Guy line.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for conditioner that smells good, adds moisture to my hair, and acts as a detangler.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker conditioner that seems to do a good job moisturizing my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly nondescript-</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product and used both the shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and very light, not overpowering at all.</li>
            <li>I liked the way this conditioner felt, but I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with it as I was with their shampoo, which had its own distinct feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it smells amazing</li>
            <li>Nourish Conditioner for Damaged hair is great for getting damaged hair silky smooth and feeling ultra conditioned.  </li>
            <li>actually really liked Bed Head shampoo &amp; conditioner</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo that goes with this product and liked it also.</li>
            <li>Still, the smoothing effects were really nice, and if it hadn&#x27;t been for the scent I would have liked it.</li>
            <li>nice conditioner for damge hair...</li>
            <li>Toni&amp;Guy brand has been popular for years in the UK, and there are T&amp;G salons all over.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is nice.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I love it even more!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love!</li>
            <li>This has a nice clean scent and the formula is rich and feels great on my hair.</li>
            <li>Softened my hair nicely and allowed me to run a brush through my hair easily</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>I love this scent of both the shampoo &amp; conditioner of this damaged hair care lines..</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad to have tried some of them</li>
            <li>bottle has an interesting push top that opens the bottle.  </li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t end up with movie-star or model hair, it was visibly better than before.</li>
            <li>Still, I went ahead and applied it, and was quite pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks and feels better when I use it.</li>
            <li>more expensive.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m wondering if it suites me better to use this product just once in a while.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>I like a citrus or my favorite Paul Mitchell line of product scent.</li>
            <li>They have a unique product with its own feel</li>
            <li>I have hair that tends to frizz easily and this does give me more manageable control during the day.  </li>
            <li>think this did a great job making my hair look closer to what you might see in a magazine ad, but it&#x27;d didn&#x27;t completely transform it.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with the results, primarily the smoothing it achieved, but</li>
            <li>My hair was easy to style.</li>
            <li>It was a bit strong for my tastes, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong and we all like it.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong but does eventually wear off during the day.  </li>
            <li>The bottle was super easy to use,the conditioner is thicker than the shampoo, still it is easy to dispense and the top unscrews easily when you get to the bottom of the bottle</li>
            <li>It cleans my hair and removes all the build up and leaves it silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I can even get free shipping from the UK if i spend over $30.00.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to work it into scalp.  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoy that.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t do much to smooth my hair, but it did seem to condition it well, and even after a couple of days my hair felt silky, so</li>
            <li>Love the smell and super clean feel this leaves</li>
            <li>and it just feels so light and fluffy but looks perfectly put-together?</li>
            <li>If you want to put your best foot forward, this is probably worth the investment, but if your hair generally looks good anyway (as mine did when I was younger), then it may not be worth the added cost.</li>
            <li>If you want to put your best foot forward, this is probably worth the investment, but if your hair generally looks good anyway (as mine did when I was younger), then it may not be worth the added cost.</li>
            <li>The conditioner has a nice fragrance (though a bit strong for my taste) and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair was &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean so there is no residue still clinging</li>
            <li>All in all this is a great conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li>Not too perfumy, a clean neutral smell.</li>
            <li>Would buy them both to get the full</li>
            <li>But if you take a minute to rinse thoroughly, it leaves your hair soft and nice.</li>
            <li>it has never been the same until this wonderful product my hair is back</li>
            <li>Even though this is adequate, I wouldn&#x27;t switch because of two things - 1)</li>
            <li>With long hair, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good quality conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It spreads easily though the hair so you don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li>I think that, with regular use, my hair would continue to improve and this is absolutely a higher end product which costs more and gives better results.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft, love this product</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and it looks so much better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their products are the kind that you will want to use extra diligence with to work into your hair.</li>
            <li>I liked the feel, but ultimately I wasn&#x27;t blown away.</li>
            <li>I liked this conditioner well enough.</li>
            <li>Once you break that initial seal, the button will be very easy to use afterwards.  </li>
            <li>so I was not shocked that I like this combination so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used better conditioners that were more expensive, but for this price range, it&#x27;s a nice selection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was great when I would reach for it in my morning shower more often than any other product, it was a sad, dark day when I ran out lol, ready to get more</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed while trying this product out for the first time was the scent.</li>
            <li>I was really thrilled with this product, so much in fact that I&#x27;m going to stat regularly buying the whole line.</li>
            <li>I started at the mid point and worked to the roots and then rubbed the conditioned hair onto my scalp to spread what was dripping off the ends into the top of my hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth as well as the toni and guy natural conditioner that I used to use in India</li>
            <li>The first time I used the Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner I felt like it wasn&#x27;t washing out of my hair all the way.</li>
            <li>I ran out of my normal conditioner and started using this product and this makes my hair feel just as good as my other conditioner which is</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which I generally like in my hair care products and 2)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant, a kind of musky scent like men&#x27;s products, but it gave me a headache especially after the second day.</li>
            <li>I was new to Toni&amp;Guy products before trying their conditioner and shampoo, and in general I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It did help tame the frizz on my curly hair, smelled great and my hair was soft.</li>
            <li>definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re new to Toni&amp;Guy.</li>
            <li>my hair felt super soft and manageable with this conditioner..</li>
            <li>The shape and size of the bottles were easy to open and handle in the shower&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>This conditioner comes in a very sleek, streamlined bottle and it makes my hair very soft and silky, it had powerful moisture that leaves my hair feeling very refreshed and pampered</li>
            <li>After it was dried though it truly looked amazing.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t have that type of hair.</li>
            <li>Our hair is much, much easier to style after using this conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this line of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li>and I can really see and feel the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I was absolutely stunned at how my hair felt and &amp;#34;behaved.&amp;#34; You know that feeling when you get your hair cut</li>
            <li>The style lasted 3 days before I washed again without looking greasy, which I appreciated, being a mom that can&#x27;t get a hair washing in everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li>(My hair is very long.)&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>, I was surprised that it smelled relatively &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; given that the shampoo smells more &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>A few years ago Unilever bought them, and it&#x27;s nice to see it here in the USA.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is like every other similar shampoo, but this conditioner really is quite good.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s results, but I prefer many of my other conditioners.</li>
            <li>Rinses out very easily yet very thick and rich in consistency.</li>
            <li>Left my hair soft and easy to manage</li>
            <li>My extremely fine hair tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>This does all three and for a decent price.  </li>
            <li>The cream is definitely better than some of the thinner fluid that runs through your fingers before you actually get it into your hair.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is very unique and took me a second to figure out how to open it.  </li>
            <li>I have damaged hair mostly on the ends from daily use with a flat iron.</li>
            <li>Toni &amp; Guy Nourish Conditioner is a fabulous conditioner that makes my hair feel fuller and soft and really helps my dry ends.</li>
            <li>I prefer the regular easy squeeze bottles - this is really sturdy (so it&#x27;s convenient for traveling, actually)</li>
            <li>but now it&#x27;s very easy to open and use in the shower with wet hands.  </li>
            <li>I like the bottle a lot - it&#x27;s very easy to open when your hands are wet, but yet quite secure when it&#x27;s closed from accidental spills.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not that much more expensive than regular good shampoo and conditioners, I&#x27;m totally hooked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Toni&amp;Guy products are new to me</li>
            <li>if your hair is extremely dry, but for moderately dry hair that just needs a little extra TLC, it is perfect.</li>
            <li>My hair laid well, styled easily and had less frizz.</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not back to smell on my husband, I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy smelling like men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>The criteria I generally establish for how intense the smell is is whether or not it makes me sneeze and</li>
            <li>After two days, I noticed distinct improvement in my hair (long, naturally wavy, dyed and with some split ends).</li>
            <li>The scent is much stronger at first when it is poured out onto your hair, but I can barely smell it after I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I think in general less easy to use.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft, but not limp.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and manageable</li>
            <li>It  has a bit of a masculine scent to it, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and didn&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li>product does stand above much of its competition.</li>
            <li>Additionally, the conditioner has a musky scent to it which makes is markedly masculine smelling.  </li>
            <li>This works very well, especially in conjunction with the shampoo.</li>
            <li>But admittedly, I am a bit self conscious for an hour after the shower that I am a cloud of perfume.</li>
            <li>My hair is thick, coarse all on its own</li>
            <li>It is hard to find a good shampoo/conditioner combination that gets my roots clean and my ends conditioned - it&#x27;s a tough balance.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is much thinner than what I normally expect for dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I think I should have opened it the first time with dry hands.</li>
            <li>Just like many products that I&#x27;ve tried, my hair reacts favorably to the first application, then reacts poorly the second time.</li>
            <li>This product worked fine - it conditioned my hair about as well as the product I usually use.  </li>
            <li>is the first thing I&#x27;ve used that has actually made a different to my hair.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t normally think hair products make that big of a difference to my hair.</li>
            <li>Importantly, we are to leave this in our hair a few moments and only then rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This has a fairly complex floral scent, and it&#x27;s a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The product dispenses nicely, and will last quite a long time as a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I generally need a lot of conditioner because of the volume of hair I have, and I felt I needed to skimp on this.</li>
            <li>It does a really good job moisturizing, but as a result caused my skin to go crazy.  </li>
            <li>My biggest nemesis, though, is oiliness; most conditioners leave my hair a limp mess by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(brown highlighted blonde with foils, 50 year old, curly, Irish, sometimes flat-ironed/sometimes not, trimmed every other month),  which is really all I ask from a conditioner, The scent was light and pleasing, hard for me to place, floral and musky maybe?</li>
            <li>I have fine and now slightly thinning highlighted blonde hair with probably 20% gray, which can be a pain to take care of, especially as I wear it long.  </li>
            <li>While it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it didn&#x27;t exactly do much for the volume.  </li>
            <li>We use flat irons and blow dry our hair frequently, so our hair could use some help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It cleans my hair and removes all the build up and leaves it silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I can even get free shipping from the UK if i spend over $30.00.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to work it into scalp.  </li>
            <li> and I really enjoy that.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do much to smooth my hair, but it did seem to condition it well, and even after a couple of days my hair felt silky, so</li>
            <li> Love the smell and super clean feel this leaves</li>
            <li> and it just feels so light and fluffy but looks perfectly put-together?</li>
            <li> If you want to put your best foot forward, this is probably worth the investment, but if your hair generally looks good anyway (as mine did when I was younger), then it may not be worth the added cost.</li>
            <li> If you want to put your best foot forward, this is probably worth the investment, but if your hair generally looks good anyway (as mine did when I was younger), then it may not be worth the added cost.</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a nice fragrance (though a bit strong for my taste) and leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair was &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean so there is no residue still clinging</li>
            <li> All in all this is a great conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Not too perfumy, a clean neutral smell.</li>
            <li> Would buy them both to get the full</li>
            <li> But if you take a minute to rinse thoroughly, it leaves your hair soft and nice.</li>
            <li> it has never been the same until this wonderful product my hair is back</li>
            <li> Even though this is adequate, I wouldn&#x27;t switch because of two things - 1)</li>
            <li> With long hair, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good quality conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It spreads easily though the hair so you don&#x27;t have to use too much.</li>
            <li> I think that, with regular use, my hair would continue to improve and this is absolutely a higher end product which costs more and gives better results.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft, love this product</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and it looks so much better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their products are the kind that you will want to use extra diligence with to work into your hair.</li>
            <li> I liked the feel, but ultimately I wasn&#x27;t blown away.</li>
            <li> I liked this conditioner well enough.</li>
            <li> Once you break that initial seal, the button will be very easy to use afterwards.  </li>
            <li> so I was not shocked that I like this combination so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used better conditioners that were more expensive, but for this price range, it&#x27;s a nice selection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was great when I would reach for it in my morning shower more often than any other product, it was a sad, dark day when I ran out lol, ready to get more</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed while trying this product out for the first time was the scent.</li>
            <li> I was really thrilled with this product, so much in fact that I&#x27;m going to stat regularly buying the whole line.</li>
            <li> I started at the mid point and worked to the roots and then rubbed the conditioned hair onto my scalp to spread what was dripping off the ends into the top of my hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth as well as the toni and guy natural conditioner that I used to use in India</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner I felt like it wasn&#x27;t washing out of my hair all the way.</li>
            <li> I ran out of my normal conditioner and started using this product and this makes my hair feel just as good as my other conditioner which is</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which I generally like in my hair care products and 2)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant, a kind of musky scent like men&#x27;s products, but it gave me a headache especially after the second day.</li>
            <li> I was new to Toni&amp;Guy products before trying their conditioner and shampoo, and in general I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> It did help tame the frizz on my curly hair, smelled great and my hair was soft.</li>
            <li> definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re new to Toni&amp;Guy.</li>
            <li> my hair felt super soft and manageable with this conditioner..</li>
            <li> The shape and size of the bottles were easy to open and handle in the shower&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> This conditioner comes in a very sleek, streamlined bottle and it makes my hair very soft and silky, it had powerful moisture that leaves my hair feeling very refreshed and pampered</li>
            <li> After it was dried though it truly looked amazing.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t have that type of hair.</li>
            <li> Our hair is much, much easier to style after using this conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this line of shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable.</li>
            <li> and I can really see and feel the difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I was absolutely stunned at how my hair felt and &amp;#34;behaved.&amp;#34; You know that feeling when you get your hair cut</li>
            <li> The style lasted 3 days before I washed again without looking greasy, which I appreciated, being a mom that can&#x27;t get a hair washing in everyday.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (My hair is very long.)&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> , I was surprised that it smelled relatively &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; given that the shampoo smells more &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> A few years ago Unilever bought them, and it&#x27;s nice to see it here in the USA.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is like every other similar shampoo, but this conditioner really is quite good.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s results, but I prefer many of my other conditioners.</li>
            <li> Rinses out very easily yet very thick and rich in consistency.</li>
            <li> Left my hair soft and easy to manage</li>
            <li> My extremely fine hair tends to be dry.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> This does all three and for a decent price.  </li>
            <li> The cream is definitely better than some of the thinner fluid that runs through your fingers before you actually get it into your hair.  </li>
            <li> The bottle is very unique and took me a second to figure out how to open it.  </li>
            <li> I have damaged hair mostly on the ends from daily use with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Toni &amp; Guy Nourish Conditioner is a fabulous conditioner that makes my hair feel fuller and soft and really helps my dry ends.</li>
            <li> I prefer the regular easy squeeze bottles - this is really sturdy (so it&#x27;s convenient for traveling, actually)</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s very easy to open and use in the shower with wet hands.  </li>
            <li> I like the bottle a lot - it&#x27;s very easy to open when your hands are wet, but yet quite secure when it&#x27;s closed from accidental spills.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not that much more expensive than regular good shampoo and conditioners, I&#x27;m totally hooked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Toni&amp;Guy products are new to me</li>
            <li> if your hair is extremely dry, but for moderately dry hair that just needs a little extra TLC, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> My hair laid well, styled easily and had less frizz.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not back to smell on my husband, I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy smelling like men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li> The criteria I generally establish for how intense the smell is is whether or not it makes me sneeze and</li>
            <li> After two days, I noticed distinct improvement in my hair (long, naturally wavy, dyed and with some split ends).</li>
            <li> The scent is much stronger at first when it is poured out onto your hair, but I can barely smell it after I blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I think in general less easy to use.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft, but not limp.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and manageable</li>
            <li> It  has a bit of a masculine scent to it, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and didn&#x27;t bother</li>
            <li> product does stand above much of its competition.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the conditioner has a musky scent to it which makes is markedly masculine smelling.  </li>
            <li> This works very well, especially in conjunction with the shampoo.</li>
            <li> But admittedly, I am a bit self conscious for an hour after the shower that I am a cloud of perfume.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick, coarse all on its own</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a good shampoo/conditioner combination that gets my roots clean and my ends conditioned - it&#x27;s a tough balance.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is much thinner than what I normally expect for dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I think I should have opened it the first time with dry hands.</li>
            <li> Just like many products that I&#x27;ve tried, my hair reacts favorably to the first application, then reacts poorly the second time.</li>
            <li> This product worked fine - it conditioned my hair about as well as the product I usually use.  </li>
            <li> is the first thing I&#x27;ve used that has actually made a different to my hair.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t normally think hair products make that big of a difference to my hair.</li>
            <li> Importantly, we are to leave this in our hair a few moments and only then rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has a fairly complex floral scent, and it&#x27;s a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The product dispenses nicely, and will last quite a long time as a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I generally need a lot of conditioner because of the volume of hair I have, and I felt I needed to skimp on this.</li>
            <li> It does a really good job moisturizing, but as a result caused my skin to go crazy.  </li>
            <li> My biggest nemesis, though, is oiliness; most conditioners leave my hair a limp mess by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (brown highlighted blonde with foils, 50 year old, curly, Irish, sometimes flat-ironed/sometimes not, trimmed every other month),  which is really all I ask from a conditioner, The scent was light and pleasing, hard for me to place, floral and musky maybe?</li>
            <li> I have fine and now slightly thinning highlighted blonde hair with probably 20% gray, which can be a pain to take care of, especially as I wear it long.  </li>
            <li> While it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it didn&#x27;t exactly do much for the volume.  </li>
            <li> We use flat irons and blow dry our hair frequently, so our hair could use some help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to push very hard down on the indented button on the top and the dispenser will pop up.  </li>
            <li> I flat iron daily and wash twice weekly.</li>
            <li> Like I said with the shampoo this product is a little high priced for the amount you get which is 8.5 ounce</li>
            <li> left my hair soft and fragrant, and not overly weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Using such a small amount was a choice I made based on the relatively high cost of this conditioner and it was barely enough to make combing my hair out doable.</li>
            <li> ; on a conditioner bottle is a sign that it will be overkill and make my hair look flat and chunky.  </li>
            <li> I color it on a regular basis and my hair is fairly long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never actually heard of this brand before, but I am always on the search for a shampoo and conditioner that will do something to help out my dry, damaged, frizzy, uncontrollable hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing is my regular conditioner works just as well and is almost half the price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t fade after a while like other conditioners do; in fact, the scent lingers for the entire 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Would recommend if you have dry frizzy hair and haven&#x27;t found anything to work for you yet.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse, dry, naturally wavy/curly, virgin hair that</li>
            <li> It was a little hard to get it opened the first time</li>
            <li> While it works well, I&#x27;m not sure I can say that it works so well that it justifies the high cost for such a small amount of conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My head started itching constantly and was greasy, I finally decided the product was no good after trying to force myself to use it for several weeks and got ride of it.</li>
            <li> Toni&amp;Guy products are a little different from the rest.</li>
            <li> For the few days I used it, I&#x27;d say its conditioning power was about on par with some of the mid-level drugstore brands, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay the few extra dollars for this particular product.</li>
            <li> I have medium length hair and only needed a small amount of either the shampoo or conditioner</li>
            <li> You just push down one side and the other pops up, then it dispenses easily.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The conditioner is very thick and coats your hair completely.</li>
            <li> unfortunately the scent was just too much for me.</li>
            <li> down,...</li>
            <li> I can go 3-4 days without it looking greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> My processed hair calmed down, and tangles were easier to manage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> this didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the conditioner in a relatively small amount even though I have very long hair.</li>
            <li> conditioner itself is white, and a thick lotion that is fragrant, but not strongly so, in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> When I dried my hair, it felt heat and weighed down by the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After washing my hair, I apply this conditioner and just leave it on for a little while as I wash my face and then rinse it off</li>
            <li> I leave it on a few minutes and rinse it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also somewhat dull, as much due to my age (49) as anything</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be one of the few non-Vine reviewers here - no free sample for me!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and this made it heavy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> I usually just pick them on which consistency and scent</li>
            <li> The fragrance was not overwhelming lingering in my hair</li>
            <li> I think I will stick with my usual.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is one of those moisturize now, dry it out bad later shampoos.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After bleaching my very thin hair and then went back to brown</li>
            <li> If you have really thin hair might want to consider using other product.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my dry, damaged, thin hair!</li>
            <li> This conditioned just as well as any thick conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not incredibly damaged, but it does suffer from frizziness and flyaway hair to some extent.</li>
            <li> combination of both the shampoo and cleanser made my hair look smoother while retaining volume (often a difficult feat) as well as enhanced shine.</li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of crazy expensive shampoos to just semi-expensive and a mix of the two.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft, love this product</li>
            <li> This is okay. If you have really thin hair might want to consider using other product. I have thick hair and this made it heavy and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and super clean feel this leaves</li>
            <li> I like ti. Gives you body and feels good on your hair.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed while trying this product out for the first time was the scent. I noted that it reminded me of a men&#x27;s cologne.  The second thing I noticed while trying this product out was, how silky it made my hair.  It does a really good job moisturizing, but as a result caused my skin to go crazy.  My head started itching constantly and was greasy, I finally decided the product was no good after trying to force myself to use it for several weeks and got ride of it. I would not recommend it</li>
            <li> I love this scent of both the shampoo &amp; conditioner of this damaged hair care lines..my hair felt super soft and manageable with this conditioner..Plus it didnt weight my hair down,...i definitley will rebuy this again, i hope they got these in 32oz sizes? love them!!!</li>
            <li> This review goes hand-in-hand with the review of the Toni &amp; Guy Cleanse Shampoo for Damaged Hair. I have thick, coarse, dry, naturally wavy/curly, virgin hair that I flat iron daily and wash twice weekly. It is hard to find a good shampoo/conditioner combination that gets my roots clean and my ends conditioned - it&#x27;s a tough balance. I have tried all sorts of crazy expensive shampoos to just semi-expensive and a mix of the two. From Bed Head (which was the same brand as Toni &amp; Guy), Kerastase, Pureology, Paul Mitchell, Alterna, Bumble, Aveda, literally the list goes on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually really liked Bed Head shampoo &amp; conditioner so I was not shocked that I like this combination so much. It cleans my hair and removes all the build up and leaves it silky smooth. I can go 3-4 days without it looking greasy or weighed down. I literally have no complaints about this conditioner. It&#x27;s now my go to shampoo and conditioner and I will continue to buy it. Love Love Love!</li>
            <li> I was new to Toni&amp;Guy products before trying their conditioner and shampoo, and in general I&#x27;m glad I did. The conditioner has a nice fragrance (though a bit strong for my taste) and leaves my hair soft and shiny. I&#x27;d say it works as well as more expensive products I&#x27;ve tried...definitely worth a try if you&#x27;re new to Toni&amp;Guy.</li>
            <li> Sometimes, &amp;#34;damaged hair&amp;#34; on a conditioner bottle is a sign that it will be overkill and make my hair look flat and chunky.  With this product, I didn&#x27;t have that issue at all.  My hair feels soft, but not limp.  The fragrance is very mild and pleasant.  This may not be the best product if your hair is extremely dry, but for moderately dry hair that just needs a little extra TLC, it is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It makes my hair so soft and manageable and I really don&#x27;t have that type of hair. My hair is thick, coarse all on its own but now I have damage from some over processing that I had done recently. I&#x27;ve been applying oils, masks and deep conditioners and this product along with the shampoo is the first thing I&#x27;ve used that has actually made a different to my hair. I can actually feel my hair transforming as I start washing and conditioning it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t normally think hair products make that big of a difference to my hair. I usually just pick them on which consistency and scent I prefer but Toni&amp;Guy&#x27;s Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner for Damaged Hair has made a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The Toni&amp;Guy products are new to me and I&#x27;m so glad to have tried some of them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is made especially for damaged hair.  We use flat irons and blow dry our hair frequently, so our hair could use some help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seemed to moisturize our hair well and it gave it a lot of shine.  Our hair is much, much easier to style after using this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle has an interesting push top that opens the bottle.  It was a little hard to get it opened the first time but now it&#x27;s very easy to open and use in the shower with wet hands.  I think I should have opened it the first time with dry hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never actually heard of this brand before, but I am always on the search for a shampoo and conditioner that will do something to help out my dry, damaged, frizzy, uncontrollable hair. I really like this line of shampoo and conditioner. The scent is pleasant and very light, not overpowering at all. It makes my hair feel soft and it looks so much better. Every time I use both the shampoo and conditioner I love it even more!</li>
            <li> I was really thrilled with this product, so much in fact that I&#x27;m going to stat regularly buying the whole line. This conditioner comes in a very sleek, streamlined bottle and it makes my hair very soft and silky, it had powerful moisture that leaves my hair feeling very refreshed and pampered, it&#x27;s not that much more expensive than regular good shampoo and conditioners, I&#x27;m totally hooked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew it was great when I would reach for it in my morning shower more often than any other product, it was a sad, dark day when I ran out lol, ready to get more now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Kasia S.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo that goes with this product and liked it also. The smell was great and it made my hair feel manageable and silky after. Like I said with the shampoo this product is a little high priced for the amount you get which is 8.5 ounce but it is a very good product. Would buy them both to get the full experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product!</li>
            <li> I used both these Cleanse Shampoo and Conditioner for damaged hair from Toni &amp; Guy together to give the product line a fair shake and I was fairly impressed with the results. My hair is not incredibly damaged, but it does suffer from frizziness and flyaway hair to some extent. It&#x27;s also somewhat dull, as much due to my age (49) as anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination of both the shampoo and cleanser made my hair look smoother while retaining volume (often a difficult feat) as well as enhanced shine. While I didn&#x27;t end up with movie-star or model hair, it was visibly better than before. This was after only one use, so I can imagine it may improve further with multiple uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the conditioner, I was surprised that it smelled relatively &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; given that the shampoo smells more &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34;. It was a bit strong for my tastes, but not overbearing. The criteria I generally establish for how intense the smell is is whether or not it makes me sneeze and this didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the conditioner in a relatively small amount even though I have very long hair. I started at the mid point and worked to the roots and then rubbed the conditioned hair onto my scalp to spread what was dripping off the ends into the top of my hair. Using such a small amount was a choice I made based on the relatively high cost of this conditioner and it was barely enough to make combing my hair out doable. I generally need a lot of conditioner because of the volume of hair I have, and I felt I needed to skimp on this. If you&#x27;re prone to tangling, this probably is not going to be the best choice, but you can get by if you&#x27;re more liberal with the application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this did a great job making my hair look closer to what you might see in a magazine ad, but it&#x27;d didn&#x27;t completely transform it. I think that, with regular use, my hair would continue to improve and this is absolutely a higher end product which costs more and gives better results. If you want to put your best foot forward, this is probably worth the investment, but if your hair generally looks good anyway (as mine did when I was younger), then it may not be worth the added cost.If you want to put your best foot forward, this is probably worth the investment, but if your hair generally looks good anyway (as mine did when I was younger), then it may not be worth the added cost.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product and used both the shampoo and conditioner&lt;br /&gt;1. The shape and size of the bottles were easy to open and handle in the shower&lt;br /&gt;2. The fragrance was not overwhelming lingering in my hair&lt;br /&gt;3. I have medium length hair and only needed a small amount of either the shampoo or conditioner&lt;br /&gt;4. My hair was &amp;#34;squeaky&amp;#34; clean so there is no residue still clinging&lt;br /&gt;5. Left my hair soft and easy to manage&lt;br /&gt;6. My hair did not require washing every day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is much thinner than what I normally expect for dry hair.  Still, I went ahead and applied it, and was quite pleased with the results.  This conditioned just as well as any thick conditioner I&#x27;ve used.  It left my hair feeling soft and smooth.  This has a fairly complex floral scent, and it&#x27;s a strong scent.  I found it to be pleasant.  All in all this is a great conditioner for dry hair.</li>
            <li> After two days, I noticed distinct improvement in my hair (long, naturally wavy, dyed and with some split ends). I was pleased with the results, primarily the smoothing it achieved, but unfortunately the scent was just too much for me. It didn&#x27;t fade after a while like other conditioners do; in fact, the scent lingers for the entire 24 hours. It&#x27;s not unpleasant, a kind of musky scent like men&#x27;s products, but it gave me a headache especially after the second day. I waited a week and tried again, and again only made it two days before I had to give it up. For the few days I used it, I&#x27;d say its conditioning power was about on par with some of the mid-level drugstore brands, and I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d pay the few extra dollars for this particular product. Still, the smoothing effects were really nice, and if it hadn&#x27;t been for the scent I would have liked it.</li>
            <li> I have course hair and a lot of it. This product tames my hair. My hair looks and feels better when I use it. The cost is reasonable.I can even get free shipping from the UK if i spend over $30.00.</li>
            <li> Works wonders on my dry, damaged, thin hair! I have already purchased another bottle.</li>
            <li> I have damaged hair mostly on the ends from daily use with a flat iron. Toni &amp; Guy Nourish Conditioner is a fabulous conditioner that makes my hair feel fuller and soft and really helps my dry ends. I ran out of my normal conditioner and started using this product and this makes my hair feel just as good as my other conditioner which is more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing my hair, I apply this conditioner and just leave it on for a little while as I wash my face and then rinse it off and it leaves my hair in wonderful condition. Will purchase again! This has a nice clean scent and the formula is rich and feels great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Just like many products that I&#x27;ve tried, my hair reacts favorably to the first application, then reacts poorly the second time. I&#x27;m wondering if it suites me better to use this product just once in a while. I&#x27;m still experimenting so can&#x27;t draw any conclusions yet. Just had to try this conditioner because it has my name on it!</li>
            <li> After bleaching my very thin hair and then went back to brown it has never been the same until this wonderful product my hair is back I love it and it smells amazing</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth as well as the toni and guy natural conditioner that I used to use in India</li>
            <li> I used this twice and I can really see and feel the difference in my hair. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and I&#x27;ll continue to use it once or twice a week.</li>
            <li> This conditioner can be used sparingly.  It&#x27;s important to work it into scalp.  The directions say to massage and comb into hair.  Importantly, we are to leave this in our hair a few moments and only then rinse out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does something terrific - on my hair and for others in my family.  Everybody likes it.  The scent isn&#x27;t strong and we all like it.</li>
            <li> Rinses out very easily yet very thick and rich in consistency. Not too perfumy, a clean neutral smell. Not toofemmy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be one of the few non-Vine reviewers here - no free sample for me! (Though I was introduced to the product through a subscription beauty box.)  I have fine and now slightly thinning highlighted blonde hair with probably 20% gray, which can be a pain to take care of, especially as I wear it long.  My biggest nemesis, though, is oiliness; most conditioners leave my hair a limp mess by the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I tried my sample of this shampoo &amp; conditioner I was absolutely stunned at how my hair felt and &amp;#34;behaved.&amp;#34; You know that feeling when you get your hair cut and it just feels so light and fluffy but looks perfectly put-together? That&#x27;s how my hair feels after using these products! I immediately came to Amazon after my second shower/style to purchase the pair, as this just became my Holy Grail of hair care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t recommend it highly enough!</li>
            <li> The first time I used the Nourish Shampoo and Conditioner I felt like it wasn&#x27;t washing out of my hair all the way. When I dried my hair, it felt heat and weighed down by the product. After it was dried though it truly looked amazing. My hair laid well, styled easily and had less frizz. The style lasted 3 days before I washed again without looking greasy, which I appreciated, being a mom that can&#x27;t get a hair washing in everyday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product dispenses nicely, and will last quite a long time as a little bit goes a long way. The shampoo foams just enough to make you feel the cleaning. The conditioner is very thick and coats your hair completely. It  has a bit of a masculine scent to it, but it doesn&#x27;t linger and didn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really loved the Toni&amp;Guy line.</li>
            <li> Toni&amp;Guy products are a little different from the rest. They have a unique product with its own feel and I really enjoy that. I liked the way this conditioner felt, but I wasn&#x27;t as impressed with it as I was with their shampoo, which had its own distinct feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their products are the kind that you will want to use extra diligence with to work into your hair. As a swimmer, I felt like this did supply extra value for damaged hair, which can often be a mixed bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does stand above much of its competition. I liked the feel, but ultimately I wasn&#x27;t blown away. There&#x27;s results, but I prefer many of my other conditioners.</li>
            <li> My extremely fine hair tends to be dry.  I color it on a regular basis and my hair is fairly long.  I am always looking for conditioner that smells good, adds moisture to my hair, and acts as a detangler.  This does all three and for a decent price.  The scent is much stronger at first when it is poured out onto your hair, but I can barely smell it after I blow dry my hair.  It&#x27;s a thicker conditioner that seems to do a good job moisturizing my hair.  The cream is definitely better than some of the thinner fluid that runs through your fingers before you actually get it into your hair.  I don&#x27;t like the shampoo in this line because of the scent, so I&#x27;d recommend a different shampoo with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I liked this conditioner well enough. It did help tame the frizz on my curly hair, smelled great and my hair was soft. The only thing is my regular conditioner works just as well and is almost half the price. I think I will stick with my usual. Would recommend if you have dry frizzy hair and haven&#x27;t found anything to work for you yet.</li>
            <li> With long hair, I&#x27;m always on the lookout for good quality conditioner.  Toni&amp;Guy Nourish Conditioner for Damaged hair is great for getting damaged hair silky smooth and feeling ultra conditioned.  The bottle is very unique and took me a second to figure out how to open it.  You&#x27;ll have to push very hard down on the indented button on the top and the dispenser will pop up.  Once you break that initial seal, the button will be very easy to use afterwards.  The conditioner is on par with conditioners such as Pantene.  While it works well, I&#x27;m not sure I can say that it works so well that it justifies the high cost for such a small amount of conditioner.  Additionally, the conditioner has a musky scent to it which makes is markedly masculine smelling.  While it&#x27;s not back to smell on my husband, I personally didn&#x27;t enjoy smelling like men&#x27;s cologne.  That aside, this conditioner is quite good, and if you&#x27;re a fan of musky scent and don&#x27;t mind the price, this would be perfect for you.</li>
            <li> This works very well, especially in conjunction with the shampoo. I have hair that tends to frizz easily and this does give me more manageable control during the day.  The scent is a bit strong but does eventually wear off during the day.  But admittedly, I am a bit self conscious for an hour after the shower that I am a cloud of perfume.</li>
            <li> nice conditioner for damge hair...</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner along with the matching shampoo. The shampoo is like every other similar shampoo, but this conditioner really is quite good. My processed hair calmed down, and tangles were easier to manage.&lt;br /&gt;The Toni&amp;Guy brand has been popular for years in the UK, and there are T&amp;G salons all over. A few years ago Unilever bought them, and it&#x27;s nice to see it here in the USA.</li>
            <li> I like the bottle a lot - it&#x27;s very easy to open when your hands are wet, but yet quite secure when it&#x27;s closed from accidental spills.  You just push down one side and the other pops up, then it dispenses easily.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner itself is white, and a thick lotion that is fragrant, but not strongly so, in my opinion.  That&#x27;s always subjective but I didn&#x27;t find it overwhelming.  It&#x27;s fairly nondescript- it&#x27;s a unisex fragrance that did linger for 24 hours, but never bothered me, it rather faded into oblivion until I found my nose close to some of my hair.  (My hair is very long.)&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair soft and fragrant, and not overly weighed down.  It didn&#x27;t do much to smooth my hair, but it did seem to condition it well, and even after a couple of days my hair felt silky, so I don&#x27;t think this is one of those moisturize now, dry it out bad later shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;It is nice. While it didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down, it didn&#x27;t exactly do much for the volume.  I&#x27;ve used better conditioners that were more expensive, but for this price range, it&#x27;s a nice selection.</li>
            <li> I like the  Toni and Guy Nourish shampoo and I think that this conditioner works well with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner feels great. It spreads easily though the hair so you don&#x27;t have to use too much. I leave it on a few minutes and rinse it out. The only downside is if you don&#x27;t get it fully rinsed your hair will be quite sticky. But if you take a minute to rinse thoroughly, it leaves your hair soft and nice. My hair was easy to style. It wasn&#x27;t weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> Softened my hair nicely and allowed me to run a brush through my hair easily (brown highlighted blonde with foils, 50 year old, curly, Irish, sometimes flat-ironed/sometimes not, trimmed every other month),  which is really all I ask from a conditioner, The scent was light and pleasing, hard for me to place, floral and musky maybe? I like a citrus or my favorite Paul Mitchell line of product scent. The bottle was super easy to use,the conditioner is thicker than the shampoo, still it is easy to dispense and the top unscrews easily when you get to the bottom of the bottle so you can use it all.</li>
            <li> This product worked fine - it conditioned my hair about as well as the product I usually use.  Even though this is adequate, I wouldn&#x27;t switch because of two things - 1) it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, which I generally like in my hair care products and 2) I prefer the regular easy squeeze bottles - this is really sturdy (so it&#x27;s convenient for traveling, actually) but I think in general less easy to use.</li>
