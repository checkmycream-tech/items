    <ol>
            <li>Excellent</li>
            <li>and they are quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li>One bright point:  </li>
            <li>And Amazon has it at a good price</li>
            <li>What good are dentures if they do not stick where they are supposed to?</li>
            <li>Did a good job, held &#x27;</li>
            <li>Poligrip ORIGINAL is the best!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much better than Fixodent!</li>
            <li>Product work amazing to help with dentures</li>
            <li>Great product, and it&#x27;s zinc free.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s kind .</li>
            <li>and they just love this product.</li>
            <li>it helps her partials stay in much better while she eats her steak, and eggs.</li>
            <li>She makes sure (quite often) that I fully understand it&#x27;s poliGRIP and not poliDENT.</li>
            <li>They received the order the day they started thinking about needing to buy more.</li>
            <li>if the supermarket is running a sale, the price is more.  </li>
            <li>Holds slightly better than others.</li>
            <li>til I bought more.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am happy to say I don&#x27;t have to use this stuff, but if I do, I&#x27;ll know which one to buy.</li>
            <li>But the Original Super Poli Grip PINK works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>Wow does this stuff hold good, but not quite all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to wearing a denture and it didn&#x27;t take long to know this is the best!</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t know how it works on full dentures.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes this add-on price if good, other times</li>
            <li>Fast shipper and you can not go wrong with Super Poligrip,it is great !!!!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Feels sort of funny reviewing Poligrip.</li>
            <li>to the point that I need a towel to remove the upper denture.&lt;br /&gt;Really good stuff, sometimes later in the day, I can taste that its there.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you why the pink color works better for me than the others.  </li>
            <li>If your bridge or denture is well made, this should really hold you all day.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works better than any other product of it</li>
            <li>But the convenience of it as an add-on can&#x27;t be beat, and it sure surpasses some of the other name brands for hold and durability!</li>
            <li>Nothing makes them stick, and short of dental implants, which I do not consider safe because of her age, and because of the nature of implants, she opted for regular dentures.</li>
            <li>My husband swears this is the only denture cream that works, so I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a hot item.</li>
            <li>Apparently it works really well</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s the only thing that really holds her teeth in place.</li>
            <li>I have a small bridge on top, that occasionally loosens up when I eat.  </li>
            <li>Though the smell was very nice, I found that it stuck my teeth together and was generally unpleasant to use.  </li>
            <li>I either end up buying the last box/boxes, or the shelf is bare.  </li>
            <li>Fixodent loses the hold if you eat chocolate and that never happens with Super Poligrip.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I gave up trying to find this product locally.  I either end up buying the last box/boxes, or the shelf is bare.  My husband swears this is the only denture cream that works, so I guess that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a hot item.</li>
            <li> Excellent adhesive.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I only need tiny spots of it to give a solid holding power.&lt;br /&gt;Even to the point that I need a towel to remove the upper denture.&lt;br /&gt;Really good stuff, sometimes later in the day, I can taste that its there.&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2-tubes.</li>
            <li> it works the way it should but unfortunately the denturist that made my uppers really missed the boat as the teeth drop down if you bite as much as a slice of bread.  so I guess it&#x27;s not the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I have tried other denture adhesives.  But the Original Super Poli Grip PINK works the best for me.  I cannot tell you why the pink color works better for me than the others.  I just know that it does.  My dentures stay tight and food doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;lost&amp;#34; under my dentures.</li>
            <li> I purchase this for another member of my family and they just love this product. Apparently it works really well and they are quite happy with this product.</li>
            <li> My Grandmother luvs this stuff it helps her partials stay in much better while she eats her steak, and eggs. Thank You</li>
            <li> My mother is 93 and insists on poliGRIP. She makes sure (quite often) that I fully understand it&#x27;s poliGRIP and not poliDENT. She says it&#x27;s the only thing that really holds her teeth in place. So far, I am happy to say I don&#x27;t have to use this stuff, but if I do, I&#x27;ll know which one to buy. And now you do too! Hah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels sort of funny reviewing Poligrip. But there you go. And Amazon has it at a good price so I don&#x27;t have to search for it at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Wow does this stuff hold good, but not quite all day. Toward dinner you will want to reapply before eating.  I only use it for an upper partial so don&#x27;t know how it works on full dentures.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much, and - unfortunately - I have to use it every day. Poligrip ORIGINAL is the best!</li>
            <li> Fast shipper and you can not go wrong with Super Poligrip,it is great !!!!!!  It holds and holds and you can eat corn on the cob</li>
            <li> Product work amazing to help with dentures</li>
            <li> I order this stuff for my parents. They received the order the day they started thinking about needing to buy more. Props to Amazon for making their lives a little easier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to wearing a denture and it didn&#x27;t take long to know this is the best! My dentist told me to use the least amount that I can and it&#x27;s so much better than Fixodent! Fixodent loses the hold if you eat chocolate and that never happens with Super Poligrip. Who doesn&#x27;t eat chocolate?</li>
            <li> I have a small bridge on top, that occasionally loosens up when I eat.  This stuff does the trick, but you do have toput an entire stip down, not just place it in spots.  If your bridge or denture is well made, this should really hold you all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes this add-on price if good, other times if the supermarket is running a sale, the price is more.  But the convenience of it as an add-on can&#x27;t be beat, and it sure surpasses some of the other name brands for hold and durability!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and it is the only brand he will use.</li>
            <li> Super Poligrip is a little better than other brands, even though not perfect by a long shot. I have had a miserable time trying to help a member of my tribe live in comfort with dentures. Nothing makes them stick, and short of dental implants, which I do not consider safe because of her age, and because of the nature of implants, she opted for regular dentures. What good are dentures if they do not stick where they are supposed to? Very little help, it seems. 3.5 Stars.</li>
            <li> Works well and can get sent to me at a price similar as Wal-Mart. Holds slightly better than others.</li>
            <li> Though the smell was very nice, I found that it stuck my teeth together and was generally unpleasant to use.  One bright point:  It contains no calories or gluten.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other product of it&#x27;s kind .</li>
            <li> Needed this to hold in my bottoms.  Did a good job, held &#x27;til I bought more.  I thought the price would be lower than purchasing at the store, but not!</li>
            <li> Great product, and it&#x27;s zinc free.</li>
