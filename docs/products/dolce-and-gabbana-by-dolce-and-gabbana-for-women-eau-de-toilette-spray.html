            <li>Love the light, clean, fresh smell from this spray.  </li>
            <li>I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!.  </li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t get this if  you live in the DC/MD area because I don&#x27;t want too many people smelling like my love.  </li>
            <li>Both the packaging and the liquid do not match the original product.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite perfume and at first I could not get it shipped to an overseas address</li>
            <li>D&amp;G original keeps</li>
            <li>Stronger scent, higher price but women love it.</li>
            <li>So, if you like the original scent, do not buy this one.  </li>
            <li>It looks like it may have been &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34; from the original store, or manufacturer.</li>
            <li>I still have the original</li>
            <li>This is by far my most favorite fragrance of all time,.  </li>
            <li>this hold true to the people who talk about this.  </li>
            <li>, it was to strong and didn&#x27;t smell at all like it did when I had first smelled it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong but sensual, intense but not too bold.</li>
            <li>I know there are many new fragrances hitting the market</li>
            <li>Been using this since it was first launched!</li>
            <li>it is a rare find these days because it is not being sold everywhere.</li>
            <li>I really love the fact that there is no trouble with ordering.  </li>
            <li>Pay a little more and get a nice perfume real one!</li>
            <li>and I receive it right on schedule.</li>
            <li>It is hard to find these days and my Beautiful ( Patricia ) loves it.</li>
            <li>I would like my money refunded or sending new original product.</li>
            <li>At first when I saw that this was coming from Hungary (the country), I thought you must be kidding.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is I wish more people would compliment me when I am wearing this.  </li>
            <li>Most will say that they tried the blue</li>
            <li>Both times it has been exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>THIS IS MY FIRST TIME I ORDERED ONLINE.</li>
            <li>Although I didnt receive this perfume yet, I can certainly give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I will be a steady customer!</li>
            <li>This is a very high quality scent and doesn&#x27;t make your nose want to run screaming into the night.  </li>
            <li>It is a shame that D&amp;G wants to discontinue it.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t vouch for its authenticity but as for the fragranceâ€¦I always get asked what I am wearing and told how much they like it.</li>
            <li>Bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find in stores; it does not smell like the real stuff  </li>
            <li>I REALIZED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE REAL DOLCE AND GABBANA PERFUME.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the survey.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR NOTHING.</li>
            <li>really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then Light Blue in the summer.  </li>
            <li>If you are the type of young girl that likes fresh scents just like Ralph Lauren, Paris Hilton or Halloween, this is not the perfume for you.</li>
            <li>The appears to be the original product, but the clear shrink wrap was not tight and a non-original manufacturer label had been used to close it.</li>
            <li>This perfume does not smell the same as the original sample of perfume that I had.</li>
            <li>I love it and hope other people do too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so original and different!</li>
            <li>he only uses it for special occasion&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>The perfume fixative simply do not have, I can use the amount for which the smell does not last more than a minute.</li>
            <li>classic and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this as a gift.</li>
            <li>So sorry they took this particular scent off the counters,  (macy&#x27;s,  etc).&lt;br /&gt;However,  as long as I can order it on line,  everything is perfect!  </li>
            <li>Package was properly sealed, and the EDT is fresh and full-strength.  </li>
            <li>I COMPARED THE BOTTLES NEW ANS OLD, THE REAL BOTTLE HAD A NOTICEABLE COLOR DIFFERENCE IN THE LID</li>
            <li>ONCE MY WIFE OPENED THIS NEW BOTTLE AND USED IT</li>
            <li>SHE IMMEDIATELY STATED WHEN I SPRAYED MY NEW PERFUME</li>
            <li>This is my favorite pwerfume for the past 12 years and this Dolce &amp; Gabbana does not even smell....</li>
            <li>Definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like the first one I had, which makes me think this is a knock off version.</li>
            <li>AND THE ACTUAL SPRAYER WAS MUCH LARGE THAN THE REAL AND WHITE IN COLOR.</li>
            <li>so I purchased directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>This smell is unbelievable, is smooth and classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my favorite and I have an extremely hard time finding any stores that carry the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Red.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love this perfume but it has been discontinued and cannot be purchased in the stores.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon. I have had men stop me and ask what I was wearing.</li>
            <li> It is an oldie but goodie. it is a rare find these days because it is not being sold everywhere.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO, EL AROMA MAGNIFICO. LES VA A ENCANTAR ESTA FRAGANCIA, PERDURA DESPUES DE HORAS, SERAN LA SENSACION AL PASAR, YO SE LOS RECOMIENDO A LAS CHICAS.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite pwerfume for the past 12 years and this Dolce &amp; Gabbana does not even smell....It has no scent at all. This is waste of my money!!!! Very Disappointed. I wish I could send it back and get my money, this is like plain water with color. I&#x27;m very unhappy with it. I just ordered another Doilce &amp; Gabbana from the website I usually buy it from. I paid for dirty water. Not HAPPY!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The product arrived here fast and in perfect condition.  Not to mention how wonderful it smells.</li>
            <li> This product is top of the line and so was the prompt shipment.  It wasn&#x27;t expected to be received until December 18, but arrived on the 14th.  That&#x27;s speedy and efficient response to my purchase.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase through Amazon.  They have never let me down.  And the fragrance is very nice.</li>
            <li> At first when I saw that this was coming from Hungary (the country), I thought you must be kidding.  I thought it would probably take a month as indicated.  But I received it in two weeks.  Perfect!!</li>
            <li> This one smell very good and Amazon price is great! Don&#x27;t try to buy in some online store to pay a little less because you can get a fake perfume! Beware of some online store like ISFRAGRANCE is TERRIBLE!!! Pay a little more and get a nice perfume real one! ISFRAGRANCE sells FAKE!!!!!!! Buy here at Amazon.</li>
            <li> Although I didnt receive this perfume yet, I can certainly give it 5 stars. I have been using it for years and I love it.</li>
            <li> i bought it for my dad even though its for woman&lt;br /&gt;he loves it he only uses it for special occasion&lt;br /&gt;but its great : )</li>
            <li> I have worn this product for a long time.  So sorry they took this particular scent off the counters,  (macy&#x27;s,  etc).&lt;br /&gt;However,  as long as I can order it on line,  everything is perfect!  PR</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. It&#x27;s classy and not overwhelming, but it hangs around all day long.  This is a very high quality scent and doesn&#x27;t make your nose want to run screaming into the night.  People often compliment this perfume when I wear it.  I&#x27;d recommend it to someone looking for a sophisticated but sensual scent.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find these days and my Beautiful ( Patricia ) loves it. It is her favourite and it made me very popular.</li>
            <li> This perfume does not smell the same as the original sample of perfume that I had. It doesn&#x27;t have the same lasting power either.</li>
            <li> this hold true to the people who talk about this.  Has a great fragrance.  Only thing is I wish more people would compliment me when I am wearing this.  I love it and hope other people do too.</li>
            <li> I discovered this a few years ago and will only buy this perfume, was dissapointed to find that a lot of stores don&#x27;t sell it anymore.  I get lots of compliments on it from both men and women.  I love the scent.  Glad I was able to purchase it online.</li>
            <li> Hi, I wish to make a complaint in relation to the product. I have used this perfume for many years and know well the smell and packaging quality. I received this perfume is not original. Both the packaging and the liquid do not match the original product. The perfume fixative simply do not have, I can use the amount for which the smell does not last more than a minute. I would like my money refunded or sending new original product.</li>
            <li> This was delivered on time and secure where no one could grab it before I got home!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the perfume. I have been using this perfume for over 20 years and I always get a lot of compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> Product is good but it reached me after 31 days..! I ordered it on June 19th and got it on July 20th...Otherwise no complaints.!</li>
            <li> My favorite! Been using this since it was first launched! It&#x27;s so original and different! I always get asked what it is I&#x27;m &amp;#34;wearing&amp;#34;, that to me is the best compliment you can get!</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume and at first I could not get it shipped to an overseas address and now I can.  I am very happy because I got a great price for it.  I will be a steady customer!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite and I have an extremely hard time finding any stores that carry the Dolce &amp; Gabbana Red. Everytime that I wear it, someone will compliments and they all ask what I am wearing. Most will say that they tried the blue but now they wanted to the Red after smelling the scent on me.&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time that I have ordered it online and I receive it right on schedule. Both times it has been exactly what I was expecting. The ease of ordering here makes it extra great! This last time I did not even bother trying to find it locally.</li>
            <li> I had smelled this on a co-worker and it smelled so good I thought I&#x27;d try it, blech, it was to strong and didn&#x27;t smell at all like it did when I had first smelled it.</li>
            <li> D&amp;G original keeps it&#x27; s Fragrance and freshness for many hours to enjoy. It is a shame that D&amp;G wants to discontinue it.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite fragrance of all time,.  I hope they never discontinue this one.  I wear it for dressy occasions and  everyday use.  I know people say it&#x27;s more for formal wear, I just love it so much that I&#x27;ll wear it all of the time!!!</li>
            <li> Definitely doesn&#x27;t smell like the first one I had, which makes me think this is a knock off version.</li>
            <li> Good purchase and delivered in promised time.  Will bluy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it. She wears it all the time.  I love the smell as well.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased this perfume from Amazon so I can&#x27;t vouch for its authenticity but as for the fragranceâ€¦I always get asked what I am wearing and told how much they like it. My favorite scent!</li>
            <li> This is sthe best fragrance ever.....</li>
            <li> My MOM had a bottle of this that she had been saviorling drop by drop.  I was really glad to find this product for her 78th birthday.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a friend.  She loves it.  She was told it is being discontinued by Dolce &amp; Gabbana so she was very happy to receive it..</li>
            <li> Bought this recently for my cousin as a gift. She is pleased with the frangance and liked it very much</li>
            <li> My wife loved it. Soft scent, great price. Highly recommend this as a gift. Sicily is also very good. Stronger scent, higher price but women love it. That will be my next purchase.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I couldn&#x27;t find in stores; it does not smell like the real stuff  and the color is off (I have a bottle that I bought at Macy&#x27;s a few years ago to compare it to) and it doesn&#x27;t hold it&#x27;s fragrance for very long.  Save your money.  ***Update: Did some research and discovered that this is the \\&quot;new\\&quot; revamped formula.  So, if you like the original scent, do not buy this one.  D&amp;G has ruined this perfume.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THIS PERFUME FOR YEARS. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME I ORDERED ONLINE. WHEN I OPENED THE BOX I REALIZED THAT THIS WAS NOT THE REAL DOLCE AND GABBANA PERFUME. THE QUALITY OF THE BOX IS REALLY POOR AND THE BOTTLE WAS NOT FULL.THE PERFUME SMELL LIKE ALCOHOL AND IT DOES NOT LAST AT ALL.. I AM VERY DISSAPOINTED!!!.  I WILL NEVER ORDER THS PRODUCT AGAIN.. IT WAS A WASTE OF MONEY..</li>
            <li> Esse perfume dispensa comentÃ¡rios, ele Ã© maravilhoso, apesar de que eu sou apaixonada por perfumes, como minha mÃ£e. Chegou tudo direitinho.</li>
            <li> I have worn Dolce &amp; Gabbana for Women over the past 10 years and have always gotten complements from men and women.  Love the light, clean, fresh smell from this spray.  When I purchased it, I thought I was buying the parfume which is what I am use to wearing but this has a lighter scent and I enjoy wearing it.</li>
            <li> The perfume was good once I opened it, but clearly the exterior wrap had been reworked. The appears to be the original product, but the clear shrink wrap was not tight and a non-original manufacturer label had been used to close it. Ultimately, the perfume was what I wanted and I am happy with it. It looks like it may have been &amp;#34;shrinkage&amp;#34; from the original store, or manufacturer. Thanks for the survey. LP.</li>
            <li> Just what my wife wanted! Just what my wife wanted! That is all I need to say if you want a honest review!</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite perfume for EVER. And now they are no longer making it. What a shame that is.</li>
            <li> Had visited my local department store to purchase a replacement bottle only to find that it has been discontinued.  In hopes of finding one last bottle, I turned to Amazon and there it was!  The bottle that I purchased was sold by Amazon, and I am delighted with it.  Package was properly sealed, and the EDT is fresh and full-strength.  Not sure about the product sold by other sellers - from reading the reviews, it sounded like a mixed bag  - so I purchased directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this fragrance for over 20yrs and I absolutely love it. This is a beautiful scent that floats in the air when you are long gone....in a good way. I know there are many new fragrances hitting the market but this is one that stands out from the rest.</li>
            <li> I love it and have received many compliments when I&lt;br /&gt;wear it.  I will keep it in my perfume collection as long&lt;br /&gt;as it exists....</li>
            <li> Seductive obsessive tease that lasts all night!</li>
            <li> smells like you just stepped out of a shower of a sexy spicy clean scent,like fresh rain,it mixes well with other scents too.i spray it all over when im leaving house and get compliments all day,lasts.i love it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price and we did not have to leave the house and shop.  I really love the fact that there is no trouble with ordering.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This smell is unbelievable, is smooth and classic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x60;t change my favourite fragancie. I love it, and I you continue using for many time.</li>
            <li> ONCE MY WIFE OPENED THIS NEW BOTTLE AND USED IT SHE IMMEDIATELY STATED WHEN I SPRAYED MY NEW PERFUME IT BURNED. I COMPARED THE BOTTLES NEW ANS OLD, THE REAL BOTTLE HAD A NOTICEABLE COLOR DIFFERENCE IN THE LID AND THE ACTUAL SPRAYER WAS MUCH LARGE THAN THE REAL AND WHITE IN COLOR. NEXT TIME I WILL GO TO MY LOCAL DEPARTMENT STORE. THANKS FOR NOTHING.</li>
            <li> todo en perfectas condiciones gracias por el producto en mi pais este producto se consigue muy caro muchas gracias 100 % recomendable</li>
            <li> I liked the time response from seeler, lead time to shipment and price.&lt;br /&gt;I really recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good purchase, definelly very good product</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful fragrance...classic and not overpowering. It&#x27;s strong but sensual, intense but not too bold. The best thing about it is that it has great staying power. Love this perfume.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this fragrance.  Please don&#x27;t get this if  you live in the DC/MD area because I don&#x27;t want too many people smelling like my love.  But it is for sale to anyone.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this fragrance and wear it every winter.  Then Light Blue in the summer.  Would always recommend it and this was a great price for the size I got.</li>
            <li> muy bueno gracias todo en orden  el enviÃ³ todo bien  gracias  feliz dÃ­a perfume muy bueno  100 % gracias ok</li>
            <li> The smell of this is awful and do not buy from this seller....  this is FAKE and be aware of FAKE products...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this perfume for many years and Doche &amp; Gabbana have discontinued this product....  and I in my stupidity looked for it online and bought 2.  I still have the original and I compared the two and the one that I bought here.....  is like smelling from the toilet.....  Bad choice on my behalf ...</li>
            <li> El articulo tal cual como describia el vendedor, el paquete arrivo en el tiempo previsto y el embalaje era el adecuado. No tengo ninguna queja.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this product and they were great, that is why i decided to buy it&lt;br /&gt;However i was disappointed when i got it. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it is a high quality perfume.&lt;br /&gt;i just did not like the smell. If you are the type of young girl that likes fresh scents just like Ralph Lauren, Paris Hilton or Halloween, this is not the perfume for you.</li>
