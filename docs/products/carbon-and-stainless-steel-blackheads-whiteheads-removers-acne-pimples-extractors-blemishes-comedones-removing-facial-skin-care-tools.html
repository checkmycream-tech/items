            <li>Great Seller!  </li>
            <li>Just perfect!</li>
            <li>This is perfect!</li>
            <li>Not the greatest item out there</li>
            <li>the quality is really good for the price, it works and that&#x27;s a great help when needed.</li>
            <li>This is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the tools seem quite good</li>
            <li>These also work good with ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>The product is great and strong!</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B005WQEZIA SUPER VALUE BUNDLE AT INTRODUCTION PRICE!!!</li>
            <li>but my fingers along were working better.  </li>
            <li>Like others I really think the the price it great and a really sharp tool that is great!</li>
            <li>The tools are easy to handle and well made.</li>
            <li>Regardless of anything else make sure you keep your tools clean-</li>
            <li>which is easy because they are steel and easy to clean; and don&#x27;t half-a</li>
            <li>that I am sure I&#x27;ll solve: the pointy end comes with a tiny protective cover - which is good.</li>
            <li>Heavy duty metal and nice design, fit in hand very nicely.</li>
            <li>boy I&#x27;m kinda ticked off that I spend so much when these come with 2 and are under $5!!!</li>
            <li>This piece is far away what you see on the picture, it&#x27;s very cheap material, my broke in a day!</li>
            <li>Sounds a bit too cheap to be true but in this case, it&#x27;s just a bargain.</li>
            <li>Yes you will Clean it, but it&#x27;s to use on my face &amp;  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to clean the tip you&#x27;re using both before and after every use, with alcohol or something like it.</li>
            <li>Good quality instruments, much better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re ready to begin the extraction process lay the preferred side on top of the blemish - basically encircling this area with the loop.&lt;br /&gt;-Apply</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a do-it-yourself type of person so if you are not and are really scared to dig in your own face -don&#x27;t take the step till you are ready.  </li>
            <li>but it works fine for those pimple that are ready to pop.</li>
            <li>At first glance, I thought that there were two tools with additional heads.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suggested Usage:&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using the Double Ended Blemish Extractor, steaming the face, or using a hot water compress is strongly recommended to help soften comedones.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Loops are too large to do any extraction.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it&#x27;s for large acne.</li>
            <li>Great quality product, it works just fine and removes the blackheads, leave a little bit of mark that disappear after few minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-This will make them much easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;-When</li>
            <li>too much force can cause infection and scarring.&lt;br /&gt;-Use</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>Cheap, simple, functional.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work.</li>
            <li>I mainly use these on my boyfriend, but they work like a charm.</li>
            <li>Very little pain, well-made, sharp, and now my face looks super good.</li>
            <li>I was very excited because these tools seem to make a big difference when taking care of facial issues.  </li>
            <li>cheap imitation of the real thing doctors use nether here not there with it</li>
            <li>Yes is too big to be useful</li>
            <li>Also the metal seem very rough on my face and it wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>First, keep in mind that there are only two tools in this set.</li>
            <li>Using them is a whole different story.  </li>
            <li>They clean the bores, pop the white heads, pop the black heads.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money then definitely pick one up because it can take care of your basic needs for a home extraction on yourself only.</li>

            <li> Delivery service was a slow, but still worth the wait.</li>
            <li> stars only because shipping took a long time.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time and it doesn&#x27;t leave a big red spot like using your fingers or some other products.</li>
            <li> This little bundle contains everything you need to keep your face looking perfectly clear of blackheads and pimples.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this combo pack with several other extractors, these tools were far less sturdy.</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried them though, which brings me to the reason for the first missing star: missing instructions.</li>
            <li> Just have to wait soooo long to get it!</li>
            <li> other minor thing,</li>
            <li> However, i can&#x27;t seem to be able to remove the cover - which is bad.</li>
            <li> Received quicker than expected.  </li>
            <li> They leave minimal marks where a pimple has been extracted, nothing like the damage your hands would do.</li>
            <li> The needle end was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> slow and even pressure lightly until the trapped sebum is forced out of the follicle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get enough traction for white heads or small black heads.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I was expecting, I guess a box or even a blister pack, but the two tools literally came simply in a zipper lock</li>
            <li> These are the same if not better than what Sephora has in stock!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really sharp.</li>
            <li> second missing star is for missing packaging.</li>
            <li> the small loop for whiteheads and the flat side for blackheads.</li>
            <li> not sure why this is getting so many bad reviews</li>
            <li> I used it on my nose and it removed some of my black/white heads, but still not worth the spend.</li>
            <li> I only made the problem worse and spread, plus leave dark marks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Do not continue to attempt the extraction if the trapped sebum is not released</li>
            <li> These extraction tools are heavy duty with no bending.</li>
            <li> ** because if you don&#x27;t use these right you can give yourself a bad infection.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend it if you are not sure how to use them.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools were not effective in extraction and some were.</li>
            <li> So I was a little disappointed that they did not make that big of a difference for me, was pressing hard</li>
            <li> I wanted a very thin and sharp but what I got was a dull needle.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a totally pleasant experience..</li>
            <li> Packaging, I hated that Sephora&#x27;s just had theirs loose in a bin.</li>
            <li> but of course doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Not impressed at all.</li>

            <li> First, keep in mind that there are only two tools in this set. At first glance, I thought that there were two tools with additional heads. This is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the tools seem quite good; durable. I have not yet tried them though, which brings me to the reason for the first missing star: missing instructions. There are none. Nothing whatsoever, not even a label as to which end is supposed to be used for which task.&lt;br /&gt;The second missing star is for missing packaging. Not sure what I was expecting, I guess a box or even a blister pack, but the two tools literally came simply in a zipper lock bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other minor thing, that I am sure I&#x27;ll solve: the pointy end comes with a tiny protective cover - which is good. However, i can&#x27;t seem to be able to remove the cover - which is bad.</li>
            <li> These are the same if not better than what Sephora has in stock!!&lt;br /&gt;I had purchased 1 Ance tool from Sephora a while ago for under $18 and boy I&#x27;m kinda ticked off that I spend so much when these come with 2 and are under $5!!! The one at Sephora was just for white/black Heads, NOT TO POP PIMPLES!!!&lt;br /&gt;Nice Packaging, I hated that Sephora&#x27;s just had theirs loose in a bin. Yes you will Clean it, but it&#x27;s to use on my face &amp;  you don&#x27;t know who had their Snotty hands on them!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why this is getting so many bad reviews, maybe people don&#x27;t know how to use it. While it&#x27;s not supposed to be painfull it&#x27;s not a totally pleasant experience.. Unless you&#x27;re the type that likes popping pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; At the end I included instructions off Sephora website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is tho I am kinda bum that the QR barcode scan didnt work. You scan it and a Youtube vid will give u tips and tricks on how to use them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: You gotta Pierce the skin then squeeze to try avoid Pimple Scars!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suggested Usage:&lt;br /&gt;Prior to using the Double Ended Blemish Extractor, steaming the face, or using a hot water compress is strongly recommended to help soften comedones.&lt;br /&gt;-This will make them much easier to remove.&lt;br /&gt;-When you&#x27;re ready to begin the extraction process lay the preferred side on top of the blemish - basically encircling this area with the loop.&lt;br /&gt;-Apply slow and even pressure lightly until the trapped sebum is forced out of the follicle.&lt;br /&gt;-Do not continue to attempt the extraction if the trapped sebum is not released easily.&lt;br /&gt;-Applying too much force can cause infection and scarring.&lt;br /&gt;-Use the small loop for whiteheads and the flat side for blackheads.</li>
            <li> Havent figured it out yet. It&#x27;s really sharp.</li>
            <li> I mainly use these on my boyfriend, but they work like a charm. They clean the bores, pop the white heads, pop the black heads. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> the quality is really good for the price, it works and that&#x27;s a great help when needed. Don&#x27;t hesitate, it&#x27;s just perfect.</li>
            <li> This piece is far away what you see on the picture, it&#x27;s very cheap material, my broke in a day!</li>
            <li> Great quality product, it works just fine and removes the blackheads, leave a little bit of mark that disappear after few minutes. Sounds a bit too cheap to be true but in this case, it&#x27;s just a bargain. Shipping was fast. Great Seller!

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this several times now. The product is great and strong! Just perfect! Delivery service was a slow, but still worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Good quality instruments, much better than I expected.  Received quicker than expected.  Heavy duty metal and nice design, fit in hand very nicely.</li>
            <li> These extraction tools are heavy duty with no bending. They leave minimal marks where a pimple has been extracted, nothing like the damage your hands would do. If used correctly (you can find tutorials on YouTube,) they will remove entire blockage.&lt;br /&gt;Four stars only because shipping took a long time. Otherwise, product is 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Some of the tools were not effective in extraction and some were. Also the metal seem very rough on my face and it wasn&#x27;t as smooth as I wanted it to be. I guess you get what you pay for. I would recommend this to anyone but if you don&#x27;t want to spend a whole lot of money then definitely pick one up because it can take care of your basic needs for a home extraction on yourself only.</li>
            <li> Performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> This is perfect! I use it all the time and it doesn&#x27;t leave a big red spot like using your fingers or some other products.</li>
            <li> I received just one comedone not two like the picture shows don&#x27;t know if I misunderstood what I was getting or what I do like what I got just thought I was receiving both</li>
            <li> Cheap, simple, functional.  You&#x27;ll want to clean the tip you&#x27;re using both before and after every use, with alcohol or something like it. Don&#x27;t forget to poke before you hoop.</li>
