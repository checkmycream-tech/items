            <li>Loved the texture.....</li>
            <li>thid is a good product tha i use all the time.</li>
            <li>I LAUGHED BECAUSE I DIDN&#x27;T THINK MEN USED FACE</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite face stuff!</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have allergies, this will work nicely for you.</li>
            <li>Yes, and within a week of use and it was my husband who told me how nice my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product, will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li>No break outs and very smooth skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice creamy moisturizer, absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t clog the pores of your skin.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, glides on smooth and moisturizes</li>
            <li>I fell for the hype and decided to try this cream after seeing the commercials that claimed this product beat the creams that cost much more.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>it has wonderful result in a short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I have used this cream for about 4 years and love it for my problematic skin.</li>
            <li>This cream lacks the one component that is sure to be anti-aging: SPF.</li>
            <li>Love it, could tell within a week the difference it make on my face.</li>
            <li>After I used it, i can feel that the line around my Jaw look better.</li>
            <li>Did my skin look better?  </li>
            <li>I gave the scented and unscented Regenerist Regenerating Serum a shot also, but it was just marginally better -</li>
            <li>It is better priced here than in drugstores.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS FACE CREAM.</li>
            <li>What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>I love how this makes my face feel.</li>
            <li>It does hydrate your skin and it does hide fine lines after a while of using it.  </li>
            <li>I gave this two stars because as a moisturizer it&#x27;s fine</li>
            <li>Application is easy and seems to be absorbed rather than sitting on the top.</li>
            <li>Feels nice, smells nice and actually does seem to minimize the fine lines.</li>
            <li>Item description was accurate.  </li>
            <li>It makes my skin hydrated &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this product as I was following an excellent skin care regime for aging skin and this product plus the Regenerist Regenerating Serum were recommended.  </li>
            <li>but I love it so much I&#x27;m using it anyway.</li>
            <li>I tried many other facial creams and this one is the best.  </li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>I started using this product 4 days ago, I am a 36 year old smoker and I have noticed the fine lines around my mouth are GONE!</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>(though, lacking SPF, it&#x27;s not the best choice) and it didn&#x27;t seem to cause my skin to breakout (it does that on its own anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed by this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a great moisturizer in general and soothes my dry skin after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li>Item arrived packaged well and appeared new and in original packaging.  </li>
            <li>I would not be able to sit next to someone who had this on.  </li>
            <li>I know that I have made it sound like I am overly sensitive</li>
            <li>Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>My face is so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in fine lines, wrinkles, or general skin texture or quality.</li>
            <li>It has a mild odor and leaves my face soft, supple and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Also, may not replace my morning and evening moisturizers when I run out as they certainly didn&#x27;t do as well as this Olay product.</li>
            <li>and it left my skin so smooth.</li>
            <li>but my skin has glowed from it, more than any other product I have tried.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so soft and smooth, and my husband said I look younger!</li>
            <li>- it DID make the skin around my eyes look smoother and hydrated, but then I had the red bumps under my eyebrows, on the very top of my cheekbones by my little crowsfeet, etc</li>
            <li>I normally use St. Ives Collagen face cream  </li>
            <li>Definitely works for me and the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>This is the first anti-wrinkle cream that I have tried that actually seems to work.  </li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;d like to not that I am only 20 years young.</li>
            <li>I also experimented with isolating my skin care products using only ONE at a time, no layering, took me about a week to do that - only time I had a problem was with the Olay products (this is also true of their eye cream</li>
            <li>As I have aged my face has become more dry.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to perfumes and this reeks.  </li>
            <li>I have been pleasantly surprised with the way it hydrates my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M 54 YEARS OLD, AND</li>
            <li>After the first few uses, it did exactly as I thought it would; it made me break out.</li>
            <li>But this Olay Microsculpting - I will give it a few  more days - but it so far is certainly not a formula for everyone.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Loved the texture.....how it felt on my skin, but my allergies couldn&#x27;t handle the scent. If you don&#x27;t have allergies, this will work nicely for you. Nice texture, glides on smooth and moisturizes well. I couldn&#x27;t use after a week due to the scent giving me headaches and a runny nose/eyes.</li>
            <li> I fell for the hype and decided to try this cream after seeing the commercials that claimed this product beat the creams that cost much more.  Unfortunately, it causes breakouts...I am 31 and haven&#x27;t had such breakouts since my teens! I plan to stop using it and won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a year now, best cream I have ever used.  No break outs and very smooth skin.  Less sagging aroung the mouth area also.</li>
            <li> I put this stuff on and in about 1/2 hour I had to wash it off.  I am sensitive to perfumes and this reeks.  It actually made my lungs ache.  I would not be able to sit next to someone who had this on.  I know that I have made it sound like I am overly sensitive and I&#x27;m not.  Weeks go by with me not be bothered by anything.  This product just set me off.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It does hydrate your skin and it does hide fine lines after a while of using it.  I use this twice a day after washing my face.  I also use the serum once per day.  It relieves the tight feeling when your face is dry.</li>
            <li> my house hold are using it .and it has wonderful result in a short period of time.  we recomend it to all with pleasure.  mkfaruqi</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to not that I am only 20 years young. I used this product because my mom recommended it for me. I have very acne-prone skin and had bad experiences with thick creams so I was a little skeptical of this product. After the first few uses, it did exactly as I thought it would; it made me break out. But I decided to continue using it to see what would happen. After about a week my skin got used to it and it did wonders. I now barely have a single pimple! and it left my skin so smooth. It also smells really great. I am very satisfied with this product. I use it twice a day as a daily moisturizer for day and night.</li>
            <li> I just turned 70 and am usually guessed to be 55 to 60.  I have always  taken care of my skin.  Have been using Retina A and Murad Serum.  However,  just added Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream to my daily routine a couple of weeks ago.  I have been pleasantly surprised with the way it hydrates my skin and I see a slight improvement in a tightening of my jaw line and lower face.  I also put it on my arms and the hydration has improved the crepe skin look.  I am seriously thinking of replacing my Murad Serum with the Regenerist Serum since this cream has worked so well. Also, may not replace my morning and evening moisturizers when I run out as they certainly didn&#x27;t do as well as this Olay product.</li>
            <li> As I have aged my face has become more dry.  I keep coming back to this cream.  It has a mild odor and leaves my face soft, supple and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Received quickly. I have used this cream for about 4 years and love it for my problematic skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first anti-wrinkle cream that I have tried that actually seems to work.  Even using it just once my skin looks and feels a little smoother.  It&#x27;s just a great moisturizer in general and soothes my dry skin after I wash my face.  My skin does tend to break out when I use it but I love it so much I&#x27;m using it anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the end of the pot of this micro-sculpting cream and I&#x27;ve seen no improvement in fine lines, wrinkles, or general skin texture or quality. My skin does not appear firmer or tighter. In fact, my skin looks worse than when I started, though I don&#x27;t know if I can blame that on the cream, since it might just be aging itself. This cream lacks the one component that is sure to be anti-aging: SPF. I gave this two stars because as a moisturizer it&#x27;s fine (though, lacking SPF, it&#x27;s not the best choice) and it didn&#x27;t seem to cause my skin to breakout (it does that on its own anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed by this product and I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get the results that a lot of other people seem to have had.</li>
            <li> I use this in the morning and at night.  Definitely works for me and the price is very reasonable.  Will definitely order more.</li>
            <li> thid is a good product tha i use all the time.I pick this one,because,i can see a difference with it...</li>
            <li> Love it, could tell within a week the difference it make on my face. It&#x27;s a wonderful product! Would deffinelty purchase again.</li>
            <li> It has only been 2 days, but ever since I have applied this, my skin looks old and tired. I normally use St. Ives Collagen face cream  -not just because it is only 5.99! - but my skin has glowed from it, more than any other product I have tried. Couldn&#x27;t find it one day, so bought the Olay.  But this Olay Microsculpting - I will give it a few  more days - but it so far is certainly not a formula for everyone. My skin is broken out and dull ever since applying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for quite a while and am very happy with it.  The price is nearly $5.00 less than in my local drug and grocery stores.  I would recommend trying it if you&#x27;re not happy with your current moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After I used it, i can feel that the line around my Jaw look better. My face is so smooth and soft. Don&#x27;t miss to try ....</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this product as I was following an excellent skin care regime for aging skin and this product plus the Regenerist Regenerating Serum were recommended.  Did my skin look better?  Yes, and within a week of use and it was my husband who told me how nice my skin looked.  This could be because my skin was very dry and it was just finally being hydrated. As I wasn&#x27;t using any facial moisturizer, I&#x27;m realize now anything would have helped at this skin care starting point. What it does do, and this is why I no longer use the product, is make my skin break out and I&#x27;m 62. I gave the scented and unscented Regenerist Regenerating Serum a shot also, but it was just marginally better - my skin would still get these weird little red bumps that would take three or four days to go away completely. I also experimented with isolating my skin care products using only ONE at a time, no layering, took me about a week to do that - only time I had a problem was with the Olay products (this is also true of their eye cream - it DID make the skin around my eyes look smoother and hydrated, but then I had the red bumps under my eyebrows, on the very top of my cheekbones by my little crowsfeet, etc AND my eyes would burn and tear like crazy).</li>
            <li> Item description was accurate.  Item arrived packaged well and appeared new and in original packaging.  Arrival was  timely.  Lowest price for this item on the net.</li>
            <li> I tried many other facial creams and this one is the best.  Wouldnt substitute it for any other...Its the best.</li>
            <li> It is better priced here than in drugstores. They charge $32 + tax &amp; on here it is $22.50 with shipping charges.&lt;br /&gt;My face was very dried out &amp; I have been using it for several years. It makes my skin hydrated &amp; smooth.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FACE CREAM. I WAS IN THE DRUG STORE ONCE, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT FACE CREAM TO BUY&lt;br /&gt;THIS WOMAN CAME UP TO ME AND SAID, HER DAUGHTER WAS A MAKE UP ARTIST FOR SINGER BOBBY BROWN.&lt;br /&gt;SHE TOLD ME HE USES THAT ON HIS FACE. I LAUGHED BECAUSE I DIDN&#x27;T THINK MEN USED FACE CREAM.&lt;br /&gt;SO I ORDERED IT ON AMAZON. I MUST SAY I LIKE IT A LOT. I&#x27;M 54 YEARS OLD, AND PEOPLE THINK I\\&quot;M TEN YEARS YOUNGER&lt;br /&gt;THAN WHAT I LOOK. SO I&#x27;M GOING TO KEEP USING THIS CREAM!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  LEE DEE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product before and will again when this one is used up. It&#x27;s a nice creamy moisturizer, absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t clog the pores of your skin. Feels nice, smells nice and actually does seem to minimize the fine lines. What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> This product has several types of parabens in it. If you don&#x27;t know about parabens, look it up. It is a preservative that can cause cancer. I am surrprised that Olay is still using it in their products. Many companies have stopped using it and found other less dangerous preservatives.</li>
            <li> I started using this product 4 days ago, I am a 36 year old smoker and I have noticed the fine lines around my mouth are GONE! It has made my skin so soft and smooth, and my husband said I look younger! I will definitely keep using this product! I am so pleased with this product, will buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> I love how this makes my face feel. I was using ponds. forget ponds i am sticking to oil of olay</li>
            <li> My favorite face stuff!</li>
            <li> Application is easy and seems to be absorbed rather than sitting on the top. One of the best purchases. Worth the money.</li>
