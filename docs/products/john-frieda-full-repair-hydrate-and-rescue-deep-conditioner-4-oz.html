            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>best i have tried and i&#x27;ve tried a few! :)</li>
            <li>works great but not enough product for the moeny</li>
            <li>This conditioner in conjunction with the Full Repair Hydrate and Rescue Shampoo is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It is ok as a conditioner, but for the same money I have had much better.</li>
            <li>leaves hair soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard that putting the conditioner in then warping your hair in the hot towel works as well as rinsing and then warping your hair in the hot towel..</li>
            <li>So glad I finally did.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair super soft and worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I have very oily hair and most conditioners especially deep conditioners</li>
            <li>I love this product especially after a new perm.</li>
            <li>It feels very silky when washed and styled also.</li>
            <li>I really like the Frieda conditioner.</li>
            <li>I would reccommend the full repair deep conditioner by John Frieda.  </li>
            <li>They had the regular conditioner, but this is better if your hair is dry like mine is.  </li>
            <li>I was using herbal esseence \\&quot;2 in 1\\&quot; because it was the only product I could find and it was okay, but didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft and my scalp was still dry and itchy (not dandruff).  </li>
            <li>John Frieda bring Full Repair Hydrate +  Rescue Deep Conditioner back!!!!</li>
            <li>dye and perm my hair and his shampoo and conditioners leave my hair silky soft without hurting the color or weakening the perm.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch.  </li>
            <li>IMO the new &amp;#34;Frizz&amp;#34; line of John Frieda does not live up to this product!</li>

            <li> I have color treated, long hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have for anyone with dry or color damaged hair.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets very dry</li>
            <li> I alternate it with my other conditioners so that my hair doesn&#x27;t get weighed down.</li>
            <li> I useit as a mask once a week by putting it on my hair dry, combing it through, wearing a cap to help it absorb for 20 minutes and then washing as usual.</li>
            <li> The Aveda stuff I was using didn&#x27;t help even a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is not sold in stores.  </li>
            <li> My hair is starting to return to normal after being burned by a hair salon (when highlighting--they did an awful job).  </li>
            <li> and I need to use \\&quot;hydrate\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner which is sometimes hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I was not happy and afraid I would wake up with half my hair still on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;Praise</li>
            <li> (I have thin, wavy, FRIZZY hair) and bleaching my ends for an ombre effect.</li>
            <li> way it down and give it that shiny, oily, dirty look but not this one!</li>
            <li> I just hate that John Frieda quit making it!</li>

            <li> John Frieda bring Full Repair Hydrate +  Rescue Deep Conditioner back!!!! I love this product especially after a new perm. It really makes my hair feel wonderful. I just hate that John Frieda quit making it! IMO the new &amp;#34;Frizz&amp;#34; line of John Frieda does not live up to this product! It sure doesn&#x27;t replace it!</li>
            <li> It hydrates without leaving any residue. This product is a must have for anyone with dry or color damaged hair. Big plus is that it is so affordable.</li>
            <li> I have color treated, long hair. So there is a lot of chemical damage. I use this product only. The Aveda stuff I was using didn&#x27;t help even a little bit. I useit as a mask once a week by putting it on my hair dry, combing it through, wearing a cap to help it absorb for 20 minutes and then washing as usual. It&#x27;s truly a miracle. This is a tip on the box and it is really a good one.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. Makes my damaged hair look and feel so much better.</li>
            <li> I was on the point of desperateness and picked up any deep treatment I felt looked promising.&lt;br /&gt;I am so thrilled to have picked this product. My hair was FRIED from straightening all the time (I have thin, wavy, FRIZZY hair) and bleaching my ends for an ombre effect. Nonetheless, I was not happy and afraid I would wake up with half my hair still on my pillow.&lt;br /&gt;Praise this product! It saved my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I did the suggested 20 min treatment that reads on the back of the box.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy once I run out.</li>
            <li> works great but not enough product for the moeny</li>
            <li> Makes my hair super soft and worth every penny. I add heat products to my hair every week. This keeps the ends from looking fried and maintains my hair in a healthy state. I alternate it with my other conditioners so that my hair doesn&#x27;t get weighed down. I have very oily hair and most conditioners especially deep conditioners way it down and give it that shiny, oily, dirty look but not this one!</li>
            <li> Heard rave reviews about this product on a morning tv show. It is ok as a conditioner, but for the same money I have had much better. I have curly hair and think Quidad is a lot better.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my hair immensely in the last month. It feels very silky when washed and styled also.</li>
            <li> Love this.  I had got a sample in the mail and had it forever before I gave it a try.  So glad I finally did.  I couldn&#x27;t find this in my local big box drugs stores (CVS, Walgreens, etc)  They had the regular conditioner, but this is better if your hair is dry like mine is.  Great product.</li>
            <li> recommend to anyone!!! leaves hair soft and easy to manage. best i have tried and i&#x27;ve tried a few! :)</li>
            <li> Not sure why this is not sold in stores.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Noticed the difference after only one use. I&#x27;m going to try the shampoo and regular conditioner also.</li>
            <li> The best products available for damaged hair are from JOHN FRIEDA!&lt;br /&gt;I dye and perm my hair and his shampoo and conditioners leave my hair silky soft without hurting the color or weakening the perm.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this conditioner in the mail and once I used it, I was hooked.  My scalp gets very dry and I need to use \\&quot;hydrate\\&quot; shampoo and conditioner which is sometimes hard to find.  I was using herbal esseence \\&quot;2 in 1\\&quot; because it was the only product I could find and it was okay, but didn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling soft and my scalp was still dry and itchy (not dandruff).  I really like the Frieda conditioner. It leaves my hair soft and my scalp doesn&#x27;t itch.  I started using the Frieda shampoo as well and am quite happy with both.  My hair is starting to return to normal after being burned by a hair salon (when highlighting--they did an awful job).  I would reccommend the full repair deep conditioner by John Frieda.  It is working for me.</li>
