            <li>that was this good.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try this because of the ingredients list, the 4.5 stars and it seemed fairly priced without breaking the bank.  </li>

            <li>I really liked this wash.</li>

            <li>I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this stuff</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this face wash.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about that?</li>
            <li>This is now my favorite face cleanser.  </li>
            <li>I love its creamy texture.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>wish it cleansed more of my make up off.</li>
            <li>love the product</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this cleanser.</li>
            <li>I love the creamy texture.</li>
            <li>Some people complain about the smell, but I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this organic face cleanser..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll still keep it and use it every now and again until I find something better</li>
            <li>However, they must have changed the formula a bit when they changed the packaging to this new tube because now it does not have a pleasant fragrance anymore.  </li>
            <li>but it washes off easily.</li>
            <li>This does has an odd, earthy smell but it does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need to use a huge amount for it to do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic brand</li>
            <li>In addition to this, I really love their Argan Serum, which has evened out my skin tone and really made my skin look and feel better.  </li>
            <li>I first got this as a free sample from Ispy and thought it was going to just be okay</li>
            <li>I first learned about this cleanser when it was featured in Oprah &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; Magazine as one of the top face cleansers.  </li>
            <li>St. Ive&#x27;s Apricot Facial Cleanser (which is very affordable and leaves my face feeling okay but is loaded with chemicals) and Desert Essences Thoroughly Clean Face Wash (which has a great ingredients list and the bottle lasts forever but it leaves my face feeling stripped),</li>
            <li>rinses squeaky clean, no lingering scent.</li>
            <li>Clean feel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and smooth non irritating and has nice clean ingredients and my picky husband liked it</li>
            <li>I use the whole Nourish Organic line and love it all try the Serum</li>
            <li>There are no added fragrances of any kind and the natural smell of the ingredients</li>
            <li>so I went and bought the full size.</li>
            <li>Also, It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming/fake smell; to me it&#x27;s mostly neutral but with a soft fresh smell (that probably doesn&#x27;t make sense but whatever :) )</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh, and keeps my acne at bay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the smell I would prefer they add a little of some kind of soothing ingredient that smells fabulous</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kinds and never had such a nice, clean feeling before.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel wonderful and not tight like other cleansers.  </li>
            <li>Nourish Organic is one of my new favorite brands.</li>
            <li>I gave it to friend at work, and she absolutely loves it!!</li>
            <li>But it works, so the price is worth it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle yet gets rid of my makeup without a fuss.</li>
            <li>it isnt unscented its just kind of a crushed watercress smell perhaps</li>
            <li>I have owned more face cleansers than I can even count and none only them are like this.</li>
            <li>Used this 3-4 more times since the initial use and I&#x27;ve made a point of shaking it well before each use.</li>
            <li>The selling point of this product, for me, is that it left my face feeling clean but not stripped -- and I&#x27;ve tried many, many cleansers that claimed to do this but never did -- and my face felt soft, moisturized and balanced, nothing short of a miracle for my acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>Like a couple other reviewers I too have noticed the burning sensation which was very surprising due to the nature of the ingredients...</li>
            <li>My easily reddened skin stays calm and clear when I use this regularly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take off makeup very well, and it is over-drying in the winter.</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day and my skin feels much softer and very moisturized.</li>
            <li>and I like how there isn&#x27;t really a scent.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let the word moisturizing scare you if you have acne prone skin, this face wash really is for all skin types.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance-free so does not irritate my skin or cause redness like many other cleansers.  </li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin (products frequently cause me to break out with an itchy rash all over my face) and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all!</li>
            <li>My skin actually FEELS squeaky clean when I&#x27;m done using it</li>
            <li>I have been using and loving this brand of facial products for a long time.  </li>
            <li>It worked very well for my normally oily skin and acne prone</li>
            <li>So many products have hidden chemicals these days, so I always look for the USDA organic seal.  </li>
            <li>Smell is now also more like Elmer&#x27;s glue and less like vomit.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love that this cleanser foams and does not take too much to wash your face just a small dab.</li>
            <li>I normally use face wash for oily skin</li>
            <li>Time to find a new face wash.</li>
            <li>foams just enough and leaves skin clean but not dry</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and this really makes my skin tight, oil free, AND extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>no oily residue, no mess!</li>
            <li>My face has been much softer since using this regularly.</li>
            <li>Smelled really old and fishy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying directly from the company from now on.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This replaced my old face wash (Ambi)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and vegan as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than regular drug store face wash, but the bottle is a bit bigger than most as well.</li>
            <li>Works well for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Will definitely continue to purchase, especially with the reasonable price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;ve only used this cleanser one time, so I may need to come back and update this review, but holy cow, fragrance free does not mean smell free and this sucker *smells</li>
            <li>will give this a few more tries</li>
            <li>However, my facial skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>Most leave my face dried out to the point that I have to apply heavy organic lotions and coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I have really bad combination skin, it gets dry easily but breaks out easily as well.  </li>
            <li>It never irritates my extremely sensitive, rosacean, acne-prone skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out either.</li>
            <li>You simply massage the cleanser onto your wet face gently using a circular motion, then wash and pat dry.</li>
            <li>and I only really smelled it when I purposefully took a whiff, but it&#x27;s so, so bad, I might not be able to get over it.</li>

            <li> The consistency is very runny, not sure if that&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s supposed to be</li>
            <li> This in turn makes it last a long time for this size tube.  </li>
            <li> It also helped clear up a crazy breakout that appeared two weeks prior to my first use and seemed like it would never go away!</li>
            <li> So for that alone, I will keep using this as long as I can stand it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Caused me to have pimples. I have combination/sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I love that this cleanser foams and does not take too much to wash your face just a small dab. This in turn makes it last a long time for this size tube.  It makes my face feel wonderful and not tight like other cleansers.  I use the whole Nourish Organic line and love it all try the Serum if  you have dry skin or patches. Others have mentioned the fragrance.  There are no added fragrances of any kind and the natural smell of the ingredients is a little different that what we are all probably used to heavily perfumed washes.  I don&#x27;t love the smell I would prefer they add a little of some kind of soothing ingredient that smells fabulous but then it wouldnt be unscented which people like and need.  It does have a smell- it isnt unscented its just kind of a crushed watercress smell perhaps sort of plain and vague.   Not something I would throw out though as one user said she did.  I would have at least used it as a body wash! Could have put i a few drops of lavendar essential oils too.</li>
            <li> Got this with my IPSY bag, I like the formula but that smell is terrible. My husband and my sister both tried it and agree the smell is terrible.</li>
            <li> rinses squeaky clean, no lingering scent. face retains moisture....not dried out</li>
            <li> This does has an odd, earthy smell but it does a wonderful job. My face has been much softer since using this regularly.</li>
            <li> Love this face wash! I have super sensitive skin (products frequently cause me to break out with an itchy rash all over my face) and this doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all! It&#x27;s great at removing makeup and gentle. Will definitely continue to purchase, especially with the reasonable price and natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> OMG, I love this stuff! Got a sample in my Ipsy bag and now its the only face wash I want to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using and loving this brand of facial products for a long time.  However, they must have changed the formula a bit when they changed the packaging to this new tube because now it does not have a pleasant fragrance anymore.  I dread having to use it and wash it off quickly because it smells nasty.  Time to find a new face wash.</li>
            <li> Clean feel. Refreshing.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t love it. It doesn&#x27;t take off makeup very well, and it is over-drying in the winter. I only use it in the mornings (no makeup then), during the summer months.</li>
            <li> Smelled really old and fishy. I&#x27;ll be buying directly from the company from now on.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good...foams just enough and leaves skin clean but not dry</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the great reviews.  Unfortunately, this product irritated my skin.  I gave it to friend at work, and she absolutely loves it!! I&#x27;m glad.  It won&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> Amazing product, great and timely delivery.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff</li>
            <li> Gave my girlfriend some bums on her face, but I didn&#x27;t have a problem with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Removes my makeup and cleans without drying my face out.</li>
            <li> It stinks really bad, but I liked the formula of this facial cleanser. I use it twice a day and my skin feels much softer and very moisturized. If you can handle the funky smell, I recommend for you to try this product.</li>
            <li> I have owned more face cleansers than I can even count and none only them are like this. My skin actually FEELS squeaky clean when I&#x27;m done using it and I like how there isn&#x27;t really a scent. It also helped clear up a crazy breakout that appeared two weeks prior to my first use and seemed like it would never go away! Only reason for 4 stars is that it is a bit drying. Make sure you use a good moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I could not get past the natural smell.  It worked great but threw it away before one quarter of the tube was gone .</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this face wash. I have sensitive skin and it never irritates or dries out my face. It&#x27;s super gentle yet gets rid of my makeup without a fuss.</li>
            <li> Burning sensation.  Discontinued after about 1.5 weeks, as burning sensation did not stop. However, my facial skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d received a sample bottle of this product and I was devastated when it emptied. This replaced my old face wash (Ambi) and I haven&#x27;t looked back. It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh, and keeps my acne at bay. It&#x27;s all natural and vegan as well. What&#x27;s not to love about that?</li>
            <li> I first learned about this cleanser when it was featured in Oprah &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; Magazine as one of the top face cleansers.  This is now my favorite face cleanser.  I love its creamy texture.  It is fragrance-free so does not irritate my skin or cause redness like many other cleansers.  Also, really great that it is 100% organic!  So many products have hidden chemicals these days, so I always look for the USDA organic seal.  Nourish Organic is one of my new favorite brands. In addition to this, I really love their Argan Serum, which has evened out my skin tone and really made my skin look and feel better.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great organic cleanser.</li>
            <li> Great product. Shipped fast. Would order again.</li>
            <li> Love it! Washes off easily and my face feels squeaky clean!!! no oily residue, no mess! and it is an added PLUS that it is organic and healthy for your skin!!!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this face wash! Don&#x27;t let the word moisturizing scare you if you have acne prone skin, this face wash really is for all skin types. I have really bad combination skin, it gets dry easily but breaks out easily as well.  I&#x27;ve only been using this face wash for a week and my skin is glowing, no acne no dryness! Plus the ingredients are amazing, no chemicals at all and vegan/cruelty free of course!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice affordable and organic with good ewg rating.  Doesn&#x27;t totally remove make up but that&#x27;s ok.  Also has a weird smell.  Lathers on the face.  Overall it&#x27;s good I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d buy it again, wish it cleansed more of my make up off.</li>
            <li> An organic beauty product? Enough said!</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used a face wash before that was this good. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds and never had such a nice, clean feeling before. Most leave my face dried out to the point that I have to apply heavy organic lotions and coconut oil. This stuff, however, I could go without, which is awesome and saves me money on creams and lotions. Definitely recommend this product and will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this really makes my skin tight, oil free, AND extremely soft.  I normally use face wash for oily skin but it dries my skin out and then I have to use a face lotion and sometimes that makes my skin oily.  When i used this product, I didn&#x27;t have to use any lotion, my skin felt amazing after just one use.  The fact that it is organic is an added plus!  Yes, it doesn&#x27;t smell like typical face washes with fragrances added but it&#x27;s really not that bad of a smell.</li>
            <li> as expected. love the product</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this in an ipsy glam bag so I went and bought the full size. It worked very well for my normally oily skin and acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with my clarisonic dupe and it&#x27;s been working wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit more expensive than regular drug store face wash, but the bottle is a bit bigger than most as well. But it works, so the price is worth it</li>
            <li> Like a couple other reviewers I too have noticed the burning sensation which was very surprising due to the nature of the ingredients...I am confused as to why this happens.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive/combination skin and normally never have burning with organic\natural products unless they contain tea tree.&lt;br /&gt;Seemed to remove my makeup well and rinsed clean.&lt;br /&gt;I will give this a few more tries but if it still burns I am returning it and going back to something else.</li>
            <li> Works well for my sensitive skin. Leaves it moisturized and feeling cleaned.  Also, it helps rid of blemishes within 3 days or so.</li>
            <li> I have combination/oily skin and received a sample of this with my Ipsy subscription. This stuff is  Amazing!!! It&#x27;s organic, cleans well, no perfume smell. Simple. I&#x27;m a fan for life!!!</li>
            <li> I first got this as a free sample from Ispy and thought it was going to just be okay but it turned out to be so awesome that I decided to buy the full size bottle! It&#x27;s not drying like other face washes I&#x27;ve tried and you don&#x27;t need to use a huge amount for it to do it&#x27;s job. Also, It doesn&#x27;t have an overwhelming/fake smell; to me it&#x27;s mostly neutral but with a soft fresh smell (that probably doesn&#x27;t make sense but whatever :) ) I use this almost every day along with my Olay face brush and I absolutely love it. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li> Get rid of dirt and oil without stripping the skin.  Works for combination acne prone skin.  Follow up with Better Botanicals Sandalwood moisturizer to keep break outs away!</li>
            <li> I really liked this wash. I found it on think dirty app when trying to find better cleanser for my husband than the dirty cetaphil. It&#x27;s nice and smooth non irritating and has nice clean ingredients and my picky husband liked it</li>
            <li> I love everything about this cleanser. I love the creamy texture. It reminds me of Cetaphil, but without the nasty chemicals they use. Some people complain about the smell, but I LOVE it. It&#x27;s raw, earthy and without any type of masking fragrance. It never irritates my extremely sensitive, rosacean, acne-prone skin and it doesn&#x27;t dry me out either. My easily reddened skin stays calm and clear when I use this regularly. At night, I use it with a soft washcloth or exfoliating sponge and it works perfectly with both.This is a fantastic brand and I can&#x27;t wait to try everything they offer!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this organic face cleanser.. It is fragrance-free, not drying or irritating, does not cause your face to turn red, and is for all skin types. You simply massage the cleanser onto your wet face gently using a circular motion, then wash and pat dry.</li>
            <li> I had been alternating between St. Ive&#x27;s Apricot Facial Cleanser (which is very affordable and leaves my face feeling okay but is loaded with chemicals) and Desert Essences Thoroughly Clean Face Wash (which has a great ingredients list and the bottle lasts forever but it leaves my face feeling stripped), so I decided to try this because of the ingredients list, the 4.5 stars and it seemed fairly priced without breaking the bank.  Now, I&#x27;ve only used this cleanser one time, so I may need to come back and update this review, but holy cow, fragrance free does not mean smell free and this sucker *smells*. Vomit and Elmer&#x27;s glue immediately came to mind. Thankfully it doesn&#x27;t seem to linger and I only really smelled it when I purposefully took a whiff, but it&#x27;s so, so bad, I might not be able to get over it. The texture&#x27;s a little weird even for a cream when smearing it on your face but it washes off easily. My face felt like it was burning a tiny bit but I stuck my head out of the shower to check my face in the mirror and it wasn&#x27;t red.  The selling point of this product, for me, is that it left my face feeling clean but not stripped -- and I&#x27;ve tried many, many cleansers that claimed to do this but never did -- and my face felt soft, moisturized and balanced, nothing short of a miracle for my acne-prone skin. So for that alone, I will keep using this as long as I can stand it. Maybe I&#x27;ll try adding lavender oil to it, see if that helps the smell and the tiny bit of burning.  UPDATE 4-5-2015: Changing my rating from 3 to 2 stars. Used this 3-4 more times since the initial use and I&#x27;ve made a point of shaking it well before each use. The consistency is very runny, not sure if that&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s supposed to be or if it&#x27;s from keeping the container on a shelf in the shower. It hasn&#x27;t burned since that initial use but my face also hasn&#x27;t felt as soft, a major disappointment. Skin still doesn&#x27;t feel stripped though. Smell is now also more like Elmer&#x27;s glue and less like vomit. I&#x27;ll still keep it and use it every now and again until I find something better but I&#x27;m definitely not repurchasing.</li>
