            <li>Great, just wish it came with a better brush to apply the shadow.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The colors in here are really beautiful, pigmented, &amp; easy to blend out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love my shadows!  </li>

            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>I really liked this eye shadow.</li>
            <li>However, colors seemed nice.</li>
            <li>packaging looks nice....</li>
            <li>Nice colors but</li>
            <li>Goes on nicely,  </li>
            <li>A nice mixture of matte and sparkly colors.</li>
            <li>Nice mix of color with neutrals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not one that can go spend a lot of money on make up, so when I saw this, I was excited!!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re warmer and appropriate more for someone with a warmer complexion, but they look good for cooler complexions in the photo.  </li>
            <li>but even though I had fair / light skin, the pigment was too light!</li>
            <li>Love all the colors in one palette.  </li>
            <li>too many glitter colors and not enuf matte colors for my taste.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this :)  </li>
            <li>just ok,  probably would not buy again</li>
            <li>I am brown complexioned with an oily t-zone, and I&#x27;ve found that the powder shadow has more staying power.</li>
            <li>Love the colors though.</li>
            <li>Overall great product!</li>
            <li>Some of the colors shimmer and some are matte, which I LOVE that there is a variety.</li>
            <li>The gold shimmer color is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok and that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li>I love the color choices.  </li>
            <li>Love the variety of colors...</li>
            <li>I really love this eyeshadow palette.</li>
            <li>My daughters both love these colors.  </li>
            <li>The colors were great, but not as pigmented as I am used to with my higher end shadows, however it is quite a nice collection of colors and the price was worth the gamble.</li>
            <li>Great selection and good quality for the price as long as i use my eye primer</li>
            <li>I was hoping for more vibrant colors but these ones work very nicely with my olive colored skin.  </li>
            <li>Best grey</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re good...not great only because I don&#x27;t see the need to use many of the colours.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are a really nice quality and there&#x27;s a pretty strong variety.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s pretty nice.</li>
            <li>smaller than i thought but beautiful colors</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a rather cheap (quality and price) pallet that I had been using for awhile.</li>
            <li>This shadow goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>Great quality at a terrific value.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>Such a great price</li>
            <li>The color choices fit any outfit or season.</li>
            <li>Nice and great for everyday.  </li>
            <li>They are not heavily pigmented, but they still go on good and blend well.</li>
            <li>My sister seemed excited about it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money though!</li>
            <li>definitely recommend this, its a great alternative to higher end brands!</li>
            <li>Bought this to go with a nice set of makeup brushes that was a gift for a young lady who aspires to be a makeup artist.  </li>
            <li>Not bad for a the price though, I guess, since you get 32 palettes.</li>
            <li>This was great when I need to due makeup for my lioness costume for halloween.</li>
            <li>For just buying a different eye shadow brand,  this actually was really great!</li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty in this palette and the mirror on top is really helpful.</li>
            <li>The light blue fell out during shipping, but that&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>But still, affordbale and useful.</li>
            <li>That is mostly the only time I put make on as I work from home and really don&#x27;t see anyone any more.</li>
            <li>and I have been using their lid brushes, but I have not tried on any of the eyeshadows until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is just the right size -</li>
            <li>the shadows are very cheap and barely show up on my eye.</li>
            <li>i love e.l.f eyeshadows the everyday i have not tried yet but am very excited too when i do one day</li>
            <li>The shades of many of the colors are different than pictured.  </li>
            <li>With a replacement blush, these colors are pretty.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;d probably work even better with a primer, which I&#x27;ll be buying next!</li>
            <li>love the different colours!</li>
            <li>They stay on pretty well even without any primer nonsense.</li>
            <li>While there are mostly neutrals in this collection, there are just enough brights to give you choices.</li>
            <li>The hinge broke on the case fairly quickly, but other than this, I love this set.</li>
            <li>My last one had a lot of glittery and bright colors that I could wear on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>the less, I really love this palette!</li>
            <li>I have another palette from them that I really like, but a lot of the shades in this one just aren&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li>They also hold their pigment really well on the eyelids, which is what I hoped for to start with.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors - a bit paler than I was expecting (</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really encounter a lot of fall out.</li>
            <li>I got the everyday color, I like wearing purples, lavenders, no other colors look good on me.</li>
            <li>The pigment on my skin isn&#x27;t as bright as I would like, even with eyeshadow primer, but I prefer subtle looks anyway.  </li>
            <li>You do need a primer because it lasts really well with the primer, and the colour payoff is decent.</li>
            <li>I normally buy the maybelline that has the 3 colors.</li>
            <li>Use this almost daily - fun to have a lot of shades to choose from.</li>
            <li>but I mean obviously there isn&#x27;t a huge amount of each color since there are so many</li>
            <li>The one problem is just that if you use one color regularly it gets used up pretty quickly, which is kind of sad</li>
            <li>I am normally very sensitive to eyeshadows, but no problems with E L F products.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a sapphire blue but this blue is more of a marine blue.</li>
            <li>it is really worthy buying this product with such a low price and the color block is not small at all~</li>
            <li>The colors go on a little light so you have to apply a generous amount if your going for a darker look.</li>
            <li>Was pleasantly surprised....</li>
            <li>I actually did not expect to like this palette as much as I do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>People were really surprised as was I and my husband.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no finely milled, shimmery shades here - but there are some with huge glittery chunks.  </li>
            <li>forgot to let u know that it actually comes off easily less than an hour, colors are most likely as shown but they dont have pigmentation to stick on your eyelid</li>
            <li>No more rummaging through so many different palettes.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old niece wars it on the daily</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the try, especially if money is tight.</li>
            <li>I was not willing to pay a bunch of money for real lion makeup that I would only use once.</li>
            <li>Long lasting and vivid colors.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love all the colors in one palette.  No more rummaging through so many different palettes.</li>
            <li> Tons of colors and the price was great.</li>
            <li> I like how the eyeshadow lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Love my shadows!  Best grey I have used besides Mac.  For the price this is great!  Lots of colors that compliment each other. The colors last all day too.</li>
            <li> too many glitter colors and not enuf matte colors for my taste. use of an eye primer is recommended.</li>
            <li> The shades of many of the colors are different than pictured.  They&#x27;re warmer and appropriate more for someone with a warmer complexion, but they look good for cooler complexions in the photo.  The case is hard to open, too.  You&#x27;ll need to bend a fingernail to open it.  I bought another e.l.f. palette with the same results.</li>
            <li> good item as an add on</li>
            <li> I really liked this eye shadow. I got the everyday color, I like wearing purples, lavenders, no other colors look good on me. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with the colors I have used. For the price it&#x27;s pretty nice. I&#x27;m not one that can go spend a lot of money on make up, so when I saw this, I was excited!! I normally buy the maybelline that has the 3 colors. But wanted something that I could play around with other colors but stay close to the colors i use.  It&#x27;s worth the try, especially if money is tight. I would recommend this :)  I will put a picture of what I got below.</li>
            <li> it is really worthy buying this product with such a low price and the color block is not small at all~</li>
            <li> I wore eyeshadows from this palette to prom. This, with ELF eyeshadow primer, stayed on all night and didn&#x27;t smudge. Perfect!</li>
            <li> The light blue fell out during shipping, but that&#x27;s okay since I don&#x27;t like that color. The rest are perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice and great for everyday.  My 15 year old niece wars it on the daily and it doesn&#x27;t look to heavy or old.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my wife and she like the product.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift so cannot rate on performance. However, colors seemed nice. Set was small. My sister seemed excited about it.</li>
            <li> Some of the eye shadow is shiny (has glitter in it) but aside from that it&#x27;s a good product given the price.</li>
            <li> I would have given this a 5 star rating but the online picture showed the colors a bit different.  I was hoping for more vibrant colors but these ones work very nicely with my olive colored skin.  I was hoping for a sapphire blue but this blue is more of a marine blue.</li>
            <li> With a replacement blush, these colors are pretty. Not much fallout, especially when primer is used.</li>
            <li> There only one color in here that doesnt seem to work for me. Its a chunky color, there&#x27;s no pigmentation and just a bunch of gold glitter</li>
            <li> The hinge broke on the case fairly quickly, but other than this, I love this set. I like the variety of colors and the boldness of the pigment. I use an ELF eyeshadow base that keeps the color in place all day long, and I love the combo.</li>
            <li> Great selection and good quality for the price as long as i use my eye primer the eyeshadow lasts all day i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Very good for the price!</li>
            <li> i love e.l.f eyeshadows the everyday i have not tried yet but am very excited too when i do one day</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow! ! Great colors, great quality  Ordered 2 and love them</li>
            <li> just ok,  probably would not buy again</li>
            <li> I got the Everyday palette.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging looks nice.... but even though I had fair / light skin, the pigment was too light! Not bad for a the price though, I guess, since you get 32 palettes. I didn&#x27;t apply eye primer, though. I&#x27;ll update my review once I do that.</li>
            <li> This is a great eyeshadow kit for a beginner like me. I am brown complexioned with an oily t-zone, and I&#x27;ve found that the powder shadow has more staying power. I definately would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Nice colors but the shadows are very cheap and barely show up on my eye. Do not get this it&#x27;s a waste of money</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last all day. Very good for temporary use.  Maybe applying eye shadow primer will help? Love the colors though.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. Great combination of colors.</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented or lasting.  There&#x27;s no finely milled, shimmery shades here - but there are some with huge glittery chunks.  There are lots of colors that are so similar they might as well be duplicates.  The only reason why this gets two stars is that there are a few colors that are decent.</li>
            <li> For just buying a different eye shadow brand,  this actually was really great! Goes on nicely,  stays on. Doesn&#x27;t smudge.  Overall great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried plenty of ELF products and liked them; they tend to be very good products for the price. I have another palette from them that I really like, but a lot of the shades in this one just aren&#x27;t very pigmented. I was looking for an affordable palette to recommend to others and was very disappointed with this one. I never reach for this in my makeup collection.</li>
            <li> e.l.f cosmetics are SO underrated! Their products work so well and the prices are affordable. This is for the MAC wannabees, us beauty loving girls on a budget! The colors are so pretty in this palette and the mirror on top is really helpful. Some of the colors shimmer and some are matte, which I LOVE that there is a variety. The gold shimmer color is my favorite. They also hold their pigment really well on the eyelids, which is what I hoped for to start with. They&#x27;d probably work even better with a primer, which I&#x27;ll be buying next! All in all I&#x27;m soooo happy with this palette. Seriously, buy it. It&#x27;s so good.</li>
            <li> Was pleasantly surprised....love the different colours! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
            <li> The mirror had become unattached by the time I received it.</li>
            <li> The colors are awesome. This palette is great for me a beginner. The colors go on a little light so you have to apply a generous amount if your going for a darker look.</li>
            <li> Use this almost daily - fun to have a lot of shades to choose from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok and that&#x27;s it the pigment is very hard to achieve even with a primer I gave 2 stars for a couple that arnt chalky and U pigmented Iam trying another company as far as eyeshadows go not good</li>
            <li> Happy with my purchase. A wide variety of colors .my one problem is it is very difficult to open, I have broken two nails in my attempts. My advice save your nails and your manicure and use a key or clip to open,</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re good...not great only because I don&#x27;t see the need to use many of the colours. But still, affordbale and useful.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors - a bit paler than I was expecting (the blues and purples are more pastel looking to me), but still beautiful.  The pigment on my skin isn&#x27;t as bright as I would like, even with eyeshadow primer, but I prefer subtle looks anyway.  A nice mixture of matte and sparkly colors.</li>
            <li> great colors,lots of choices.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a rather cheap (quality and price) pallet that I had been using for awhile. I love the color choices.  My last one had a lot of glittery and bright colors that I could wear on a daily basis. This one has a wider color selection. This shadow goes on smoothly and I don&#x27;t have to pile on layer after layer to see the shades. I combine it with e.l.f eyelid primer for all day crease proof wear.</li>
            <li> Great quality at a terrific value. I am normally very sensitive to eyeshadows, but no problems with E L F products. Fantastic.</li>
            <li> smaller than i thought but beautiful colors</li>
            <li> i dont like it i bought it over reviews but thez forgot to let u know that it actually comes off easily less than an hour, colors are most likely as shown but they dont have pigmentation to stick on your eyelid</li>
            <li> When I received this 50% of the eye shadows were knocked out....completely a mess</li>
            <li> Not great coverage and color is lacking.  Needed tons of shadow on brush to even look like the suggested color.</li>
            <li> Great, just wish it came with a better brush to apply the shadow.  Love the variety of colors... Stays on all day</li>
            <li> Just received this and am so excited for it!!! Such a great price a s I love all the colors! Definitely recommend!!</li>
            <li> I have heard of e.l.f. products before and I have been using their lid brushes, but I have not tried on any of the eyeshadows until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is just the right size - has all the colors I need and use and not too big and bulky to put in the purse or for travel.&lt;br /&gt;The price is not too shabby either!&lt;br /&gt;Thank You.</li>
            <li> I really love this eyeshadow palette. It has plenty of colors to choose from. They are not heavily pigmented, but they still go on good and blend well. For the price, e.l.f. products just can not be beat.</li>
            <li> Product delivered well</li>
            <li> lots of colors and options - good product</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are a really nice quality and there&#x27;s a pretty strong variety. They stay on pretty well even without any primer nonsense. The one problem is just that if you use one color regularly it gets used up pretty quickly, which is kind of sad but I mean obviously there isn&#x27;t a huge amount of each color since there are so many and it&#x27;s so inexpensive. It&#x27;s definitely worth the money though!</li>
            <li> This is a great palette.  My daughters both love these colors.  Nice mix of color with neutrals.</li>
            <li> Impressive eyeshadow for the price.  Bought this to go with a nice set of makeup brushes that was a gift for a young lady who aspires to be a makeup artist.  She loved it.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I actually did not expect to like this palette as much as I do.&lt;br /&gt;The colors in here are really beautiful, pigmented, &amp; easy to blend out.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really encounter a lot of fall out. However, some of the shades are quite chalky.&lt;br /&gt;None the less, I really love this palette! The color selection is spot on, and the looks you can create with this are so stunning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this, its a great alternative to higher end brands!</li>
            <li> For the price its good.  Some of the colors are a lot lighter than they look.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and vivid colors. The color choices fit any outfit or season. While there are mostly neutrals in this collection, there are just enough brights to give you choices.</li>
            <li> You do need a primer because it lasts really well with the primer, and the colour payoff is decent. The matte sometimes need layering.</li>
            <li> This was great when I need to due makeup for my lioness costume for halloween. I did it all with this eyeshadow palette. People were really surprised as was I and my husband. I was not willing to pay a bunch of money for real lion makeup that I would only use once. This I can keep and use next year during halloween again. That is mostly the only time I put make on as I work from home and really don&#x27;t see anyone any more. This is great.</li>
            <li> The colors were great, but not as pigmented as I am used to with my higher end shadows, however it is quite a nice collection of colors and the price was worth the gamble.</li>
