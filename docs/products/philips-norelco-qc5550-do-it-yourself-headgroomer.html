            <li>Just a smooth shaven head that looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li>This thing is really fabulous - the Philips engineers did themselves proud.</li>
            <li>I liked what I saw, and after reading up on it, ordered one.</li>
            <li>I have never cut my own hair before I got this one.  </li>
            <li>Product met my expectation, had all the bells and whilste attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Durable product, nice size fits in palm nice</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best hair groomer.</li>
            <li>The design is a good idea but the manufacturer should have put some better materials.</li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good for many things, as a head shaver</li>
            <li>own a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Charges and fells nice.</li>
            <li>First use, I was able to shave my head perfectly in a fraction of the time that it would take me to go get it done at a hairstylist.  </li>
            <li>It is a very easy do-it-yourself unit.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>and it is very easy to handle, but</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found by far.</li>
            <li>Among the Do-it-yourself (DIY) headgroomers I had, I would say that the Philips Norelco Qc5550/40 is so far, the best.  </li>
            <li>Its shaving head accessory also proves to be of great addition to the package.  </li>
            <li>Most of the rechargeable devices I own have an LED that indicates once the unit is fully charged, but on this groomer the LED starts flashing when it&#x27;s time to recharge.</li>
            <li>By far the best unit on the market.  </li>
            <li>I started thinking that looking at the $20 plus my time to travel and to wait for my turn could be done a lot better if I cut my own.  </li>
            <li>Among the Do-it-yourself (DIY) headgroomers I had, I would say that the Philips Norelco Qc5550/40 is so far, the best.</li>
            <li>Its shaving head accessory also proves to be of great addition to the package.</li>
            <li>I was really happy how the sides came out and honestly looked exactly like I just got a $20 hair cut.</li>
            <li>Love it, does a good job, easy to use.</li>
            <li>it very comfortable!very good!</li>
            <li>It works great and it easy to use, it will give you the clean head shave look.</li>
            <li>It was incredibly hassle free, and the replacement has been running great for several months now.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li>Cuts good and quick, no pulling on my hair.</li>
            <li>So I quickly  returned it before it dies on me for good.</li>
            <li>No scrapes, no razor burn, no irritation of any kind, and it was quick - my kind of deal.</li>
            <li>have some very light thinning in the front of my head that has pushed me towards more shorter hair cuts which let be blend things in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I have never tried, but it does looks more safer and smoother)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>However, when I read about (Philips Norelco&#x27;s QC5550 DO-It-Yourself Headgroomer, I decided to take a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it two times to make sure I haven&#x27;t received by mistake a defective unit...</li>
            <li>Safe and efficient for all your grooming needs.</li>
            <li>A lot better than some of the electric shavers that I used to have.</li>
            <li>Lovely.</li>
            <li>I am 100% satisfied with it, but it is ok</li>
            <li>If you are looked for smooth bald head, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had so many kinds of hair clippers and always had problems with something</li>
            <li>Gets most of it done in one pass</li>
            <li>The next version could be perfect.</li>
            <li>I do have to say I was impressed with the design of the Remington product but reading the reviews about battery life and people having to replace them every year left me no choice but to choose the product which I thought was second best</li>
            <li>I love this itemï¼Œdo</li>
            <li>Boy is this so much better.</li>
            <li>The battery is excellent that I can trim my hair and then have a lot of charge left over, It also hold charge for weeks.</li>
            <li>Does a respectable job of keeping my head shaved.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply made!</li>
            <li>maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those who do not wish to spend tinme waiting for barber service :)</li>
            <li>I did a better job with my ANDIS BALDER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li>Love it, love it, love it...</li>
            <li>I like to be able to skip a day or two.  </li>
            <li>Not terribly even either.</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the performance, however, after just 2 months one of the springs on the blades broke and I could not get it back on.  </li>
            <li>But like I said earlier, the Customer Service lady was great, and even took my call on a Sunday!</li>
            <li>When you run your hand over the shaven area you can still feel the fuzz, this is what I meant it could do a better job.</li>
            <li>This is the best Headgroomer I have purchased, making it the third.  </li>
            <li>Maybe if you have finer hair, it will work better for you.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent product, especially for bald heads.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>The more I did it the more hair fell off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The unit body and finish itself is actually pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>A pleasant surprise that I&#x27;ve grown very fond of is the charging LED where the power cord plugs in.</li>
            <li>Safe to use, easy to use and</li>
            <li>Use the brushing unit and warm water, it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and clean when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>The overall ergonomic design and application of the unit is very good.</li>
            <li>The travel pouch and hand mirror are a nice touch as well, but the quality of this product stands alone as worth the price tag.</li>
            <li>Easy and comfortable to use excellent for those who enjoy a very short crop!</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m in Afghanistan it would make for an easy shve</li>
            <li>Still cuts easily through and I never had my hair get caught and pulled on by the trimmer.</li>
            <li>The shaving head accessory can shave your head cleanly and safely.</li>
            <li>easy break.....</li>
            <li>All the bells and whistles that came with the package does make buzzing/shaving easy.  </li>
            <li>It is easily used.</li>
            <li>I tried to do it for him but it irritated his scalp too easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use by myself</li>
            <li>Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Compact</li>
            <li>the blade head rotates so it easy to manuvour it..</li>
            <li>cleans easily</li>
            <li>The headgroomer is smooth , precise and easy to use , so i realy love it.</li>
            <li>But you can easily make mistake with this, since the length it leaves depend on the angle of your hand.</li>
            <li>Everything snaps off and on easily.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve used it 4 times, still going strong.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps the most satisfying product of its kind: sleek and comfortable design, high performance in operation, fully accessorized, compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li>But for what I use it for it works great, powerful, fast, comfortable.</li>
            <li>Shaves beard and mustache pretty nice, leaves</li>
            <li>Awesome product - shaves down to bald</li>
            <li>I can shave easy and fast and safe!</li>
            <li>This does not do that and the swiveling head which I thought wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal is actually pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li>Works fine with me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comfortable mirror with a rubber band attached to it.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming attachment - good quality blades, though not professional ones, like in Moser/Oster/Andis, but this also means that blades do not require to apply oil after each use - convenient by means of maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Big comb to make a nice haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller</li>
            <li>By contrast, the Philips Norelco clipper operates smoothly, and easily and reliably.</li>
            <li>Works great as a headshaver, but the foils break too easy and cost 1/2 as much as the whole razor.</li>
            <li>He really did a good job with it the very first time.  </li>
            <li>and close is the best way to describe this little gem.</li>
            <li>Granted, I have relatively light growth on my chin.  </li>
            <li>The the unit itself isn&#x27;t that sturdy or durable, it&#x27;s made from cheap materials.</li>
            <li>The motor sounds fairly quiet and cuts the hair with great precision.  </li>
            <li>Smooth.</li>
            <li>Light weight morphed into cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li>When fully charged, the surround light goes out.</li>
            <li>This Norelco QC5550/40 headgroomer is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Overall its a great product.</li>
            <li>The motor sounds fairly quiet and cuts the hair with great precision.</li>
            <li>Its great to have a cord just in case the battery gets low.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the cheap $10-$20 conair hair trimmers for over 2 years.</li>
            <li>After the 1st couple of sessions, I felt extremely comfortable handling the shaver and utilizing the rotating head function for around the ears and when swapping hands/sides of the head.</li>
            <li>It made an unbearable squeaking sound every 2-3 mins.</li>
            <li>Might need a grip surface on the brown smooth side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and use, battery lasts forever.</li>
            <li>They do a fine job but have significant shortcomings that the Philips Headgroom addresses completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just charge it, clean it, and replace the shaving head every 3-5 months depending on your usage and you should be fine.</li>
            <li>Attachments are very useful.</li>
            <li>My first time using it was very smooth and everything went well with trimming my brother hair.  </li>
            <li>You can also clean it under running water which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I like to keep my head totally clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>Have used normal razor blades for many, many years.</li>
            <li>The product is really out of my expectation ,it&#x27;s very easy to operation.</li>
            <li>(although it has many settings so you can get the exact length you want) - and it was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>, of course, the device itself - very good quality plastic and rubber is used - tight grip and comfortable in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Come to find out that even when the light goes out when charging (suppose to be a full charge)</li>
            <li>I have shaved my head for almost 10 years and this sounded interesting when I first saw it.  </li>
            <li>(I wrote this evaluation on a separate review of the same product, but because this one has more reviews, I figure it would garner and generate more eyeballs thus alerting more consumers to my experience with this machine).</li>
            <li>No skin irritation and most of the hairs get cut in the first streak.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure that this will be it..</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this out when I got it.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased a rechargeable shaver and the replacement they sent me was a corded electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Nice new shape</li>
            <li>I cut it with the close trimmer for about a week, maybe two, and liked it much better than the Shortcut: easier to use, and not as likely to scrape my scalp, and faster, to boot.</li>
            <li>so be prepared for a bit of clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t require any dis-assembly to clean.</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly and does not tear the hair out.</li>
            <li>Some parts of my head were clean shaved, while others had a noticeable stubble.  </li>
            <li>For me its acceptable because it gives you a clean shaven head.  </li>
            <li>manual work is very delicateï¼Œ meets the need of meã€‚Goods distribution is also very thoughtful and timely&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its very light and very well designed.</li>
            <li>Overall good cut but pour performace if you like to take your time.</li>
            <li>I use it every three days and on a full charge, it lasts me over three weeks.</li>
            <li>A few years back the battery did die and will no longer hold a charge, but it held up for about 5 years, which is impressive on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>Took me 20 mins to go full bald with that thing.  </li>
            <li>really wanted to love them.</li>
            <li>This was a present for my boyfriend, and though the reviews were good, i&#x27;m looking for another product to get for him.</li>
            <li>Really gives you a shave as close as a bode - well, almost :)</li>
            <li>very solid good quality, and everything fits so well, not even a thing for regretting</li>
            <li>but it really does not seem that agile for someone to self shave, Then I looked into the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>He is new to shaving his head bald and this seemed like the perfect product, but after his first use he was left with brush-burn like marks on his scalp.</li>
            <li>It glides smoothly and leaves a pretty uniform and clean buzz.</li>
            <li>, it looks great when hold it in your hand, but i bought it for the other guy;</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be any more satisfied with any product I&#x27;ve bought in the last year.</li>
            <li>It works both on battery or plugged in and the battery does not self-discharge quickly.</li>
            <li>you can make the clear hair style by yourself very easy.</li>
            <li>overall product is great and of high quality.</li>
            <li>I purchased that one to be able to have a haircut, while I live and work in the USA.</li>
            <li>new attachment is much better quality, but I am still worried about its durability.  </li>
            <li>The blades actually feel cool to the touch which is nice.  </li>
            <li>As for the shaving unit, I suggest you run it under the water (but remove the head from the groomer itself first!)</li>
            <li>I like the easy height settings and that the head rotates so you can reach the back of your head at a better angle.  </li>
            <li>The head unit canbe turned 180 degrees, making it easy to get the cutter positioned to cut sides and back, top, front, all around, without craning your neck, or contorting to see in the mirror.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine, and really gives my bald head a close shave.</li>
            <li>This was a great shaver for a little over 2 months.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adjustable and cuts very closely and comfortably.</li>
            <li>Comparatively the Phillips Norelco - provides a much cleaner bald trim, its light weight and requires no oiling or power adjustment.</li>
            <li>Amazon Customer Service was absolutely amazing with the exchange process and shipped me the same model the</li>
            <li>really wanted the Qc5550 to be a light, cordless, swiveling head replacement.  </li>
            <li>so thats worth 3 to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only shaved my head 4 times with this so far, but it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>the clipper attachment gets much closer than a &#x27;regular&#x27; clipper, while the foil shaver achieves a good &#x27;bald&#x27; result on my noggin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the Philips Headgroom so far.</li>
            <li>but I use an old toothbrush as it&#x27;s more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li>You can however use it right away when you plug in the charger in.  </li>
            <li>Right away I noticed that the clipper would not give a sub-zero cut just by looking at it.  </li>
            <li>The foil attachement really helps with getting a very smooth surface :-)&lt;br /&gt;Philips absolutely is head and sholders above any product out there.</li>
            <li>But normal useage should be fine.  </li>
            <li>I was blown away by how clean, fast and efficient the buzz head was.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a very easy to use dial with multiple settings instead of clip on attachments.</li>
            <li>Very easy to handle, multiple shapes to choose.</li>
            <li>The battery last a fair amount of time and i only need to charge it once every two weeks and has an overall good quality.</li>
            <li>The unit itself is fine, it shaves my head as well as my face (which is a bonus) pretty decently</li>
            <li>I still have some hair on the top of my head but generally speaking</li>
            <li>Nice, little, efficient, comfortable headgroomer.</li>
            <li>I am impressed with how quickly it gets through a big boofhead&#x27;s worth of thick hair.</li>
            <li>Very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However they do not move back at all, and give a very precise shave.</li>
            <li>While this is a good body grooming tool, easy to handle and lasting a long time on a charge, it certainly will not shave my head.</li>
            <li>Also, in order to get any kind of decent results, it needs to be used daily.</li>
            <li>I buy this product, it only took three times it will not be able to start again.</li>
            <li>I lost is part of the money, it will lose the whole company!</li>
            <li>I have only used this 4 are 5 times so far to shave my head, but like the title says it has done a good job with no problems at all, very ez to use</li>
            <li>I will have to leave it for a few more hours before I can actually get a good use out of it.</li>
            <li>The Shaver does exactly what it claims it will do.</li>
            <li>yr warranty and can work on the cord if necessary and seems to have the cordless power to get through most hair.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>Just shave it, straight away!</li>
            <li>The first is that the razor died within two months after I purchased it.</li>
            <li>the plastic will wear out and the blades won&#x27;t be able to attach to attach back on (what happened to me).</li>
            <li>The shaver is built like a jack-in-the-box: you open it up, the parts fly out and you have to very meticulously put them back.</li>
            <li>My first unit made a screeching noise after a month of use.  </li>
            <li>A charge will last four or five days, or more, if you cut your hair every day.</li>
            <li>Listen, this will not be a blade replacement but it&#x27;ll get you pretty darn close to one.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li>Because it was my first time to do it</li>
            <li>I dont like shaving all the way and this buzzer is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t beleive it till we saw, it really works for bald heads!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Highly recommended for people, who is willing to make a haircut by self.</li>
            <li>He did use the attachment to lower his hair at first, and that worked well.</li>
            <li>it has several attachments to adjust the length since I wouldn&#x27;t want to bald them :)</li>
            <li>At first, I thought it was a bit of plastic around the blade or maybe hair.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li>I really like this!  </li>
            <li>In all, I was spending more time using this product than using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I tried going all over my head at every different angle, in case it did better against the grain.</li>
            <li>Just 10 mins after using it for the first time it was already defectiv.</li>
            <li>The first one we purchased just stopped working after about 6 months.</li>
            <li>At first I almost purchased the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>The balder attachment does give a good, close shave, however there are parts of my head that it shaves unevenly.  </li>
            <li>You can really shave down your head clean and safe.  </li>
            <li>You can really shave down your head clean and safe.</li>
            <li>I can really shave down your head clean and safe.</li>
            <li>The blades seem to move around a bit at first, but they really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>still gave it two stars because I think it may still work great as a regular hair trimmer due to</li>
            <li>Stray long hairs and patches were everyone, no matter how many times I went over them.</li>
            <li>First impression is for the price, the build of it is pretty decent.</li>
            <li>I was clearly the two blades or the connection to the motor or the motor itself.&lt;br /&gt;Other than this MAJOR flaw, the unit was OK.</li>
            <li>Easy to use especially for close cuts.  </li>
            <li>It just stops suddenly and without warning, however it charges very quickly.</li>
            <li>Luckily we had an old one whose machine was functional</li>
            <li>About the size as a regular electric razor and as easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a nice little touch.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a guy that likes the shaved look and hates the hassle of taking a straight razor to your head, this Philips Norelco is for you.</li>
            <li>The cut is very close which is what I was looking for</li>
            <li>I can shave with a blade much faster and much, much closer.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;they need to make replacement parts available especially parts that are parts that do need to be replaced&lt;br /&gt;often</li>
            <li>Very close shaving and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li>Alright where to begin-there&#x27;s so much about this product that needs saying.</li>
            <li>The white light indicating that it was charging still did work, but the unit would not operate and turn on when I&#x27;d hit the button.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Gives him a very close cut -</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only a few dollars more and is MUCH more substantial.  </li>
            <li>Wish it cut a bit longer, but works really well.</li>
            <li>Works very well ..... .... ... ... ... . . . . . . . .  . . . .</li>
            <li>but this one really do its job with no any problems, so fast doing my self</li>
            <li>This works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>(if they have not changed too much)  I bought one of these 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li>The design is still very close to what I have with the exception that I did not get the shave attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on that part of it.  </li>
            <li>I was done buzzing my whole head in 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted this to be a razor replacement.  </li>
            <li>It does get very close</li>
            <li>My whole head not including face took over 30 minutes to get finished.  </li>
            <li>but they thought it just like what the real headgroomer did.</li>
            <li>A must have for anyone who wants to maintain a Bald look.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research and this is really so</li>
            <li>So that is really a moot point.</li>
            <li>This shaver works really well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li>We were very dissapointed with the purchase as we paid over 70 bucks.</li>
            <li>never used this type of device before but found this very convenient..</li>
            <li>I just spent $19.99 on haircut maybe for many years.</li>
            <li>It provides a very close shave although not as close as blade.&lt;br /&gt;But without troubles and very</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get a straight up corded clipper, or anything else.</li>
            <li>The shave is very close.</li>
            <li>Really like it.</li>
            <li>I really can DIY my hair in the bath room now.</li>
            <li>Compare to other \\&quot;DIY hair clipper\\&quot;, this one provides stylish haircuts which however require some skills.  </li>
            <li>I opened the box and the replacement was not the same razor that I originally purchased.</li>
            <li>The blades just did not cut through easily, thus making the process very long.</li>
            <li>It would also start spitting back the hair already cut into my head, making me having to clean the blades during the shaving process.</li>
            <li>I shave my head every other day, so using a razor is pretty easy, but I left it grow for about 2 weeks and this thing breezed right threw it!</li>
            <li>Fast, easy, no irritation, no real downside.</li>
            <li>Charges quickly, cuts cleanly, and the rotation of the head allows for cleaner cuts than previous groomer&#x27;s could do.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised after shaving my head for the first time.  </li>
            <li>The first one worked for about 2 weeks then made a loud grinding noise</li>
            <li>I was sceptic about the results of the headgroomer and after my first use i was surprised.</li>
            <li>In short; it gets super close NO stubble left but the battery fully charged wont make it through a full cut.</li>
            <li>Worked for a dozen time then just died on me... too bad because us was really comfortable to use, and did a great job.</li>
            <li>The previous version of this item did a better job of containing the hair pieces, but it didn&#x27;t cut as well.  </li>
            <li>If anybody knows of a decent and efficient head shaver that will get the job done, please comment and recommend one.</li>
            <li>Positives:  -Decent  </li>
            <li>I had the older model for about 3 years now, but it had a EU plug charger.</li>
            <li>Having said that I can confirm that I have not been in a situation when it run out of charge like the older norelco.  </li>
            <li>I bought it mainly for the balder and it worked</li>
            <li>Personally I don&#x27;t allow my hair to grow more than an inch long, and when I saw this product I was sold by the very close buzz and a shaving adapter.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recomended.</li>
            <li>expectations were high on purchasing this product, expectations  were surpassed by eons.&lt;br /&gt;Thanking</li>
            <li>But like with any other rechargeable appliance, make sure you use it until battery is completely drained, then recharge it.     </li>
            <li>lightweight and small and therefore very easy to use in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li>On the top of my head I use a little longer setting.  </li>
            <li>I hope this has helped you understand it a little better.</li>
            <li>First we thought of sending it back but the policy said only unopened in original packing will be accepted/refunded.</li>
            <li>It does its job, but wish it could do it a little better.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Battery runs around 1h, charging very fast, Li-Ion is used.&lt;br /&gt;Travel charger unit with american plug (should depend of the market, mine was for U.S.).</li>
            <li>you cut your hair short, this device is worth looking into.</li>
            <li>product is definitely worth the extra $10-$20 over the cheaper competition, as you can tell Phillips put added quality into this model.</li>
            <li>It works best with multiple slow passes and different angles to get a even cut especially on a head as bumpy as mine.</li>
            <li>have not used any other product available in the market</li>
            <li>I contacted Amazon and a new unit was sent immediately.</li>
            <li>So I went to the Phillips website and started a live chat with one of their representatives.</li>
            <li>I wore one of them out, and just got a new one in June.</li>
            <li>when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I had a defect with balder section within 90 days but contacted manufacter, sent me a new one.</li>
            <li>It seemed new in the packing when it arrived.</li>
            <li>I really like the part that it could really cut my hair to as short as 1mm (3/64 inch).  </li>
            <li>I really like the part that it could really cut my hair to as short as 1mm (3/64 inch).</li>
            <li>I really like the part that it could really cut my hair to as short as 1mm (3/64 inch)</li>
            <li>Excellent device for multiple styles of cutting.</li>
            <li>After running about three minutes, it would screech very loudly and freeze up.</li>
            <li>Thought and care went into shaping the product, as it feels very natural and ergonomical in hand at this point.</li>
            <li>Too bad because it really looked like a good clipper!</li>
            <li>This is my second unit as the first unit that I ordered was stripped out and would not cut.  </li>
            <li>I just want something that&#x27;s going to last pretty indefinitely</li>
            <li>replacement is still running without any issues, and I use the groomer weekly, so obviously the first unit I received was not representative of the quality of this product.</li>
            <li>finally i&#x27;ve got what exactly want.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll get a pretty close to blade (but NOT same as) shave.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty close but not close enough.  </li>
            <li>I would have give this Norelco a higher rating like 4 to 5 stars if it is still working after the second time.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for cutting hair yourself!</li>
            <li>The first (bought locally, Toronto, Canada) unit&#x27;s foil became unusable with a hole after three months use.</li>
            <li>It feels great in hand, compare to some other buzzers this Philips is a bit heavier and you can easily get a grip on it without slipping or getting tired.   </li>
            <li>so we replaced the old blades with new ones and started using.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty much the \\&quot;monk\\&quot; style with regular growth on the sides and back</li>
            <li>Only criticism is when used with the guard off, where the bare metal is a bit scratchy...not as smooth as my Wahl, although the Wahl is much bigger and heavier.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for everyone (such as guys still lucky enough to have hair but want to shave it)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll last a week or more with less frequent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic electric shaver for years, which looks and works a little like a smaller, more precision version of the balding attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only way you could get a closer shave is by doing it with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve charged it once so far</li>
            <li>The one I purchased and told her was QC5550 (looking directly at the box), the one I found out that she recorded was QC5530/40 (a cheaper alternative without the balder attachment).</li>
            <li>Not overly loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d had my clipper for about eight weeks, so I&#x27;d used it eight times, when it developed a problem.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d really wanted to know if there was some way I could lubricate the groomer to eliminate the problem, but after hearing what was happening the representative simply sent me replacement unit.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and to use razors on my head gives me razor bumps and burns all the time.</li>
            <li>stops working and makes loud noise</li>
            <li>It began to squeal wildly.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re after the complete Chrome Dome look, this may not give it to you.</li>
            <li>This makes the work much quicker and has the capability to trim facial hair.</li>
            <li>They said they would replace the complete unit but that was four months ago.</li>
            <li>B000VVT94G Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper]]</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I remember reading that the information that came with the unit mentioned that the machine would last some time, but the second representative I talked to mentioned that it would last over a year (as though I&#x27;m supposed to be satisfied with that response) and even THAT claim didn&#x27;t hold true.</li>
            <li>-Very fragile due to cheap materials  </li>
            <li>The rotating head allows you to reach from any angle, particularly when using a handheld mirror to shave/trim back of head &amp; neck.</li>
            <li>It costs under $10 and unless you are very particular about how your hair looks it might do the trick and for much less money, If you really care how your hair looks go to a barber or hairdresser.</li>
            <li>After the machine is turned for awhile it makes a high pitch noise and turns off and then will not turn back on and yes it was fully charged.</li>
            <li>By the way, the unit comes with a hand-held mirror, about 5\\&quot; in diameter, with an elastic strap on the back to slide your hand under, to make holding easy, while holding the instrument in the other hand.</li>
            <li>I use it without a guard and it generally takes just two passes to complete a haircut.  </li>
            <li>A true waste of money.</li>
            <li>The small mirror is also very useful.</li>
            <li>It does better than most other methods of cutting with a groomer yourself.</li>
            <li>So I called Phillips again the next day and the new representative said she&#x27;d have somebody contact me anywhere from 24-48 hours because this product was a newer edition</li>
            <li>It really struggled to cut through hair in the back of my head, even when using it on a daily basis</li>
            <li>Walked out of the bathroom and my girlfriend was shocked and how fast and good it looked (she knows of the incident when I was 7)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Almost as good as a blade, but should be used at least every every 2 to 4 days,  Can be used quite a few times between charges.</li>
            <li>In the short term, the product performed well - very early on (after about 8 uses)</li>
            <li>Even though this product wasn&#x27;t thorough in making my head as smooth and bald as my face razors did, I felt for the times that I had used it, that it decent enough-I just had to go over areas of my head 10-15 times at the very least</li>
            <li>So it was decent overall, and not only that</li>
            <li>I also talked to another representative who said this unit lasts quite a long time, and came up with an astonishingly high number-somewhere between 5-6 years.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried at first because I have a sensitive head.</li>
            <li>For $50, I expected something that would last me 2-3 years, at the very least, and give me a satisfying and consistent head shave.</li>
            <li>It arrived in about a week, I put the old groomer in the box, attached the prepaid Fed Ex label, and dropped it off at my local Fed Ex store front.</li>
            <li>Maybe I expected too much.</li>
            <li>The second time I used it I got a loud squeaky noise followed by it shutting off.</li>
            <li>We thought we would try a second time and so far it is still working.</li>
            <li>You have to love it when a business stands behind their product</li>
            <li>The blades are kind of flimsy, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li>The directional change takes a little getting used to if you have been using regular clippers but its well worth it.</li>
            <li>This product caused MAJOR razor bumps over my ENTIRE head.</li>
            <li>will be getting a new one of these in the near future i&#x27;m sue, but will not even consider any other.  </li>
            <li>Only downside, if you will, is I would never use it without a spacer since the blades are very pointy and sharp.</li>
            <li>Also, frequently you have to go over the same spot several times with this razor even when you just brushed hair off of it.</li>
            <li>Not completely smooth bald, but pretty close.  </li>
            <li>It becomes worth the small effort it takes to keep it looking that</li>
            <li>Highly recommend over the other shavers online.</li>
            <li>good razor and clippers but almost impossible to get replacement screens and cutters for&lt;br /&gt;the shaver</li>
            <li>Aside from all of these chaotic events, the razor itself was loose; it would wiggle with my finger instead of remaining fixed.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe I just got a dud with a junk battery, but if the device can&#x27;t operate on a straight plug-in, when the battery holds even less of a charge as it ages (if it&#x27;s even possible to have more of a lousy battery) it will become entirely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since my monthly $20 hair cut and the sides of my head above my ears was growing out a little fast</li>

            <li> Good work thank you.</li>
            <li> good deal with good product, recommanded by some friends</li>

            <li> First shave my hair and shave my beard, awesome.</li>
            <li> Holds a charge forever, cuts easily, and feels great on the scalp.</li>
            <li> Just a smooth shaven head that looks and feels great.  </li>
            <li> This thing is really fabulous - the Philips engineers did themselves proud.</li>
            <li> I liked what I saw, and after reading up on it, ordered one.</li>
            <li> I have never cut my own hair before I got this one.  </li>
            <li> Product met my expectation, had all the bells and whilste attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Durable product, nice size fits in palm nice</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best hair groomer.</li>
            <li> The design is a good idea but the manufacturer should have put some better materials.</li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good for many things, as a head shaver</li>
            <li> own a [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Charges and fells nice.</li>
            <li> First use, I was able to shave my head perfectly in a fraction of the time that it would take me to go get it done at a hairstylist.  </li>
            <li> It is a very easy do-it-yourself unit.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> and it is very easy to handle, but</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found by far.</li>
            <li> Among the Do-it-yourself (DIY) headgroomers I had, I would say that the Philips Norelco Qc5550/40 is so far, the best.  </li>
            <li> Its shaving head accessory also proves to be of great addition to the package.  </li>
            <li> Most of the rechargeable devices I own have an LED that indicates once the unit is fully charged, but on this groomer the LED starts flashing when it&#x27;s time to recharge.</li>
            <li> By far the best unit on the market.  </li>
            <li> I started thinking that looking at the $20 plus my time to travel and to wait for my turn could be done a lot better if I cut my own.  </li>
            <li> Among the Do-it-yourself (DIY) headgroomers I had, I would say that the Philips Norelco Qc5550/40 is so far, the best.</li>
            <li> Its shaving head accessory also proves to be of great addition to the package.</li>
            <li> I was really happy how the sides came out and honestly looked exactly like I just got a $20 hair cut.</li>
            <li> Love it, does a good job, easy to use.</li>
            <li> it very comfortable!very good!</li>
            <li> It works great and it easy to use, it will give you the clean head shave look.</li>
            <li> It was incredibly hassle free, and the replacement has been running great for several months now.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li> Cuts good and quick, no pulling on my hair.</li>
            <li> So I quickly  returned it before it dies on me for good.</li>
            <li> No scrapes, no razor burn, no irritation of any kind, and it was quick - my kind of deal.</li>
            <li> have some very light thinning in the front of my head that has pushed me towards more shorter hair cuts which let be blend things in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I have never tried, but it does looks more safer and smoother)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> However, when I read about (Philips Norelco&#x27;s QC5550 DO-It-Yourself Headgroomer, I decided to take a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it two times to make sure I haven&#x27;t received by mistake a defective unit...</li>
            <li> Safe and efficient for all your grooming needs.</li>
            <li> A lot better than some of the electric shavers that I used to have.</li>
            <li> Lovely.</li>
            <li> I am 100% satisfied with it, but it is ok</li>
            <li> If you are looked for smooth bald head, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had so many kinds of hair clippers and always had problems with something</li>
            <li> Gets most of it done in one pass</li>
            <li> The next version could be perfect.</li>
            <li> I do have to say I was impressed with the design of the Remington product but reading the reviews about battery life and people having to replace them every year left me no choice but to choose the product which I thought was second best</li>
            <li> I love this itemï¼Œdo</li>
            <li> Boy is this so much better.</li>
            <li> The battery is excellent that I can trim my hair and then have a lot of charge left over, It also hold charge for weeks.</li>
            <li> Does a respectable job of keeping my head shaved.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply made!</li>
            <li> maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those who do not wish to spend tinme waiting for barber service :)</li>
            <li> I did a better job with my ANDIS BALDER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it...</li>
            <li> I like to be able to skip a day or two.  </li>
            <li> Not terribly even either.</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the performance, however, after just 2 months one of the springs on the blades broke and I could not get it back on.  </li>
            <li> But like I said earlier, the Customer Service lady was great, and even took my call on a Sunday!</li>
            <li> When you run your hand over the shaven area you can still feel the fuzz, this is what I meant it could do a better job.</li>
            <li> This is the best Headgroomer I have purchased, making it the third.  </li>
            <li> Maybe if you have finer hair, it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, especially for bald heads.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> The more I did it the more hair fell off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The unit body and finish itself is actually pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> A pleasant surprise that I&#x27;ve grown very fond of is the charging LED where the power cord plugs in.</li>
            <li> Safe to use, easy to use and</li>
            <li> Use the brushing unit and warm water, it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and clean when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The overall ergonomic design and application of the unit is very good.</li>
            <li> The travel pouch and hand mirror are a nice touch as well, but the quality of this product stands alone as worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Easy and comfortable to use excellent for those who enjoy a very short crop!</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m in Afghanistan it would make for an easy shve</li>
            <li> Still cuts easily through and I never had my hair get caught and pulled on by the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The shaving head accessory can shave your head cleanly and safely.</li>
            <li> easy break.....</li>
            <li> All the bells and whistles that came with the package does make buzzing/shaving easy.  </li>
            <li> It is easily used.</li>
            <li> I tried to do it for him but it irritated his scalp too easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use by myself</li>
            <li> Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Compact</li>
            <li> the blade head rotates so it easy to manuvour it..</li>
            <li> cleans easily</li>
            <li> The headgroomer is smooth , precise and easy to use , so i realy love it.</li>
            <li> But you can easily make mistake with this, since the length it leaves depend on the angle of your hand.</li>
            <li> Everything snaps off and on easily.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it 4 times, still going strong.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps the most satisfying product of its kind: sleek and comfortable design, high performance in operation, fully accessorized, compact and easy to use.</li>
            <li> But for what I use it for it works great, powerful, fast, comfortable.</li>
            <li> Shaves beard and mustache pretty nice, leaves</li>
            <li> Awesome product - shaves down to bald</li>
            <li> I can shave easy and fast and safe!</li>
            <li> This does not do that and the swiveling head which I thought wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal is actually pretty awesome.  </li>
            <li> Works fine with me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comfortable mirror with a rubber band attached to it.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming attachment - good quality blades, though not professional ones, like in Moser/Oster/Andis, but this also means that blades do not require to apply oil after each use - convenient by means of maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Big comb to make a nice haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller</li>
            <li> By contrast, the Philips Norelco clipper operates smoothly, and easily and reliably.</li>
            <li> Works great as a headshaver, but the foils break too easy and cost 1/2 as much as the whole razor.</li>
            <li> He really did a good job with it the very first time.  </li>
            <li> and close is the best way to describe this little gem.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have relatively light growth on my chin.  </li>
            <li> The the unit itself isn&#x27;t that sturdy or durable, it&#x27;s made from cheap materials.</li>
            <li> The motor sounds fairly quiet and cuts the hair with great precision.  </li>
            <li> Smooth.</li>
            <li> Light weight morphed into cheap plastic.  </li>
            <li> When fully charged, the surround light goes out.</li>
            <li> This Norelco QC5550/40 headgroomer is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Overall its a great product.</li>
            <li> The motor sounds fairly quiet and cuts the hair with great precision.</li>
            <li> Its great to have a cord just in case the battery gets low.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the cheap $10-$20 conair hair trimmers for over 2 years.</li>
            <li> After the 1st couple of sessions, I felt extremely comfortable handling the shaver and utilizing the rotating head function for around the ears and when swapping hands/sides of the head.</li>
            <li> It made an unbearable squeaking sound every 2-3 mins.</li>
            <li> Might need a grip surface on the brown smooth side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and use, battery lasts forever.</li>
            <li> They do a fine job but have significant shortcomings that the Philips Headgroom addresses completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just charge it, clean it, and replace the shaving head every 3-5 months depending on your usage and you should be fine.</li>
            <li> Attachments are very useful.</li>
            <li> My first time using it was very smooth and everything went well with trimming my brother hair.  </li>
            <li> You can also clean it under running water which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I like to keep my head totally clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> Have used normal razor blades for many, many years.</li>
            <li> The product is really out of my expectation ,it&#x27;s very easy to operation.</li>
            <li> (although it has many settings so you can get the exact length you want) - and it was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> , of course, the device itself - very good quality plastic and rubber is used - tight grip and comfortable in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Come to find out that even when the light goes out when charging (suppose to be a full charge)</li>
            <li> I have shaved my head for almost 10 years and this sounded interesting when I first saw it.  </li>
            <li> (I wrote this evaluation on a separate review of the same product, but because this one has more reviews, I figure it would garner and generate more eyeballs thus alerting more consumers to my experience with this machine).</li>
            <li> No skin irritation and most of the hairs get cut in the first streak.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure that this will be it..</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out when I got it.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased a rechargeable shaver and the replacement they sent me was a corded electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice new shape</li>
            <li> I cut it with the close trimmer for about a week, maybe two, and liked it much better than the Shortcut: easier to use, and not as likely to scrape my scalp, and faster, to boot.</li>
            <li> so be prepared for a bit of clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t require any dis-assembly to clean.</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly and does not tear the hair out.</li>
            <li> Some parts of my head were clean shaved, while others had a noticeable stubble.  </li>
            <li> For me its acceptable because it gives you a clean shaven head.  </li>
            <li> manual work is very delicateï¼Œ meets the need of meã€‚Goods distribution is also very thoughtful and timely&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its very light and very well designed.</li>
            <li> Overall good cut but pour performace if you like to take your time.</li>
            <li> I use it every three days and on a full charge, it lasts me over three weeks.</li>
            <li> A few years back the battery did die and will no longer hold a charge, but it held up for about 5 years, which is impressive on it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> Took me 20 mins to go full bald with that thing.  </li>
            <li> really wanted to love them.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my boyfriend, and though the reviews were good, i&#x27;m looking for another product to get for him.</li>
            <li> Really gives you a shave as close as a bode - well, almost :)</li>
            <li> very solid good quality, and everything fits so well, not even a thing for regretting</li>
            <li> but it really does not seem that agile for someone to self shave, Then I looked into the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> He is new to shaving his head bald and this seemed like the perfect product, but after his first use he was left with brush-burn like marks on his scalp.</li>
            <li> It glides smoothly and leaves a pretty uniform and clean buzz.</li>
            <li> , it looks great when hold it in your hand, but i bought it for the other guy;</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be any more satisfied with any product I&#x27;ve bought in the last year.</li>
            <li> It works both on battery or plugged in and the battery does not self-discharge quickly.</li>
            <li> you can make the clear hair style by yourself very easy.</li>
            <li> overall product is great and of high quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased that one to be able to have a haircut, while I live and work in the USA.</li>
            <li> new attachment is much better quality, but I am still worried about its durability.  </li>
            <li> The blades actually feel cool to the touch which is nice.  </li>
            <li> As for the shaving unit, I suggest you run it under the water (but remove the head from the groomer itself first!)</li>
            <li> I like the easy height settings and that the head rotates so you can reach the back of your head at a better angle.  </li>
            <li> The head unit canbe turned 180 degrees, making it easy to get the cutter positioned to cut sides and back, top, front, all around, without craning your neck, or contorting to see in the mirror.</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine, and really gives my bald head a close shave.</li>
            <li> This was a great shaver for a little over 2 months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s adjustable and cuts very closely and comfortably.</li>
            <li> Comparatively the Phillips Norelco - provides a much cleaner bald trim, its light weight and requires no oiling or power adjustment.</li>
            <li> Amazon Customer Service was absolutely amazing with the exchange process and shipped me the same model the</li>
            <li> really wanted the Qc5550 to be a light, cordless, swiveling head replacement.  </li>
            <li> so thats worth 3 to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only shaved my head 4 times with this so far, but it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> the clipper attachment gets much closer than a &#x27;regular&#x27; clipper, while the foil shaver achieves a good &#x27;bald&#x27; result on my noggin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the Philips Headgroom so far.</li>
            <li> but I use an old toothbrush as it&#x27;s more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> You can however use it right away when you plug in the charger in.  </li>
            <li> Right away I noticed that the clipper would not give a sub-zero cut just by looking at it.  </li>
            <li> The foil attachement really helps with getting a very smooth surface :-)&lt;br /&gt;Philips absolutely is head and sholders above any product out there.</li>
            <li> But normal useage should be fine.  </li>
            <li> I was blown away by how clean, fast and efficient the buzz head was.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very easy to use dial with multiple settings instead of clip on attachments.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle, multiple shapes to choose.</li>
            <li> The battery last a fair amount of time and i only need to charge it once every two weeks and has an overall good quality.</li>
            <li> The unit itself is fine, it shaves my head as well as my face (which is a bonus) pretty decently</li>
            <li> I still have some hair on the top of my head but generally speaking</li>
            <li> Nice, little, efficient, comfortable headgroomer.</li>
            <li> I am impressed with how quickly it gets through a big boofhead&#x27;s worth of thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However they do not move back at all, and give a very precise shave.</li>
            <li> While this is a good body grooming tool, easy to handle and lasting a long time on a charge, it certainly will not shave my head.</li>
            <li> Also, in order to get any kind of decent results, it needs to be used daily.</li>
            <li> I buy this product, it only took three times it will not be able to start again.</li>
            <li> I lost is part of the money, it will lose the whole company!</li>
            <li> I have only used this 4 are 5 times so far to shave my head, but like the title says it has done a good job with no problems at all, very ez to use</li>
            <li> I will have to leave it for a few more hours before I can actually get a good use out of it.</li>
            <li> The Shaver does exactly what it claims it will do.</li>
            <li> yr warranty and can work on the cord if necessary and seems to have the cordless power to get through most hair.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I used an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> Just shave it, straight away!</li>
            <li> The first is that the razor died within two months after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> the plastic will wear out and the blades won&#x27;t be able to attach to attach back on (what happened to me).</li>
            <li> The shaver is built like a jack-in-the-box: you open it up, the parts fly out and you have to very meticulously put them back.</li>
            <li> My first unit made a screeching noise after a month of use.  </li>
            <li> A charge will last four or five days, or more, if you cut your hair every day.</li>
            <li> Listen, this will not be a blade replacement but it&#x27;ll get you pretty darn close to one.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> Because it was my first time to do it</li>
            <li> I dont like shaving all the way and this buzzer is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t beleive it till we saw, it really works for bald heads!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommended for people, who is willing to make a haircut by self.</li>
            <li> He did use the attachment to lower his hair at first, and that worked well.</li>
            <li> it has several attachments to adjust the length since I wouldn&#x27;t want to bald them :)</li>
            <li> At first, I thought it was a bit of plastic around the blade or maybe hair.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> I really like this!  </li>
            <li> In all, I was spending more time using this product than using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I tried going all over my head at every different angle, in case it did better against the grain.</li>
            <li> Just 10 mins after using it for the first time it was already defectiv.</li>
            <li> The first one we purchased just stopped working after about 6 months.</li>
            <li> At first I almost purchased the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> The balder attachment does give a good, close shave, however there are parts of my head that it shaves unevenly.  </li>
            <li> You can really shave down your head clean and safe.  </li>
            <li> You can really shave down your head clean and safe.</li>
            <li> I can really shave down your head clean and safe.</li>
            <li> The blades seem to move around a bit at first, but they really don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> still gave it two stars because I think it may still work great as a regular hair trimmer due to</li>
            <li> Stray long hairs and patches were everyone, no matter how many times I went over them.</li>
            <li> First impression is for the price, the build of it is pretty decent.</li>
            <li> I was clearly the two blades or the connection to the motor or the motor itself.&lt;br /&gt;Other than this MAJOR flaw, the unit was OK.</li>
            <li> Easy to use especially for close cuts.  </li>
            <li> It just stops suddenly and without warning, however it charges very quickly.</li>
            <li> Luckily we had an old one whose machine was functional</li>
            <li> About the size as a regular electric razor and as easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a nice little touch.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a guy that likes the shaved look and hates the hassle of taking a straight razor to your head, this Philips Norelco is for you.</li>
            <li> The cut is very close which is what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I can shave with a blade much faster and much, much closer.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;they need to make replacement parts available especially parts that are parts that do need to be replaced&lt;br /&gt;often</li>
            <li> Very close shaving and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.</li>
            <li> Alright where to begin-there&#x27;s so much about this product that needs saying.</li>
            <li> The white light indicating that it was charging still did work, but the unit would not operate and turn on when I&#x27;d hit the button.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Gives him a very close cut -</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only a few dollars more and is MUCH more substantial.  </li>
            <li> Wish it cut a bit longer, but works really well.</li>
            <li> Works very well ..... .... ... ... ... . . . . . . . .  . . . .</li>
            <li> but this one really do its job with no any problems, so fast doing my self</li>
            <li> This works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> (if they have not changed too much)  I bought one of these 8 years ago.  </li>
            <li> The design is still very close to what I have with the exception that I did not get the shave attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on that part of it.  </li>
            <li> I was done buzzing my whole head in 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted this to be a razor replacement.  </li>
            <li> It does get very close</li>
            <li> My whole head not including face took over 30 minutes to get finished.  </li>
            <li> but they thought it just like what the real headgroomer did.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who wants to maintain a Bald look.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research and this is really so</li>
            <li> So that is really a moot point.</li>
            <li> This shaver works really well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li> We were very dissapointed with the purchase as we paid over 70 bucks.</li>
            <li> never used this type of device before but found this very convenient..</li>
            <li> I just spent $19.99 on haircut maybe for many years.</li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave although not as close as blade.&lt;br /&gt;But without troubles and very</li>
            <li> /&gt;Get a straight up corded clipper, or anything else.</li>
            <li> The shave is very close.</li>
            <li> Really like it.</li>
            <li> I really can DIY my hair in the bath room now.</li>
            <li> Compare to other \\&quot;DIY hair clipper\\&quot;, this one provides stylish haircuts which however require some skills.  </li>
            <li> I opened the box and the replacement was not the same razor that I originally purchased.</li>
            <li> The blades just did not cut through easily, thus making the process very long.</li>
            <li> It would also start spitting back the hair already cut into my head, making me having to clean the blades during the shaving process.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every other day, so using a razor is pretty easy, but I left it grow for about 2 weeks and this thing breezed right threw it!</li>
            <li> Fast, easy, no irritation, no real downside.</li>
            <li> Charges quickly, cuts cleanly, and the rotation of the head allows for cleaner cuts than previous groomer&#x27;s could do.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised after shaving my head for the first time.  </li>
            <li> The first one worked for about 2 weeks then made a loud grinding noise</li>
            <li> I was sceptic about the results of the headgroomer and after my first use i was surprised.</li>
            <li> In short; it gets super close NO stubble left but the battery fully charged wont make it through a full cut.</li>
            <li> Worked for a dozen time then just died on me... too bad because us was really comfortable to use, and did a great job.</li>
            <li> The previous version of this item did a better job of containing the hair pieces, but it didn&#x27;t cut as well.  </li>
            <li> If anybody knows of a decent and efficient head shaver that will get the job done, please comment and recommend one.</li>
            <li> Positives:  -Decent  </li>
            <li> I had the older model for about 3 years now, but it had a EU plug charger.</li>
            <li> Having said that I can confirm that I have not been in a situation when it run out of charge like the older norelco.  </li>
            <li> I bought it mainly for the balder and it worked</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t allow my hair to grow more than an inch long, and when I saw this product I was sold by the very close buzz and a shaving adapter.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> expectations were high on purchasing this product, expectations  were surpassed by eons.&lt;br /&gt;Thanking</li>
            <li> But like with any other rechargeable appliance, make sure you use it until battery is completely drained, then recharge it.     </li>
            <li> lightweight and small and therefore very easy to use in the palm of your hand.</li>
            <li> On the top of my head I use a little longer setting.  </li>
            <li> I hope this has helped you understand it a little better.</li>
            <li> First we thought of sending it back but the policy said only unopened in original packing will be accepted/refunded.</li>
            <li> It does its job, but wish it could do it a little better.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Battery runs around 1h, charging very fast, Li-Ion is used.&lt;br /&gt;Travel charger unit with american plug (should depend of the market, mine was for U.S.).</li>
            <li> you cut your hair short, this device is worth looking into.</li>
            <li> product is definitely worth the extra $10-$20 over the cheaper competition, as you can tell Phillips put added quality into this model.</li>
            <li> It works best with multiple slow passes and different angles to get a even cut especially on a head as bumpy as mine.</li>
            <li> have not used any other product available in the market</li>
            <li> I contacted Amazon and a new unit was sent immediately.</li>
            <li> So I went to the Phillips website and started a live chat with one of their representatives.</li>
            <li> I wore one of them out, and just got a new one in June.</li>
            <li> when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I had a defect with balder section within 90 days but contacted manufacter, sent me a new one.</li>
            <li> It seemed new in the packing when it arrived.</li>
            <li> I really like the part that it could really cut my hair to as short as 1mm (3/64 inch).  </li>
            <li> I really like the part that it could really cut my hair to as short as 1mm (3/64 inch).</li>
            <li> I really like the part that it could really cut my hair to as short as 1mm (3/64 inch)</li>
            <li> Excellent device for multiple styles of cutting.</li>
            <li> After running about three minutes, it would screech very loudly and freeze up.</li>
            <li> Thought and care went into shaping the product, as it feels very natural and ergonomical in hand at this point.</li>
            <li> Too bad because it really looked like a good clipper!</li>
            <li> This is my second unit as the first unit that I ordered was stripped out and would not cut.  </li>
            <li> I just want something that&#x27;s going to last pretty indefinitely</li>
            <li> replacement is still running without any issues, and I use the groomer weekly, so obviously the first unit I received was not representative of the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> finally i&#x27;ve got what exactly want.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll get a pretty close to blade (but NOT same as) shave.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty close but not close enough.  </li>
            <li> I would have give this Norelco a higher rating like 4 to 5 stars if it is still working after the second time.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for cutting hair yourself!</li>
            <li> The first (bought locally, Toronto, Canada) unit&#x27;s foil became unusable with a hole after three months use.</li>
            <li> It feels great in hand, compare to some other buzzers this Philips is a bit heavier and you can easily get a grip on it without slipping or getting tired.   </li>
            <li> so we replaced the old blades with new ones and started using.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty much the \\&quot;monk\\&quot; style with regular growth on the sides and back</li>
            <li> Only criticism is when used with the guard off, where the bare metal is a bit scratchy...not as smooth as my Wahl, although the Wahl is much bigger and heavier.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for everyone (such as guys still lucky enough to have hair but want to shave it)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll last a week or more with less frequent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic electric shaver for years, which looks and works a little like a smaller, more precision version of the balding attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only way you could get a closer shave is by doing it with a straight razor.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve charged it once so far</li>
            <li> The one I purchased and told her was QC5550 (looking directly at the box), the one I found out that she recorded was QC5530/40 (a cheaper alternative without the balder attachment).</li>
            <li> Not overly loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d had my clipper for about eight weeks, so I&#x27;d used it eight times, when it developed a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d really wanted to know if there was some way I could lubricate the groomer to eliminate the problem, but after hearing what was happening the representative simply sent me replacement unit.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and to use razors on my head gives me razor bumps and burns all the time.</li>
            <li> stops working and makes loud noise</li>
            <li> It began to squeal wildly.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re after the complete Chrome Dome look, this may not give it to you.</li>
            <li> This makes the work much quicker and has the capability to trim facial hair.</li>
            <li> They said they would replace the complete unit but that was four months ago.</li>
            <li> B000VVT94G Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper]]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I remember reading that the information that came with the unit mentioned that the machine would last some time, but the second representative I talked to mentioned that it would last over a year (as though I&#x27;m supposed to be satisfied with that response) and even THAT claim didn&#x27;t hold true.</li>
            <li> -Very fragile due to cheap materials  </li>
            <li> The rotating head allows you to reach from any angle, particularly when using a handheld mirror to shave/trim back of head &amp; neck.</li>
            <li> It costs under $10 and unless you are very particular about how your hair looks it might do the trick and for much less money, If you really care how your hair looks go to a barber or hairdresser.</li>
            <li> After the machine is turned for awhile it makes a high pitch noise and turns off and then will not turn back on and yes it was fully charged.</li>
            <li> By the way, the unit comes with a hand-held mirror, about 5\\&quot; in diameter, with an elastic strap on the back to slide your hand under, to make holding easy, while holding the instrument in the other hand.</li>
            <li> I use it without a guard and it generally takes just two passes to complete a haircut.  </li>
            <li> A true waste of money.</li>
            <li> The small mirror is also very useful.</li>
            <li> It does better than most other methods of cutting with a groomer yourself.</li>
            <li> So I called Phillips again the next day and the new representative said she&#x27;d have somebody contact me anywhere from 24-48 hours because this product was a newer edition</li>
            <li> It really struggled to cut through hair in the back of my head, even when using it on a daily basis</li>
            <li> Walked out of the bathroom and my girlfriend was shocked and how fast and good it looked (she knows of the incident when I was 7)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Almost as good as a blade, but should be used at least every every 2 to 4 days,  Can be used quite a few times between charges.</li>
            <li> In the short term, the product performed well - very early on (after about 8 uses)</li>
            <li> Even though this product wasn&#x27;t thorough in making my head as smooth and bald as my face razors did, I felt for the times that I had used it, that it decent enough-I just had to go over areas of my head 10-15 times at the very least</li>
            <li> So it was decent overall, and not only that</li>
            <li> I also talked to another representative who said this unit lasts quite a long time, and came up with an astonishingly high number-somewhere between 5-6 years.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first because I have a sensitive head.</li>
            <li> For $50, I expected something that would last me 2-3 years, at the very least, and give me a satisfying and consistent head shave.</li>
            <li> It arrived in about a week, I put the old groomer in the box, attached the prepaid Fed Ex label, and dropped it off at my local Fed Ex store front.</li>
            <li> Maybe I expected too much.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it I got a loud squeaky noise followed by it shutting off.</li>
            <li> We thought we would try a second time and so far it is still working.</li>
            <li> You have to love it when a business stands behind their product</li>
            <li> The blades are kind of flimsy, unfortunately.  </li>
            <li> The directional change takes a little getting used to if you have been using regular clippers but its well worth it.</li>
            <li> This product caused MAJOR razor bumps over my ENTIRE head.</li>
            <li> will be getting a new one of these in the near future i&#x27;m sue, but will not even consider any other.  </li>
            <li> Only downside, if you will, is I would never use it without a spacer since the blades are very pointy and sharp.</li>
            <li> Also, frequently you have to go over the same spot several times with this razor even when you just brushed hair off of it.</li>
            <li> Not completely smooth bald, but pretty close.  </li>
            <li> It becomes worth the small effort it takes to keep it looking that</li>
            <li> Highly recommend over the other shavers online.</li>
            <li> good razor and clippers but almost impossible to get replacement screens and cutters for&lt;br /&gt;the shaver</li>
            <li> Aside from all of these chaotic events, the razor itself was loose; it would wiggle with my finger instead of remaining fixed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I just got a dud with a junk battery, but if the device can&#x27;t operate on a straight plug-in, when the battery holds even less of a charge as it ages (if it&#x27;s even possible to have more of a lousy battery) it will become entirely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since my monthly $20 hair cut and the sides of my head above my ears was growing out a little fast</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old guy who looked at several other options for self Shave devices and finally before finally settling on the Philips Norelco QC5550.</li>
            <li> pivoting blade is actually very useful for behind the ears/back of the head and the neck.</li>
            <li> and it took about half the time with these than my normal clippers.</li>
            <li> I use the shortest setting with the small attachment to give me a very close head shave.  </li>
            <li> header/balder - three separate blades, two under the foils, one between the foils, just as in usual modern shaver.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> The second one worked as stated but it just took to long to shave a head.  </li>
            <li> Takes hair down to near razor length (or no length)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was scared running it up the side of my head knowing the only other experience cutting my own hair was when I was 7 with a pair of scissors</li>
            <li> Use a little force but not too hard, you want the head to make full contact with your scalp instead of just simply gliding.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stable work so far (a few weeks of daily use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does take longer than wet shaving my head though, which I switched to not long after getting this shaver</li>
            <li> However, since I trim my own hair, the Wahl is heavy and awkward to use, especially in the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only option was to let the hair grow back out and try other options.</li>
            <li> main issue is that the replacement blades are hard to find, a 3rd party seller here on Amazon sells it as well as a couple of sellers on e bay</li>
            <li> The first shaver ended up being a dud, as the battery failed to hold a charge and the blades would often seize with a loud screeching noise.</li>
            <li> well it did as long as hurry with it.</li>
            <li> This thing is a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I thought maybe the battery was low, so I spent over an hour recharging it.</li>
            <li> The Norelco holds a charge for long period.</li>
            <li> So now several months after purchasing the product I can say that it has been money well spent.  </li>
            <li> It adjusts to a wide range of (short) hair lengths</li>
            <li> This is to say, there is not much available that I have seen so far.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of flexibility and a wide range hair length adjustment using the dial on the handle or using a different comb attachment on the end.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit if you want super short or shaved style.</li>
            <li> Finally, after buying three other brands (Remington and two different models of Wahl)that were a complete waste of money this Norelco can do what I am looking for and that is a simple military buzz cut (or maybe slightly longer).</li>
            <li> and I have been cutting my own hair for a few yrs</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times to cut medium length hair short- not balded.</li>
            <li> I shave my head completely without any attachment, leaving a small amount of hair.  </li>
            <li> -Razor was loose  </li>
            <li> I was mid haircut (it was not pretty!)</li>
            <li> but unfortunately also the second unit wasn&#x27;t working anymore after the first trim.</li>
            <li> I usually find several missed spots even after going over several times, which does lead to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> Unlike some other buzzers I&#x27;ve used this one will not yank your hair as hair gets too long or dense.</li>
            <li> but you have to go very slow and have to go over and over the same section until its completely shaven.  </li>
            <li> The accessory is not precise and you can&#x27;t have the same hair length.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need to wet my scalp or apply shaving cream, etc.</li>
            <li> There are just a few DIY headgroomers out there that could go as short as that.  </li>
            <li> After taking it apart for cleaning purposes, the parts will not fit back together.</li>
            <li> What the heck, it would grow back out in a few days if I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The charging transformer is slim and narrow, using only one outlet and not covering adjacent</li>
            <li> There are just a few DIY headgroomers out there that could go as short as that.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with this if you don&#x27;t.want to cut close.</li>
            <li> have tried out a few others that are similar but none are multi use like this one.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this product for African american men or men with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for years, and this is simply better than I was using in the past.  </li>
            <li> I just every or every other day and one charge hold for 2-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be close, but it shaved as close as a blade!  </li>
            <li> Cuts sharp.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely please with this purchase.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;ve tried to shave my head in the past with a razor my head would look blotchy and red.</li>
            <li> I kept the large blade attachment on then twisted the setting dial for maximum length and ran it up the sides of my head.</li>
            <li> And despite much searching online, I was unable to find a place to purchase a replacement</li>
            <li> (I had to run over the same area 10-15 times at least)  </li>
            <li> The springs are twisted and the 2 shaving pieces will not sit straight.</li>
            <li> so I suppose I got my money&#x27;s worth, but still it&#x27;s disappointing.  </li>
            <li> The manual says to replace the foil head at least once a year (which is not even close to being often enough.)</li>
            <li> A few days later, I tried to cut my hair a small piece of plastic fell out along with my hair.  </li>
            <li> That leaves scar tissue, and an uneven surface, but not really noticable at a glance.</li>
            <li> works but is really low power and slow.  </li>
            <li> So I cut it all the way down, and it was a piece of cake.</li>
            <li> After that, it went down hill.  </li>
            <li> Negatives:  -Lasted less than two months  </li>
            <li> Have this thing for almost half a year now and can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Unlike a jack-in-the-box, this shaver works less and less well after each occurrence .</li>
            <li> about 4 years I&#x27;ve been using typical Wahl style clippers.</li>
            <li> What truly sets it apart from typical clippers is how you can rotate the cutter depending on which area of your head you are shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my head but after a half dozen uses the foil head broke and cut into my scalp.</li>
            <li> then you&#x27;ve gotta wait for it to re-charge while you have Quasimodo-esque hair for a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Less cumbersome than a set of clippers</li>
            <li> It finished cutting my hair the first time.</li>
            <li> Not a good look for anyone, but when I use this product it not only gets skin close</li>
            <li> All it does now when turned on is scream for a few seconds and shut down.</li>
            <li> , I had thought about taking my hair all the way down a time or two, but never wanted to get involved with one of those razor blades some guys use, because my scalp is a little uneven, having had a number of precancerous lesions removed over the years.</li>
            <li> But It&#x27;s a little slower than shaving with a blade razor.</li>
            <li> so I thought I&#x27;d go with something a little easier on my head.</li>
            <li> My wife likes a little bit of hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, push the shaving adapter (head) against your head with a little force because without that contact it won&#x27;t \\&quot;shave\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It will take a little bit longer than buzzing but spend some time</li>
            <li> but little on the crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> All the previous reviews about it working a few times, making a screeching noise and then going dead are all correct.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve left it charging for a few hours only to get less than a minute of hair cutting power out of</li>
            <li> Item makes a horrible squeaking sound and shuts off, then have to stop shaving and turn shaver back on then repeat then repeat then give up.</li>
            <li> as with any electric shaver screens and cutters do wear and it is recommended to replace screens&lt;br /&gt;and cutters every few months</li>
            <li> let alone a few years</li>
            <li> bought it a few months ago and haven&#x27;t had any troubles.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I could restart it, but after a few seconds the process would repeat.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago, this instrument came up on my Amazon account page, so I clicked on it, just to have a look.</li>
            <li> It is somewhat uncomfortable on my scalp when I use it to shave my head completely bald.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;balder&amp;#34; just seems to harsh.</li>
            <li> However, after a few months of use</li>
            <li> Resigned to not letting my $50 go to waste, I tried out the shaving attachment.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco 5550 stopped cutting and making a high pitch noise.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to go over a few spots again with my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> I initially bought this unit after I tried face razors and the head blade, but those unfortunately just cut my scalp up</li>
            <li> The last time I used it was around two weeks ago, and I didn&#x27;t receive any sign or indication that something was wrong.</li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s not many sources to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> and brush the gaps on the inside unit as the small parts of the hair does stuck in between the gaps.</li>
            <li> Something which usually takes me 10-15min with a razor.  </li>
            <li> small brush for maintenance needs.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> Storage case is chintzy  and  too small to hold shaver, charger and and included attachments.</li>
            <li> It lasted a few days and it broke!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does leave several ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li> The flexible plastic may ease irritation, but it is extremely flimsy at the stress points - poor design.</li>
            <li> Unlike other Lithium ion devices, I&#x27;ve never had this unit quit on me; I&#x27;m always warned well before the battery is completely exhausted.</li>
            <li> I had been cutting my hair as close as the Remington Shortcut could get it, which is about 1/16th\\&quot;, and the Headgroomer made that easier, and got it closer, just a bare stubble.</li>
            <li> also had a hard time shaving the hair around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Hardly holds a charge-</li>
            <li> Using it proved a little painful and did not leave my hair at the same length.</li>
            <li> Avoid this shoddy garbage at all costs.</li>
            <li> In fact, the battery seems to last a bit longer than the 60 minute cutting time it states in the manual.</li>
            <li> Apparently it is a common problem.  </li>
            <li> The battery failure did not hurt anything, I just use it with the cord and it still performs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I then checked my email and found out that the Phillips representative took down the wrong model number.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I purchased this imagining any multitude of problems.</li>
            <li> But it makes a lot of annoying and loud noise as if the machine needs some oil.</li>
            <li> Perhaps my gray hair is too tough for it.</li>
            <li> I do have very thick hair, and it takes a while to get it to a &#x27;five-o&#x27;clock&#x27; shadow, but I can&#x27;t get a cleaner shave than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just a little unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> Frustrating as hell.</li>
            <li> Enough said, I hate having to oil the blades and needing to remember to keep a supply of oil on hand.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since the unit is unusable without the attachment, I must give this a poor rating.</li>
            <li> worse, it doesn&#x27;t operate on power even when plugged in.</li>
            <li> No more awkward holding position or untouched spots on the behind as you can hold it</li>
            <li> Not worth paying 75 bucks for just the blades :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely worthless unless you&#x27;re used to shaving with a butter knife in which case you will find this \\&quot;balder\\&quot; a slight improvement.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to use to trim your head.</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive the quality product I was expecting to get.  </li>
            <li> I just thought I&#x27;d try it because I hate to waste money on a barber</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> It works for a while, screeches, then shuts off randomly.  </li>
            <li> I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> The traditional clippers have cords and it&#x27;s very annoying to have the cord swinging around as you move the clippers into position on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not meet expectations.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating.  </li>
            <li> Very poor quality</li>
            <li> The head on the razor is already farad and is cutting my skin...</li>
            <li> I was unsatisfied with that response because it&#x27;s inconvenient for me; I&#x27;d have to wear a hoodie for over seven days.</li>
            <li> The unit also has a hair length \\&quot;zoom\\&quot; adjustment, for fine-tuning cutting height.</li>
            <li> The head twists so you don&#x27;t have to twist your wrist into awkward positions.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to cut my hair myself and I use the cutting element alone w/out any combs.</li>
            <li> This was disappointing too.  </li>
            <li> This claim is almost impossible for me to fathom with an item like this that has this type of inferior quality parts.</li>
            <li> Now, for the bad news.  </li>
            <li> bad something with the motor or connectors were flawed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it was so bad my mom had to shave me bald.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t dismantle the blades from the plastic base too often or else</li>
            <li> I hate using a blade, and was hesitant about using an electric razor on my head.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> This item is the worst headgroomer I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> the worst trimmer I ever purchased, don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great unit that works flawlessly.  I use it without a guard and it generally takes just two passes to complete a haircut.  This is my second unit as the first unit that I ordered was stripped out and would not cut.  I contacted Amazon and a new unit was sent immediately.</li>
            <li> I buy this product, it only took three times it will not be able to start again. Contact philips in China, I provide them with amazon&#x27;s electronic invoices, they refused to accept, must I provide print invoice and I can&#x27;t have. And told me that the product is gray. Ask, a coinsurance global products are gray? A company with all sorts of excuses to refuse to repair. I lost is part of the money, it will lose the whole company! Refuse to buy any products of philips again!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I do like the shaver.But It&#x27;s a little slower than shaving with a blade razor.</li>
            <li> In the short term, the product performed well - very early on (after about 8 uses) one of the plastic blades on the guide snapped - and now is unusable.  The flexible plastic may ease irritation, but it is extremely flimsy at the stress points - poor design.</li>
            <li> Compare to other \\&quot;DIY hair clipper\\&quot;, this one provides stylish haircuts which however require some skills.  The Prcision comb require care when use it, as it looks rather fragile.  But normal useage should be fine.  For shaving, it is not very necessary, I assume one that shaves beard would do the same job. (I have never tried, but it does looks more safer and smoother)</li>
            <li> I have only used this 4 are 5 times so far to shave my head, but like the title says it has done a good job with no problems at all, very ez to use</li>
            <li> This item is the worst headgroomer I&#x27;ve ever seen. The accessory is not precise and you can&#x27;t have the same hair length. I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> All right, I recommend.</li>
            <li> Worked for a dozen time then just died on me... too bad because us was really comfortable to use, and did a great job.</li>
            <li> Man, this is a great product.  I&#x27;ve been looking for an electric razor for my head, and after reading some of the reviews I decided to take a chance on it.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The only way you could get a closer shave is by doing it with a straight razor.  I&#x27;ve charged it once so far and I&#x27;ve used it 4 times, still going strong.  If you&#x27;re a guy that likes the shaved look and hates the hassle of taking a straight razor to your head, this Philips Norelco is for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in hopes to avoid using a razor to shave my head. As I&#x27;m in Afghanistan it would make for an easy shve well it did as long as hurry with it. The cut is very close which is what I was looking for but the device will get stock after about 10 minutes of use and make some wear noise. Come to find out that even when the light goes out when charging (suppose to be a full charge) I will have to leave it for a few more hours before I can actually get a good use out of it. Overall good cut but pour performace if you like to take your time.</li>
            <li> When I decided to go bald because of a hairless spot in the middle of my head, I dreaded it, because I know some fellows&lt;br /&gt;who shave their heads and have cut , nick, and bruises all over their heads.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t want to be like that.  However, when I read about (Philips Norelco&#x27;s QC5550 DO-It-Yourself Headgroomer, I decided to take a chance, and I&#x27;m glad I did.  No cut, nicks, bruises, no nothing.  Just a smooth shaven head that looks and feels great.  The Shaver does exactly what it claims it will do. Wives of husbands ask me what do I use, and I tell them, the best shaver on the market, The Philips Norelco QC5550 Do-It-Yourself Headgroomer.</li>
            <li> I got these clippers as a gift and I have been cutting my own hair for a few yrs and it took about half the time with these than my normal clippers. The directional change takes a little getting used to if you have been using regular clippers but its well worth it.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use to trim your head. Doesn&#x27;t help that the price dropped below $50 a month after I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Finally, after buying three other brands (Remington and two different models of Wahl)that were a complete waste of money this Norelco can do what I am looking for and that is a simple military buzz cut (or maybe slightly longer). I don&#x27;t want to have a shaved look so I can&#x27;t review that feature but from battery life and charge(1 hr), sensible design, rinseable, two yr warranty and can work on the cord if necessary and seems to have the cordless power to get through most hair. It works best with multiple slow passes and different angles to get a even cut especially on a head as bumpy as mine. For the price it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve found by far.</li>
            <li> I use this to trim my hair to a uniform (very short) length - haven&#x27;t tried to actually shave with it.  But for what I use it for it works great, powerful, fast, comfortable.</li>
            <li> I have shaved my head for almost 10 years and this sounded interesting when I first saw it.  So, I ordered it with the $10 off coupon (total &#x3D; $39).  Now, for the bad news.  It&#x27;s completely worthless unless you&#x27;re used to shaving with a butter knife in which case you will find this \\&quot;balder\\&quot; a slight improvement.  I can shave with a blade much faster and much, much closer.    This thing is a complete waste of money.  Buy good blades for shaving your head bald and pass on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> the worst trimmer I ever purchased, don&#x27;t recommend it at all. I purchased it two times to make sure I haven&#x27;t received by mistake a defective unit...but unfortunately also the second unit wasn&#x27;t working anymore after the first trim.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the most satisfying product of its kind: sleek and comfortable design, high performance in operation, fully accessorized, compact and easy to use. Safe and efficient for all your grooming needs. Whether for home use or on the road, this machine is durable, 120/110V charger, easily adjusted to be personalized and performs incredibly well. Comes with 2 1/2 years warranty, ships promptly and well packed. Don&#x27;t look elsewhere. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> good razor and clippers but almost impossible to get replacement screens and cutters for&lt;br /&gt;the shaver head.&lt;br /&gt;they need to make replacement parts available especially parts that are parts that do need to be replaced&lt;br /&gt;often as with any electric shaver screens and cutters do wear and it is recommended to replace screens&lt;br /&gt;and cutters every few months</li>
            <li> Have used normal razor blades for many, many years. Then switched to Headblade sports, the one with the wheels, a good product. But the hassle of applying gel, shaving cream, water, etc., just annoys me! This is the first time I used an electric shaver. I&#x27;m so amazed at how close the shave can get. Maybe not as close as razor blades but close enough. Works beautifully for me! Now I don&#x27;t need to wet my scalp or apply shaving cream, etc. before shaving. Just shave it, straight away!</li>
            <li> The head on the razor is already farad and is cutting my skin... Don&#x27;t know if it is warranted or not it is getting louder and don&#x27;t know what to do, I&#x27;ve only had it since  Feb./2013 should last longer. I did not keep box and can&#x27;t find paper work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joseph Warden&lt;br /&gt;jabrooks1976@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment I was using broke after a year of use, mid-haircut.  And despite much searching online, I was unable to find a place to purchase a replacement attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; hair clipper I replaced this with gets the job done faster, and as it uses the same guiding attachments they use in salons, there&#x27;s no need to convert what a &amp;#34;two on the sides&amp;#34; is to the measurement system they use for these.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong with this unit if you want super short or shaved style. Just dial in the length that you want and buzz away. The shaving attachment works great too. A lot better than some of the electric shavers that I used to have. Very close shaving and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all. You can actually use it on your beard. Granted, I have relatively light growth on my chin.  Battery life is good. I use it every three days and on a full charge, it lasts me over three weeks. But like with any other rechargeable appliance, make sure you use it until battery is completely drained, then recharge it.     Product was delivered a day in advance of promised delivery date. No issues here.</li>
            <li> (I wrote this evaluation on a separate review of the same product, but because this one has more reviews, I figure it would garner and generate more eyeballs thus alerting more consumers to my experience with this machine). Alright where to begin-there&#x27;s so much about this product that needs saying. The first is that the razor died within two months after I purchased it. I initially bought this unit after I tried face razors and the head blade, but those unfortunately just cut my scalp up so I thought I&#x27;d go with something a little easier on my head. Even though this product wasn&#x27;t thorough in making my head as smooth and bald as my face razors did, I felt for the times that I had used it, that it decent enough-I just had to go over areas of my head 10-15 times at the very least which wasn&#x27;t all that efficient. So it was decent overall, and not only that but this product also didn&#x27;t cut me like my face razors did-and this was the reason why I acknowledged the advantages of this product and gave it two stars instead of one. So, I pulled it out to shave my head again and it died on me. I thought maybe the battery was low, so I spent over an hour recharging it. The white light indicating that it was charging still did work, but the unit would not operate and turn on when I&#x27;d hit the button. The last time I used it was around two weeks ago, and I didn&#x27;t receive any sign or indication that something was wrong. I cleaned the machine out with water the same way I&#x27;d done it several times before. Anyway, I called Phillips and they said they&#x27;d send a unit to me in seven business days. I was unsatisfied with that response because it&#x27;s inconvenient for me; I&#x27;d have to wear a hoodie for over seven days. I then checked my email and found out that the Phillips representative took down the wrong model number. The one I purchased and told her was QC5550 (looking directly at the box), the one I found out that she recorded was QC5530/40 (a cheaper alternative without the balder attachment). So I called Phillips again the next day and the new representative said she&#x27;d have somebody contact me anywhere from 24-48 hours because this product was a newer edition and she couldn&#x27;t pull any information on it and thus couldn&#x27;t aid me further. Frustrating as hell. Aside from all of these chaotic events, the razor itself was loose; it would wiggle with my finger instead of remaining fixed. The the unit itself isn&#x27;t that sturdy or durable, it&#x27;s made from cheap materials. I&#x27;m not sure if I remember reading that the information that came with the unit mentioned that the machine would last some time, but the second representative I talked to mentioned that it would last over a year (as though I&#x27;m supposed to be satisfied with that response) and even THAT claim didn&#x27;t hold true. I also talked to another representative who said this unit lasts quite a long time, and came up with an astonishingly high number-somewhere between 5-6 years. This claim is almost impossible for me to fathom with an item like this that has this type of inferior quality parts. I don&#x27;t buy the affirmation that this unit lasts 5-6 years, I don&#x27;t even buy the claim that it lasts over or even around 5-6 months after using it. For $50, I expected something that would last me 2-3 years, at the very least, and give me a satisfying and consistent head shave. If anybody knows of a decent and efficient head shaver that will get the job done, please comment and recommend one. I&#x27;d looked for hours before purchasing this and unfortunately I didn&#x27;t receive the quality product I was expecting to get.  Recap:  Positives:  -Decent  -For the several times I&#x27;ve used this, it didn&#x27;t tear my scalp and make me bleed  Negatives:  -Lasted less than two months  -Not efficient (I had to run over the same area 10-15 times at least)  -Very fragile due to cheap materials  -Razor was loose  -You have to replace the aluminum part every year-inconvenient  -I doubt it lasts over a year, let alone a few years</li>
            <li> Bought this item in Nov.I have used it twice.It finished cutting my hair the first time.Got about 1/4 th of the job done the second time and quit.All it does now when turned on is scream for a few seconds and shut down.A true waste of money.</li>
            <li> The unit itself is fine, it shaves my head as well as my face (which is a bonus) pretty decently so thats worth 3 to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main issue is that the replacement blades are hard to find, a 3rd party seller here on Amazon sells it as well as a couple of sellers on e bay so there&#x27;s not many sources to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t dismantle the blades from the plastic base too often or else the plastic will wear out and the blades won&#x27;t be able to attach to attach back on (what happened to me).</li>
            <li> Among the Do-it-yourself (DIY) headgroomers I had, I would say that the Philips Norelco Qc5550/40 is so far, the best.  I really like the part that it could really cut my hair to as short as 1mm (3/64 inch).  There are just a few DIY headgroomers out there that could go as short as that.  The motor sounds fairly quiet and cuts the hair with great precision.  Its shaving head accessory also proves to be of great addition to the package.  You can really shave down your head clean and safe.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use the shortest setting with the small attachment to give me a very close head shave.  Not completely smooth bald, but pretty close.  My wife likes a little bit of hair.  On the top of my head I use a little longer setting.  I like the easy height settings and that the head rotates so you can reach the back of your head at a better angle.  Cuts good and quick, no pulling on my hair.</li>
            <li> Have this thing for almost half a year now and can&#x27;t complain. I just every or every other day and one charge hold for 2-4 weeks. I use the shaver-like function for my head to get the almost bald look and it works really good. No skin irritation and most of the hairs get cut in the first streak. For my beard I use the trimmer with the smallest spacer. Still cuts easily through and I never had my hair get caught and pulled on by the trimmer. Only downside, if you will, is I would never use it without a spacer since the blades are very pointy and sharp. So if you&#x27;re looking for hair shorter than trimmer-with-spacer but longer than the \\&quot;shaver\\&quot; you may want to look for another product. I never used the rotating head feature so I can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
            <li> Easy to use especially for close cuts.  I would recommend this product to anyone who likes a close but not quite a bald look.</li>
            <li> Simply love it! Easy and comfortable to use excellent for those who enjoy a very short crop!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has been sporting a Telly Savalas bald-look for a while now.  The last hair trimmer we purchased only lasted a year and I had to cut the hair for him.  This one he tried doing by himself and it worked great.  Gives him a very close cut - almost balding which is what he wanted (although it has many settings so you can get the exact length you want) - and it was quick and easy.  He really did a good job with it the very first time.  Best of all he loves doing it and the savings will pay for it in just a couple of months. This one is a winner.</li>
            <li> Works great as a headshaver, but the foils break too easy and cost 1/2 as much as the whole razor.</li>
            <li> This product caused MAJOR razor bumps over my ENTIRE head. I would not recommend it for African Americans or anyone else who might be at risk of getting razor bumps.</li>
            <li> Lovely. bought it a few months ago and haven&#x27;t had any troubles.</li>
            <li> Junk. Don&#x27;t waste your money. All the previous reviews about it working a few times, making a screeching noise and then going dead are all correct.</li>
            <li> it was not that good. I bought three of it and one was not working well. I am 100% satisfied with it, but it is ok</li>
            <li> Does not give me the closeness of the shave as described by the advertisement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s helpful and good to use.  you can make the clear hair style by yourself very easy. very good product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! I can shave easy and fast and safe! I Definitely recommend it! This is my first perfect shaving Stuff!</li>
            <li> This was a great shaver for a little over 2 months. After taking it apart for cleaning purposes, the parts will not fit back together. The springs are twisted and the 2 shaving pieces will not sit straight. The shaver is built like a jack-in-the-box: you open it up, the parts fly out and you have to very meticulously put them back. Unlike a jack-in-the-box, this shaver works less and less well after each occurrence . Is $60 good for 60 days? Hell no. Avoid this shoddy garbage at all costs.</li>
            <li> The Phillips Norelco cuts my hair short, also the Philips Norelco menâ€™s hair clipperâ€™s motor runs quietly. The shaving head accessory can shave your head cleanly and safely. Does not irritate the skin. Itâ€™s cordless and battery life is good. I would definitely recommended this Philips Norelco headgroomer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donald,&lt;br /&gt;Brooklyn, NY</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised after shaving my head for the first time.  I expected it to be close, but it shaved as close as a blade!  If you are looked for smooth bald head, this is the product for you!</li>
            <li> It does everything I need it to do. Smooth. Not overly loud. Cuts sharp. But doesn&#x27;t hurt. Nice new shape</li>
            <li> Best shaver ever wprth every penny leaves no stubble</li>
            <li> It did a great job but then it broke apart.  It did work for a couple of years so I suppose I got my money&#x27;s worth, but still it&#x27;s disappointing.  I didn&#x27;t drop it.  It just broke apart in my hand while I was twisting the cutter.  Light weight morphed into cheap plastic.  And even before that the comb stopped staying in place.  Bottom line:  I ordered the Oster Fast-Cut.  It&#x27;s only a few dollars more and is MUCH more substantial.  I just want something that&#x27;s going to last pretty indefinitely and I&#x27;m pretty sure that this will be it..</li>
            <li> this cutter trimmer does not perform as I had hoped it would. I just thought I&#x27;d try it because I hate to waste money on a barber...don&#x27;t you?</li>
            <li> Awesome product - shaves down to bald - best  I have used.</li>
            <li> Works great, and love that it is cordless. Cuts at 5/8ths of an inch. Wish it cut a bit longer, but works really well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to save time and money. Rather than visiting the barbershop every three weeks and paying $20 for a \\&quot;number one all over\\&quot; buzz cut, I thought I could clip myself once a week in just a couple of minutes before showering. It has worked out splendidly, surpassing my expectations and easily paying for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the purpose of my review isn&#x27;t to tout the groomer - superb as it is - but rather to mention Phillips customer service. I&#x27;d had my clipper for about eight weeks, so I&#x27;d used it eight times, when it developed a problem. After running about three minutes, it would screech very loudly and freeze up. I could restart it, but after a few seconds the process would repeat. So I went to the Phillips website and started a live chat with one of their representatives. I&#x27;d really wanted to know if there was some way I could lubricate the groomer to eliminate the problem, but after hearing what was happening the representative simply sent me replacement unit. It arrived in about a week, I put the old groomer in the box, attached the prepaid Fed Ex label, and dropped it off at my local Fed Ex store front. It was incredibly hassle free, and the replacement has been running great for several months now. You have to love it when a business stands behind their product so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE JULY 2013&lt;br /&gt;----------------&lt;br /&gt;The replacement is still running without any issues, and I use the groomer weekly, so obviously the first unit I received was not representative of the quality of this product. A pleasant surprise that I&#x27;ve grown very fond of is the charging LED where the power cord plugs in. Most of the rechargeable devices I own have an LED that indicates once the unit is fully charged, but on this groomer the LED starts flashing when it&#x27;s time to recharge. Unlike other Lithium ion devices, I&#x27;ve never had this unit quit on me; I&#x27;m always warned well before the battery is completely exhausted. That&#x27;s a nice little touch.</li>
            <li> Works very well ..... .... ... ... ... . . . . . . . .  . . . .</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve had so many kinds of hair clippers and always had problems with something but this one really do its job with no any problems, so fast doing my self no help need. just wonderful. finally i&#x27;ve got what exactly want.</li>
            <li> I was on the fence about if I needed this or not.  I still have a Wahl corded trimmer that I was using with no guard but it was on the way out.  Had to adjust the power screw to get the heads started and then it would chatter once it got going.  This does not do that and the swiveling head which I thought wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal is actually pretty awesome.  I don&#x27;t use the &#x27;balder&#x27; attachment so I cannot speak to how well that works but for just getting it back to a hint of stubble this works great.  Gets most of it done in one pass so it has been a time saver as well.</li>
            <li> This works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I bought this headgroomer and I have had it for almost 2 years now. I must say it was the best purchase I could have made. I have really sensitive skin and to use razors on my head gives me razor bumps and burns all the time. I use this product to shave my head every 2-3 days and it works like a charm. Just charge it, clean it, and replace the shaving head every 3-5 months depending on your usage and you should be fine. If your looking for something that works and is dependable. and your thinking about this&amp;#62;? just get it. You wont regret it.</li>
            <li> By far the best unit on the market.  (if they have not changed too much)  I bought one of these 8 years ago.  The design is still very close to what I have with the exception that I did not get the shave attachment, so I can&#x27;t comment on that part of it.  A few years back the battery did die and will no longer hold a charge, but it held up for about 5 years, which is impressive on it&#x27;s own.  The battery failure did not hurt anything, I just use it with the cord and it still performs perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;I will be getting a new one of these in the near future i&#x27;m sue, but will not even consider any other.  Best on the market.  You can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> My first unit made a screeching noise after a month of use.  Others have mentioned the same thing.  It works for a while, screeches, then shuts off randomly.  Philips customer support was good and sent me a replacement unit.  Now the replacement is making the same noise.  Very frustrating.  I wish I had never bought this thing.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times to cut medium length hair short- not balded. I am impressed with how quickly it gets through a big boofhead&#x27;s worth of thick hair. Obviously I can&#x27;t speak to durability yet.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my Philips Norelco Headgroomer.  The hair length adjustment works perfect in selecting how close you want to trim your hair to your scalp.  It is a very easy do-it-yourself unit.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After my barber retired, I started used a Remington Shortcut, and have for two or three years. I wore one of them out, and just got a new one in June. A few weeks ago, this instrument came up on my Amazon account page, so I clicked on it, just to have a look. I liked what I saw, and after reading up on it, ordered one. I had been cutting my hair as close as the Remington Shortcut could get it, which is about 1/16th\\&quot;, and the Headgroomer made that easier, and got it closer, just a bare stubble. I cut it with the close trimmer for about a week, maybe two, and liked it much better than the Shortcut: easier to use, and not as likely to scrape my scalp, and faster, to boot. Then, I started looking at the \\&quot;balding\\&quot; attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I had thought about taking my hair all the way down a time or two, but never wanted to get involved with one of those razor blades some guys use, because my scalp is a little uneven, having had a number of precancerous lesions removed over the years. That leaves scar tissue, and an uneven surface, but not really noticable at a glance. But the balding device looked like an electric shaver head, only bigger, with somewhat larger holes in the foil. I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic electric shaver for years, which looks and works a little like a smaller, more precision version of the balding attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In amy event, I decided one day to give it a go. What the heck, it would grow back out in a few days if I didn&#x27;t like it. So I cut it all the way down, and it was a piece of cake. No scrapes, no razor burn, no irritation of any kind, and it was quick - my kind of deal. Fast, easy, no irritation, no real downside. And the thing is, it&#x27;s addictive. Once you do it, if you like the look and feel, and I do, you get hooked up on it. You can&#x27;t get it too close now. It becomes worth the small effort it takes to keep it looking that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Headgroomer is a terrific instrument, however short you like to cut your hair. The head unit canbe turned 180 degrees, making it easy to get the cutter positioned to cut sides and back, top, front, all around, without craning your neck, or contorting to see in the mirror. By the way, the unit comes with a hand-held mirror, about 5\\&quot; in diameter, with an elastic strap on the back to slide your hand under, to make holding easy, while holding the instrument in the other hand. The unit also has a hair length \\&quot;zoom\\&quot; adjustment, for fine-tuning cutting height. The instrument comes with three attachments, one for precision, shorter cuts, one for longer cuts, plus the \\&quot;balding\\&quot; attachment. It has high-tech lithium ion batteries, and charges in an hour. A charge will last four or five days, or more, if you cut your hair every day. It&#x27;ll last a week or more with less frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The insturment has a battery charge indicator in the plug-in surround. The surround flashes orange when the battery is low, and turns blue when plugged in to the charging unit. When fully charged, the surround light goes out. The charging transformer is slim and narrow, using only one outlet and not covering adjacent ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you cut your hair short, this device is worth looking into. I&#x27;m sold on it. I hope this has helped you understand it a little better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only shaved my head 4 times with this so far, but it does a great job.  The blades actually feel cool to the touch which is nice.  It glides over my head and I&#x27;ve gotten no cuts or bumps.  The included mirror is great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attached &amp;#34;balder blade&amp;#34; works but is really low power and slow.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for that feature.  Took me 20 mins to go full bald with that thing.  I just use the regular blade with no guards on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last thing to note is that your hair will go flying with this thing so be prepared for a bit of clean up afterwards.  The previous version of this item did a better job of containing the hair pieces, but it didn&#x27;t cut as well.  The next version could be perfect.</li>
            <li> Nice, little, efficient, comfortable headgroomer. I like it.</li>
            <li> easy break.....though</li>
            <li> no power. stops working and makes loud noise</li>
            <li> This Norelco QC5550/40 headgroomer is fantastic. I was using a Remington SCC100R. It served its purpose, enough said. The Norelco holds a charge for long period. It can be used while plugged in, if needed. Doesn&#x27;t require any dis-assembly to clean. The rotating head allows you to reach from any angle, particularly when using a handheld mirror to shave/trim back of head &amp; neck. The foil razor attachment (aka balder attachment) is great for the neck just below hairline. QC5550/40 came with a travel bag &amp; mirror. Overall its a great product. I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Personally I don&#x27;t allow my hair to grow more than an inch long, and when I saw this product I was sold by the very close buzz and a shaving adapter.  First impression is for the price, the build of it is pretty decent. It feels great in hand, compare to some other buzzers this Philips is a bit heavier and you can easily get a grip on it without slipping or getting tired.   I did not try the standard or precision guide as I always buzz/shave my head to as blad as I can. I was blown away by how clean, fast and efficient the buzz head was. Unlike some other buzzers I&#x27;ve used this one will not yank your hair as hair gets too long or dense. It glides smoothly and leaves a pretty uniform and clean buzz. Also the rotating head is a BIG plus! No more awkward holding position or untouched spots on the behind as you can hold it however you prefer. I was done buzzing my whole head in 5 minutes.  Then comes the shaving part. Listen, this will not be a blade replacement but it&#x27;ll get you pretty darn close to one. Remember, it works great with hair shorter than a millimeter. I suggest you buzz your head without any guides, as close to scalp as you can then use the shaving unit. Also, push the shaving adapter (head) against your head with a little force because without that contact it won&#x27;t \\&quot;shave\\&quot;. Use a little force but not too hard, you want the head to make full contact with your scalp instead of just simply gliding. It will take a little bit longer than buzzing but spend some time and you&#x27;ll get a pretty close to blade (but NOT same as) shave.  Changing and cleaning the head is a breeze. For the buzzer simply pop the unit off and brush hair off with included brush. As for the shaving unit, I suggest you run it under the water (but remove the head from the groomer itself first!) and brush the gaps on the inside unit as the small parts of the hair does stuck in between the gaps. Use the brushing unit and warm water, it&#x27;s easy to clean.  All the bells and whistles that came with the package does make buzzing/shaving easy.  Bottom-line, if you prefer very short, buzzed hair style, even bald, this is the unit for you. Efficient, does it&#x27;s job well and remember this is not a blade substitute but it&#x27;s pretty darn close.</li>
            <li> I have never cut my own hair before I got this one.  Did an excellent job the first time and has ever since.  It is very easy to use and clean when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I had been rocking the number 1 &#x27;buzz cut&#x27; for some time before getting this and when I did, thats when I went totally bald... the clipper attachment gets much closer than a &#x27;regular&#x27; clipper, while the foil shaver achieves a good &#x27;bald&#x27; result on my noggin.  It does take longer than wet shaving my head though, which I switched to not long after getting this shaver but I do still use this if I have been lazy and let it grow a bit too long for a wet shave to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this to be a razor replacement.  It does do a \\&quot;decent\\&quot; job but leaves stubble even after several passes in all directions.  It does get very close so if you like the totally bald look then it will give you that.  HOWEVER if you like the bald smoothness, I would pass on this.  I like to keep my head totally clean and smooth.  This unit for me gave me the closeness that I feel on the day after a shave with a Mach 5 razor.  It is pretty close but not close enough.  Another issue I have with this shaver is it takes FOREVER to do the job totally.  My whole head not including face took over 30 minutes to get finished.  Something which usually takes me 10-15min with a razor.  I will be returning this product tomorrow as it just doesn&#x27;t give me the smoothness that I want.  Maybe I expected too much.</li>
            <li> OK....I keep my hair cut short and was paying a barber to cut my hair every three weeks at $20 a shot.  I started thinking that looking at the $20 plus my time to travel and to wait for my turn could be done a lot better if I cut my own.  So now several months after purchasing the product I can say that it has been money well spent.  I do have to say I was impressed with the design of the Remington product but reading the reviews about battery life and people having to replace them every year left me no choice but to choose the product which I thought was second best and that was this Norelco.  I have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I am not impressed. It is somewhat uncomfortable on my scalp when I use it to shave my head completely bald. This shaver has nicked me on the back of the head causing bleeding and razor bumps all over my head especially in the back. Also, frequently you have to go over the same spot several times with this razor even when you just brushed hair off of it.</li>
            <li> It is easily used.And all my &amp;#34;clients&amp;#34; think it is very good.Because it was my first time to do it but they thought it just like what the real headgroomer did.</li>
            <li> I had a buzzer that was dying and I researched this product.  This is a great quality product that I use.  I shave my head completely without any attachment, leaving a small amount of hair.  I dont like shaving all the way and this buzzer is exactly what I was looking for.  Great quality</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who wants to maintain a Bald look. I have been searching for quite some time for a no hassle tool. Now my search has ended. Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Product met my expectation, had all the bells and whilste attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Durable product, nice size fits in palm nice when shaving.&lt;br /&gt;I had a defect with balder section within 90 days but contacted manufacter, sent me a new one. Great !!!</li>
            <li> I love this itemï¼Œdo manual work is very delicateï¼Œ meets the need of meã€‚Goods distribution is also very thoughtful and timely&lt;br /&gt;ã€‚</li>
            <li> First use, I was able to shave my head perfectly in a fraction of the time that it would take me to go get it done at a hairstylist.  The rotating head makes it truly possible to do it yourself.  And, even after shipping and fees to Canada, it still comes to a third of the price of purchasing here.</li>
            <li> saving money on blades! Didn&#x27;t beleive it till we saw, it really works for bald heads! could not be happier</li>
            <li> Great for one use. The second time I used it I got a loud squeaky noise followed by it shutting off. Would turn back on and continued shutting off every 10 seconds. I was in the middle of shaving my head so it took forever.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love them. I saw others with this issue so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> The product is really out of my expectation ,it&#x27;s very easy to operation. Now i do the haircut myself,so i just order it again for my friend.</li>
            <li> Among the Do-it-yourself (DIY) headgroomers I had, I would say that the Philips Norelco Qc5550/40 is so far, the best. I really like the part that it could really cut my hair to as short as 1mm (3/64 inch). There are just a few DIY headgroomers out there that could go as short as that. The motor sounds fairly quiet and cuts the hair with great precision. Its shaving head accessory also proves to be of great addition to the package. You can really shave down your head clean and safe. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Works fine with me. I had the older model for about 3 years now, but it had a EU plug charger. I purchased that one to be able to have a haircut, while I live and work in the USA. Once you get used to it, it will save you a tonne of money (only applies to those who need a haircut or a shave, NOT A HAIRDO!!!).</li>
            <li> it very comfortable!very good! I can really shave down your head clean and safe.I really like the part that it could really cut my hair to as short as 1mm (3/64 inch)</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco unit. Boy is this so much better. The battery is excellent that I can trim my hair and then have a lot of charge left over, It also hold charge for weeks. Absolutely the best hair groomer. The foil attachement really helps with getting a very smooth surface :-)&lt;br /&gt;Philips absolutely is head and sholders above any product out there. I did a lot of research and this is really so dependable.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing it lacks is a charge capacity indicator. Having said that I can confirm that I have not been in a situation when it run out of charge like the older norelco.  Its very light and very well designed. Highly recomended. One last thing I dont think they have any trimmer in the market with a charge time indicator like they do on the shavers. So that is really a moot point.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the Philips Headgroom so far. Just to frame this my hairline has hit the stage where it looks best to keep it shaved. I still have some hair on the top of my head but generally speaking it&#x27;s pretty much the \\&quot;monk\\&quot; style with regular growth on the sides and back but little on the crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about 4 years I&#x27;ve been using typical Wahl style clippers. They do a fine job but have significant shortcomings that the Philips Headgroom addresses completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here they are in order of importance to me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s adjustable and cuts very closely and comfortably. I always use the closest setting but if you are looking for adjustability it&#x27;s a very easy to use dial with multiple settings instead of clip on attachments. What truly sets it apart from typical clippers is how you can rotate the cutter depending on which area of your head you are shaving. It&#x27;s very easy to find the best position when you&#x27;re clipping around your ears for example. Very, very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s cordless and rechargeable. The traditional clippers have cords and it&#x27;s very annoying to have the cord swinging around as you move the clippers into position on your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Super easy to clean. It comes with a brush but I use an old toothbrush as it&#x27;s more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Doesn&#x27;t need lubrication. Enough said, I hate having to oil the blades and needing to remember to keep a supply of oil on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great job on this product Philips. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s for everyone (such as guys still lucky enough to have hair but want to shave it) but for baldies like me this is the way you should go.</li>
            <li> The manual says to replace the foil head at least once a year (which is not even close to being often enough.) I did extensive research and could not find replacement parts ANYWHERE. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this out when I got it.  The design for this head groomer is excellent.  My first time using it was very smooth and everything went well with trimming my brother hair.  A few days later, I tried to cut my hair a small piece of plastic fell out along with my hair.  After that, it went down hill.  The Norelco 5550 stopped cutting and making a high pitch noise.  I cannot use this Head groomer anymore.  I would have give this Norelco a higher rating like 4 to 5 stars if it is still working after the second time.</li>
            <li> A great piece of tech, multifunctional and ergonomical.&lt;br /&gt;Rich package:&lt;br /&gt;Comfortable mirror with a rubber band attached to it.&lt;br /&gt;Trimming attachment - good quality blades, though not professional ones, like in Moser/Oster/Andis, but this also means that blades do not require to apply oil after each use - convenient by means of maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;Big comb to make a nice haircut.&lt;br /&gt;Smaller comb for precision trimming.&lt;br /&gt;Shaving header/balder - three separate blades, two under the foils, one between the foils, just as in usual modern shaver. Shaves beard and mustache pretty nice, leaves no scars.&lt;br /&gt;A small brush for maintenance needs.&lt;br /&gt;And, of course, the device itself - very good quality plastic and rubber is used - tight grip and comfortable in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looks very stylish and hi-tech.&lt;br /&gt;Rotating header is a great invention! Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Battery runs around 1h, charging very fast, Li-Ion is used.&lt;br /&gt;Travel charger unit with american plug (should depend of the market, mine was for U.S.). But charger can be used in Europe, too, if you have an adapter for the plug, because charger works with any current in range ~100-240V.&lt;br /&gt;Stable work so far (a few weeks of daily use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for people, who is willing to make a haircut by self.</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle.  The head twists so you don&#x27;t have to twist your wrist into awkward positions.  The cut is so close, hubby&#x27;s scalp feels like a peach.  And, he can do it himself.</li>
            <li> This was a present for my boyfriend, and though the reviews were good, i&#x27;m looking for another product to get for him. He is new to shaving his head bald and this seemed like the perfect product, but after his first use he was left with brush-burn like marks on his scalp. I tried to do it for him but it irritated his scalp too easily. He did use the attachment to lower his hair at first, and that worked well. The &amp;#34;balder&amp;#34; just seems to harsh.</li>
            <li> Easy to use by myself</li>
            <li> This shaver works really well and I would recommend it to anyone.  Its great to have a cord just in case the battery gets low.  This is perfect for cutting hair yourself!</li>
            <li> Does a respectable job of keeping my head shaved.  Almost as good as a blade, but should be used at least every every 2 to 4 days,  Can be used quite a few times between charges. My only problem is it gives no warning nor is there any indication when battery charge is about to run out.  It just stops suddenly and without warning, however it charges very quickly. You can however use it right away when you plug in the charger in.  Storage case is chintzy  and  too small to hold shaver, charger and and included attachments.</li>
            <li> Item makes a horrible squeaking sound and shuts off, then have to stop shaving and turn shaver back on then repeat then repeat then give up.</li>
            <li> Hubs loves it as a balder! I even use it trim our infant sons&#x27; hair- it has several attachments to adjust the length since I wouldn&#x27;t want to bald them :)</li>
            <li> Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Compact&lt;br /&gt;Multi Functional&lt;br /&gt;Everything i needed&lt;br /&gt;Worth&#x27;s it&lt;br /&gt;if your looking for a budget shaving machine that should defentally do it</li>
            <li> I bought this to get a closer shave to my head/face. (Going bald in style over here! haha)&lt;br /&gt;The overall product is great and of high quality. The blades seem to move around a bit at first, but they really don&#x27;t. They have 1mm of forward motion if you push them while locked with your finger. However they do not move back at all, and give a very precise shave. Battery life is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pivoting blade is actually very useful for behind the ears/back of the head and the neck. It provides an easier reach and a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It began to squeal wildly. At first, I thought it was a bit of plastic around the blade or maybe hair. But it would not stop. Eventually, the device cut off! I was mid haircut (it was not pretty!) I let it recharge fully overnight and the next day, I finished the remainder of the cut but, even before I was done, it began again. I took the plastic part (comb?) off but the noise did not stop. I was clearly the two blades or the connection to the motor or the motor itself.&lt;br /&gt;Other than this MAJOR flaw, the unit was OK. It does better than most other methods of cutting with a groomer yourself. The swivel is genius. The unit body and finish itself is actually pretty good quality. What I have seen before from products made in Europe by Philips.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad something with the motor or connectors were flawed.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend this. Especially at the price! I have returned it.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted it to do. Takes hair down to near razor length (or no length)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used it every day for the last month. Use in combination with Remington face saver.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made! It lasted a few days and it broke! The design is a good idea but the manufacturer should have put some better materials.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cheap $10-$20 conair hair trimmers for over 2 years. Comparatively the Phillips Norelco - provides a much cleaner bald trim, its light weight and requires no oiling or power adjustment. It&#x27;s ready to use. If you are a regular bald trim shaver - this product is for you!</li>
            <li> I really like this!  I&#x27;ve been cutting my hair for years, and this is simply better than I was using in the past.  Holds a charge forever, cuts easily, and feels great on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver for my head but after a half dozen uses the foil head broke and cut into my scalp. Very poor quality</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean. You can also clean it under running water which is a huge plus. I now use it as a daily shaver as well, and have cut my and my sons hair without any issues. Great product</li>
            <li> Superb product.  Safe to use, easy to use and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended for those who do not wish to spend tinme waiting for barber service :)</li>
            <li> purchased this product in hopes of not using a razor as i wanted a close shave. It works great and it easy to use, it will give you the clean head shave look. however after a few days my head felt really irritated and started to show bumps. All over the side of my head and back. The only option was to let the hair grow back out and try other options. I would not recommend this product for African american men or men with thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> i purchased one and later returned it.  The first one worked for about 2 weeks then made a loud grinding noise so I returned it for a replacement.  The second one worked as stated but it just took to long to shave a head.  I bought it mainly for the balder and it worked but you have to go very slow and have to go over and over the same section until its completely shaven.  I did a better job with my ANDIS BALDER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works if you have time I would estimate about 45 minutes or so to completely shave a head and not have any rough spots left.</li>
            <li> This is great for just having a shaved head. I hate using a blade, and was hesitant about using an electric razor on my head. But this product works great for me.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this item. but I do use a simple comb which comes with a razor blade installed which I buy on Amazon. You comb your hair and it cuts the hair. It costs under $10 and unless you are very particular about how your hair looks it might do the trick and for much less money, If you really care how your hair looks go to a barber or hairdresser.</li>
            <li> It seemed new in the packing when it arrived. But it makes a lot of annoying and loud noise as if the machine needs some oil. We were very dissapointed with the purchase as we paid over 70 bucks. First we thought of sending it back but the policy said only unopened in original packing will be accepted/refunded. Luckily we had an old one whose machine was functional so we replaced the old blades with new ones and started using. Not worth paying 75 bucks for just the blades :(</li>
            <li> What a great product.  Really gives you a shave as close as a bode - well, almost :)&lt;br /&gt;Fast and close is the best way to describe this little gem.</li>
            <li> I shave my head every other day, so using a razor is pretty easy, but I left it grow for about 2 weeks and this thing breezed right threw it! I was done in about 10 mins! It left about a 2 day stubble which came off in seconds with a razor.</li>
            <li> never used this type of device before but found this very convenient.. the blade head rotates so it easy to manuvour it..</li>
            <li> The first shaver ended up being a dud, as the battery failed to hold a charge and the blades would often seize with a loud screeching noise. Amazon Customer Service was absolutely amazing with the exchange process and shipped me the same model the very next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was about 1 month and 10 shaves ago. This 2nd shaver has worked just as advertised w/out incident. In fact, the battery seems to last a bit longer than the 60 minute cutting time it states in the manual. Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to cut my hair myself and I use the cutting element alone w/out any combs. After the 1st couple of sessions, I felt extremely comfortable handling the shaver and utilizing the rotating head function for around the ears and when swapping hands/sides of the head. Thought and care went into shaping the product, as it feels very natural and ergonomical in hand at this point. It cuts cleanly and does not tear the hair out. I don&#x27;t have to go over the same area multiple times and I get a close even #0 buzz everytime within about 10 minutes. I have yet to try the bald attachment as my girl and I both prefer the stubble look, so I cannot comment on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely worth the extra $10-$20 over the cheaper competition, as you can tell Phillips put added quality into this model. The travel pouch and hand mirror are a nice touch as well, but the quality of this product stands alone as worth the price tag.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Paid off after three uses.  Wish it had a beveled comb to help with tapering.  Doesn&#x27;t pull.  cleans easily</li>
            <li> About the size as a regular electric razor and as easy to handle.  It adjusts to a wide range of (short) hair lengths so you just need to experiment to see what looks good.  No need for a barber anymore.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I purchased this imagining any multitude of problems. However, after a few months of use I&#x27;m extremely please with this purchase. Battery life is great. I cut my hair fairly short and the clipper doesn&#x27;t leave any lines or variance in the cut, unless I miss a spot of course.if you are looking for something to use with a handful of options give this a chance.</li>
            <li> Ordered the product for my husband and he had a problem that several others have expressed in there reviews. ï»¿ After the machine is turned for awhile it makes a high pitch noise and turns off and then will not turn back on and yes it was fully charged. Returned it.  Had to do something he never had done before shave his head with a razor.  The picture on the reveiw is of what the machine did not his razor.  Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Great purchase ! I was sceptic about the results of the headgroomer and after my first use i was surprised. The headgroomer is smooth , precise and easy to use , so i realy love it. In the bottom line it saved me 20 $ each month by not paying my barber and do it my self in 7 minutes!! It was one of my best deals ever despite the shipping costs to israel. Well done philips!!!.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it...Charges quickly, cuts cleanly, and the rotation of the head allows for cleaner cuts than previous groomer&#x27;s could do.</li>
            <li> great brand and great stuff, it looks great when hold it in your hand, but i bought it for the other guy;</li>
            <li> I purchased this while it&#x27;s a deep promition. Will not use at this moment because I would still like to go to the hair salon for my hair cut. However I plan to use for my kids&#x27; hair cut later.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried at first because I have a sensitive head. When I&#x27;ve tried to shave my head in the past with a razor my head would look blotchy and red. Not a good look for anyone, but when I use this product it not only gets skin close but there is zero irritation! Great job norelco!</li>
            <li> it is MADE IN HUNGARY . very solid good quality, and everything fits so well, not even a thing for regretting</li>
            <li> Very easy to handle, multiple shapes to choose. It works and it&#x27;s great! It contains a mirror~Also the price is low.</li>
            <li> By using it, I can do haircut by myself for my son and husband. It&#x27;s convenient and efficient. I just spent $19.99 on haircut maybe for many years. It&#x27;s a big deal!</li>
            <li> The groomer works well, good battery life.  However the precision comb broke after 8 months of use and is discontinued on Philips&#x27; support site.  Since the unit is unusable without the attachment, I must give this a poor rating.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this device for shaving or balding your head. It really struggled to cut through hair in the back of my head, even when using it on a daily basis (hair shorter than 1mm). The blades just did not cut through easily, thus making the process very long. It would also start spitting back the hair already cut into my head, making me having to clean the blades during the shaving process. In all, I was spending more time using this product than using a regular razor.&lt;br /&gt;I also had a hard time shaving the hair around the ears.&lt;br /&gt;I still gave it two stars because I think it may still work great as a regular hair trimmer due to it is portability and it is very easy to handle, but I did not like it for what I bought it for.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a cordless replacement of my Wahl Balding clipper. I like the sub-zero length, basically a days growth of hair. I don&#x27;t want a clean-shaved look. With my Wahl, I just use it without the guard and it leaves an even stubble. However, since I trim my own hair, the Wahl is heavy and awkward to use, especially in the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted the Qc5550 to be a light, cordless, swiveling head replacement.  Unfortunately it did not meet expectations.  Right away I noticed that the clipper would not give a sub-zero cut just by looking at it.  Using it proved a little painful and did not leave my hair at the same length. Stray long hairs and patches were everyone, no matter how many times I went over them. Resigned to not letting my $50 go to waste, I tried out the shaving attachment.  This was disappointing too.  Depending on the way your hair grows, it may or may not shave well.  Some parts of my head were clean shaved, while others had a noticeable stubble.  Also, in order to get any kind of decent results, it needs to be used daily. I like to be able to skip a day or two.  I shave my head for convenience and ease, not for style (not to mention hiding my receding/thinning hair).  I don&#x27;t want it to be a daily grooming chore.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re after the complete Chrome Dome look, this may not give it to you. It won&#x27;t replace a blade, which is what I was after. I tried going all over my head at every different angle, in case it did better against the grain. Gives a short stubble, thats it. Not terribly even either. Perhaps my gray hair is too tough for it. It&#x27;s easier than my Wahl clippers, but that&#x27;s about all I can say.</li>
            <li> It provides a very close shave although not as close as blade.&lt;br /&gt;But without troubles and very fast.&lt;br /&gt;The battery is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it greatly!</li>
            <li> This is probably the closest you can get to \\&quot;bald\\&quot; with an electric razor.  Prior to this I was using my Norelco rotary shaver to shave my head and it actually worked well, but this gets closer.  I&#x27;ve only used the balder attachment, so that is what this review is based on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with the performance, however, after just 2 months one of the springs on the blades broke and I could not get it back on.  The blades are kind of flimsy, unfortunately.  Thankfully, Philips has excellent customer service, so I took advantage of the warranty and called to request a replacement balder attachment which they sent me quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new attachment is much better quality, but I am still worried about its durability.  The balder attachment does give a good, close shave, however there are parts of my head that it shaves unevenly.  I usually find several missed spots even after going over several times, which does lead to irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, it is an alternative to going with the manual razor.  Unfortunately it does leave several ingrown hairs.  I usually have to go over a few spots again with my rotary shaver.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and it&#x27;s very light weight.</li>
            <li> Works Ok. It&#x27;s perfect to cut the hair yourself.</li>
            <li> Hardly holds a charge- I&#x27;ve left it charging for a few hours only to get less than a minute of hair cutting power out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even worse, it doesn&#x27;t operate on power even when plugged in. It needs to have the battery charged, which means if the battery runs out (which it will) then you&#x27;ve gotta wait for it to re-charge while you have Quasimodo-esque hair for a half hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I just got a dud with a junk battery, but if the device can&#x27;t operate on a straight plug-in, when the battery holds even less of a charge as it ages (if it&#x27;s even possible to have more of a lousy battery) it will become entirely useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get a straight up corded clipper, or anything else. Forget this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> You need to be careful with this if you don&#x27;t.want to cut close. I have Philips trimmer and I thought this will be as good as the one I had. But you can easily make mistake with this, since the length it leaves depend on the angle of your hand.</li>
            <li> Love it, does a good job, easy to use. A must for the pratical look.</li>
            <li> Started making &amp;#34;screeching&amp;#34; sounds, then just stopped working. I called Phillips Customer Service. Lady was very nice, explained situation. She said she would ship me a replacement shaver. It took seven days by Fed Ex ground. I opened the box and the replacement was not the same razor that I originally purchased. I originally purchased a rechargeable shaver and the replacement they sent me was a corded electric shaver. It seems to work fine, and really gives my bald head a close shave. But like I said earlier, the Customer Service lady was great, and even took my call on a Sunday! I&#x27;m just a little unhappy with the product.</li>
            <li> It just makes a screeching noise and stops.  Apparently it is a common problem.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does its job, but wish it could do it a little better.  For me its acceptable because it gives you a clean shaven head.  When you run your hand over the shaven area you can still feel the fuzz, this is what I meant it could do a better job. On the face shaven, it does not do as good as it does on your head.  I would rate it 2 1/2 for the face area.</li>
            <li> This is the best Headgroomer I have purchased, making it the third.  This is to say, there is not much available that I have seen so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and value for money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used any other product available in the market but i this one is a grt product and i have used atleast ten times for my son&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well designed product</li>
            <li> Good work thank you. Gary Davis</li>
            <li> good deal with good product, recommanded by some friends, it really is great for DIY with your hair...&lt;br /&gt;i don&#x27;t use it yet</li>
            <li> In short; it gets super close NO stubble left but the battery fully charged wont make it through a full cut.</li>
            <li> This is a remarkably well designed and well built unit. I can&#x27;t be any more satisfied with any product I&#x27;ve bought in the last year. This thing is really fabulous - the Philips engineers did themselves proud. I bought it after my Remington Short Cut clipper died -what a piece of junk! By contrast, the Philips Norelco clipper operates smoothly, and easily and reliably. It has a lot of flexibility and a wide range hair length adjustment using the dial on the handle or using a different comb attachment on the end. It works both on battery or plugged in and the battery does not self-discharge quickly.</li>
            <li> While this is a good body grooming tool, easy to handle and lasting a long time on a charge, it certainly will not shave my head. I do have very thick hair, and it takes a while to get it to a &#x27;five-o&#x27;clock&#x27; shadow, but I can&#x27;t get a cleaner shave than this. While I kept this and it&#x27;s good for many things, as a head shaver, it takes longer than a razor and doesn&#x27;t give as good results. Maybe if you have finer hair, it will work better for you.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product, especially for bald heads. It is a chore to shave your face and head daily. This makes the work much quicker and has the capability to trim facial hair. The shave is very close. The battery lasts several shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the downside: This my second unit. The first (bought locally, Toronto, Canada) unit&#x27;s foil became unusable with a hole after three months use. Philips did not, and still does not, have a spare foil in parts stock. They said they would replace the complete unit but that was four months ago. The still have no stock of this shaver yet. It&#x27;s made in eastern Europe. I couldn&#x27;t wait any longer and ordered one from Amazon</li>
            <li> First shave my hair and shave my beard, awesome.The battery last a fair amount of time and i only need to charge it once every two weeks and has an overall good quality.</li>
            <li> Just 10 mins after using it for the first time it was already defectiv. It made an unbearable squeaking sound every 2-3 mins. So I quickly  returned it before it dies on me for good. Too bad because it really looked like a good clipper!</li>
            <li> Best - best - best of all time.&lt;br /&gt;I will be telling all my friends about it.&lt;br /&gt;My expectations were high on purchasing this product, expectations  were surpassed by eons.&lt;br /&gt;Thanking you in advance.&lt;br /&gt;Warmest regards&lt;br /&gt;Dallas</li>
            <li> The first one we purchased just stopped working after about 6 months. We thought we would try a second time and so far it is still working.</li>
            <li> Excellent device for multiple styles of cutting. Attachments are very useful. The overall ergonomic design and application of the unit is very good. Might need a grip surface on the brown smooth side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried out a few others that are similar but none are multi use like this one.</li>
            <li> Really like it. Very pleased. Less cumbersome than a set of clippers</li>
            <li> lightweight and small and therefore very easy to use in the palm of your hand. Only criticism is when used with the guard off, where the bare metal is a bit scratchy...not as smooth as my Wahl, although the Wahl is much bigger and heavier.</li>
            <li> Got mine on the recommendation of a friend. This product is fantastic! Cuts as close as a blade with no cuts. Easy to clean and use, battery lasts forever. Thoroughly recommended.</li>
            <li> I am a 26 year old guy who looked at several other options for self Shave devices and finally before finally settling on the Philips Norelco QC5550. At first I almost purchased the [[ASIN:B000VVT94G Wahl Professional 8110 5-star Series Balding Clipper]] but it really does not seem that agile for someone to self shave, Then I looked into the [[ASIN:B0015K9BXQ Remington Short Cut Clipper Rechargeable, Cordless, Haircut Kit]] but noticed A lot of people complaining about the internal battery dying within a year (about 150 1 star reviews).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a [[ASIN:B00747FI2W Philips Norelco QT4010 Beard, Stubble and Moustache Trimmer]] and it has been the best beard trimmer I have used for the price range so I decided to go with the QC5550.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some very light thinning in the front of my head that has pushed me towards more shorter hair cuts which let be blend things in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the QC5550 I decided to try it out, It&#x27;s been 3 weeks since my monthly $20 hair cut and the sides of my head above my ears was growing out a little fast so I need to trim. I kept the large blade attachment on then twisted the setting dial for maximum length and ran it up the sides of my head. I was scared running it up the side of my head knowing the only other experience cutting my own hair was when I was 7 with a pair of scissors and it was so bad my mom had to shave me bald. I adjusted and ran it up again then switched sides, finally rotating the blade and shaving the lower back of my head using a mirror. The more I did it the more hair fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final Result.. It looked REALLY good. I was really happy how the sides came out and honestly looked exactly like I just got a $20 hair cut. Walked out of the bathroom and my girlfriend was shocked and how fast and good it looked (she knows of the incident when I was 7)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sidenote: Quality is great. Everything snaps off and on easily. Charges and fells nice. Highly recommend over the other shavers online.</li>
            <li> It can perfectly deal with my hair. I really can DIY my hair in the bath room now. The small mirror is also very useful. I can use it to shave the back side of my head along with  the bathroom mirror.</li>
