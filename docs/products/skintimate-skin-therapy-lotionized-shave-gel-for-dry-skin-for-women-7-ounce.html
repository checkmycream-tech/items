            <li>I have dry skin and this product makes my skin so amazingly soft after use and it really helps to reduce razor bumps.</li>
            <li>so I took it serious that it would be &#x27;lotionized&#x27; and would not dry my skin out more</li>
            <li>And I have very dry sensitive skin because I have eczema, and this product doesn&#x27;t irritate me at all.</li>

            <li> This is so far the best shave gel I have found.  I have tried several types.  I even tried the different scents, but I keep going back to this one.  It smells nice and works really well.  Always leaves my legs soft after using.  It also lasts a long time.  I am not impressed by the shave creams.  Gels are the way to go though!</li>
            <li> I have used this shaving cream for awhile now.  It doesn&#x27;t dry your skin and is good year round! Love it.</li>
            <li> Watch out!  They show you a picture of two cans, but you only get one.  It&#x27;s not a good deal, but you don&#x27;t know it until it arrives.</li>
            <li> I can tell a huge difference in this product from others. It leaves my skin feeling much softer. When I use this I don&#x27;t even dread shaving!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shaving gel! I bought it a few months ago and shaving has been so much easier with this product. My sensitive skin is satisfied and there are less bumps and burns too! I love how healthy and comfortable it leaves me after shaving. Not to mention it&#x27;s lotionized! I&#x27;ll be purchasing more down the road :-)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff it is nice consistency stays on your legs while you shave and leaves them very soft, and a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> i used marykay shave cream until they discontinued it. this stuff is really great and makes my legs feel moisturized too!</li>
            <li> I give comments after I used it.  It is moisture and very smooth.  I like it.  The tin is bigger than my expectation. many thanks.</li>
            <li> So I have to say, I&#x27;ve tried other shave gels, but I keep going back to this one. I get a nice, close, smooth shave every time with Skintimate for Dry Skin.

            <li> Standard Shave Gel. Reduces razor burn, is great for sensitive skin, no ill effects as of yet! Great product. Good price.</li>
            <li> A purchase for the wife. According to her, this stuff works great. It&#x27;s Lotionized, so you know, if you have the legs of a dry woman this should help.</li>
            <li> You will love this creamy shave gel for your body. It&#x27;s so silky and smooth and it lathers up really nice too.</li>

            <li> Smooth legs after every shave... and soft!  I don&#x27;t even need to use lotion after I shave with using this product.</li>
            <li> Really makes shaving smooth with no bumps</li>
            <li> I have dry skin so I took it serious that it would be &#x27;lotionized&#x27; and would not dry my skin out more, however this was not the case - I ended up with dryer skin then when I started.</li>
            <li> A fellow man recommended this to me and I have been using this to shave my face every day for the past 15 years. Much better than shaving creams marketed to men that I have tried.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product many times in the past. It lathers nicely for a smooth shave. The bottle was smaller than what I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it does what it needs to do :)</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and this product makes my skin so amazingly soft after use and it really helps to reduce razor bumps. I&#x27;m so happy I found this. I recommend this wholeheartedly.</li>
