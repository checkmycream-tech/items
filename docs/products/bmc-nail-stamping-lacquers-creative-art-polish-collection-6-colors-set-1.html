            <li>“This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>gorgeous colors, perfect for stamping, and arrived super fast.  </li>
            <li>These colors are easy to apply and you have a nice variety of colors which is nice.</li>
            <li>But the rest of them stamp pretty well, and I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s mostly all I use for stamping now.</li>
            <li>The metallics are my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love these polishes and will buy again.</li>
            <li>and they are okay.  </li>
            <li>Love stamping with these products.</li>
            <li>love the colors.</li>
            <li>The caps are smooth, but also pull-off revealing a textured extra-grip cap underneath, which comes in handy.</li>
            <li>she needs more practice.</li>
            <li>i was actually able to pick it up off the plate and off the stamper)</li>
            <li>Will have to get more colors.</li>
            <li>and I love that.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to do more for you.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed doing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>STAMPING!! :)</li>
            <li>However the colors are very pretty and it makes a nice nail polish.</li>
            <li>The Gold works perfectly fine, but I have a Metallic Gold nail polish that I like a lot better.</li>
            <li>However, they looked perfect over all other polishes.</li>
            <li>The formula on ALL the polishes was fantastic:</li>
            <li>The price of the Set 1 is a great price and I highly recommend this set to anyone that is looking for stamping polish at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I bought all three sets of stamping polish, and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>I cannot describe how excited I was when I tried these nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Colors are bright which I like, however the red isn&#x27;t truly</li>
            <li>Some of the lighter colors do not work as well as the darker but overall a good product for this use.</li>
            <li>However they are really good as just regular polish</li>
            <li>All of them are good except for the white one which for some reason wont work.</li>
            <li>now only if they stamp as good as they look.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, goes on nicely however, it last about long as hail in a June rain storm!  </li>
            <li>BM was fantastic about getting a replacement sent to me right away.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, not thick enough for stamping, yet its stamping polish?</li>
            <li>I do agree with other reviews that these don&#x27;t stamp very well over darker colors, but they&#x27;re a great value.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Shipping was super fast!</li>
            <li>I really like the blue and black from this set the best.</li>
            <li>Blue was another amazing color, and white is really good, but a little bit too light.</li>
            <li>I have regular polish that stamp better than these.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t do any better at stamping than regular nail polish.  </li>
            <li>Better than trying to use regular polish.</li>
            <li>great consistency, creamy but not too thick, and there was no separation.</li>
            <li>The images you get when stamping with this polish are always crisp.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Work better as a basic polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my first sponsored product for me to review, Thank You Bundle Monster for choosing me to sponsor your products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>The colors pick up so nice for stamping that I am buying the other two sets.</li>
            <li>and I had a fun day with these popping vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than Konad and works really, really well!</li>
            <li>The darker colors in the set (#20-Sky Blue and #8-Lucky Green) were impressive when stamped over light and dark polishes alike!</li>
            <li>The amount of product is very generous, the colours are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The red and silver are a bit light.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>so it really adheres to the stamp.</li>
            <li>The gold and silver didn&#x27;t show up very well, and they don&#x27;t look metallic at all on the nail like they do in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Really thick, good product for nail art.</li>
            <li>Dry time was great as well, allowing just enough &amp;#34;work time&amp;#34; to get your images aligned and stamped on the nail properly.</li>
            <li>only cons with this set is the Royal Blue &amp; Crimson Red didn&#x27;t show as good over black.&lt;br /&gt;also</li>
            <li>For the price, these are decent stamping polishes.</li>
            <li>I have used other stamping nail polishes and have had to try two to three times to pick up a clean picture, but these picked up on the first try.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li>Luckily, the polish doubles as a regular polish, so I just added another pretty red to my collection.</li>
            <li>She seemed to be happy with the purchase and had no hassles picking up the design, though the viscosity is a bit less for few colors but in the end it worked well.</li>
            <li>Red is not so great, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the plates or not, but it doesn&#x27;t pick up the entire image.</li>
            <li>The nail polishes go on easily and dry down pretty well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used black so far, but I&#x27;m absolutely in love.    </li>
            <li>Also took nearly two weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li>so sad, i saved and saved for a good stamping polish, and i must save yet again.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll most likely buy the other two sets in the near future.</li>
            <li>The colors are all beautiful and on-trend, with no odd or unpleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have to say if you are one looking for polish that will stamp over black then I can tell you only 2 out of the colors that shows really good over black</li>
            <li>And as for #10-Amethyst, it&#x27;s obviously too dark to show up when stamped on black/very dark polish, but still opaque and looks amazing over every thing else.</li>
            <li>Also the images I have uploaded are her first two tries at nail stamping</li>
            <li>Finally, I used a variety of different topcoats and had no smearing of the stamping at all, which was really impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>The lighter colors in the set (#15-Sunshine Yellow, #12-Orange Peel, and #21-Electric Pink) are lovely and vibrant, but not completely opaque when stamped over black/very dark polish.</li>
            <li>On the description, it clearly stated that it can be used as regular nail polish too.</li>
            <li>Silver and gold did well sometimes, but overall the red and blue were the only two colors I could get to stamp consistently.</li>
            <li>The white is thin and transfers light, not as bold as other white nail polishes for stamping.</li>
            <li>Not all the colors work on dark color s fast s</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Not all the colors work on dark color s fast s</li>
            <li> So if you don&#x27;t want to purchase the entire set, I suggest buying the Blue, Black and White.</li>
            <li> I used 3 different stampers and an assortment  of scrapers but for some reason black, and white just didn&#x27;t pick up or transfer well.</li>
            <li> they are very sheer,  and do not show up on dark polish.</li>
            <li> The Noir Black (13) is a must have if you are only looking for black stamping polish or the Angelic White.</li>
            <li> I am new to stamping, and I was having a lot of trouble with regular nail polishes, even ones that I thought were thick and dark.  </li>
            <li> The dark blue stamps well over lighter colors but not over black.</li>

            <li> Was a gift. The person is very happy!</li>
            <li> These are great for nailing stamping! They are the perfect consistency!</li>
            <li> good! it works well for the stamps!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product, it was a gift from my boyfriend. The amount of product is very generous, the colours are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> These are great stamping polishes. It&#x27;s mostly all I use for stamping now.</li>
            <li> Works well for stamping. Some of the lighter colors do not work as well as the darker but overall a good product for this use.</li>
            <li> I have regular polish that stamp better than these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving a 3 star  rating because only 3 of the polishes stamped well. I used 3 different stampers and an assortment  of scrapers but for some reason black, and white just didn&#x27;t pick up or transfer well. I found the Polish to be very thin and not opaque  enough to show up well. Silver and gold did well sometimes, but overall the red and blue were the only two colors I could get to stamp consistently. Still the problem with the opacity though. However they are really good as just regular polish</li>
            <li> For the price, these are decent stamping polishes. I really like the blue and black from this set the best. The red and silver are a bit light. I do agree with other reviews that these don&#x27;t stamp very well over darker colors, but they&#x27;re a great value.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive the set with the black polish having been broken during transport. BM was fantastic about getting a replacement sent to me right away. They have excellent customer service and I&#x27;ll most likely buy the other two sets in the near future.</li>
            <li> so sad, i saved and saved for a good stamping polish, and i must save yet again. these were weaker at stamping than my color club and opi vast regular nail polish collections. don&#x27;t buy these. BMC makes EXCELLENT stamping plates, so go for those. otherwise, stick to konad stamping polishes,&lt;br /&gt;i wonder if i can get my money back</li>
            <li> Great Stamping Polish!!!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t do any better at stamping than regular nail polish.  In fact, the white is useless.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I bought all three sets of stamping polish, and I was not disappointed.  I am new to stamping, and I was having a lot of trouble with regular nail polishes, even ones that I thought were thick and dark.  With these,  I am not having any trouble at all!  The metallics are my favorite. I used all of the colors and took pictures.  They are posted here.</li>
            <li> great this is the best stamping nail polish i have bought!</li>
            <li> Good colors and it works well with the nail stamping kit I purchased too.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, not thick enough for stamping, yet its stamping polish? Hmm</li>
            <li> It did not do what it said it would do. Does not stick.</li>
            <li> A little bit watery but stamps ok!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as stamp polish at all!! However the colors are very pretty and it makes a nice nail polish. Just don&#x27;t buy it thinking it will work for stamping.</li>
            <li> This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review. These colors are easy to apply and you have a nice variety of colors which is nice. The nail polishes go on easily and dry down pretty well. The kids and I had a fun day with these popping vibrant colors. I would recommend these nail polishes to anyone.</li>
            <li> It stamped great! but it wasn&#x27;t like advertised. On the description, it clearly stated that it can be used as regular nail polish too. I purchased two sets because of this. However, regular nail polish just goes on way too thick, causing a sloppy, not smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> This is good stamping polish. . I love these polishes and will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good nail polishes for stamping.  The metallic colors and the black stamp and transfer well.  Red is barely visible over black but will work well over lighter contrasting base nail polishes.  The white is not as thick as expected for stamping.  The white is thin and transfers light, not as bold as other white nail polishes for stamping. The dark blue stamps well over lighter colors but not over black.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get it to work</li>
            <li> Colors are bright which I like, however the red isn&#x27;t truly a red would have given it 5 stars if the this wasn&#x27;t the case.</li>
            <li> All of them are good except for the white one which for some reason wont work.</li>
            <li> I used these with a stamper and they are okay.  Better than trying to use regular polish.</li>
            <li> Shipping was super fast! Definetly will be buying more nail supplies from bundle monster! Great prices!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with these colors. I cannot describe how excited I was when I tried these nail polishes. The colors pick up so nice for stamping that I am buying the other two sets. I have used other stamping nail polishes and have had to try two to three times to pick up a clean picture, but these picked up on the first try.</li>
            <li> Love stamping with these products.</li>
            <li> liked the packaging. love the colors. now only if they stamp as good as they look. heard great things</li>
            <li> Used for dial filling.  The product works well for the projects I use it for.</li>
            <li> gorgeous colors, perfect for stamping, and arrived super fast.  I highly recommend this product and seller</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than Konad and works really, really well! I&#x27;ve only used black so far, but I&#x27;m absolutely in love.    Update: So I&#x27;ve had a chance to test all the colors. Red is not so great, I&#x27;m not sure if it was the plates or not, but it doesn&#x27;t pick up the entire image. Luckily, the polish doubles as a regular polish, so I just added another pretty red to my collection. Blue was another amazing color, and white is really good, but a little bit too light. The Gold works perfectly fine, but I have a Metallic Gold nail polish that I like a lot better. Same with the Silver.    So if you don&#x27;t want to purchase the entire set, I suggest buying the Blue, Black and White.</li>
            <li> Is this stamping polish or regular polish?&lt;br /&gt;I tried to use as stamping polish, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My review is for the stamping polish set #2, and as soon as I received them, I was impressed. They came packaged in a &#x27;BMC&#x27; printed box with a specially made foam insert that perfectly held and protected the polishes for shipping. The caps are smooth, but also pull-off revealing a textured extra-grip cap underneath, which comes in handy. The bottles are not labeled with color names, but instead numbers (corresponding names can be found on the Bundle Monster website). The colors are all beautiful and on-trend, with no odd or unpleasant odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for their performance, I was very pleased! The lighter colors in the set (#15-Sunshine Yellow, #12-Orange Peel, and #21-Electric Pink) are lovely and vibrant, but not completely opaque when stamped over black/very dark polish. However, they looked perfect over all other polishes. The darker colors in the set (#20-Sky Blue and #8-Lucky Green) were impressive when stamped over light and dark polishes alike! And as for #10-Amethyst, it&#x27;s obviously too dark to show up when stamped on black/very dark polish, but still opaque and looks amazing over every thing else. The formula on ALL the polishes was fantastic: great consistency, creamy but not too thick, and there was no separation. The images you get when stamping with this polish are always crisp. Dry time was great as well, allowing just enough &amp;#34;work time&amp;#34; to get your images aligned and stamped on the nail properly. Finally, I used a variety of different topcoats and had no smearing of the stamping at all, which was really impressive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I would definitely recommend these stamping polishes to anyone wanting to add to their stamping polish collection. And at this price point, you need them all! ;)</li>
            <li> My wife bought this after she saw the videos on nail art. She seemed to be happy with the purchase and had no hassles picking up the design, though the viscosity is a bit less for few colors but in the end it worked well. Also the images I have uploaded are her first two tries at nail stamping so may be she needs more practice.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money! These are terrible. Work better as a basic polish. When used for stamping(when i was actually able to pick it up off the plate and off the stamper) they are very sheer,  and do not show up on dark polish.</li>
            <li> Not all the colors work on dark color s fast s</li>
            <li> wonderful product great coverage!</li>
            <li> Good assortment of colors.  Really thick, good product for nail art.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, goes on nicely however, it last about long as hail in a June rain storm!  Peals off usually 8-10 hours after application, very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great stamping polish.  Will have to get more colors.</li>
            <li> None of these colors are showing up on my 35$ black gel manicure.  I&#x27;m so sad, just got 25 plates, these polishes an it doesnt show up :(  Must be because my black polish Idk...</li>
            <li> Cant say these worked all the time for my stamping but when they did they were great. Thanks</li>
            <li> “This item was sponsored to me by Bundle Monster in exchange for my honest review.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first sponsored product for me to review, Thank You Bundle Monster for choosing me to sponsor your products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These stamping polishes are great, they stamp very good, polish is opaque and don&#x27;t need to use a lot for stamping and I love that. The smell is not overbearing. I have to say if you are one looking for polish that will stamp over black then I can tell you only 2 out of the colors that shows really good over black is Iced Silver (17) &amp;  Liquid Gold (26) and of coarse Angelic White (1). The Royal Blue (24) &amp; Crimson Red (5) are great over lighter to medium base colors. The Noir Black (13) is a must have if you are only looking for black stamping polish or the Angelic White. The price of the Set 1 is a great price and I highly recommend this set to anyone that is looking for stamping polish at a reasonable price. They also sell individually if you are not wanting to buy the set. visit their website [...] and check out their products. I have bought from them many times and have been happy how their products work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons with this set is the Royal Blue &amp; Crimson Red didn&#x27;t show as good over black.&lt;br /&gt;also they put numbers on the bottles instead of the names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros is the price, great for anyone looking for stamping polish that is within their budget.&lt;br /&gt;and quality of the polish for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Bundle Monster for letting me be a sponsor for your products. Can&#x27;t wait to do more for you. I really enjoyed doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAPPY STAMPING!! :)</li>
            <li> the colors are so ugly</li>
            <li> Perfect for stamping! It&#x27;s thick so it really adheres to the stamp. Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> bought it as a gift and was missing a color. Also took nearly two weeks to arrive.</li>
            <li> Works well stays on good</li>
            <li> I got set one. The gold and silver didn&#x27;t show up very well, and they don&#x27;t look metallic at all on the nail like they do in the bottle. But the rest of them stamp pretty well, and I&#x27;m happy with them.</li>
