    <ol>
            <li>Best there is period!</li>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>Great company!</li>
            <li>This is the best aftershave lotion I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Great product for my skin!</li>
            <li>Like this although I think I still like Baxter&#x27;s of CA the best.</li>
            <li>had heard excellent things about the Coral Skin Food, and it lived up to all expectations.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Balms are generally best during the winter, since they act as a lotion and hydrate your skin, keeping you moisturized.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, if you don&#x27;t want both a blam and a splash, this is a great way to go!</li>
            <li>I can get an excellent shave using this with a canned foam whipped up with some water.</li>
            <li>Splashes are best during the summer, since they close the pores without causing any oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, ideally, this product would moisturize without getting you oily.</li>
            <li>This stuff is great aftershave.  </li>
            <li>Great soothing feeling on face after shaving</li>
            <li>Its greaseless and provides cooling effect - great for your face.</li>
            <li>Worked great to soften up the hair before shave , and to seal the face off after.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s great as a pre-shave lotion as well</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff!</li>
            <li>but I love this scent the best.</li>
            <li>Good for some, but not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li>My son loves this stuff - the scent is very appealing.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling great after a spirited bout with my DE razor.</li>
            <li>I have already recommended this product to my friends who are seeking a better way forward!</li>
            <li>It feels real good and cool when it goes on the skin, I really love this product.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Kind of like vitamins...</li>
            <li>F. Trumper&#x27;s Rose Shaving Cream.</li>
            <li>Smells nice.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best post shaving treatment you can get!  </li>
            <li>I love the rose water scent this has.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of my face after applying this to my face, has a nice unobtrusive scent.  </li>
            <li>So far she is not too impressed either.  </li>
            <li>It is like a gel with a nice (yet not overly strong) scent.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with razor burn, and it has a great scent.</li>
            <li>Got this to go along with my GFT Rose shave cream, and it&#x27;s fantastic for a pre and post shave balm.</li>
            <li>The coral variety is not quite my favorite</li>
            <li>Makes the skin feel nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Sandalwood is my favorite of the three fragrances.</li>
            <li>The skin does feel a bit &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; after application but in a healthy way.</li>
            <li>but this stuff works really great on it, and I really like the smell, which isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>It was an excellent decision, both economically and practically, but one thing the MachX razors do really well is minimize razor burn.    </li>
            <li>Does not give a sting, as many aftershaves are supposed to do</li>
            <li>I Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing better for  your skin after you shave than this product.</li>
            <li>but none can top the way this makes your skin feel and how protected it feels after use.</li>
            <li>Love the moisturizing from this product.  </li>
            <li>great pre and after shave ,really helps on my skin burn</li>
            <li>Just use a dime-sized drop of it and make sure your face is still damp, it will lubricate all over your face</li>
            <li>It came highly recommended and works great for me.  </li>
            <li>The single greatest after shave in existence.</li>
            <li>Trumper Skin Food is the most gentle, most effective aftershave I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is quite floral, and I still don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve gotten used to that, but it somehow still manages to be pleasant and surprisingly masculine.  </li>
            <li>This is the most soothing and actually economical post shaving preparation you can find.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the skin food</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to coloring choose the sandalwood variety which is about equally effective and works well with more herbal or drier scents.</li>
            <li>Quickly loses the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; so it is perfect for use before splashing on your favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is very sweet but mild.</li>
            <li>I like the clean and smooth feel after I have used it.  </li>
            <li>Really makes the skin feel better after a shave.</li>
            <li>The scent is a lovely, but masculine and unobtrusive rose that will harmonize nicely with many colognes or EDT sprays, as long as they are of the sweeter or classic barber shop variety.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure I have THE most sensitive skin in the world,  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all the other products in the market that claim to be great for your skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and dries quickly.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; type product is not greasy and has a very pleasant, clean, but subtle, smell.  </li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strange though, It doesn&#x27;t smell like a Rose cream, I get a strong scent of the ingredient Citronella, like the candles you use in the summer to ward off mosquitoes.  </li>
            <li>and they are both equally as good and both go a long way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It does on easy, and is only sticky for 5 or 10 seconds before becoming smooth.</li>
            <li>Once applied on the face, it does start soothing the skin and gets absorbed quickly.</li>
            <li>I combine it with other aftershave balms to good result: I use with TOBS Jermyn St, and T&amp;H 1805 balms and the combination is my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li>and it really keeps your skin smooth.</li>
            <li>/&gt;$40 also seemed like a lot at first, but its a very potent product and you&#x27;ll probably only use one or two drops every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells great, is very lightweight and refreshing and is suprisingly moisturizing even when used in very small quantities.</li>
            <li>Others I have heard found the smell FAR too strong, but it wore off quickly for me, and blended well with my cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, right?  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll actually try anything else since I&#x27;m so satisfied with the results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Geo F Trumper Coral Skin Food for about 2 years now and for me it works better than the stuff Ive picked up at the local CVS or Duane Reade.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t tried this yet, it&#x27;s definately worth the price!</li>
            <li>Anyway it is a good product but EXTREMELY overpriced, but hey, live and learn, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hint of scent left on the skin is very inviting almost sexy...</li>
            <li>My morning shaving ritual starts with a hot wash cloth, followed by a \\&quot;lathering up\\&quot; with a quality soap (I like \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; and \\&quot;Truefitt &amp; Hill\\&quot; shaving cream) applied with a pure badger shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>That if the primary fragrance in this aftershave, not bad, but certainly not manly.  </li>
            <li>It works, but I could not tell you if the real difference is this product or the others I use with it.</li>
            <li>I use a straight razor and</li>
            <li>Thanks to this stuff, I don&#x27;t get razor burn.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>It has a very feminine smell and leaves your face and hands sticky.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>blade),so when I am done, my face is ready for a soothing after-shave balm.  </li>
            <li>It is not a light in the rose fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Wow a big &amp;#34;STING&amp;#34;, and a strong scent at first.  </li>
            <li>I use a little prior to shaving and then a little more after shaving, and it&#x27;s a great experience.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do either of those things quite as well as they would individually, so you would be better off getting one balm and one splash for different seasons, but this product does the job almost as well and can be used all season round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Skin food has become a vital component of my straight razor routine.</li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;m really quite amazed at how well it dried and how smooth I became.</li>
            <li>Slightly strong smell so use just a little.</li>
            <li>As someone with a tough beard and REALLY sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve always dreaded shaving, but this aftershave is AMAZING at cooling my skin after shaving so close to the skin that my dome is baby-soft.    </li>
            <li>I use this regularly as an after shave balm and it really calms your skin.</li>
            <li>Just a few drops and it leaves your face refreshed and smooth after the shave.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this bottle lasts me over a year.</li>
            <li>have sensitive skin and have not had any razor burn since adding this to my regimen.</li>
            <li>The same sized bottle (and a tub of the shaving cream) lasted me about a year, and I shave my whole head (barring eyebrows of course).  </li>
            <li>A very little amount is more than enough.  </li>
            <li>In general I loath menthol but it works beneficially here.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much each time, so a bottle of this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li>A tiny amount, just a few drops actually will smooth, sooth and nurture your skin like nothing else.</li>
            <li>The price is high but this bottle lasts a very very long time.</li>
            <li>This has a unique smell that&#x27;s hard to put in words</li>
            <li>New to wet shaving</li>

            <li> Just a few drops and it leaves your face refreshed and smooth after the shave.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this bottle lasts me over a year.</li>
            <li> have sensitive skin and have not had any razor burn since adding this to my regimen.</li>
            <li> The same sized bottle (and a tub of the shaving cream) lasted me about a year, and I shave my whole head (barring eyebrows of course).  </li>
            <li> A very little amount is more than enough.  </li>
            <li> In general I loath menthol but it works beneficially here.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much each time, so a bottle of this will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> A tiny amount, just a few drops actually will smooth, sooth and nurture your skin like nothing else.</li>
            <li> The price is high but this bottle lasts a very very long time.</li>
            <li> This has a unique smell that&#x27;s hard to put in words</li>
            <li> New to wet shaving</li>
            <li> am taking off one star because I feel the price is a little high, for the size of bottle.</li>
            <li> it;s any consolation to anyone, the stuff should last a fairly long time-</li>
            <li> (I prefer the lime version) but it has a unique scent which is very subtle after it dries.  </li>
            <li> This bottle lasts a very long time since you only use a dab.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t narrow down exactly what the smell reminds me of</li>
            <li> Since buying it four months ago, I have eschewed the other brands which I can no long remember.  </li>
            <li> Repairs any minor shaving nicks and irritations well.  </li>
            <li> It evaporates quicker than other similar products,  balms and creams for example, and does keep your face moisturized.</li>
            <li> The scent is pleasing and lasts for a short time so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it clashing with other cologne or perfumes you might prefer to use it.</li>
            <li> it calms my face without leaving it greasy and doesn&#x27;t dry out</li>
            <li> It lubricates my face for pre-shave and moisturizes post-shave, without being oily or leaving me feeling sticky or dry.  </li>
            <li> then it&#x27;s dry and your skin is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bottle will last a very long time - a little does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> my Geo F Trumper Skin Food bottle almost empty, and thinking I needed to be getting a &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It seems expensive at first, but it will last you three times longer than most of the store-bought crap I&#x27;ve used over the course of my life, and it&#x27;s quality stuff.</li>
            <li> A little of it goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this stuff.</li>
            <li> and I would not use any other type of aftershave again.</li>
            <li> They are extremely sharp and I can get</li>
            <li> Needless to say I&#x27;ll be steering clear of this line of product in the future.</li>
            <li> Use it with other products to make my face bleed less when shaving.</li>
            <li> i have thick curly facial hair ..</li>
            <li> I purchased the product after being unsatisfied with a few other after shave lotions.  </li>
            <li> You only need a very small amount per shave.  </li>
            <li> you take half a dozen to improve health</li>
            <li> I use a \\&quot;Merkur\\&quot; \\&quot;Futur\\&quot; safety razor (if you are using a DE razor, don&#x27;t waste your money on Merkur blades.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is great aftershave.  You don&#x27;t need to use much each time, so a bottle of this will last a long time.  My last one lasted over a year.  Really makes the skin feel better after a shave.</li>
            <li> Use it with other products to make my face bleed less when shaving. It works, but I could not tell you if the real difference is this product or the others I use with it. Kind of like vitamins... you take half a dozen to improve health and then you&#x27;re wary of stopping any of them to find out which ONE makes the biggest improvement.</li>
            <li> Great soothing feeling on face after shaving</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.  A very little amount is more than enough.  I use a straight razor and dso three passes over my skin every time I shave.  Thanks to this stuff, I don&#x27;t get razor burn.  Also when I grow out my beard hair, I&#x27;ve noticed it is softer and easier to shave off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now and I would not use any other type of aftershave again. There is no burn and it really keeps your skin smooth.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly as an after shave balm and it really calms your skin. I then can use a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use Coral Skin Food after shaving. Its greaseless and provides cooling effect - great for your face. It evaporates quicker than other similar products,  balms and creams for example, and does keep your face moisturized.</li>
            <li> Best there is period!</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Really helps with razor burn, and it has a great scent.</li>
            <li> i have thick curly facial hair .. and i always get razor burn when i shave.     This product -- when used as a pre-shave -- seems to help reduce the redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> New to wet shaving and figured I would give this a try as a post shave treatment for my face.  Works very well.  Bottle will last a very long time - a little does go a long way.  It&#x27;s not greasy and dries quickly.  Rated a 4 out of 5 because I have nothing to compare it to at this time.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll actually try anything else since I&#x27;m so satisfied with the results.  Great company!</li>
            <li> Got this to go along with my GFT Rose shave cream, and it&#x27;s fantastic for a pre and post shave balm. Just a few drops and it leaves your face refreshed and smooth after the shave. Worked great to soften up the hair before shave , and to seal the face off after.</li>
            <li> Trumper Skin Food is the most gentle, most effective aftershave I&#x27;ve found.  The coral variety is not quite my favorite (I prefer the lime version) but it has a unique scent which is very subtle after it dries.  This is expensive, but a little goes a LONG way.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this bottle lasts me over a year.</li>
            <li> I love the rose water scent this has. Once applied on the face, it does start soothing the skin and gets absorbed quickly. The scent is pleasing and lasts for a short time so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it clashing with other cologne or perfumes you might prefer to use it. I&#x27;ve heard it&#x27;s great as a pre-shave lotion as well, I haven&#x27;t tried it but will give it a shot.</li>
            <li> This is the best aftershave lotion I have ever used. A little of it goes a long way.  Since buying it four months ago, I have eschewed the other brands which I can no long remember.  I have already recommended this product to my friends who are seeking a better way forward!</li>
            <li> That if the primary fragrance in this aftershave, not bad, but certainly not manly.  It is not a light in the rose fragrance.  Good for some, but not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> Makes the skin feel nice and smooth. Love this product. Do not hesitate to buy. Sandalwood is my favorite of the three fragrances.</li>
            <li> This is the most soothing and actually economical post shaving preparation you can find. A tiny amount, just a few drops actually will smooth, sooth and nurture your skin like nothing else. The skin does feel a bit &amp;#34;tight&amp;#34; after application but in a healthy way. There is a dash of menthol in the formula. In general I loath menthol but it works beneficially here. The scent is something of a match to Geo. F. Trumper&#x27;s Rose Shaving Cream. The scent is a lovely, but masculine and unobtrusive rose that will harmonize nicely with many colognes or EDT sprays, as long as they are of the sweeter or classic barber shop variety. The scent works well with Joop, Claiborne Mango or Cuba Prestige for example. If you are sensitive to coloring choose the sandalwood variety which is about equally effective and works well with more herbal or drier scents.</li>
            <li> It came highly recommended and works great for me.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I have THE most sensitive skin in the world,  I hate it,  but this stuff works really great on it, and I really like the smell, which isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Geo F Trumper Coral Skin Food for about 2 years now and for me it works better than the stuff Ive picked up at the local CVS or Duane Reade.  A little goes a long way, I use it pre shave and post shave it calms my face without leaving it greasy and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have not had any razor burn since adding this to my regimen.</li>
            <li> This has a unique smell that&#x27;s hard to put in words but I would say it smells like edible plastic.  It feels real good and cool when it goes on the skin, I really love this product.</li>
            <li> My son loves this stuff - the scent is very appealing.This does not break out your skin. The hint of scent left on the skin is very inviting almost sexy...This bottle lasts a very long time since you only use a dab.</li>
            <li> I cant shave without it! Skin food has become a vital component of my straight razor routine. If you have sensitive skin and haven&#x27;t tried this yet, it&#x27;s definately worth the price! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I made the switch over to a double-sided butterfly razor instead of the Mach3/4/5/6/x razors.  It was an excellent decision, both economically and practically, but one thing the MachX razors do really well is minimize razor burn.    I recently purchased this as a follow-up to the Geo F. Trumper Essence of Limes aftershave.  The same sized bottle (and a tub of the shaving cream) lasted me about a year, and I shave my whole head (barring eyebrows of course).  As someone with a tough beard and REALLY sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve always dreaded shaving, but this aftershave is AMAZING at cooling my skin after shaving so close to the skin that my dome is baby-soft.    Regardless of how you like to shave, you should give this stuff a whirl.  It seems expensive at first, but it will last you three times longer than most of the store-bought crap I&#x27;ve used over the course of my life, and it&#x27;s quality stuff.</li>
            <li> The single greatest after shave in existence. Once you use this you&#x27;ll never go back. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and every time I try something &amp;#34;new and great&amp;#34; I go back to Coral Skin Food!!</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my face after applying this to my face, has a nice unobtrusive scent.  Does not give a sting, as many aftershaves are supposed to do, right?  But my skin has never showed ill effects after shaving, so it is working perhaps?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my Geo F Trumper Skin Food bottle almost empty, and thinking I needed to be getting a &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; from my aftershave after shaving, I got some Clubman Pinaud aftershave splash, for the sting and the scent.  Wow a big &amp;#34;STING&amp;#34;, and a strong scent at first.  But the scent does not linger as its gone after 15 minutes, on me.  There is no difference in my skin after using the Clubman Pinaud and the Coral Skin Food.  So I will be reordering this Geo. Trumper Coral Skin Food soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am taking off one star because I feel the price is a little high, for the size of bottle.</li>
            <li> Great product for my skin!</li>
            <li> Like this although I think I still like Baxter&#x27;s of CA the best. This is a close second, though. And, like Baxter&#x27;s, not greasy which is what I like.</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff. Leaves my skin feeling great after a spirited bout with my DE razor. A must have!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased the product after being unsatisfied with a few other after shave lotions.  It is like a gel with a nice (yet not overly strong) scent.  It really only takes a drop or two to cover my neck and face.  I enjoy the skin food so well I have suggested to all my friends..</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for its rave reviews from men and their experiences using it post shave, despite the color.  It has a very feminine smell and leaves your face and hands sticky.  These are two qualities a man should not be receiving or looking for in an after shave product and should not be caught in public exhibiting.  I have since returned to my Art of Shaving after shave balm while passing along the Coral Skin Food to a girl friend of mine.  So far she is not too impressed either.  Needless to say I&#x27;ll be steering clear of this line of product in the future.</li>
            <li> Been using this product for over 8 years and I love it. Nothing better for  your skin after you shave than this product. Comes in additional scents (Lime and Sandalwood) but I love this scent the best. I&#x27;ve tried all the other products in the market that claim to be great for your skin but none can top the way this makes your skin feel and how protected it feels after use. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This a terrific \\&quot;soothing preparation for after shaving\\&quot;. I typically apply this after using with hazel using a small dab. It smells great, is very lightweight and refreshing and is suprisingly moisturizing even when used in very small quantities. The price is high but this bottle lasts a very very long time. Try it out.</li>
            <li> Love the moisturizing from this product.  Very soothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had heard excellent things about the Coral Skin Food, and it lived up to all expectations.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff! Slightly strong smell so use just a little. I combine it with other aftershave balms to good result: I use with TOBS Jermyn St, and T&amp;H 1805 balms and the combination is my new favorite scent.</li>
            <li> The efficacy of this product is first-rate.  I use a little prior to shaving and then a little more after shaving, and it&#x27;s a great experience.  It lubricates my face for pre-shave and moisturizes post-shave, without being oily or leaving me feeling sticky or dry.  The fragrance is quite floral, and I still don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve gotten used to that, but it somehow still manages to be pleasant and surprisingly masculine.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Tightens up your face after shaving. I like the clean and smooth feel after I have used it.  Quickly loses the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; so it is perfect for use before splashing on your favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> My morning shaving ritual starts with a hot wash cloth, followed by a \\&quot;lathering up\\&quot; with a quality soap (I like \\&quot;The Art of Shaving\\&quot; and \\&quot;Truefitt &amp; Hill\\&quot; shaving cream) applied with a pure badger shaving brush.  I use a \\&quot;Merkur\\&quot; \\&quot;Futur\\&quot; safety razor (if you are using a DE razor, don&#x27;t waste your money on Merkur blades.  \\&quot;Feather\\&quot; blades are the only way to go.  They are extremely sharp and I can get two or three additional shaves out of one blade),so when I am done, my face is ready for a soothing after-shave balm.  I&#x27;ve used \\&quot;Geo F. Trumpers\\&quot; \\&quot;Coral Skin Food\\&quot; and \\&quot;The Art of Shavings\\&quot; after-shave balms for years and they are both equally as good and both go a long way.  I&#x27;ve strayed here and there over the years, but I have always come back to the \\&quot;tried and proven\\&quot;!  Hope that this review helps...</li>
            <li> great pre and after shave ,really helps on my skin burn</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a quality product. Smells nice. I can&#x27;t narrow down exactly what the smell reminds me of but it&#x27;s a citrus sort of smell. Anyway it is a good product but EXTREMELY overpriced, but hey, live and learn, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In it;s any consolation to anyone, the stuff should last a fairly long time- A little goes a long way with this stuff. Just use a dime-sized drop of it and make sure your face is still damp, it will lubricate all over your face (I know, that sounds..weird). Your face will be slippery for about 20 seconds then it&#x27;s dry and your skin is smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you you have the money to spend, and feel like impulse buying, go for it, it is quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best post shaving treatment you can get!  This &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34; type product is not greasy and has a very pleasant, clean, but subtle, smell.  Does not overpower and one can still where cologne.  One 200ml bottle lasted me over a year with almost daily use!  You only need a very small amount per shave.  Repairs any minor shaving nicks and irritations well.  Great product!</li>
            <li> If you dont know about skin food products, they are considered the in-between between a balm and a splash. Balms are generally best during the winter, since they act as a lotion and hydrate your skin, keeping you moisturized. Splashes are best during the summer, since they close the pores without causing any oiliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, ideally, this product would moisturize without getting you oily. And in reality, it totally does. It doesn&#x27;t do either of those things quite as well as they would individually, so you would be better off getting one balm and one splash for different seasons, but this product does the job almost as well and can be used all season round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$40 also seemed like a lot at first, but its a very potent product and you&#x27;ll probably only use one or two drops every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does on easy, and is only sticky for 5 or 10 seconds before becoming smooth. Actually, I&#x27;m really quite amazed at how well it dried and how smooth I became. I still like to use additional moisturizer, but this worked well nonetheless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very sweet but mild. Others I have heard found the smell FAR too strong, but it wore off quickly for me, and blended well with my cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, if you don&#x27;t want both a blam and a splash, this is a great way to go!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the bee&#x27;s knees!  I can get an excellent shave using this with a canned foam whipped up with some water. That should tell you something!  I apply liberally before I put the lather on my face and the Feather blade just glides.  The scent is a bit strange though, It doesn&#x27;t smell like a Rose cream, I get a strong scent of the ingredient Citronella, like the candles you use in the summer to ward off mosquitoes.  That being said Trumper&#x27;s Skin Food will always have a place on my shave shelf!</li>
