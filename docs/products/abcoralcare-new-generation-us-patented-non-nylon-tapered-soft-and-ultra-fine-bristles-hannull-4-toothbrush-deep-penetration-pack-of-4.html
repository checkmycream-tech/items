            <li>Excellent toothbrushes for my kids at a good price.  </li>
            <li>The abcOralCare Hannull 4 toothbrush is great.</li>
            <li>LOL.</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>These toothbrushes work great.</li>
            <li>Really good on your teeth.</li>
            <li>Perfect amount of softness yet feels as if it gets your teeth squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually experienced better results using the Hannulls in combination with DenTek interdental brushes.</li>
            <li>I love this!  </li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I think the compact size is perfect for my rather large mouth.</li>
            <li>Amazing toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Best toothbrushes that I have used so far.  </li>
            <li>The baby love the color, but it&#x27;s not the softest brush.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This cleans better and is affordable.</li>
            <li>These are fabulous!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>love the compact head.</li>
            <li>I love that it gets the plaque off in every nook and cranny.</li>
            <li>next check-up, so I can tell him all about this wonderful toothbrush.</li>
            <li>If they could make one like this but smaller, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>I feel as though it gets my teeth very clean</li>
            <li>Because the bristles are not dense the toothbrush rinses very clean after use.</li>
            <li>Size is great and theres no way your going to find brushes as soft as these in stores.</li>
            <li>Good toothbrushes for the whole family.</li>
            <li>Instead get Perio fine filament toothbrushes because they are way better than these fine filament brushes.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so soft and very effective.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a while since I started using this toothbrush, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>These are great but so super soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this brush, very high quality and comfort.</li>
            <li>These make  a huge difference in no sore gums</li>
            <li>But like I said, even if you use a light hand, they wear out so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>The whole family is loving these toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>brush again and still didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li>Dentist was amazed how clean my teeth were.  </li>
            <li>I like them so much that I gave up using my tried and true Sonicare toothbrush, a product that I used for more than a decade.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They&#x27;re nice and soft for people who have gum issues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky if I can find 1 option</li>
            <li>at one visit she noticed sudden change, and said floss better and brush more etc.  </li>
            <li>Very gentle cleaning action, love them!</li>
            <li>After a week of the new toothbrush I ordered more abc OralCare  Hannull 4 tooth brushes.</li>
            <li>Thank you to all the amazon reviewers as I&#x27;ve now found my new favorite toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>They clean my teeth very well and also clean the gum line and spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li>Super soft, yet cleans like magic.  </li>
            <li>The bristles on these are super soft, making brushing so much more efficient then</li>
            <li>bristles are arranged differently, and do an amazing job on surface buildup.  </li>
            <li>but considering what happened not cutting corners on my teeth.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle on the gums and clean teeth well.</li>
            <li>You know what, these really are special.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are nice, soft but not to soft.</li>
            <li>These really are nicer than regular brushes, and typically clean better than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s surprising they can clean as well as other soft toothbrushes although they seem to.</li>
            <li>yet is very gentle on my gums.  </li>
            <li>After just the first brushing I was hooked and ordered another 3 pks to send to my sisters and nephew.  </li>
            <li>You not only love them, but will want to tell the world and share with your family and friends.  </li>
            <li>Soft and safe for me and my young kids.</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>The first one I bought might have been super soft.</li>
            <li>Results are good , no more bleeding.</li>
            <li>Just the right size and leaves my mouth feeling extra clean.  </li>
            <li>This abcOralCare one does&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well - even though the bristles are as fine as the Perio ones, these feel like they do not go between the teeth and gums (like slippery and so ineffective), also my teeth feel still feel unclean, not slick when I swipe my tongue over my teeth after brushing like they do when I use other fine filament toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>So a very good tooth brush although not excellent.</li>
            <li>Nice large head with gentle but firm micro bristles really get between teeth.</li>
            <li>The brushes work better than my sonicare and is a helluva lot gentler, but you still need to be careful.</li>
            <li>I really like these and use with the ABC Oralcare compact head tapered bristles.  </li>
            <li>So not only do my teeth get clean, but my gums are cleaned without hurting.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and great for tender gums, especially if they are sensitive due to whitening.</li>
            <li>love these toothbrushes, they keep your mouth clean and healthy, very gentle on gums, and teeth,  would recommend these to everyone, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Let me preface this by saying that normally if I go longer than a week without flossing, when I do floss, my gums get very irritated and bleed.</li>
            <li>My gums are pretty sensitive and I have no problem with these.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and gentle on the mouth...</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>the dollar store brushes I bought were high end toothpaste brands on the box and on the brush</li>
            <li>The head was a little larger than I prefer, but overall a great deal.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the most sensitive gums, but noticed sore spots when I brushed a little too enthusiastically along my gum line.</li>
            <li>I believe l have purchased four four-packs so far.</li>
            <li>have sensitive gum</li>
            <li>My dentist told me to use compact heads and soft bristles.</li>
            <li>Turns out the local pharmacy and department stores don&#x27;t carry much of a selection in that design.</li>
            <li>Too soft though.</li>
            <li>They said they were sensitive soft.</li>
            <li>Oh, they do make my teeth feel smoother than the old brushes too.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>After I used this brush for the first time, my gums were pretty sore in a few places.</li>
            <li>The key points are that the gentle deep gum and thorough between teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li>Extra soft bristles for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>Usually, brushing along the gum line gets them clean, but it scrapes the gums a bit.  </li>
            <li>You will feel like you just came back from the Dentist&#x27;s office after a professional teeth cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Other American toothbrushes were too rough and didn&#x27;t clean between teeth well.  </li>
            <li>I wish my dentist would give these away during 6 month cleanings versus the harder oralB brushes I get normally.</li>
            <li>Wow, never knew bristles like this would make a huge difference in my gums, those other crest and aim brushes I use were thick bristles and will never use them again!</li>

            <li> it was before even with other sensitive toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> It can really get in between small areas.</li>
            <li> However, with these tooth brushes, the tips are not very thick, so they aren&#x27;t stiff enough to hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li> They were not soft .Maybe</li>
            <li> There will be other offerings by the same brand, but not the compact-soft version I like.</li>
            <li> It seemed that after time past the bristle took a soft form though.  </li>
            <li> Although I must have at least 20 brand new toothbrushes on hand, I will be stocking up on these</li>
            <li> My gums were puffy and red, but after using this for 2 days, I noticed less puffiness and cleaner feeling.  </li>
            <li> I definitely have less plaque on my floss now.</li>
            <li> The bristles were hard although it read soft.  </li>
            <li> Now, a few days later, some staining in the crevices of my bottom teeth is literally disappearing.</li>
            <li> In between my Hannull 4 purchases I tried their extra-soft version with the black bristles (the bristles were anti-bacterial or something).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I knew that it was doing some serious deep cleaning.</li>
            <li> you probably will notice less &amp;#</li>
            <li> and my gums got WORSE at the next visit!  </li>
            <li> the head was not as compact and the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; bristles were very stiff.</li>
            <li> I ended up mashing the bristles in to my gum-line and brushing too hard.  </li>
            <li> The bristles were too hard.</li>
            <li> In the beginning this tooth brush seemed too hard.  </li>
            <li> The head is compact size which is can be hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I mean, how can a toothbrush make your gums sore?</li>
            <li> but something is very wrong with them and feel this has hurt my dental future.  </li>
            <li> Wow, you will not be disappointed if you just try this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> It still works just as well at cleaning as tough bristles too.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was shocked because I was NOT expecting that!</li>

            <li> I only order my toothbrushes online now. Nylon-bristled toothbrushes are the only thing in the stores and given out by our dentists.  Nylon scratches the gums and does not get in at the gum line well enough.  Since we switched we have cleaner teeth and healthier gums.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes have become my all time favorites. They clean my teeth very well and also clean the gum line and spaces between teeth. I believe l have purchased four four-packs so far.</li>
            <li> The baby love the color, but it&#x27;s not the softest brush.&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive gum</li>
            <li> Not that impressed.  Had to floss after brushing then brush again and still didn&#x27;t feel clean.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for!!  My gums were puffy and red, but after using this for 2 days, I noticed less puffiness and cleaner feeling.  I wish my dentist would give these away during 6 month cleanings versus the harder oralB brushes I get normally. This cleans better and is affordable. I think the compact size is perfect for my rather large mouth. It can really get in between small areas.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these for years and continually have great check-ups!</li>
            <li> Good toothbrushes for the whole family. Soft and safe for me and my young kids. I recommend for adults and children.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me to use compact heads and soft bristles. Turns out the local pharmacy and department stores don&#x27;t carry much of a selection in that design. I&#x27;m lucky if I can find 1 option and then it&#x27;s like $3+ a pop. It&#x27;s only gonna be used for 3 months!  So I turned to the magics of the internets.  The abcOralCare Hannull 4 toothbrush is great. This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this pack. In between my Hannull 4 purchases I tried their extra-soft version with the black bristles (the bristles were anti-bacterial or something). Too soft though. I ended up mashing the bristles in to my gum-line and brushing too hard.  The only issue I&#x27;ve had with these toothbrushes is sometimes when I need them I can&#x27;t find them listed on Amazon. There will be other offerings by the same brand, but not the compact-soft version I like. That&#x27;s how I ended up getting their extra-soft version once.  ***Update: The pack ran out so I tried a toothbrush I bought at the store and the head was not as compact and the &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; bristles were very stiff. Why did I even bother? After a week of the new toothbrush I ordered more abc OralCare  Hannull 4 tooth brushes. ***</li>
            <li> I love this!  I feel as though it gets my teeth very clean yet is very gentle on my gums.  Because the bristles are not dense the toothbrush rinses very clean after use.Although I must have at least 20 brand new toothbrushes on hand, I will be stocking up on these</li>
            <li> These are fabulous! Nice large head with gentle but firm micro bristles really get between teeth. I&#x27;m spoiled - never going back to regular toothbrushes. I stopped using my Sonicare, too.  Gave a pack to my parents and their dental hygienist asked what they&#x27;re doing differently; they had no plaque at their last checkups! And my dad&#x27;s gums have stopped receding.</li>
            <li> Would not get theses again. The bristles were too hard. They said they were sensitive soft. They were not soft .Maybe it was my fault. The first one I bought might have been super soft.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted for softness. The head was a little larger than I prefer, but overall a great deal.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet.  Needed some extras for the kids and this is the only four pack that I saw on amazon that had enough multiple colors for the kids.</li>
            <li> Wow, never knew bristles like this would make a huge difference in my gums, those other crest and aim brushes I use were thick bristles and will never use them again! These make  a huge difference in no sore gums</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but the bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> After I used this brush for the first time, my gums were pretty sore in a few places. I was amazed by that! I mean, how can a toothbrush make your gums sore? LOL. That&#x27;s when I knew that it was doing some serious deep cleaning. Now, a few days later, some staining in the crevices of my bottom teeth is literally disappearing. I think it&#x27;s a combination of this toothbrush and the ClayBrite Extra Toothpaste that I&#x27;ve been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/29/2014 UPDATE: It&#x27;s been a while since I started using this toothbrush, and it&#x27;s still going strong. I decided to try flossing my teeth, since I haven&#x27;t done so since I got this toothbrush. Let me preface this by saying that normally if I go longer than a week without flossing, when I do floss, my gums get very irritated and bleed. Well, no irritation or bleeding this time! I was shocked because I was NOT expecting that!</li>
            <li> Dentist was amazed how clean my teeth were.  Other American toothbrushes were too rough and didn&#x27;t clean between teeth well.  The key points are that the gentle deep gum and thorough between teeth cleaning.</li>
            <li> In the beginning this tooth brush seemed too hard.  The bristles were hard although it read soft.  It did not meet my expectation initially.  It seemed that after time past the bristle took a soft form though.  So a very good tooth brush although not excellent.</li>
            <li> But they wear out so fast.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re nice and soft for people who have gum issues. But like I said, even if you use a light hand, they wear out so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Good price, though.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> The best toothbrush on earth!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I absolutely love it. The head is compact size which is can be hard to find in stores. The bristles are very soft and great for tender gums, especially if they are sensitive due to whitening. It still works just as well at cleaning as tough bristles too. Best toothbrush I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Squigle toothpaste....a wonderful combination for those of us who suffer from canker sores.  Very soft and gentle on the mouth...love the compact head. Give these a try...you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrushes for my kids at a good price.  Would definitely recommend to anyone!  That&#x27;s all I have to say.</li>
            <li> Very gentle cleaning action, love them!</li>
            <li> Love these! Really good on your teeth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the most sensitive gums, but noticed sore spots when I brushed a little too enthusiastically along my gum line. I love that it gets the plaque off in every nook and cranny. I definitely have less plaque on my floss now. The brushes work better than my sonicare and is a helluva lot gentler, but you still need to be careful.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great, especially good if you have a lot of surface plaque.  bristles are arranged differently, and do an amazing job on surface buildup.  I really like these and use with the ABC Oralcare compact head tapered bristles.  Excellent.</li>
            <li> These are great but so super soft It&#x27;s surprising they can clean as well as other soft toothbrushes although they seem to.</li>
            <li> love these toothbrushes, they keep your mouth clean and healthy, very gentle on gums, and teeth,  would recommend these to everyone, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ll never buy another brand/type again.  Perfect amount of softness yet feels as if it gets your teeth squeaky clean.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perfect. The bristles are nice, soft but not to soft.</li>
            <li> These brushes have helped my gums!  The dollar store tooth brushes listed as &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; have IMO caused my gums to recede.  My dentist tracks the recession of my gums at every visit.  at one visit she noticed sudden change, and said floss better and brush more etc.  I did that for 6 months... and my gums got WORSE at the next visit!  so i did some research and I saw these on amazon and bought based on reviews. Started using these and my recession has actually stopped!  and my gums are no longer sore.  the dollar store brushes I bought were high end toothpaste brands on the box and on the brush but something is very wrong with them and feel this has hurt my dental future.  so I will be buying these abc ones now on. I would say I wish they were as low cost as the ones at the dollar store but considering what happened not cutting corners on my teeth.  Oh, they do make my teeth feel smoother than the old brushes too.</li>
            <li> These are the best toothbrushes that I&#x27;ve ever used.  They are gentle on the gums and clean teeth well.</li>
            <li> You know what, these really are special.  Usually, brushing along the gum line gets them clean, but it scrapes the gums a bit.  However, with these tooth brushes, the tips are not very thick, so they aren&#x27;t stiff enough to hurt my gums.  So not only do my teeth get clean, but my gums are cleaned without hurting.  These really are nicer than regular brushes, and typically clean better than my Sonicare.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the toothbrushes and will continue to order them. Size is great and theres no way your going to find brushes as soft as these in stores.</li>
            <li> Amazing toothbrush. Makes my teeth feel great!</li>
            <li> 1.5 *s - Skip these abcOralCare toothbrushes. Instead get Perio fine filament toothbrushes because they are way better than these fine filament brushes. This abcOralCare one does&#x27;t feel like it cleans as well - even though the bristles are as fine as the Perio ones, these feel like they do not go between the teeth and gums (like slippery and so ineffective), also my teeth feel still feel unclean, not slick when I swipe my tongue over my teeth after brushing like they do when I use other fine filament toothbrushes.I think I will give this pack away and repurchase the Dr. Collins ones.</li>
            <li> Wow, you will not be disappointed if you just try this toothbrush.  Super soft, yet cleans like magic.  You will feel like you just came back from the Dentist&#x27;s office after a professional teeth cleaning.  No exaggeration, plus the next morning you probably will notice less &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34;.  After just the first brushing I was hooked and ordered another 3 pks to send to my sisters and nephew.  You not only love them, but will want to tell the world and share with your family and friends.  I&#x27;m actually looking forward to wowing my dental hygienist next check-up, so I can tell him all about this wonderful toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this brush, very high quality and comfort. I showed one to my dentist  and he is ordering them for his office.</li>
            <li> These toothbrushes work great. I like them so much that I gave up using my tried and true Sonicare toothbrush, a product that I used for more than a decade. I&#x27;ve actually experienced better results using the Hannulls in combination with DenTek interdental brushes.</li>
            <li> I prefer the smaller heads but I like the shape of the heads on these. If they could make one like this but smaller, it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Extra soft bristles for sensitive teeth. Results are good , no more bleeding.</li>
            <li> Wow. The whole family is loving these toothbrushes.  They&#x27;re so soft and very effective.  Thank you to all the amazon reviewers as I&#x27;ve now found my new favorite toothbrush.  Just the right size and leaves my mouth feeling extra clean.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes that I have used so far.  My gums are pretty sensitive and I have no problem with these.  The bristles on these are super soft, making brushing so much more efficient then it was before even with other sensitive toothbrushes.</li>
