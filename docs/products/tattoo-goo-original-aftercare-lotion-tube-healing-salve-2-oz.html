            <li>I really liked using this lotion after being tattooed.</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best tattoo lotion I have used - will be buying it again.  </li>
            <li>The salve works great and is a good moisturizer, but this is a totally different story.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks plumped up, healthy and it doesn&#x27;t stink/irritate</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably buy more just for those babies.</li>

            <li>Works better than anything else for me.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff, speeds up the healing process for us.</li>
            <li>i love this stuff</li>
            <li>They use the finest ingredients money can buy and have gone from a boutique start up to the most respected name in Tattoo and piercing after care in the world.</li>
            <li>I love the way my tats look within seconds after applying tattoo goo :)</li>
            <li>Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li>Great stuff, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Great product to use in healing a new tattoo.</li>
            <li>I have a LOT of tattoo&#x27;s and Tattoo Goo lotion is an excellent product for keeping them looking sharp.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and promoted smooth healing.  </li>
            <li>Its only 5 bucks too witch is nice and it helps heal the tattoo nicely.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a thicker product try the Original Tattoo Goo in a tin.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t compare it to other products, but I will say that this stuff is pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>Ok so I got my first set of this stuff at Wallyworld and</li>
            <li>My first application of the tattoo goo, no smell no shine and my tat has no peeling Love</li>
            <li>Great on new tattoos but also brightens older ones.</li>
            <li>Also since my skin absorbed it easily I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my shirt sticking to my tatoo.</li>
            <li>simply the best stuff on the market for new and old Tattoos!!!!!</li>
            <li>wow, no itching, didn&#x27;t get sore, and has kept my new ink looking so great.  </li>
            <li>I now use Tattoo Goo on a daily basis and it keeps the color looking bright and fresh without clogging my pores.</li>
            <li>The lotion is thinner and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It works great for keeping tattoos moisturized without a threat of damage from scents and other chemicals, but is a bit greasy and washes off much too easy.</li>
            <li>Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li>I have had a great experience with all of the Tattoo Goo products that i have tried so far and will use no other products on my ink.  </li>
            <li>,just didnt think it was worth what i paid for.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have about 18 hrs worth of tattoos on me</li>
            <li>, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel oily, it goes on clear and smooth, dries relatively quickly but keeps the tattoo looking and feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I believe this product is helpful to maintene the color vivid and smooth yous sking with the neccessary nutrients.</li>
            <li>I got my first tattoo about 18 years ago and my most recent session was a couple of weeks ago.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that I need to reapply pretty often.  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a better daily Lotion for my ink and skin</li>
            <li>that something I really try to avoid!</li>
            <li>Tattoo Goo was  recommended by my tattoo artist upon getting my first tattoo ever.</li>
            <li>currently, i have used many aftercare products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many different kinds</li>
            <li>Used it only once so far, but I really liked it.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this product and other Tattoo Goo products in the past and have always been more than happy...</li>
            <li>It smells nice, and makes the color in my tat look nice for awhile, but the moisture doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  </li>
            <li>Its really helped speed up the the healing process as well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care for the smell to much either.</li>
            <li>It also really helped with healing time and quality</li>
            <li>It really helps to heal the tattoo after getting one.</li>
            <li>Helps speed up the healing process, and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Gentle lotion that&#x27;s been proven</li>
            <li>I just started using this product, but it really does work.  </li>
            <li>First of all it smells and it attracts alot of unwanted attention to the new tat from it shining so damn much.</li>
            <li>It helped to heal the new tattoos I did and made the older tattoos look like new!!!</li>
            <li>Tattoo Goo skin care lotion is incredibly rich in Humectants and essential oils.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ready for the new tattoo on Monday.</li>
            <li>I will use this daily and buy more when I get my next tattoo.</li>
            <li>It does not heal any faster than normal lotion.</li>
            <li>This is pretty much a travel size bottle, you can easily get double or tipple for less.</li>
            <li>This product is free of fragrance, alcohol, and the other things one is supposed to avoid with a new tattoo.  </li>
            <li>Beats Aquaphor and A &amp; D ointment to help new tattoos heal well.</li>
            <li>Both products keep my tattoo looking new..</li>
            <li>I think using both of these routinely helped me heal more quickly, plus there is some peace of mind in using something created or at least packaged for this specific use.</li>
            <li>I picked up a tube of Goo after getting my first (and second!)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tattoo Goo helps new ink heal and revitalizes old ink.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li>And Thirdly, It contains an ingredient dimethicone, which is a natural rubber latex, meaning, IF YOU&#x27;RE SENSITIVE TO LATEX, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!</li>
            <li>I bought an extra tube of this from amazon instead of buying a whole new kit.  </li>
            <li>I had a large back piece done and was sore.</li>
            <li>My husband myself and 2 of my adult children tried this</li>
            <li>It made them so soft.</li>
            <li>It keeps your skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency-- not greasy, not too thick, no odd medicinal smell, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.  </li>
            <li>It would be worth it if it actually made tattoo colors more vibrant, but it fails in that department as well.</li>
            <li>My tatts are small and I can put a tiny dot on each one and smooth it out.</li>
            <li>to not only help you new tattoo heal but enhance colors even on older tattoos that have faded from UV exposure, age and other factors.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using A&amp;D ointment on my half sleeve for the first two weeks.</li>
            <li>My tattoo is brighter and clearer and not dry.</li>
            <li>If you get the kit you can use the little tin can to upkeep your tattoos and keep them looking fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>The thicker lotions were harder to rub in whereas the tattoo goo lotion wasn&#x27;t too thick and seemed to penetrate easily.</li>
            <li>I was putting this on my ink and got a little too much</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was putting this on my ink and got a little too much</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this is possible, but it literally feels dry after I rub it in.  </li>
            <li> this stuff is a tattoo saver especially during the winter months and my legs get so dry.</li>
            <li> It goes on watery and instantly makes your skin feel dry.</li>
            <li> didnt, like this,, felt very dry after applying, i rather stick to regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Second, it&#x27;s not very moisturizing, it tends to make your tattoos dry and scaly while healing.</li>
            <li> The other couple days I use the actual tattoo goo in a can.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, light enough that you can put clothes over it without getting them dirty.</li>
            <li> The lotion&#x27;s consistency is about the same as the average hand and face lotion.</li>
            <li> I have bad skin and break out and dry out easily.</li>
            <li> First off, this is too expensive for quantity.</li>

            <li> I read up on their website, talked to my tat artist and other people with tattoos.</li>
            <li> and there is nothing worse then the itch of a new tattoo combined with a reaction itch.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the few dollars just to ensure you look after what could be an expensive piece.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that this lotion is rather thin and watery.  </li>
            <li> it is thin enough to easily smooth over a painful and healing tattoo.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just because it moisturizes the dead skin or</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think this was too expensive, especially compared to some of the other lotions out there.</li>
            <li> And compared to most other cosmetics and skin care items; the cost isn&#x27;t outrageous.  </li>
            <li> Moisturized well with no strong scent.</li>
            <li> I went for the lotion because of my past experience with thick products clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter so you don&#x27;t have to rub so hard to spread it out.</li>
            <li> I did use both products every day for at least two weeks after each session.</li>
            <li> This lotion just sucks.</li>
            <li> However, it is a VERY small bottle for the price. .</li>
            <li> no matter what I do, my elbows are crazy dry.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s thin.</li>
            <li> Used it 2-3 times per day and never experienced any scabbing or peeling.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I found I was allergic to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this now on a small tat and on 1/4 of a sleeve, and both times I thought it was awful.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like oily lotion that feels greasy with an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Smells bad too.</li>
            <li> It does not work and it smells real bad!</li>

            <li> The best stuff ever for tattoos. I have 4 &amp; won&#x27;t use anything else. Smells delicious!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the salve in a tin.  The salve works great and is a good moisturizer, but this is a totally different story.  I&#x27;ve tried this now on a small tat and on 1/4 of a sleeve, and both times I thought it was awful.  For me, it actually seems like it dries out the area.  I have no idea how this is possible, but it literally feels dry after I rub it in.  I swear by the Tattoo Goo wash, and the salve is very good, but this stuff does not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> didnt, like this,, felt very dry after applying, i rather stick to regular lotion.,just didnt think it was worth what i paid for.</li>
            <li> One of the best products to help heal a fresh tattoo.  Would use it again and recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> I got my first tattoo about 18 years ago and my most recent session was a couple of weeks ago. Throughout the years I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of products from Vaseline to A&amp;D ointment and Tattoo Goo Lotion is the absolute best. I tried Tattoo Goo after A&amp;D ointment clogged my pores causing a bunch of ingrown hairs on my forearm. I now use Tattoo Goo on a daily basis and it keeps the color looking bright and fresh without clogging my pores. Its really helped speed up the the healing process as well. The lotion&#x27;s consistency is about the same as the average hand and face lotion. If you&#x27;re looking for a thicker product try the Original Tattoo Goo in a tin. I went for the lotion because of my past experience with thick products clogging my pores.</li>
            <li> My husband myself and 2 of my adult children tried this and we didn&#x27;t care for it. After using it my son and I got a rash so we stopped using it. I didn&#x27;t care for the smell to much either.</li>
            <li> this was a very good product and it helped my tattoo stop itching during the healing process i am very pleased</li>
            <li> I like the tattoo goo the best bc it is thin enough to easily smooth over a painful and healing tattoo.  It also really helped with healing time and quality</li>
            <li> I really liked using this lotion after being tattooed. I had a large back piece done and was sore. The thicker lotions were harder to rub in whereas the tattoo goo lotion wasn&#x27;t too thick and seemed to penetrate easily. Also since my skin absorbed it easily I didn&#x27;t have to worry about my shirt sticking to my tatoo. I used this along with the tattoo goo soap and had no problems. I did use both products every day for at least two weeks after each session. I think using both of these routinely helped me heal more quickly, plus there is some peace of mind in using something created or at least packaged for this specific use. I didn&#x27;t think this was too expensive, especially compared to some of the other lotions out there.</li>
            <li> I picked up a tube of Goo after getting my first (and second!) tattoo about a week ago. I can&#x27;t compare it to other products, but I will say that this stuff is pretty awesome. Yes, it&#x27;s thin. But I happen to like that. My tatts are small and I can put a tiny dot on each one and smooth it out. My skin looks plumped up, healthy and it doesn&#x27;t stink/irritate/grease me up. Bonus: no matter what I do, my elbows are crazy dry. I was putting this on my ink and got a little too much so I thought, &#x27;What the heck?!&#x27; and put it on my elbows. Holy smokes! It made them so soft. I&#x27;ll probably buy more just for those babies.</li>
            <li> This product is free of fragrance, alcohol, and the other things one is supposed to avoid with a new tattoo.  It does what it claims.  If nothing else you have a good lotion.  It&#x27;s worth the few dollars just to ensure you look after what could be an expensive piece.</li>
            <li> This is great to help keep your skin from drying out. I have bad skin and break out and dry out easily. This stuff works well without removing any of the color</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find that this lotion is rather thin and watery.  I&#x27;ve found that I need to reapply pretty often.  It smells nice, and makes the color in my tat look nice for awhile, but the moisture doesn&#x27;t last long enough.  I prefer Ink Fixx Tattoo Lotion.</li>
            <li> First off, this is too expensive for quantity. This is pretty much a travel size bottle, you can easily get double or tipple for less. Second, it&#x27;s not very moisturizing, it tends to make your tattoos dry and scaly while healing. And Thirdly, It contains an ingredient dimethicone, which is a natural rubber latex, meaning, IF YOU&#x27;RE SENSITIVE TO LATEX, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!! The company who makes this is just trying to make money off you, you dont need this lotion!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> In the 22 years of being tattooed I have yet to find a better daily Lotion for my ink and skin&lt;br /&gt;Love is love with this product I just beg that TATTOO GOO makes a larger size! I go through atleast one bottle a week.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Tattoo Goo aftercare lotion, this was great!! It really helps to heal the tattoo after getting one. It soothes the area of the tattoo without making it itch or burn..Love this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is the best place to buy it if you are not trying to get it in bulk. This is the best deal.&lt;br /&gt;Tattoo Goo helps new ink heal and revitalizes old ink.&lt;br /&gt;A definite must have</li>
            <li> Great product to use in healing a new tattoo. Also brings color back into tattoos after one&#x27;s skin dries out. I will use this daily and buy more when I get my next tattoo. Beats Aquaphor and A &amp; D ointment to help new tattoos heal well. Not greasy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best tattoo lotion I have used - will be buying it again.  Great on new tattoos but also brightens older ones.</li>
            <li> Just use regular cream. It has the same effects. 3 dollars for such a small bottle. Smells bad too. Ew.</li>
            <li> It does not work and it smells real bad! I&#x27;ve got darker because of it and that something I really try to avoid!</li>
            <li> I do permanent makeup for a living, and this is the best after care to use on the area</li>
            <li> I have 12t tattoos and used this on each one. Keeps  your tattoos looking like knew.  I use this on my  tattoos for years now .  A must have for anybody with a tattoo. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It works great for keeping tattoos moisturized without a threat of damage from scents and other chemicals, but is a bit greasy and washes off much too easy. Had to keep reapplying it.</li>
            <li> Works better than anything else for me. I&#x27;m ready for the new tattoo on Monday.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of tattoo&#x27;s and Tattoo Goo lotion is an excellent product for keeping them looking sharp.  This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff, speeds up the healing process for us.</li>
            <li> Helps speed up the healing process, and absorbs fast. However, it is a VERY small bottle for the price. .</li>
            <li> I believe this product is helpful to maintene the color vivid and smooth yous sking with the neccessary nutrients. Great</li>
            <li> Tattoo goo skincare lotion is amazing stuff!! It helped to heal the new tattoos I did and made the older tattoos look like new!!! I have ordered this product and other Tattoo Goo products in the past and have always been more than happy...simply the best stuff on the market for new and old Tattoos!!!!!</li>
            <li> brings my tattoos to life no matter what their age i love this stuff</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product!  Tattoo Goo was  recommended by my tattoo artist upon getting my first tattoo ever. I have had a great experience with all of the Tattoo Goo products that i have tried so far and will use no other products on my ink.  I love the consistency-- not greasy, not too thick, no odd medicinal smell, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothes.  It keeps your skin soft and supple. Easy to use and promoted smooth healing.  It is the perfect product line for the first timer..  And compared to most other cosmetics and skin care items; the cost isn&#x27;t outrageous.  Afterall;  a tattoo is a lifetime commitment  and I believe that my skin deserves the best.  They can take you thru  all aspects of daily care  from washing to  sunscreen --  another advantage to sticking with a brand that strives for total care.</li>
            <li> Loved the goo. Used it 2-3 times per day and never experienced any scabbing or peeling. It also helped with itching. My tattoo looks amazing!</li>
            <li> As soon as I put this on my tattoo, I can immediately see the difference in color. My tattoo is brighter and clearer and not dry. Perfect traveling size. Keep one in my car for just in case situations.</li>
            <li> Needs to have bigger tubes</li>
            <li> This lotion is all around terrible. From the scent to the consistancy. It&#x27;s like oily lotion that feels greasy with an unpleasant smell. It would be worth it if it actually made tattoo colors more vibrant, but it fails in that department as well.</li>
            <li> I use this 4-5 times a week, but only once a day when used. The other couple days I use the actual tattoo goo in a can. Both products keep my tattoo looking new.. Good stuff..</li>
            <li> After reading about how a&amp;d ointment and neosporin can pull your color out I started checking thia brand out. I read up on their website, talked to my tat artist and other people with tattoos. The Goo in the tin is thicker and gets stuck to clothing easier. The lotion is thinner and dries quickly. It&#x27;s lighter so you don&#x27;t have to rub so hard to spread it out. I like how it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and a tube only cost five bucks at the tat shop. Plus if my artist uses it himself why shouldn&#x27;t i?</li>
            <li> Great product none greasy and easy to use for the healing process.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to rub a lot for the lotion to absorb into the tattoo which prevents damage and it keeps it moist for a while. Wouldn&#x27;t order from this seller though, they take forever to ship your things.</li>
            <li> Tattoo Goo is great for tattoos, I should know, I have 7 and always use it on mine. I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Tattoo Goo skin care lotion is incredibly rich in Humectants and essential oils. It literally \\&quot;melts\\&quot; into your skin, isn&#x27;t greasy an promotes healing while preventing loss of ink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a Gentle lotion that&#x27;s been proven to not only help you new tattoo heal but enhance colors even on older tattoos that have faded from UV exposure, age and other factors. All Tattoo Goo products are sourced from the world over. They use the finest ingredients money can buy and have gone from a boutique start up to the most respected name in Tattoo and piercing after care in the world.</li>
            <li> Ok so I got my first set of this stuff at Wallyworld and wow, no itching, didn&#x27;t get sore, and has kept my new ink looking so great.  I bought an extra tube of this from amazon instead of buying a whole new kit.  Cannot be happier with this stuff.</li>
            <li> This product made my husband and myself break out in the area of application. The Tattoo Goo Salve however works great and not issues. Must be an ingredient in the lotion that clogs the pours or something.</li>
            <li> this stuff is a tattoo saver especially during the winter months and my legs get so dry. I love the way my tats look within seconds after applying tattoo goo :)</li>
            <li> makes my tattoos color brighter. i don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s just because it moisturizes the dead skin or what but it works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using A&amp;D ointment on my half sleeve for the first two weeks. First of all it smells and it attracts alot of unwanted attention to the new tat from it shining so damn much. My first application of the tattoo goo, no smell no shine and my tat has no peeling Love it</li>
            <li> This is amazing. Its only 5 bucks too witch is nice and it helps heal the tattoo nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or anything. I definitely recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> I have about 18 hrs worth of tattoos on me currently, i have used many aftercare products. This lotion just sucks. It goes on watery and instantly makes your skin feel dry. Not what you want to feel after a tattoo. It does not heal any faster than normal lotion. I recommend aveeno baby lotion. It works wonders. Dont buy into this gimick.</li>
            <li> Used it only once so far, but I really liked it. Not greasy, light enough that you can put clothes over it without getting them dirty. Shipping was very fast!</li>
            <li> Moisturized well with no strong scent.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
            <li> Awesome product, fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, but it really does work.  I ordered the numbing stuff and that didn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> I have friends that rave about this product.  Unfortunately I found I was allergic to it and there is nothing worse then the itch of a new tattoo combined with a reaction itch.</li>
            <li> Best tattoo care lotion ever. I&#x27;ve used so many different kinds but this one doesn&#x27;t leave residue, it doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel oily, it goes on clear and smooth, dries relatively quickly but keeps the tattoo looking and feeling fresh. If you get the kit you can use the little tin can to upkeep your tattoos and keep them looking fresh for a long time. I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this on all my present tattoo&#x27;s, helps the color to stand out</li>
