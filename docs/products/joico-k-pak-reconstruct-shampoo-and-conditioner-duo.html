            <li>I bought joico in a salon and loved it.  </li>
            <li>good clean-smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li>They have the best prices and free shipping.</li>
            <li>Joico KPack always brings the good out in my locks.</li>
            <li>hair loved it.</li>
            <li>But the point is neither are any good, and both should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>To be fair, please note that I am also using the Joico K-pak split-end mender, Moroccan argan oil, and TRESemme heat styling spray in my hair as well.</li>
            <li>So use it with with a good moisturizing set for your softness.</li>
            <li>Good luck ladies.</li>
            <li>I gave this shampoo and conditioner a fair chance, about a month or so of use.</li>
            <li>and I knew I needed to invest on good shampoo&amp;conditioner.</li>
            <li>it smells good and makes your hair appear healthier</li>
            <li>The hair stylist used this product on my hair and I loved it</li>
            <li>Always a good idea.</li>
            <li>I buy Salon Selectives for a $1 and it works as good as this Joyco product.</li>
            <li>I am going to consult my hair dresser for a recommendation on what is as good as this product used to be.</li>
            <li>Priced good and will buy again</li>
            <li>It worked good for a while</li>
            <li>But when I curl it, it&#x27;s gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>Really good Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li>I loved how this made my hair feel.</li>
            <li>Works good and products stands well.</li>
            <li>Super affordable, though maybe not the best product for my fine/processed/color treated hair.</li>
            <li>That stuff smells heavenly, makes your hair super shiny and sleek, and is great for your hair!</li>
            <li>Love this brand!</li>
            <li>Love this brand!</li>

            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite shampoo and conditioner pair!</li>
            <li>Glad I did!</li>
            <li>I just wanted a working pump-nothing more!</li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>Love my hair!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner!</li>
            <li>It has been safe for my color-treated hair!</li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really amazing the way it leaves your hair feeling.</li>
            <li>I feel I should write a review to clarify some things about this set.&lt;br /&gt;First off, this price is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product, and the price on amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li>Its amazing .</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>It works so good on my grand daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li>This set is a nice size and price.  </li>
            <li>It smells ok and is fairly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I use this 1-2/week and love how good my hair feels afterward.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my hair kind of straw like.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesnt smell as nice</li>
            <li>I have REAL JOICO products and they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>, I really needed something to help with breakage, I&#x27;m very happy with this and the price.  </li>
            <li>like to dry my hair and this product is perfect, the look is always beautiful.</li>
            <li>it cost me about 4 CENTS PER DAY to have clean and manageable hair, and a great looking shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed an incredible difference in the strengthening of my hair, and I&#x27;ve also noticed I haven&#x27;t had nearly as much breakage as I use too!</li>
            <li>Excellent product I&#x27;ve been using for years and normally pay $90 for the shampoo, conditioner and styling gel.  </li>
            <li>By far the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair strong and feeling like silk!</li>
            <li>Excellent product by far I have tried so many and this one is just by far the best one in the market!</li>
            <li>Was happy that Amazon had such great deals on this product, because nothing works as well for his straight-plus-curly-hair combo except this product.</li>
            <li>There is a very light hint</li>
            <li>Just like the ones at the Hair Salon at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>Have been using these for years and love them.</li>
            <li>When I recieved the bottles, I would have figured the sender would have tried to make the product better packaged</li>
            <li>In any case, I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and a great product.</li>
            <li>But shipping aside, I always love Joico products.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t help my hair look better at all</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It works great, leaves hair smelling nice, feeling soft, looking shiny.  </li>
            <li>and this is a much better price.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>So you can still enjoy volume as well!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is ok.</li>
            <li>better</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Looks fabulous when I style it and feels so nice.</li>
            <li>Love Joico shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>Overall, I think joico is a great product and smells good too.</li>
            <li>It does say its safe for colored hair</li>
            <li>and I fell In love with it.</li>
            <li>My hair is coarse and I have a lot of it this conditioner works wonders and smells great too!</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t been able to find joico products anywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m paying around $20 (per bottle) for more than 2x the amount.</li>
            <li>This was the area I was the most concerned about, and is also why I feel I should write this review.</li>
            <li>These bottles have a PUMP, like a soap dispenser, not a pop top like the picture shows; so that&#x27;s where it can lead to leakage.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with how it was packaged and shipped, so if anything I&#x27;d recommend having this fulfilled by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>All in all, I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is one more thing</li>
            <li>(I condition more than shampoo)</li>
            <li>I still feel I got the most for my money.</li>
            <li>Took forever to  arrive but love the product.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner and you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Only bummer is that the seller didn&#x27;t do the best job with packaging and some of the shampoo had leaked into the package.</li>
            <li>I was introduced to this shampoo and conditioner by my stylist and immediately fell in love.  </li>
            <li>When it came time to purchase more, I immediately came to amazon.com to see if I could get it cheaper.  </li>
            <li>I hope this helps someone! :)</li>
            <li>I applied the shampoo, and enjoyed the smell (the stylist stated that it has the smell of pina colodas...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s healthy and I color my hair every 5 weeks</li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s some better stuff out there.</li>
            <li>Shampoo bottle wasl  damaged/crushed on top.  </li>
            <li>Ships on time, love this product.</li>
            <li>in most over the counter shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love them and would recommend them</li>
            <li>Then I immediately bought these :)</li>
            <li>This has always been, and will always be, my favorite shampoo/conditioner duo.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It really is gentle, it smells great.  </li>
            <li>This product keeps my hair looking healthy and minimizes the damage.</li>
            <li>The scent is just ok.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li>Once opened, it does not seal any more.</li>
            <li>Love this product, so nice of the seller to include a free reconstructor conditioner.</li>
            <li>sure you know the feeling.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took about a week for my hair to feel about 85% better, which is huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I already use joico color endure violet and LOVE it</li>
            <li>My hair feels like healthy virgin hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was told it would make my hair feel and look healthy again</li>
            <li>and I would love it.</li>
            <li>The price is better than elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I found the magic combination to perfect hair, finally (at 40).  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never buy anything else!! :)</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>i love it ,it&#x27;s the 3* time i bougth it</li>
            <li>recomended for many people</li>
            <li>I have used Joico K-pack for almost 5 years now and have no doubt that it&#x27;s the best product on the market out there for dry, damaged or color-processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love using this and the bottles are super large all for a great price.</li>
            <li>the best for my fine, wavy, long hair.</li>
            <li>Also, doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, very light and smells great!</li>
            <li>Or better ( genuine) quality product, period!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It smells so great, and makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>Interesting note: if you visit or are familiar with these stores- they boast both drug store and salon brands- two separate sections.  </li>
            <li>results with use.&lt;br /&gt;The pump allows easy use.</li>
            <li>so I cannot easily use this product without transferring to another container.</li>
            <li>the pumps are easy to</li>
            <li>That being said, the K-Pak shampoo is great for you if your hair is already healthy, but it works wonders for you if your hair is kind of dried out.  </li>
            <li>Also, the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t have the best smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shampoo and conditioner are just average.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These two bottles look just fine against the tile work in my shower, the product inside cleans and conditions my hair beautifully, and because I&#x27;m the only one who uses it, it LASTS TWO YEARS.  </li>
            <li>Keeps your hair smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>so I was fine to change it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loyal customer of Joico and have been for many years, will continue to sing their praises.</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo and conditioning regime for dry or color-processed hair, by far -  love this stuff, and I&#x27;ll keep ordering it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product great for dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have also experienced great results by adding a little pure tea tree oil to my shampoo.</li>
            <li>It is a joy now to wash and dry my hair which is soft and full and beautiful.</li>
            <li>The very first use I noticed a difference in my hair!</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the split ends, but whats done is done</li>
            <li>I am glad I decided to purchase, worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Joico is a fantastic product and have been using for years.  </li>
            <li>I had this order fulfilled by Amazon, that was important to me.</li>
            <li>I then distribute Joico&#x27;s Protect and Shine Serum throughout, and am happy with how the undamaged upper 50% of my hair responds to these products.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Wished the shampoo was available for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>It smelled great in the shower, but for some reason when it mixed with my hair, it stunk!</li>
            <li>Was a bit of a mess to clean up on arrival, otherwise still best shampoo/conditioner out there for the money.</li>
            <li>I should also mention that the K-pak reconstruct is safe for color-treated hair, says it right on the bottle.</li>
            <li>Very worth it</li>
            <li>I have been using these products for about a month or so, and have noticed a significant difference in the health and behavior of my once unruly hair.  </li>
            <li>It has definitely given me a better and better result over time, too, which I haven&#x27;t been able to say for anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li>I rather pay the price for original than for a knock off</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>was excited to order it online, but ...</li>
            <li>I orginally got this product rom mu hair salon at a much higher price, I love the product and price offered by this company</li>
            <li>and I was never disappointed.</li>
            <li>Totally, totally worth it!</li>
            <li>Is OK, but for VERY dry hair, it is not as good as Salerm Balsam stuff</li>
            <li>all I need a shampoo to clean it and a conditioner to soften/condition it.  </li>
            <li>Thinking I would see phenomenal results, have shiny, soft, maneagable hair, I gladly purchased the product.</li>
            <li>It was so clean and bouncy.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need anything special for my hair -</li>
            <li>The Color therapy one is special,</li>
            <li>(Which is my goal right now!)</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure that this was the real mccoy.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good value, personally.</li>
            <li>I love amazon for a lot of things, but I would wonder if these are really the salon grade products you get here?  </li>
            <li>I used this kind of shampoo before but what these people are selling is nowhere near what it should be.</li>
            <li>I took a gamble on this product based on the reviews I read here because most of them said there was some spillage during transit, but my hair is so fried and dyed it really needs some TLC.</li>
            <li>Stuffing one&#x27;s hair too full of protein, can cause snapping.</li>
            <li>I ended up ( thank God for amazon&#x27;s superior customer service ) getting all my money back and ordering from another seller just the pump.</li>
            <li>I used this very same product for years and loved it.</li>
            <li>Such a shame as before it was so good.</li>
            <li>Love this product, I have very damaged hair from hair straightening.</li>
            <li>My hair is highlighted to a very blonde shade and has a fair amount of damage.</li>
            <li>I also use Redken Extreme Anti-Snap Leave-in after too, but that has always been great.  </li>
            <li>This particular brand is my favorite.</li>
            <li>overall just more healthy.</li>
            <li>It is very popular and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>Received item very fast!</li>
            <li>Its a great product, but I have to say, for the price is not worth it.</li>
            <li>packaging was GREAT, delivery was AMAZING cause came earlier then expected and price is UNBEATABLE!</li>
            <li>I have a perfectly healthy head of hair, it&#x27;s mostly salt-and-pepper grey, it&#x27;s not colored or highlighted in any way</li>
            <li>Good product for dry and thining hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased because a friend mentioned it was good for dry hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very soft after using this and seems to be growing better</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really my go to!!</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited about getting this because I have a k-pak that I had bought at the salon at home</li>
            <li>I instantly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I have blonde hair and it is safe to say that these products have self handely saved my hair!</li>
            <li>The shampoo is fine, the conditioner is what really bothered me.  </li>
            <li>Smells fantastic but didn&#x27;t really do as much for my hair as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner does the trick, and it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li>Frankly, I expected that it will help my curly damaged hair to get a good condition</li>
            <li>I would however, say this product is better for those with natural color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although the quantity to price value is good, I will likely go with the organic/natural competitors I found previously at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>( I love how certain hairdressers love to put your hair down, just to sell you their product!), but as soon as the Stylist asked me what I used for my hair ( and I said Joico), he had absolutely NOTHING  to say to me, because he knows I&#x27;m using a very good product that used to be sold ONLY in Salons ( which is how I got introduced to it in the first place).</li>
            <li>Not the right texture, not the right color, does not smell good like kpak, and is certainly not as efficient.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right -</li>
            <li>Both bottle pumps were in the locked position, and sealed with just the right amount of tape.</li>
            <li>Because there&#x27;s a difference, right?</li>
            <li>dye my hair correctly and take very good care of it, but I wanted to find something that would reverse some minor damage from the flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have used many different professional products (Kenra, Rusk, WEN, etc) and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li>leaves hair very very very non-dry.</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I DO have, however, is a stunning remodeled bathroom that includes a tile shower that set me back THOUSANDS of dollars.  </li>
            <li>Arrived exactly how I ordered.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a much better value to buy the set than the individual products.</li>
            <li>KPack gives me back that silky feel I love to have.</li>
            <li>First time using this product.</li>
            <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>but I found something better for doing it in the same pries.</li>
            <li>and I really liked the results, but the conditioner isn&#x27;t was I expected.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s start with pricing first.</li>
            <li>to how well this product works, let me first tell you about my hair.</li>
            <li>First impression, I&#x27;m liking it though.</li>
            <li>I will also be looking into a purchasing a much better hairdryer to avoid more of the same damage in the future.</li>
            <li>I love the way this product smells, the way it makes me hair feel and especially the way it makes my hair look!</li>
            <li>The results stayed consistent.</li>
            <li>Open the envelope, Conditioner is ok, pump is in place</li>
            <li>It leaked and that is why it only got three stars I love this product and this has never happend before.</li>
            <li>and my hair does feel softer bouncier and much shinier!  </li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely manner and the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I usually buy this product from a salon as was impressed that it was of same quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Came exactly as described.</li>
            <li>thing that struck me first was the understated design of the product.</li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t bright green.</li>
            <li>NO FURTHER, if your hair can be saved, this is the shampoo and conditioner set that will be able to handle the job.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so used to conditioners working at first but then</li>
            <li>my hair is also color treated, but its straight and fine, this product leaves my hair soft and bouncy!</li>
            <li>Also I have long hair that tangles easily, this shampoo and conditioner eliminated that problem!</li>
            <li>Best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve found for very dry, thin hair - especially the conditioner which greatly reduces frizz and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>This set was totally affordable, so I definitely jumped on a good bargain when I saw it.  </li>
            <li>strong conditioner, maybe a little too strong.</li>
            <li>I took her advise and decided to try the K-Pak intense hydrating conditioner first.</li>
            <li>I color my hair, and need a good shampoo and conditioner, this one is no better than store bought.</li>
            <li>I was looking for natural hair products at a good price/quantity ratio due to all of the sulfates, etc.</li>
            <li>it should last you a good long while if if like myself i wash my hair every day and when it&#x27;s hot out during the summer wash my hair as much as 2 or 3 times a day..</li>
            <li>I use this Joico K-Pak along with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo (Green), and my hair is so healthy.</li>
            <li>I have gotten the same exact results with the cheap versions of salon brands, as I did with this</li>
            <li>Really strong smell is the only downside.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been duped, and I&#x27;m generally smart about these things.</li>
            <li>I love this product it leaves my hair super SOFT, it may be a little pricy but its worth it</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>I repeatedly use this product and I really like it.</li>
            <li>much protein in it.</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo and condition- esp for the cost!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was very hopeful that this would repair my somewhat damaged, frizzy hair</li>
            <li>It took so much shampoo like a minimum of 3+ quarter size to get coverage and lather.  </li>
            <li>This is not the real Joico KPak -</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s real.  </li>
            <li>Shipped fast</li>
            <li>I will have to throw these away and go buy the real product somewhere else.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see much improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure this is not genuine, Ive used this product for years and this is the first time I have not purchased it from a salon...</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t help but think that the liquid soap was supposed to go in the shampoo bottle, as the &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; almost seemed like real (but still subpar) conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you really want some, go to a salon.</li>
            <li>Again, they charge too much for them and the safety is compromised with an out-of-date preservative.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate enough to receive my product intact with no spillage.</li>
            <li>Already I can feel a difference, my hair is much softer than before</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner has helped it look and feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li>After reading some comments I was really worried that the shampoo and conditioner would spill out from transport, but it was packaged very well when I got,</li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair looking so much silkier and healthier than before.</li>
            <li>I searched Amazon and found out that they sell the whole product line.</li>
            <li>I work in one very well known store banana republic &amp; my clients always always compliment my hair.</li>
            <li>It takes them a whole day to answer me!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Beware, this company does not handle their problems very well.</li>
            <li>I really want to recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed it doesn&#x27;t fall out as much</li>
            <li>really like the shampoo quality and smell.</li>
            <li>I use it every day and absolutely adore</li>
            <li>I was a bit worried, at such a cheap price, that the product would be diverted but it was not.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks for the help.</li>
            <li>It was recommended for being gentle on your hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really feel a difference on my hair</li>
            <li>I really like the smell too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Delivery arrived and products had unusual tape over hand pumps.  </li>
            <li>These two bottles of unusual content are suspicious.  </li>
            <li>They were shipped fast and well packaged</li>
            <li>love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....</li>
            <li>I damage my hair with foils&#x27; and perms&#x27; my hair so using the Joico products keeps my hair healthy, soft and totally manageable-</li>
            <li>I mean how much good can shampoo and conditioner do when your hair has been turned to straw by chemicals?</li>
            <li>by optimizing ph levels the product encourages hair to lay flat and smooth.</li>
            <li>As mentioned in other reviews, the pumps were not sealed or taped and when I opened the box there was conditioner all over the place and the top of the bottle was all dented and the pump was all crocked.  </li>
            <li>No spills :) Only 4 stars because I ordered &amp;#34;reconstruct&amp;#34; and received &amp;#34;color therapy.&amp;#34; I didnt return, and don&#x27;t really mind because I was low on mine anyway, but I wanted reconstruct to use on my kids.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve changed out our shower head in the past to soften the water, but my hair still felt kind of...icky.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ve developed some pretty formidable trust issues from shopping for a solution to damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first after using the product, I get a lot of soft shiny volume (dryer), so it must be set.  </li>
            <li>Good price as this product is getting hard to find in stores/salons near me.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s the same as going to a professional beauty store, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is typical of many products like this.</li>
            <li>:) I also somehow manage to make these bottles last almost an entire year.</li>
            <li>Since the cards inside were untouched it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but I will make sure to order this separately from anything else in the future.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s response was to give me free next day shipping on a re-order(less than wow factor when you&#x27;re already a Prime member, but I needed it ASAP).</li>
            <li>Have blonde long hair and taken into account how much I have treated my hair with chemicals, this product has def made my hair more healthier looking and manageable after wash.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend it if you have dryer/course type of hair.</li>
            <li>so I turn the heat up high</li>
            <li>highly recommend trying this set if you have bleached hair.</li>
            <li>When opened there was a little liquid on the top of these bottles.  </li>
            <li>I want to thank this seller for delivering this product fast, well packaged, no leaks, no mess!</li>
            <li>This K-PAK Shampoo &amp; Conditioner really helped my hair to be soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels somewhat normal again.</li>
            <li>like I normally do.</li>
            <li>I make sure I always use detangler (I use the Johnson &amp; Johnson kids detangler in the green bottle) to help prevent breakage when combing my hair.</li>
            <li>Not terrible or too strong, but just a little odd.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, thick course hair and this is a great every day combo.</li>
            <li>It did leave my hair incredibly soft and manageable and with a lot less breakage, but for dyes, I truly believe that the water in my area is doing more stripping/damage than the sulfates in the shampoo.</li>
            <li>Left my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good and left hair as any other regular shampoo.</li>
            <li>When I arrived home, I jumped in the shower to try out my new hair</li>
            <li>This is the third time I have ordered it online and the first time that it leaked during shipping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nearly 50% off salon prices!</li>
            <li>Combing through aisle after aisle of hair products with bright green bottles with ALL NATURAL AVOCADO HONEY SHEA VITAMIN E NOURISHING plastered all over their labels vouching for your attention with carefully engineered designs specifically created to look like it would be God&#x27;s gift to your hair.</li>
            <li>I have soft, shiny BOUNCY hair again!</li>
            <li>I have fine, long, blonde hair.</li>
            <li>It gets my hair clean just like any other shampoo</li>
            <li>Seems to work much better for me than more expensive brands such Kerastase, Loreal Professional, and Pureology.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to re-construct your hair that is bleach blonde, and you&#x27;re willing to pay a little bit more, I would suggest Bed Head Bleach Blonde Re-constructor.</li>
            <li>and I was missing a good inch and a half of product.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend you give it a try since your getting such a large quanity</li>
            <li>Next time, I&#x27;ll splurge on something a little more indulgent.</li>
            <li>Amazing product addicted</li>
            <li>I was trying to steer clear of using chemically-laden products, but I bought into the stylist&#x27;s sales tactics.</li>
            <li>These shipped in a box without any padding inside, and instead the liter bottles were taped with clear packaging tape to a cardboard backing.  </li>
            <li>They didn&#x27;t sport pictures of 15 different types of oil and vegetables and natural ingredients that are supposed to make my hair feel whole again.</li>
            <li>it really makes a big difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li>soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Makes hair so soft</li>
            <li>It makes my hai silky, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Met completely my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair is not as soft with this gold.  </li>
            <li>The reason I only gave it 3 stars out of 5 is because I don&#x27;t know what the hype really is.</li>
            <li>Professional companies like Joico, Redken, ISO, Wella, Matrix, etc., and</li>
            <li>The conditioner makes my hair extremely soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I went back to TJ Maxx to purchase the shampoo and the whole shelf of K-Pak was sold out.</li>
            <li>This immediately fixed the issue the shampoo caused.</li>
            <li>but the Shampoo pump is completely snapped off and</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft the way I want it to feel.</li>
            <li>I called a local salon and asked how much they charge for these</li>
            <li>It feels so soft, you&#x27;d never believe I bleach it if you felt it.</li>
            <li>far as shipping goes, I had no problems.</li>
            <li>The real catch is to only use it once a week though.  </li>
            <li>I have been a long time Joico user, but this is the first time I have purchased Joico from Amazon as opposed to the salon.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It healed the parts of my hair that could be saved, and even some parts that I thought were completely lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve been looking for something to make your hair feel soft, shiny, and manageable again</li>
            <li>I called my old stylist</li>
            <li>So money-wise, I feel this is a good deal since this amount will probably last me several months if not a year at least.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say I hate the product, but the one I recieved from this sender wasn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li>and if you don&#x27;t towel dry it first</li>
            <li>I love the smell of the shampoo and a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s all natural - it&#x27;s neither dry nor oily, the ends don&#x27;t split, it&#x27;s shiny, easy to manage and style, and I have no dandruff or other scalp issues.  </li>
            <li>I have bleached white hair that is in decent condition.</li>
            <li>The stylist, obviously seeing the damage I had done, highly recommended the Joico K-pak.</li>
            <li>I have highly processed hair, (double lifted)</li>
            <li>and this is the only thing that I&#x27;ve found to make my hair soft and natural feeling once again!</li>
            <li>, so I use this after any chemical process to bring the p.H. back to normal.</li>
            <li>I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down like most other moisturizing shampoos.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell the same and absolutely did not work the same as Joico!</li>
            <li>Professional lines are only guaranteed when sold by a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m barely seeing any frizz at all!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it now and then, for no other reason than it was costly.</li>
            <li>The build-up in my hair along with well water required a major miracle.</li>
            <li>I have not used this Seller&#x27;s product yet, but generally Joico K-pack brings out health and beauty out of your hair.</li>
            <li>The SAME STORE offers both the drug store and salon version.  </li>
            <li>I like my old type (same brand)</li>
            <li>On the back of the bottle it says \\&quot;GUARANTEED WHEN PURCHASED FROM A PROFESSIONAL STYLIST</li>
            <li>I recently went natural and I was told about this product from a retired hair stylist when I was looking at this product in TJ Maxx.  </li>
            <li>This product is not nearly up to par with what I normally buy at the salon.  </li>
            <li>I have super thick hair, that is colored frequently</li>
            <li>/&gt;About a month ago I went to get my hair colored at a fine salon, they used only Redken product, and they tried so hard to sell it to me by saying my hair was damaged and lifeless</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical about the 1-minute conditioner, but works great.  </li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t re-construct my hair like other reviews say.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and its hard to find a good shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy or under conditioned.  </li>
            <li>my hair, like on weekends, I use the reconstructor, but when I need my hair to perform, such as for work or a special occassion, I use my Moisture Therapy Duo, dab a little Deep Reconstructor on the ends then distribute the regular Moisture Therapy Conditioner throughout and place a shower cap over my hair for the remainder of the shower.</li>
            <li>I see a dramatic difference in my hair :-)  </li>
            <li>have curly , heavy hair, like it very much, try it for your self</li>
            <li>have very fine, thin color treated hair that takes daily abuse from the flat iron and blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s dried out from chemical treatment, heat damage, sun damage, or maybe you live in a place that has water so hard it&#x27;s pretty much acid if it hits your eyes (like me!)...</li>
            <li>I dyed it a whole lot more than I should&#x27;ve a few years back, and I could never get it to recover, especially since my hair grows back so slowly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used and like the product, so it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning, but I really do prefer the color therapy version since I color and highlight my hair.  </li>
            <li>It completely restored my hair after dying it blonde, red, and blonde again.</li>
            <li>The bottom 50% of my caucasian hair is &#x27;fluffy&#x27; being damaged with split ends from heat styling and coloring, I first heard about the Joico system of products through using their Split End Mender.</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t really because it poofs), while still not weighing down my hair or giving it a residue feel.  </li>
            <li>Although I&#x27;ll never have long lusioius locks as long as I keep abusing them, K-Pak helps tremendously with the breakage without waying it down.  </li>
            <li>Companies that have the real product, that are old -- way past their shelf life and should have been thrown away - decide to re-sell them to another outlet.</li>
            <li>To make a long story short I am NEVER going back to my old products.</li>
            <li>When it was done, I could not bear to detract from the beauty of this tile shower by having some gaudy bright blue, pink, green, orange or any other butt-ugly-brightly-colored bottles of shampoo and conditioner sitting in plain sight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I usually do since a friend and cosmetology school grad tipped me off that they are one of the few places open to the public where you can get salon grade products at a bit of a better value than the actual salon mark up.  </li>
            <li>I way overprocess my already thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky, full of body, less breakage, and less hair falling out.</li>

            <li> I bought joico in a salon and loved it.  </li>
            <li> good clean-smelling shampoo.</li>
            <li> They have the best prices and free shipping.</li>
            <li> Joico KPack always brings the good out in my locks.</li>
            <li> hair loved it.</li>
            <li> But the point is neither are any good, and both should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> To be fair, please note that I am also using the Joico K-pak split-end mender, Moroccan argan oil, and TRESemme heat styling spray in my hair as well.</li>
            <li> So use it with with a good moisturizing set for your softness.</li>
            <li> Good luck ladies.</li>
            <li> I gave this shampoo and conditioner a fair chance, about a month or so of use.</li>
            <li> and I knew I needed to invest on good shampoo&amp;conditioner.</li>
            <li> it smells good and makes your hair appear healthier</li>
            <li> The hair stylist used this product on my hair and I loved it</li>
            <li> Always a good idea.</li>
            <li> I buy Salon Selectives for a $1 and it works as good as this Joyco product.</li>
            <li> I am going to consult my hair dresser for a recommendation on what is as good as this product used to be.</li>
            <li> Priced good and will buy again</li>
            <li> It worked good for a while</li>
            <li> But when I curl it, it&#x27;s gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> Really good Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I loved how this made my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Works good and products stands well.</li>
            <li> Super affordable, though maybe not the best product for my fine/processed/color treated hair.</li>
            <li> That stuff smells heavenly, makes your hair super shiny and sleek, and is great for your hair!</li>
            <li> Love this brand!</li>
            <li> Love this brand!</li>
            <li> My favorite brand!</li>

            <li> Love my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner!</li>
            <li> It has been safe for my color-treated hair!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really amazing the way it leaves your hair feeling.</li>
            <li> I feel I should write a review to clarify some things about this set.&lt;br /&gt;First off, this price is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product, and the price on amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Its amazing .</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> It works so good on my grand daughter&#x27;s curly hair.</li>
            <li> This set is a nice size and price.  </li>
            <li> It smells ok and is fairly moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I use this 1-2/week and love how good my hair feels afterward.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my hair kind of straw like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesnt smell as nice</li>
            <li> I have REAL JOICO products and they work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> , I really needed something to help with breakage, I&#x27;m very happy with this and the price.  </li>
            <li> like to dry my hair and this product is perfect, the look is always beautiful.</li>
            <li> it cost me about 4 CENTS PER DAY to have clean and manageable hair, and a great looking shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed an incredible difference in the strengthening of my hair, and I&#x27;ve also noticed I haven&#x27;t had nearly as much breakage as I use too!</li>
            <li> Excellent product I&#x27;ve been using for years and normally pay $90 for the shampoo, conditioner and styling gel.  </li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair strong and feeling like silk!</li>
            <li> Excellent product by far I have tried so many and this one is just by far the best one in the market!</li>
            <li> Was happy that Amazon had such great deals on this product, because nothing works as well for his straight-plus-curly-hair combo except this product.</li>
            <li> There is a very light hint</li>
            <li> Just like the ones at the Hair Salon at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> Have been using these for years and love them.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the bottles, I would have figured the sender would have tried to make the product better packaged</li>
            <li> In any case, I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a great product.</li>
            <li> But shipping aside, I always love Joico products.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t help my hair look better at all</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> It works great, leaves hair smelling nice, feeling soft, looking shiny.  </li>
            <li> and this is a much better price.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> So you can still enjoy volume as well!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is ok.</li>
            <li> better</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Looks fabulous when I style it and feels so nice.</li>
            <li> Love Joico shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> Overall, I think joico is a great product and smells good too.</li>
            <li> It does say its safe for colored hair</li>
            <li> and I fell In love with it.</li>
            <li> My hair is coarse and I have a lot of it this conditioner works wonders and smells great too!</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t been able to find joico products anywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m paying around $20 (per bottle) for more than 2x the amount.</li>
            <li> This was the area I was the most concerned about, and is also why I feel I should write this review.</li>
            <li> These bottles have a PUMP, like a soap dispenser, not a pop top like the picture shows; so that&#x27;s where it can lead to leakage.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with how it was packaged and shipped, so if anything I&#x27;d recommend having this fulfilled by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> All in all, I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is one more thing</li>
            <li> (I condition more than shampoo)</li>
            <li> I still feel I got the most for my money.</li>
            <li> Took forever to  arrive but love the product.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Only bummer is that the seller didn&#x27;t do the best job with packaging and some of the shampoo had leaked into the package.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this shampoo and conditioner by my stylist and immediately fell in love.  </li>
            <li> When it came time to purchase more, I immediately came to amazon.com to see if I could get it cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I hope this helps someone! :)</li>
            <li> I applied the shampoo, and enjoyed the smell (the stylist stated that it has the smell of pina colodas...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s healthy and I color my hair every 5 weeks</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s some better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Shampoo bottle wasl  damaged/crushed on top.  </li>
            <li> Ships on time, love this product.</li>

            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels better than it has in years.  </li>
            <li> Once opened, it does not seal any more.</li>
            <li> Love this product, so nice of the seller to include a free reconstructor conditioner.</li>
            <li> sure you know the feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took about a week for my hair to feel about 85% better, which is huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have used Joico K-pack for almost 5 years now and have no doubt that it&#x27;s the best product on the market out there for dry, damaged or color-processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love using this and the bottles are super large all for a great price.</li>
            <li> the best for my fine, wavy, long hair.</li>
            <li> Also, doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, very light and smells great!</li>
            <li> Or better ( genuine) quality product, period!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It smells so great, and makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Interesting note: if you visit or are familiar with these stores- they boast both drug store and salon brands- two separate sections.  </li>
            <li> results with use.&lt;br /&gt;The pump allows easy use.</li>
            <li> so I cannot easily use this product without transferring to another container.</li>
            <li> the pumps are easy to</li>
            <li> That being said, the K-Pak shampoo is great for you if your hair is already healthy, but it works wonders for you if your hair is kind of dried out.  </li>
            <li> Also, the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t have the best smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shampoo and conditioner are just average.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These two bottles look just fine against the tile work in my shower, the product inside cleans and conditions my hair beautifully, and because I&#x27;m the only one who uses it, it LASTS TWO YEARS.  </li>
            <li> Keeps your hair smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> so I was fine to change it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loyal customer of Joico and have been for many years, will continue to sing their praises.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioning regime for dry or color-processed hair, by far -  love this stuff, and I&#x27;ll keep ordering it!  </li>
            <li> Love this product great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have also experienced great results by adding a little pure tea tree oil to my shampoo.</li>
            <li> It is a joy now to wash and dry my hair which is soft and full and beautiful.</li>
            <li> The very first use I noticed a difference in my hair!</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the split ends, but whats done is done</li>
            <li> I am glad I decided to purchase, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Joico is a fantastic product and have been using for years.  </li>
            <li> I had this order fulfilled by Amazon, that was important to me.</li>
            <li> I then distribute Joico&#x27;s Protect and Shine Serum throughout, and am happy with how the undamaged upper 50% of my hair responds to these products.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is absolutely fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Wished the shampoo was available for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> It smelled great in the shower, but for some reason when it mixed with my hair, it stunk!</li>
            <li> Was a bit of a mess to clean up on arrival, otherwise still best shampoo/conditioner out there for the money.</li>
            <li> I should also mention that the K-pak reconstruct is safe for color-treated hair, says it right on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Very worth it</li>
            <li> I have been using these products for about a month or so, and have noticed a significant difference in the health and behavior of my once unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> It has definitely given me a better and better result over time, too, which I haven&#x27;t been able to say for anything else I have tried.</li>
            <li> I rather pay the price for original than for a knock off</li>
            <li> Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> was excited to order it online, but ...</li>
            <li> I orginally got this product rom mu hair salon at a much higher price, I love the product and price offered by this company</li>
            <li> and I was never disappointed.</li>
            <li> Totally, totally worth it!</li>
            <li> Is OK, but for VERY dry hair, it is not as good as Salerm Balsam stuff</li>
            <li> all I need a shampoo to clean it and a conditioner to soften/condition it.  </li>
            <li> Thinking I would see phenomenal results, have shiny, soft, maneagable hair, I gladly purchased the product.</li>
            <li> It was so clean and bouncy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need anything special for my hair -</li>
            <li> The Color therapy one is special,</li>
            <li> (Which is my goal right now!)</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure that this was the real mccoy.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good value, personally.</li>
            <li> I love amazon for a lot of things, but I would wonder if these are really the salon grade products you get here?  </li>
            <li> I used this kind of shampoo before but what these people are selling is nowhere near what it should be.</li>
            <li> I took a gamble on this product based on the reviews I read here because most of them said there was some spillage during transit, but my hair is so fried and dyed it really needs some TLC.</li>
            <li> Stuffing one&#x27;s hair too full of protein, can cause snapping.</li>
            <li> I ended up ( thank God for amazon&#x27;s superior customer service ) getting all my money back and ordering from another seller just the pump.</li>
            <li> I used this very same product for years and loved it.</li>
            <li> Such a shame as before it was so good.</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have very damaged hair from hair straightening.</li>
            <li> My hair is highlighted to a very blonde shade and has a fair amount of damage.</li>
            <li> I also use Redken Extreme Anti-Snap Leave-in after too, but that has always been great.  </li>
            <li> This particular brand is my favorite.</li>
            <li> overall just more healthy.</li>
            <li> It is very popular and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Received item very fast!</li>
            <li> Its a great product, but I have to say, for the price is not worth it.</li>
            <li> packaging was GREAT, delivery was AMAZING cause came earlier then expected and price is UNBEATABLE!</li>
            <li> I have a perfectly healthy head of hair, it&#x27;s mostly salt-and-pepper grey, it&#x27;s not colored or highlighted in any way</li>
            <li> Good product for dry and thining hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased because a friend mentioned it was good for dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft after using this and seems to be growing better</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really my go to!!</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited about getting this because I have a k-pak that I had bought at the salon at home</li>
            <li> I instantly fell in love with it!</li>
            <li> I have blonde hair and it is safe to say that these products have self handely saved my hair!</li>
            <li> The shampoo is fine, the conditioner is what really bothered me.  </li>
            <li> Smells fantastic but didn&#x27;t really do as much for my hair as I&#x27;d hoped.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner does the trick, and it&#x27;s well worth it.  </li>
            <li> Frankly, I expected that it will help my curly damaged hair to get a good condition</li>
            <li> I would however, say this product is better for those with natural color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although the quantity to price value is good, I will likely go with the organic/natural competitors I found previously at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> ( I love how certain hairdressers love to put your hair down, just to sell you their product!), but as soon as the Stylist asked me what I used for my hair ( and I said Joico), he had absolutely NOTHING  to say to me, because he knows I&#x27;m using a very good product that used to be sold ONLY in Salons ( which is how I got introduced to it in the first place).</li>
            <li> Not the right texture, not the right color, does not smell good like kpak, and is certainly not as efficient.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right -</li>
            <li> Both bottle pumps were in the locked position, and sealed with just the right amount of tape.</li>
            <li> Because there&#x27;s a difference, right?</li>
            <li> dye my hair correctly and take very good care of it, but I wanted to find something that would reverse some minor damage from the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have used many different professional products (Kenra, Rusk, WEN, etc) and this is by far my favorite!</li>
            <li> leaves hair very very very non-dry.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I DO have, however, is a stunning remodeled bathroom that includes a tile shower that set me back THOUSANDS of dollars.  </li>
            <li> Arrived exactly how I ordered.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a much better value to buy the set than the individual products.</li>
            <li> KPack gives me back that silky feel I love to have.</li>
            <li> First time using this product.</li>
            <li> I will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> but I found something better for doing it in the same pries.</li>
            <li> and I really liked the results, but the conditioner isn&#x27;t was I expected.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with pricing first.</li>
            <li> to how well this product works, let me first tell you about my hair.</li>
            <li> First impression, I&#x27;m liking it though.</li>
            <li> I will also be looking into a purchasing a much better hairdryer to avoid more of the same damage in the future.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells, the way it makes me hair feel and especially the way it makes my hair look!</li>
            <li> The results stayed consistent.</li>
            <li> Open the envelope, Conditioner is ok, pump is in place</li>
            <li> It leaked and that is why it only got three stars I love this product and this has never happend before.</li>
            <li> and my hair does feel softer bouncier and much shinier!  </li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely manner and the product was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I usually buy this product from a salon as was impressed that it was of same quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is mediocre at best.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> thing that struck me first was the understated design of the product.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t bright green.</li>
            <li> NO FURTHER, if your hair can be saved, this is the shampoo and conditioner set that will be able to handle the job.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so used to conditioners working at first but then</li>
            <li> my hair is also color treated, but its straight and fine, this product leaves my hair soft and bouncy!</li>
            <li> Also I have long hair that tangles easily, this shampoo and conditioner eliminated that problem!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve found for very dry, thin hair - especially the conditioner which greatly reduces frizz and leaves my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> This set was totally affordable, so I definitely jumped on a good bargain when I saw it.  </li>
            <li> strong conditioner, maybe a little too strong.</li>
            <li> I took her advise and decided to try the K-Pak intense hydrating conditioner first.</li>
            <li> I color my hair, and need a good shampoo and conditioner, this one is no better than store bought.</li>
            <li> I was looking for natural hair products at a good price/quantity ratio due to all of the sulfates, etc.</li>
            <li> it should last you a good long while if if like myself i wash my hair every day and when it&#x27;s hot out during the summer wash my hair as much as 2 or 3 times a day..</li>
            <li> I use this Joico K-Pak along with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo (Green), and my hair is so healthy.</li>
            <li> I have gotten the same exact results with the cheap versions of salon brands, as I did with this</li>
            <li> Really strong smell is the only downside.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been duped, and I&#x27;m generally smart about these things.</li>
            <li> I love this product it leaves my hair super SOFT, it may be a little pricy but its worth it</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> I repeatedly use this product and I really like it.</li>
            <li> much protein in it.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and condition- esp for the cost!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that this would repair my somewhat damaged, frizzy hair</li>
            <li> It took so much shampoo like a minimum of 3+ quarter size to get coverage and lather.  </li>
            <li> This is not the real Joico KPak -</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s real.  </li>
            <li> Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I will have to throw these away and go buy the real product somewhere else.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see much improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is not genuine, Ive used this product for years and this is the first time I have not purchased it from a salon...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t help but think that the liquid soap was supposed to go in the shampoo bottle, as the &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; almost seemed like real (but still subpar) conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you really want some, go to a salon.</li>
            <li> Again, they charge too much for them and the safety is compromised with an out-of-date preservative.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate enough to receive my product intact with no spillage.</li>
            <li> Already I can feel a difference, my hair is much softer than before</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner has helped it look and feel so much healthier.</li>
            <li> After reading some comments I was really worried that the shampoo and conditioner would spill out from transport, but it was packaged very well when I got,</li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair looking so much silkier and healthier than before.</li>
            <li> I searched Amazon and found out that they sell the whole product line.</li>
            <li> I work in one very well known store banana republic &amp; my clients always always compliment my hair.</li>
            <li> It takes them a whole day to answer me!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beware, this company does not handle their problems very well.</li>
            <li> I really want to recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed it doesn&#x27;t fall out as much</li>
            <li> really like the shampoo quality and smell.</li>
            <li> I use it every day and absolutely adore</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried, at such a cheap price, that the product would be diverted but it was not.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks for the help.</li>
            <li> It was recommended for being gentle on your hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really feel a difference on my hair</li>
            <li> I really like the smell too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Delivery arrived and products had unusual tape over hand pumps.  </li>
            <li> These two bottles of unusual content are suspicious.  </li>
            <li> They were shipped fast and well packaged</li>
            <li> love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....</li>
            <li> I damage my hair with foils&#x27; and perms&#x27; my hair so using the Joico products keeps my hair healthy, soft and totally manageable-</li>
            <li> I mean how much good can shampoo and conditioner do when your hair has been turned to straw by chemicals?</li>
            <li> by optimizing ph levels the product encourages hair to lay flat and smooth.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, the pumps were not sealed or taped and when I opened the box there was conditioner all over the place and the top of the bottle was all dented and the pump was all crocked.  </li>
            <li> No spills :) Only 4 stars because I ordered &amp;#34;reconstruct&amp;#34; and received &amp;#34;color therapy.&amp;#34; I didnt return, and don&#x27;t really mind because I was low on mine anyway, but I wanted reconstruct to use on my kids.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve changed out our shower head in the past to soften the water, but my hair still felt kind of...icky.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ve developed some pretty formidable trust issues from shopping for a solution to damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first after using the product, I get a lot of soft shiny volume (dryer), so it must be set.  </li>
            <li> Good price as this product is getting hard to find in stores/salons near me.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s the same as going to a professional beauty store, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is typical of many products like this.</li>
            <li> :) I also somehow manage to make these bottles last almost an entire year.</li>
            <li> Since the cards inside were untouched it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but I will make sure to order this separately from anything else in the future.</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s response was to give me free next day shipping on a re-order(less than wow factor when you&#x27;re already a Prime member, but I needed it ASAP).</li>
            <li> Have blonde long hair and taken into account how much I have treated my hair with chemicals, this product has def made my hair more healthier looking and manageable after wash.</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend it if you have dryer/course type of hair.</li>
            <li> so I turn the heat up high</li>
            <li> highly recommend trying this set if you have bleached hair.</li>
            <li> When opened there was a little liquid on the top of these bottles.  </li>
            <li> I want to thank this seller for delivering this product fast, well packaged, no leaks, no mess!</li>
            <li> This K-PAK Shampoo &amp; Conditioner really helped my hair to be soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels somewhat normal again.</li>
            <li> like I normally do.</li>
            <li> I make sure I always use detangler (I use the Johnson &amp; Johnson kids detangler in the green bottle) to help prevent breakage when combing my hair.</li>
            <li> Not terrible or too strong, but just a little odd.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, thick course hair and this is a great every day combo.</li>
            <li> It did leave my hair incredibly soft and manageable and with a lot less breakage, but for dyes, I truly believe that the water in my area is doing more stripping/damage than the sulfates in the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Left my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good and left hair as any other regular shampoo.</li>
            <li> When I arrived home, I jumped in the shower to try out my new hair</li>
            <li> This is the third time I have ordered it online and the first time that it leaked during shipping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly 50% off salon prices!</li>
            <li> Combing through aisle after aisle of hair products with bright green bottles with ALL NATURAL AVOCADO HONEY SHEA VITAMIN E NOURISHING plastered all over their labels vouching for your attention with carefully engineered designs specifically created to look like it would be God&#x27;s gift to your hair.</li>
            <li> I have soft, shiny BOUNCY hair again!</li>
            <li> I have fine, long, blonde hair.</li>
            <li> It gets my hair clean just like any other shampoo</li>
            <li> Seems to work much better for me than more expensive brands such Kerastase, Loreal Professional, and Pureology.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to re-construct your hair that is bleach blonde, and you&#x27;re willing to pay a little bit more, I would suggest Bed Head Bleach Blonde Re-constructor.</li>
            <li> and I was missing a good inch and a half of product.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend you give it a try since your getting such a large quanity</li>
            <li> Next time, I&#x27;ll splurge on something a little more indulgent.</li>
            <li> Amazing product addicted</li>
            <li> I was trying to steer clear of using chemically-laden products, but I bought into the stylist&#x27;s sales tactics.</li>
            <li> These shipped in a box without any padding inside, and instead the liter bottles were taped with clear packaging tape to a cardboard backing.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t sport pictures of 15 different types of oil and vegetables and natural ingredients that are supposed to make my hair feel whole again.</li>
            <li> it really makes a big difference in my hair.  </li>
            <li> soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Makes hair so soft</li>
            <li> It makes my hai silky, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Met completely my expectations.&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair is not as soft with this gold.  </li>
            <li> The reason I only gave it 3 stars out of 5 is because I don&#x27;t know what the hype really is.</li>
            <li> Professional companies like Joico, Redken, ISO, Wella, Matrix, etc., and</li>
            <li> The conditioner makes my hair extremely soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> I went back to TJ Maxx to purchase the shampoo and the whole shelf of K-Pak was sold out.</li>
            <li> This immediately fixed the issue the shampoo caused.</li>
            <li> but the Shampoo pump is completely snapped off and</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft the way I want it to feel.</li>
            <li> I called a local salon and asked how much they charge for these</li>
            <li> It feels so soft, you&#x27;d never believe I bleach it if you felt it.</li>
            <li> far as shipping goes, I had no problems.</li>
            <li> The real catch is to only use it once a week though.  </li>
            <li> I have been a long time Joico user, but this is the first time I have purchased Joico from Amazon as opposed to the salon.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It healed the parts of my hair that could be saved, and even some parts that I thought were completely lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve been looking for something to make your hair feel soft, shiny, and manageable again</li>
            <li> I called my old stylist</li>
            <li> So money-wise, I feel this is a good deal since this amount will probably last me several months if not a year at least.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say I hate the product, but the one I recieved from this sender wasn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t towel dry it first</li>
            <li> I love the smell of the shampoo and a little goes a long way..</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s all natural - it&#x27;s neither dry nor oily, the ends don&#x27;t split, it&#x27;s shiny, easy to manage and style, and I have no dandruff or other scalp issues.  </li>
            <li> I have bleached white hair that is in decent condition.</li>
            <li> The stylist, obviously seeing the damage I had done, highly recommended the Joico K-pak.</li>
            <li> I have highly processed hair, (double lifted)</li>
            <li> and this is the only thing that I&#x27;ve found to make my hair soft and natural feeling once again!</li>
            <li> , so I use this after any chemical process to bring the p.H. back to normal.</li>
            <li> I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down like most other moisturizing shampoos.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell the same and absolutely did not work the same as Joico!</li>
            <li> Professional lines are only guaranteed when sold by a professional hair stylist.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m barely seeing any frizz at all!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it now and then, for no other reason than it was costly.</li>
            <li> The build-up in my hair along with well water required a major miracle.</li>
            <li> I have not used this Seller&#x27;s product yet, but generally Joico K-pack brings out health and beauty out of your hair.</li>
            <li> The SAME STORE offers both the drug store and salon version.  </li>
            <li> I like my old type (same brand)</li>
            <li> On the back of the bottle it says \\&quot;GUARANTEED WHEN PURCHASED FROM A PROFESSIONAL STYLIST</li>
            <li> I recently went natural and I was told about this product from a retired hair stylist when I was looking at this product in TJ Maxx.  </li>
            <li> This product is not nearly up to par with what I normally buy at the salon.  </li>
            <li> I have super thick hair, that is colored frequently</li>
            <li> /&gt;About a month ago I went to get my hair colored at a fine salon, they used only Redken product, and they tried so hard to sell it to me by saying my hair was damaged and lifeless</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about the 1-minute conditioner, but works great.  </li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t re-construct my hair like other reviews say.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and its hard to find a good shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy or under conditioned.  </li>
            <li> my hair, like on weekends, I use the reconstructor, but when I need my hair to perform, such as for work or a special occassion, I use my Moisture Therapy Duo, dab a little Deep Reconstructor on the ends then distribute the regular Moisture Therapy Conditioner throughout and place a shower cap over my hair for the remainder of the shower.</li>
            <li> I see a dramatic difference in my hair :-)  </li>
            <li> have curly , heavy hair, like it very much, try it for your self</li>
            <li> have very fine, thin color treated hair that takes daily abuse from the flat iron and blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s dried out from chemical treatment, heat damage, sun damage, or maybe you live in a place that has water so hard it&#x27;s pretty much acid if it hits your eyes (like me!)...</li>
            <li> I dyed it a whole lot more than I should&#x27;ve a few years back, and I could never get it to recover, especially since my hair grows back so slowly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used and like the product, so it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning, but I really do prefer the color therapy version since I color and highlight my hair.  </li>
            <li> It completely restored my hair after dying it blonde, red, and blonde again.</li>
            <li> The bottom 50% of my caucasian hair is &#x27;fluffy&#x27; being damaged with split ends from heat styling and coloring, I first heard about the Joico system of products through using their Split End Mender.</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t really because it poofs), while still not weighing down my hair or giving it a residue feel.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ll never have long lusioius locks as long as I keep abusing them, K-Pak helps tremendously with the breakage without waying it down.  </li>
            <li> Companies that have the real product, that are old -- way past their shelf life and should have been thrown away - decide to re-sell them to another outlet.</li>
            <li> To make a long story short I am NEVER going back to my old products.</li>
            <li> When it was done, I could not bear to detract from the beauty of this tile shower by having some gaudy bright blue, pink, green, orange or any other butt-ugly-brightly-colored bottles of shampoo and conditioner sitting in plain sight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I usually do since a friend and cosmetology school grad tipped me off that they are one of the few places open to the public where you can get salon grade products at a bit of a better value than the actual salon mark up.  </li>
            <li> I way overprocess my already thin fine hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky, full of body, less breakage, and less hair falling out.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve noticed less breakage and my hair is left very soft ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for over a month now, and I have medium long hair (mid way between shoulders and elbows), so it definitely lasts.  </li>
            <li> It actually helped repair the damage on my hair from coloring and the flat iron.</li>
            <li> Normally conditioners leave my hair heavy and even oily looking, but I leave this conditioner in my hair for 3 mins daily  </li>
            <li> However, this is moot once you use the conditioner, which seems a little dry and has a very off-putting smell (in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In a week your hair will slow down the falling out process, you will feel silky smooth feeling to it, and manageable hair will be your gift from Joico!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the pump tops were taped down well!!</li>
            <li> So there are some that are in fact, real, but past their shelf life.</li>
            <li> Will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> i bought this and upon use it seems different from the ones i have been using from a long time.</li>
            <li> I have nearly white hair, and that definitely is not natural.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and not weighted down.</li>
            <li> I also flat iron and blow dry my hair regularly.</li>
            <li> After a few uses Its like I have new hair.</li>
            <li> product restores your hair, especially when it&#x27;s damaged, colored, dry, processed.</li>
            <li> I moved to a different area and my hair was so dry and lifeless.</li>
            <li> she has really course thick hair that she constantly dyes...</li>
            <li> Not the worst shampoo and conditioner but not the best either and Certainly not</li>
            <li> I have very long, very dry, very wavy hair (not color treated though), and often suffer from frizz and breakage just from everyday brushing and styling.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s right, urine!), formaldehyde, and a laundry list of icky harsh stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Sure</li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find this product.</li>
            <li> It is the only product I&#x27;ve found that gives enough slip after washing to run a comb through wet without breaking (and for those of you with wavy or curly hair you know that wet combing is a must-</li>
            <li> It just takes a couple of pumps for my medium long hair so the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> My local drug store sells the 10.1 ounce shampoo and conditioner for roughly $17 a piece.</li>
            <li> My hair is also long</li>
            <li> but I waited too long after purchase.  </li>
            <li> So strange.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this shampoo and conditioner are better than some of the typical cheaper products out there {Pantene, Suave, etc.}</li>
            <li> Received a double pack of conditioner instead of a shampoo/conditioner set AND both bottles were split at the bottom and spilled all over the box and my other products.</li>
            <li> Have tried using other shampoos and conditioners but always go back to Joico Products....</li>
            <li> I live in an extremely humid climate, so I fight my hair with a flatiron almost everyday.</li>
            <li> So be very careful who you choose to buy this from, since it is a big investment.</li>
            <li> once it is dry</li>
            <li> My stylist gave me the tip to towel dry my hair after I shampoo then add the conditioner and let it sit for like 3 mins.</li>
            <li> My hair has become dry and there is no shine to it.</li>
            <li> This kept my hair dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> When I used all 4 of these products together, my hair felt extremely dry out of the shower, and I would not have dared to heat style without some type of leave-in serum, etc.  </li>
            <li> My hair is as dry as ever.</li>
            <li> and then I noticed my hair getting dry feeling</li>
            <li> Delivered on time but my hair is still dry.  </li>
            <li> Too much protein is not good for your hair so if you notice this switch to something moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I have damaged my DARK brown hair from when I went platinum blonde</li>
            <li> The conditioner does not give my hair that soft, slick feeling and it does not detangle my hair at all.  </li>
            <li> Blonde hair doesn&#x27;t shine like dark hair</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m down to 25% of the bottle left on the conditioner and 35% on the shampoo.</li>
            <li> Needless to say I have to be careful of what I used because a lot of things weigh it down and easily cause buildup.</li>
            <li> I typically buy the products during the liter sales at a local store, but I was buying this as a Christmas gift, so I had to find it somewhere else.  </li>
            <li> I love this product usually but am a bit bummed the wrong product was sent.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be better than the joico in the blue bottles but was really disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t necessarily smell that, but there is a slight hint of coconut maybe pineapple...</li>
            <li> Good price, but disappointed in the shipping and in having to give a dented bottle with missing product for a gift.</li>
            <li> But without fail, every time you take home that new damaged-hair shampoo-conditioner set and it makes it feel soft for about 3 hours after you wash it</li>
            <li> This K-pak series should only be used when your hair needs a little TLC from chemical damage or heat damage.</li>
            <li> Maybe its just the product I received as a few others have made similar</li>
            <li> But not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I used to have to buy shampoo/conditioner about 1x a month, so $40 for over 7 months, not including tax is roughly $5.71 a month.</li>
            <li> Only continued to use it as I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money spent on it.</li>
            <li> I experience way less breakage and the protein doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like the Paul Mitchell and Redken similar products do.</li>
            <li> Apparently Joico K-Pak products are hard to keep on the shelves.</li>
            <li> I am not positive but it seems like the bottles where all tampered with by diluting with lotion or some other product other than Joico.  </li>
            <li> I usually get them from the salon I get my hair done, but this is bigger and</li>
            <li> The distributor on the other hand...  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t coat your hair like other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why Iever try any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> I usually get the blue bottle, but I decided to try this one.  </li>
            <li> As always, I found it cheaper on Amazon vs. Kohls and other websites.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Small amount of product did leak out, but not enough to complain (during shippment).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the shampoo has sulfates in it and due to</li>
            <li> In my experience, I truly have found that this product works no better than what you can find in your local discount stores.)</li>
            <li> but in the meantime having to use other pump or pour out in hand.  </li>
            <li> But have been using this product every other day, for 2 weeks now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never trying any other product or brand for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll only buy it again if I&#x27;m too lazy to leave my house.</li>
            <li> I am more than a little disappointed .It</li>
            <li> A lot less flat iorning needed than usual.  </li>
            <li> the shampoo is runny and smells bad and the conditioner feels and smells like cheap lotion</li>
            <li> have wavy hair that is naturally dark brown, but I dye it bleach blonde.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Perhaps even dark dye colors.</li>
            <li> But absolutely not worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> It has a sour foul smelling to it.  </li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all &amp; I</li>
            <li> The shampoo seems watered down.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to be frizzy and these products keep the frizz down.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> My bottles came bubble wrapped with the pumps taped down.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find that it weighs my hair down.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t lose half of the product I purchased, that didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> I swear, I&#x27;m even finding less hair in the shower after I wash it.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to save a half what I spend at the store</li>
            <li> No more dry, brittle straw for me!</li>
            <li> It was a mess</li>
            <li> One bottle was cracked during shipping and made a mess.</li>
            <li> (if you&#x27;re at all interested): I have discovered benefits to using a cold water/raw organic apple cider vinegar rinse.</li>
            <li> The fragrant and texture is not true to Joico.  </li>
            <li> My hair was in HORRIBLE condition from frequent colorings and my own poor hair decisions.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday without it weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li> It is either fake or very VERY old.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this on amazon before, and this time, the products i got from this seller is either very very old, quality damaged or fake product.  </li>
            <li> it is not original.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is it leaked during shipping!  </li>
            <li> I have bought this product before from the salon and it was amazing, this was FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really helped a lot with the damage my hair suffers from all of the coloring I do to it.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Will never buy again&amp;#62; waste of money</li>
            <li> After rinsing, I apply the Split End Mender, a thicker serum, to the towel dried lower 50% of my hair</li>
            <li> After I got out of the shower, I towel dried my hair, applied some heat-protectant to my hair, and blow dried.</li>
            <li> The tape was so sticky that, after I struggled for a few minutes to peel it off, it took me 20+ minutes to get the stickiness off the bottles using Goo Gone.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;d have to send the broken Shampoo bottle back and then get a replacement!</li>
            <li> The pump was broken, it didnt work, the smell wasnt the same, ive used this brand before i know what it does for my hair and what it should smell like.  </li>
            <li> /pumps firmly protected.  </li>
            <li> No product discounts, no free stuff, just &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34; guess you&#x27;ll have to try again.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo and conditioner, does not leave hair heavy or limp.  </li>
            <li> It may work with air dried hair, too.  </li>
            <li> Got twice the volume for half the cost!  </li>
            <li> The packaging was horrible and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the original that I would have purchased in a regular salon.  </li>
            <li> Due to the use of \\&quot;DIY\\&quot; hair color, the end result for me, was brittle, frizzy, dull, and straw-like hair.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s no easy feat.</li>
            <li> And so, in one last desperate attempt to save mine from being dry and unmanageable forever, I ordered these on</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just really perfume heavy</li>
            <li> So unfortunately this is a great product, but with terrible packaging!</li>
            <li> what the product usually smells like in the conditioner.</li>
            <li> Received a refund from amazon as they were not able to replace the item.</li>
            <li> This stuff does not seem like the what I have used in the past and my hair is now paying the price.  </li>
            <li> Usually use paul mitchell (and still do) but am using this as well.</li>
            <li> how light my hair color is, the combination of sulfates and cruddy FL water strip my hair of the color.</li>
            <li> The conditioner smells horrible, its been tampered with for sure.</li>
            <li> My hair is frequently colored and suffers from a lot of damage.</li>
            <li> I have been buying Joico products for the past 6 years</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the &amp;#34;Real Deal&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve never used this product from a salon, just from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Usually buy it from Ulta but found it on Amazon - no going out to store  Convenient shopping from home</li>
            <li> I received  the Shampoo and Conditioner packed and sealed, however the shampoo had small hole in it and leaked out.</li>
            <li> It does not make hair feel soft like it&#x27;s supposed to, it smells weird, and the pump was broken...</li>
            <li> but if you get your hands on the real stuff, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I lost about 1/3 of the conditioner that leaked out and made a mess and the pump is broken</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has the \\&quot;pump\\&quot; style of lid, so there was some spillage in shipping, which I hadn&#x27;t really expected based on the picture.</li>
            <li> I suppose, and this makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something at least.  </li>
            <li> At least 1/4 of the bottle spilled out.</li>
            <li> I HAVE to wash daily or my hair looks oily and dirty.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Joico product since the late 1980&#x27;s</li>
            <li> have curly, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly hair</li>
            <li> To make the damage worse, I also dye it every few months or so.</li>
            <li> My hair felt matted, unnaturally thick, and almost felt melted together.</li>
            <li> This product came secured in thick plastic with the lids</li>
            <li> Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> and oh did I mention I got my hair brutally damaged by going from black hair to blonde hair!</li>
            <li> Not a good savings.</li>
            <li> Disappointed, I moved over to Joico&#x27;s Moisture Therapy Liter Duo in the blue bottles.  </li>
            <li> but I swear it made it worse.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo was broken n liking</li>
            <li> The conditioner is expired and like a thin body lotion.</li>
            <li> You might say it was unnecessary to Goo Gone the bottles, but they were literally so sticky from the tape that they would have been a nuisance to use in my shower.  </li>
            <li> Also the pump on the shampoo bottle was broken.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it is outdated, don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard for me to find something I like, I have curly hair that is very thin</li>
            <li> I give this particular item three stars because of the terrible packaging, however.  </li>
            <li> Be wary.</li>
            <li> Not impressed....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner before, but it is expensive beyond belief if you find it in stores.  </li>
            <li> I am continuing to use it because it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> This was definitely fake.</li>
            <li> The rest is fake.</li>
            <li> FAKE:</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the k-pak that I received was quite a bit thinner than what I had bought at the salon and instead of a shampoo and conditioner, I ended up getting two conditioners.</li>
            <li> Needless to say</li>
            <li> But sadly stuck with a $30 mistake.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical--</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from an itchy and flaky scalp every time that we run out of this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions on the bottles and sealed the cuticles of my hair with a cold water rinse.</li>
            <li> And I tried shampoo after shampoo and oils, hair skin &amp; nails supplements, I tried not blowdrying it and washing it with cold water, but at the end of the day my hair my hair still made the Scarecrow look like he should be on a Garnier</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s awful and I&#x27;m not sure how this can be sold like this.</li>
            <li> Product is FAKE!</li>
            <li> This product is a FAKE!</li>
            <li> As I began to work the shampoo in, I noticed that my hair was getting globbed together, and was nearly impossible to rinse.</li>
            <li> I am somewhat disappointed with the way this shampoo works on my hair.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy about how I received this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed and will not ever buy anything from this seller again..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> The shampoo was horrible.</li>
            <li> It leaked every where in the box and it smelt awful!</li>
            <li> It smells horrible!!!</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!!!  </li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pointed in its direction by a friend of my boyfriend&#x27;s, who said that she had horribly damaged hair before she started using these.</li>
            <li> I hate it!!  </li>
            <li> drying, stripping, awful.</li>
            <li> I hated the way it smelled!</li>
            <li> The price was outrageous in Ulta, so I checked Amazon..</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is definitely not the orginnal Joico K-Pak product. As others have noted its smells horribly different then&lt;br /&gt;the store same bought products. It does smell like it has been mixed with vaseline brand lotion. There is a very light hint&lt;br /&gt;of what the product usually smells like in the conditioner. The shampoo was horrible. Be wary. My family use to&lt;br /&gt;own a hair salon and this product was all I had used. Maybe its just the product I received as a few others have made similar&lt;br /&gt;reviews. Please go to nearest salon and compare the smell and tell me your discoveries.</li>
            <li> Luv this combo!  I usually get them from the salon I get my hair done, but this is bigger and a.great price.  I especially luv the Conditioner it really makes a big difference in my hair.  My hair is actually in great shape and these products keep it looking nice and. soft and shiny.  I get my hair colored at the salon but it never looks damaged. My hairdresser recommended it.  Once my husband thought I&#x27;d been to the salon  but I only had washed it!  I will keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Great products as described</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. But not what I expected. It leaked every where in the box and it smelt awful!</li>
            <li> Great product as described. I&#x27;ve ordered this twice now &amp; will continue to do so its a really great deal. Both have pumps included.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner leaves my hair feeling soft and silky.I am glad I decided to purchase, worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.... Leaves residue on hair, plus side, smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this brand! Great product! Very nice smell! Shipping was fast and the pump tops were taped down well!! No spills :) Only 4 stars because I ordered &amp;#34;reconstruct&amp;#34; and received &amp;#34;color therapy.&amp;#34; I didnt return, and don&#x27;t really mind because I was low on mine anyway, but I wanted reconstruct to use on my kids. Its a great protein product. Will reorder reconstruct. 2nd times the charm! ;)</li>
            <li> Just like the ones at the Hair Salon at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;Nice results with use.&lt;br /&gt;The pump allows easy use.</li>
            <li> I repeatedly use this product and I really like it. However, this item shipped by Hayward Beauty came damaged and spilled. I lost about 1/3 of the conditioner that leaked out and made a mess and the pump is broken so I cannot easily use this product without transferring to another container. In order for me to get a refund, I have to send it back which is NOT feasible to do for an item that is already leaking.</li>
            <li> I have fine, long, blonde hair. Have been using these for years and love them.</li>
            <li> Arrived with the contents spilled out.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the bottles, I would have figured the sender would have tried to make the product better packaged so I wouldn&#x27;t lose half of the product I purchased, that didn&#x27;t work.  The packaging was horrible and the shampoo doesn&#x27;t feel or smell the original that I would have purchased in a regular salon.  It has a sour foul smelling to it.  The shampoo is fine, the conditioner is what really bothered me.  I wouldn&#x27;t say I hate the product, but the one I recieved from this sender wasn&#x27;t the greatest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure that this was the real mccoy.  I bought joico in a salon and loved it.  It seems as though this does notbwork as well.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is outdated, don&#x27;t know but it does notbwork well.</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly to my door, which I was impressed with. Unfortunately, it has the \\&quot;pump\\&quot; style of lid, so there was some spillage in shipping, which I hadn&#x27;t really expected based on the picture. Those liters are the type that I had before, with no pump. In any case, I really love this product. It&#x27;s really helped a lot with the damage my hair suffers from all of the coloring I do to it. My hair feels somewhat normal again. :) I also somehow manage to make these bottles last almost an entire year. I think it&#x27;s a good value, personally.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff. It works so good on my grand daughter&#x27;s curly hair. No tangles. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> good clean-smelling shampoo. strong conditioner, maybe a little too strong. much protein in it. leaves hair very very very non-dry.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo and condition- esp for the cost!&lt;br /&gt;I have curly, thick hair. It leaves my hair soft and not weighted down. Great product!</li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that this would repair my somewhat damaged, frizzy hair but I swear it made it worse.  It took so much shampoo like a minimum of 3+ quarter size to get coverage and lather.  Ridiculous.</li>
            <li> This is not the real Joico KPak - it&#x27;s awful and I&#x27;m not sure how this can be sold like this. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s even actually made by Joico????</li>
            <li> Received item very fast! This product is amazing. This combined with argan oil are the only products that have kept my color treated hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel AMAZING!</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product. i can&#x27;t believe it took me so long to find this product. it is ph balanced for african american hair.  by optimizing ph levels the product encourages hair to lay flat and smooth. saves time by shorting the required steps for straightening my hair. i have seen an improvement in the texture of my hair in just two uses.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are amazing!  I have very long, very dry, very wavy hair (not color treated though), and often suffer from frizz and breakage just from everyday brushing and styling.  I have been using these products for about a month or so, and have noticed a significant difference in the health and behavior of my once unruly hair.  It is the only product I&#x27;ve found that gives enough slip after washing to run a comb through wet without breaking (and for those of you with wavy or curly hair you know that wet combing is a must- once it is dry you can&#x27;t really because it poofs), while still not weighing down my hair or giving it a residue feel.  It has definitely given me a better and better result over time, too, which I haven&#x27;t been able to say for anything else I have tried. Now all that being said, I did not purchase through amazon.  I love amazon for a lot of things, but I would wonder if these are really the salon grade products you get here?  I went to Ulta- and I usually do since a friend and cosmetology school grad tipped me off that they are one of the few places open to the public where you can get salon grade products at a bit of a better value than the actual salon mark up.  Interesting note: if you visit or are familiar with these stores- they boast both drug store and salon brands- two separate sections.  You will see some of the same things sitting in both sections- well, they are not the same.  The SAME STORE offers both the drug store and salon version.  Two separate products, two separate prices.  Check it out... it&#x27;s real.  So buyer beware indeed- but if you get your hands on the real stuff, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love this brand! Makes hair so soft</li>
            <li> This set is a nice size and price.  It smells ok and is fairly moisturizing.  It&#x27;s not the best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve used, but it does the trick!  Next time, I&#x27;ll splurge on something a little more indulgent.</li>
            <li> All was wonderful . Shipped fast</li>
            <li> I used to buy this from a salon. It&#x27;s amazing. Leaves my hair strong and feeling like silk! Very worth it</li>
            <li> Joico is one of the best products on the market. It is very popular and works extremely well. I would recommend going to reddoorbeauty.com if you are looking to purchase hair products. They have the best prices and free shipping.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is absolutely gorgeous! I love it. My hair is so smoothy and shiny with it!!!</li>
            <li> I have a perfectly healthy head of hair, it&#x27;s mostly salt-and-pepper grey, it&#x27;s not colored or highlighted in any way - it&#x27;s all natural - it&#x27;s neither dry nor oily, the ends don&#x27;t split, it&#x27;s shiny, easy to manage and style, and I have no dandruff or other scalp issues.  I don&#x27;t need anything special for my hair - all I need a shampoo to clean it and a conditioner to soften/condition it.  That&#x27;s it - nothing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I DO have, however, is a stunning remodeled bathroom that includes a tile shower that set me back THOUSANDS of dollars.  When it was done, I could not bear to detract from the beauty of this tile shower by having some gaudy bright blue, pink, green, orange or any other butt-ugly-brightly-colored bottles of shampoo and conditioner sitting in plain sight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These two bottles look just fine against the tile work in my shower, the product inside cleans and conditions my hair beautifully, and because I&#x27;m the only one who uses it, it LASTS TWO YEARS.  That&#x27;s right - it cost me about 4 CENTS PER DAY to have clean and manageable hair, and a great looking shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> Arrived exactly how I ordered.  My favorite brand!</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic but didn&#x27;t really do as much for my hair as I&#x27;d hoped.  And then I was stuck with like a gallon of it.  Super affordable, though maybe not the best product for my fine/processed/color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and a great product. My hair is greatly improved because of this product. Keeps your hair smooth and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I&#x27;ve used it for years, but was suddenly having issues finding it in salons. This set is great for people who use heat styling every day. I experience way less breakage and the protein doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like the Paul Mitchell and Redken similar products do.</li>
            <li> Joico is a fantastic product and have been using for years.  The distributor on the other hand...  The bottles were packaged in a baggie.  When opened there was a little liquid on the top of these bottles.  I would not reorder from them again.</li>
            <li> As mentioned in other reviews, the pumps were not sealed or taped and when I opened the box there was conditioner all over the place and the top of the bottle was all dented and the pump was all crocked.  It was a mess and I was missing a good inch and a half of product.  But shipping aside, I always love Joico products.  I typically buy the products during the liter sales at a local store, but I was buying this as a Christmas gift, so I had to find it somewhere else.  Good price, but disappointed in the shipping and in having to give a dented bottle with missing product for a gift.</li>
            <li> As a product it is one of my favorites however the packaging was almost nonexistent and the conditioner broke open and leaked all over the box and even leaked out the box on to my porch. Received a refund from amazon as they were not able to replace the item.</li>
            <li> Have blonde long hair and taken into account how much I have treated my hair with chemicals, this product has def made my hair more healthier looking and manageable after wash. My hairstylist uses this herself and swears on it. Would def recommend it</li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t do thing to repair or reconstruct hair, it doesn&#x27;t even give moisture to your hair.  Aveda products are the best.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that these were that great for the price. They didn&#x27;t help my hair look better at all and I just gave them away to one of my friends after using it for two weeks.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is the only shampoo and conditioner that I have used that my hair does not fall out.</li>
            <li> In our house, we use this shampoo &amp; conditioner on Caucasian and African-American hair. It works great, leaves hair smelling nice, feeling soft, looking shiny.  I was a little skeptical about the 1-minute conditioner, but works great.  It&#x27;s also a much better value to buy the set than the individual products.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! My stylist suggested I get it and I wish I had known about it sooner. It&#x27;s really amazing the way it leaves your hair feeling. It doesn&#x27;t coat your hair like other shampoos and conditioners. My stylist gave me the tip to towel dry my hair after I shampoo then add the conditioner and let it sit for like 3 mins. The reason being is bc there are microscopic holes/pockets in your hair that fill with water and if you don&#x27;t towel dry it first then the conditioner doesn&#x27;t have the chance to get in there and do its job. My mom tried it and loves it too...she has really course thick hair that she constantly dyes...her hair was the softest ive ever felt it after just one use. my hair is also color treated, but its straight and fine, this product leaves my hair soft and bouncy! Normally conditioners leave my hair heavy and even oily looking, but I leave this conditioner in my hair for 3 mins daily  and I haven&#x27;t noticed any problems! Trust me get this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I use this kit every day!&lt;br /&gt;I like to dry my hair and this product is perfect, the look is always beautiful.</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought this shampoo was after looking at the reviews. I am somewhat disappointed with the way this shampoo works on my hair. My hair has become dry and there is no shine to it. Before Joico I was using Dove shampoo and it worked well on my hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from amazon after trying it from the store. I paid $15.00 for 8 oz and this is a much better price. It will last me a lot longer too. It makes my hai silky, shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Good product for dry and thining hair.  It restores the strength and body.  Smells great too!  I have purchased many times and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> I love that I can come to Amazon and find brand name shampoo and conditioner for great prices! This particular brand is my favorite. It makes my hair look and smell great! It just takes a couple of pumps for my medium long hair so the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I love this product usually but am a bit bummed the wrong product was sent. I had ordered the Joico Color Therapy (as shown in picture), but received Reconstruct.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. It&#x27;s really my go to!! Seems to work much better for me than more expensive brands such Kerastase, Loreal Professional, and Pureology. I would highly recomend it if you have dryer/course type of hair. I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down like most other moisturizing shampoos. So you can still enjoy volume as well!</li>
            <li> I use this 1-2/week and love how good my hair feels afterward.  I have thick, curly hair and this helps manage it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Joico on and off since I remember and I always come back. KPack gives me back that silky feel I love to have. It&#x27;s hard for me to find something I like, I have curly hair that is very thin and I don&#x27;t have a lot of it. Needless to say I have to be careful of what I used because a lot of things weigh it down and easily cause buildup. Joico KPack always brings the good out in my locks.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from an itchy and flaky scalp every time that we run out of this shampoo and conditioner. Was happy that Amazon had such great deals on this product, because nothing works as well for his straight-plus-curly-hair combo except this product.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my hair soft. I don&#x27;t know why Iever try any other shampoo. Amazon carries it for cheaper than the beauty supply store!</li>
            <li> love how this makes my hair feel healthier and soft without the extra weight.....I feel it improves the hair shaft</li>
            <li> Excellent. Will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> This will change your life! I have damaged my hair from bleaching and coloring and this shampoo and conditioner brought my hair back to life!</li>
            <li> Pumps are great for ease of use. I have dry, thick course hair and this is a great every day combo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo and conditioner before, but it is expensive beyond belief if you find it in stores.  This set was totally affordable, so I definitely jumped on a good bargain when I saw it.  That being said, the K-Pak shampoo is great for you if your hair is already healthy, but it works wonders for you if your hair is kind of dried out.  Whether it&#x27;s dried out from chemical treatment, heat damage, sun damage, or maybe you live in a place that has water so hard it&#x27;s pretty much acid if it hits your eyes (like me!)...this stuff is a lifesaver.  We&#x27;ve changed out our shower head in the past to soften the water, but my hair still felt kind of...icky.  This shampoo and conditioner does the trick, and it&#x27;s well worth it.  I have to wear my hair every day.  I&#x27;ve been using the same bottle for over a month now, and I have medium long hair (mid way between shoulders and elbows), so it definitely lasts.  A great purchase.  I will definitely keep ordering it from amazon.</li>
            <li> I used this kind of shampoo before but what these people are selling is nowhere near what it should be. It is either fake or very VERY old. It smells horrible!!! Waste of money. I will have to throw these away and go buy the real product somewhere else.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is ok. but, the conditioner suxs. I needed 12 pumps just to get enough in my hair. Will never buy again&amp;#62; waste of money</li>
            <li> First time using this product. Excellent brand !!! I will definitely buy more. Met completely my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;My hair loved it.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I expected that it will help my curly damaged hair to get a good condition but I found something better for doing it in the same pries.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair kind of straw like. I am continuing to use it because it was so expensive. After this I&#x27;m going back to regular store brand.</li>
            <li> As a consumer, I expect to get what I pay for.  My hair feels drier than ever before after using this product.  I have used Joico in the past and have now been made aware that there are now knock off hair care products.  What a disappointment!!!  This stuff does not seem like the what I have used in the past and my hair is now paying the price.  Wish I could get a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never again!!!!</li>
            <li> I usually get the blue bottle, but I decided to try this one.  I am definitely going back to the blue bottle.  my hair is not as soft with this gold.  leaves hair frizzie.</li>
            <li> Joico K-Pak products are wonderful for my hair! I damage my hair with foils&#x27; and perms&#x27; my hair so using the Joico products keeps my hair healthy, soft and totally manageable-</li>
            <li> I like my old type (same brand) better but this works great too.</li>
            <li> Definitely NOT kpak . Not the right texture, not the right color, does not smell good like kpak, and is certainly not as efficient. For any soak into hair to repair like kpak, it feels like it just sits on the surface. Not the worst shampoo and conditioner but not the best either and Certainly not Joyco kpak</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> The shampoo was broken n liking</li>
            <li> I use this Joico K-Pak along with Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Special Shampoo (Green), and my hair is so healthy. Looks fabulous when I style it and feels so nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard great things about this shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair that is naturally dark brown, but I dye it bleach blonde.&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair correctly and take very good care of it, but I wanted to find something that would reverse some minor damage from the flat iron. I did some research and came to this shampoo. As always, I found it cheaper on Amazon vs. Kohls and other websites.&lt;br /&gt;The bottles came packaged well, so there were no leaks when I recieved the package. The bottles are HUGE and come with the pumps which is awesome. Great value. The reason I only gave it 3 stars out of 5 is because I don&#x27;t know what the hype really is. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this shampoo and conditioner are better than some of the typical cheaper products out there {Pantene, Suave, etc.} but it didn&#x27;t &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; me. I don&#x27;t really see much improvement in my hair. It gets my hair clean just like any other shampoo but it really didn&#x27;t re-construct my hair like other reviews say. Also, the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t have the best smell.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this shampoo and conditioner are just average. If you&#x27;re looking for something to re-construct your hair that is bleach blonde, and you&#x27;re willing to pay a little bit more, I would suggest Bed Head Bleach Blonde Re-constructor.</li>
            <li> Love Joico shampoo and conditioner but I find after a while there is a bit of build up on my hair. This is typical of many products like this. Overall, I think joico is a great product and smells good too.</li>
            <li> This is the reconstructing shampoo and conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using the Color Therapy duo, but accidentally purchased this type instead. It does say its safe for colored hair so I was fine to change it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt smell as nice and I found that it reconstructs ZIP! I color my hair, and need a good shampoo and conditioner, this one is no better than store bought. The Color therapy one is special, this one isnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cleans and conditions...thats about it.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used (in the $20 - $30 range) saved my hair.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is expired and like a thin body lotion.</li>
            <li> I discovered Joico K-pak while I was in cosmetology school and I fell In love with it. This shampoo and conditioner has saved my hair. When I started using this it was totally fried and damaged from hair color. My hair is coarse and I have a lot of it this conditioner works wonders and smells great too!</li>
            <li> it is not original. i bought this and upon use it seems different from the ones i have been using from a long time.</li>
            <li> Usually use paul mitchell (and still do) but am using this as well. Small amount of product did leak out, but not enough to complain (during shippment).</li>
            <li> K-Pak is awesome.  I way overprocess my already thin fine hair.  Although I&#x27;ll never have long lusioius locks as long as I keep abusing them, K-Pak helps tremendously with the breakage without waying it down.  That&#x27;s no easy feat.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure this is not genuine, Ive used this product for years and this is the first time I have not purchased it from a salon...the shampoo is runny and smells bad and the conditioner feels and smells like cheap lotion....I will NOT be purchasing online again, lesson learned.</li>
            <li> Thought this would be better than the joico in the blue bottles but was really disappointed.  This kept my hair dry and frizzy. Only continued to use it as I didn&#x27;t want to waste my money spent on it. Will not buy again though.</li>
            <li> This was definitely fake. I am a biochemist, and I know how to identify chemicals. But you don&#x27;t have to a be a biochemist to identify soap, which was I found in the conditioner bottle. I can&#x27;t help but think that the liquid soap was supposed to go in the shampoo bottle, as the &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; almost seemed like real (but still subpar) conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t been able to find joico products anywhere. If you really want some, go to a salon. The rest is fake.</li>
            <li> Product is FAKE! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve been duped, and I&#x27;m generally smart about these things. I&#x27;ve been using this &#x27;mystery&#x27; shampoo and conditioner for over 6 months and I&#x27;m not only experiencing thinning, but my scalp is sore. I did some research and discovered that either one of two things happened….&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. FAKE: Professional companies like Joico, Redken, ISO, Wella, Matrix, etc., and so on DO NOT sell their products to drug, discount, stores - they just don&#x27;t. Part of their agreement &amp; policy with hair stylists is that they will only sell their product to Salons so that the customer has to get the product at &#x27;the&#x27; Salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. EXPIRED: Companies that have the real product, that are old -- way past their shelf life and should have been thrown away - decide to re-sell them to another outlet. So there are some that are in fact, real, but past their shelf life. Again, they charge too much for them and the safety is compromised with an out-of-date preservative. There is virtually no way to tell which one of these problems is which. But the point is neither are any good, and both should be avoided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the sake of your hair, scalp and possibly your health…….BUYER BEWARE!</li>
            <li> I bought this product cause I used it before and I really liked the results, but the conditioner isn&#x27;t was I expected.</li>
            <li> after a while it didn&#x27;t make any difference in the feel of my hair so i will not re-purchase</li>
            <li> I took a gamble on this product based on the reviews I read here because most of them said there was some spillage during transit, but my hair is so fried and dyed it really needs some TLC. Let&#x27;s start with pricing first. My local drug store sells the 10.1 ounce shampoo and conditioner for roughly $17 a piece. So by ordering this duo, which is the 33.8 ounce,(at the time I wrote this) I&#x27;m paying around $20 (per bottle) for more than 2x the amount. I&#x27;m not including shipping in this estimate. So money-wise, I feel this is a good deal since this amount will probably last me several months if not a year at least. Next I&#x27;ll move on to packaging. This was the area I was the most concerned about, and is also why I feel I should write this review. I had this order fulfilled by Amazon, that was important to me. These bottles have a PUMP, like a soap dispenser, not a pop top like the picture shows; so that&#x27;s where it can lead to leakage. I was fortunate enough to receive my product intact with no spillage. Both bottle pumps were in the locked position, and sealed with just the right amount of tape. The bottles also came in a plastic bag. I am completely satisfied with how it was packaged and shipped, so if anything I&#x27;d recommend having this fulfilled by Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;As to how well this product works, let me first tell you about my hair. I live in an extremely humid climate, so I fight my hair with a flatiron almost everyday. My hair is also long so I turn the heat up high so I don&#x27;t stand there all day making my hair pin-straight. To make the damage worse, I also dye it every few months or so. So split ends, breakage and frizz are a regular thing for me. I&#x27;m basing this review off of a one-time use, and I will provide an update after using this for a month or so. I was using the sulfate-free repair system from L&#x27;Oreal before switching to this stuff. I should also mention that the K-pak reconstruct is safe for color-treated hair, says it right on the bottle. I followed the instructions on the bottles and sealed the cuticles of my hair with a cold water rinse. To be fair, please note that I am also using the Joico K-pak split-end mender, Moroccan argan oil, and TRESemme heat styling spray in my hair as well. I straightened and styled my hair with my flatiron like I normally do. Already I can feel a difference, my hair is much softer than before and I&#x27;m barely seeing any frizz at all! The shine is about the same as before, so nothing to be said there. All in all, I am satisfied with the product.&lt;br /&gt;There is one more thing I feel I should mention: I took another gamble not buying this product from a salon. On the back of the bottle it says \\&quot;GUARANTEED WHEN PURCHASED FROM A PROFESSIONAL STYLIST ONLY\\&quot;. This could be a marketing ploy, but to me, that translates to \\&quot;buyer beware\\&quot;; I am told there are counterfeit versions of Joico out there. So be very careful who you choose to buy this from, since it is a big investment. I went from spending $10 on shampoo and conditioner to about $40 with shipping. First impression, I&#x27;m liking it though. I&#x27;ll submit an update on how well this stuff maintains my hair in about a month.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: This is my update. I&#x27;ve been using the Joico K-Pack system for 7 months now and I&#x27;m down to 25% of the bottle left on the conditioner and 35% on the shampoo. (I condition more than shampoo) I&#x27;ve found that the shampoo has sulfates in it and due to how light my hair color is, the combination of sulfates and cruddy FL water strip my hair of the color. (turns brassy) I&#x27;ve since switched to the purple shampoo (which is not Joico), but keeping the conditioner and split-end mender. I&#x27;m not going to change my review, only because since then it was my choice to switch to a lighter dye, and everyone&#x27;s hair situation is different. I still feel I got the most for my money. I used to have to buy shampoo/conditioner about 1x a month, so $40 for over 7 months, not including tax is roughly $5.71 a month. So salon-grade products forthe same price as drug store. I would however, say this product is better for those with natural color. Perhaps even dark dye colors. It did leave my hair incredibly soft and manageable and with a lot less breakage, but for dyes, I truly believe that the water in my area is doing more stripping/damage than the sulfates in the shampoo. Because of my specific situation, I had to change some products (shampoo/distilled water), but if my hair ever becomes that destroyed again, this is the product I will turn to, and fulfill through Amazon. Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited about getting this because I have a k-pak that I had bought at the salon at home and I really like it.  Unfortunately, the k-pak that I received was quite a bit thinner than what I had bought at the salon and instead of a shampoo and conditioner, I ended up getting two conditioners.</li>
            <li> The bottom 50% of my caucasian hair is &#x27;fluffy&#x27; being damaged with split ends from heat styling and coloring, I first heard about the Joico system of products through using their Split End Mender. Since it was a Reconstructing product I thought I would use it in tandem with the Reconstructing Shampoo and Conditioner, which sometimes comes with the an additional bottle of their Deep Reconstructer.  As a beauty school graduate and former hairdresser I know there is a science regarding pH levels to reconstructing the hair,which I think can be different from actually CONDITIONING the hair. When I used all 4 of these products together, my hair felt extremely dry out of the shower, and I would not have dared to heat style without some type of leave-in serum, etc.  Disappointed, I moved over to Joico&#x27;s Moisture Therapy Liter Duo in the blue bottles.  What a difference between the 2 products.  So when I want to&#x27;rebuild&#x27;? my hair, like on weekends, I use the reconstructor, but when I need my hair to perform, such as for work or a special occassion, I use my Moisture Therapy Duo, dab a little Deep Reconstructor on the ends then distribute the regular Moisture Therapy Conditioner throughout and place a shower cap over my hair for the remainder of the shower. After rinsing, I apply the Split End Mender, a thicker serum, to the towel dried lower 50% of my hair, I don&#x27;t see a huge difference in the split ends, but whats done is done I suppose, and this makes me feel like I&#x27;m doing something at least.  I then distribute Joico&#x27;s Protect and Shine Serum throughout, and am happy with how the undamaged upper 50% of my hair responds to these products.  If anyone can inform me of why the Reconstructing Duo seems so drying please comment! I think that maybe your hair needs to be &#x27;restructured&#x27; before it can accept or retain conditioner? I will also be looking into a purchasing a much better hairdryer to avoid more of the same damage in the future.</li>
            <li> Took forever to  arrive but love the product.</li>
            <li> This product made my hair look and feel wonderful.  It actually helped repair the damage on my hair from coloring and the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner and you can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon.  This is the third time I have ordered it online and the first time that it leaked during shipping.  The savings definitely outweighed the tiny amount of product lost, but I had also ordered flash cards and it got all over the box they came in.  Since the cards inside were untouched it wasn&#x27;t a big deal, but I will make sure to order this separately from anything else in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is a FAKE! A KNOCK OFF! The conditioner smells horrible, its been tampered with for sure. I have REAL JOICO products and they work wonderfully. I will never shop this company again.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite shampoo and conditioner pair! I have damaged my DARK brown hair from when I went platinum blonde and this is the only thing that I&#x27;ve found to make my hair soft and natural feeling once again!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner set is a good price and a great value. My hair is frequently colored and suffers from a lot of damage. This shampoo and conditioner has helped it look and feel so much healthier. I swear, I&#x27;m even finding less hair in the shower after I wash it. I believe it&#x27;s preventing breakage.</li>
            <li> This K-PAK Shampoo &amp; Conditioner really helped my hair to be soft and silky.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great deal compared to salon prices! Only bummer is that the seller didn&#x27;t do the best job with packaging and some of the shampoo had leaked into the package. Nonetheless, I will buy this again and fully recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been buying Joico products for the past 6 years and I can guarantee you, you won&#x27;t find better quality product for the money!!! Or better ( genuine) quality product, period!&lt;br /&gt;This product restores your hair, especially when it&#x27;s damaged, colored, dry, processed. In a week your hair will slow down the falling out process, you will feel silky smooth feeling to it, and manageable hair will be your gift from Joico!&lt;br /&gt;About a month ago I went to get my hair colored at a fine salon, they used only Redken product, and they tried so hard to sell it to me by saying my hair was damaged and lifeless ( I love how certain hairdressers love to put your hair down, just to sell you their product!), but as soon as the Stylist asked me what I used for my hair ( and I said Joico), he had absolutely NOTHING  to say to me, because he knows I&#x27;m using a very good product that used to be sold ONLY in Salons ( which is how I got introduced to it in the first place). So, there you have it, ladies and gents, best product for your hair, truly the best!! It works for everyone, especially the restorative system series. I also recommend Deep Penetrating Reconstruct in conjunction with Shampoo and Conditioner, sold here. I want to thank this seller for delivering this product fast, well packaged, no leaks, no mess! Will definitely buy it again from this very same seller! Enjoy!!!</li>
            <li> After reading some comments I was really worried that the shampoo and conditioner would spill out from transport, but it was packaged very well when I got, so no worries on spilling. Also, the shampoo and conditioner work great! It smells so great, and makes my hair feel so soft. It also leaves my hair looking so much silkier and healthier than before.</li>
            <li> I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for years.  I have 3C curly hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight it down.  LOVE IT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and this is one of the best deals I found. The only downfall was when I received my package the pumps were broke off of the bottles.</li>
            <li> One bottle was cracked during shipping and made a mess.</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable. I have been using these products for a month and I like how my hair seems to be fuller and shinier....overall just more healthy. The shampoo and conditioner also smells really nice and leaves my hair smelling great!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this shampoo and conditioner by my stylist and immediately fell in love.  When it came time to purchase more, I immediately came to amazon.com to see if I could get it cheaper.  I did!  Got twice the volume for half the cost!  Shipped nicely-no leakage from either bottle.  If you&#x27;re looking for an amazing reconstructive shampoo, you have to try this!  It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all &amp; I, virtually, have no split ends even though I use a straightening iron several times a week!</li>
            <li> This Shampoo and Conditioner is perfect! My hair feels and looks greats and smells so good! I&#x27;ve used Paul Mitchell for years and this knocks it out of the park!</li>
            <li> I feel I should write a review to clarify some things about this set.&lt;br /&gt;First off, this price is amazing. Let&#x27;s face it, it&#x27;s the same as going to a professional beauty store, so that&#x27;s a huge plus.&lt;br /&gt;Second, this is a reconstructing shampoo and conditioner. So for the people looking to use it to get rid of dryness, this isn&#x27;t for you. Protein reconstructers are known to STRENGTHEN not SOFTEN. It actually can cause dryness and breakage if OVER used. It&#x27;s purpose is to reconstruct and strengthen. And so it should be used hand in hand with a moisturizing set and not as a daily shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;From my experience with it, it works wonders. It makes my over bleached hair feel like virgin hair again. It has a p.H. of 4.5 - 5.5 (the same p.H. level as your hair), so I use this after any chemical process to bring the p.H. back to normal. It definitely pulls it&#x27;s weight.&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for something good to strengthen your hair, this the best thing you can do for it. But please do not over use this. Stuffing one&#x27;s hair too full of protein, can cause snapping. So use it with with a good moisturizing set for your softness. Good luck ladies. I hope this helps someone! :)</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy about how I received this product. When I opened the box there was shampoo everywhere! At least 1/4 of the bottle spilled out.</li>
            <li> I recently went natural and I was told about this product from a retired hair stylist when I was looking at this product in TJ Maxx.  I took her advise and decided to try the K-Pak intense hydrating conditioner first. I instantly fell in love with it! The conditioner makes my hair extremely soft and manageable.  I went back to TJ Maxx to purchase the shampoo and the whole shelf of K-Pak was sold out. Apparently Joico K-Pak products are hard to keep on the shelves. I searched Amazon and found out that they sell the whole product line. To make a long story short I am NEVER going back to my old products. I see a dramatic difference in my hair :-)  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥</li>
            <li> I gave this shampoo and conditioner a fair chance, about a month or so of use. My hair is as dry as ever. The shampoo seems watered down.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it now and then, for no other reason than it was costly.</li>
            <li> i purchased this product for both myself and my mom as a gift. I love the smell of the shampoo and a little goes a long way..i&#x27;ve noticed less breakage and my hair is left very soft ...I would recommend you give it a try since your getting such a large quanity it should last you a good long while if if like myself i wash my hair every day and when it&#x27;s hot out during the summer wash my hair as much as 2 or 3 times a day..</li>
            <li> Not the same ...... I rather pay the price for original than for a knock off</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is absolutely fabulous.  It smells delicious and I can feel a noticeable difference in the health of my hair.</li>
            <li> Items arrive on time and as described</li>
            <li> Good price as this product is getting hard to find in stores/salons near me.  My only complaint is it leaked during shipping!  Was a bit of a mess to clean up on arrival, otherwise still best shampoo/conditioner out there for the money.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells, the way it makes me hair feel and especially the way it makes my hair look! However. I can&#x27;t use it!!! I get blisters along my scalp line and pimples/rash all over my neck, shoulders and back.</li>
            <li> Due to the use of \\&quot;DIY\\&quot; hair color, the end result for me, was brittle, frizzy, dull, and straw-like hair. So, my answer was to cut it short, and leave it alone. The stylist, obviously seeing the damage I had done, highly recommended the Joico K-pak. Thinking I would see phenomenal results, have shiny, soft, maneagable hair, I gladly purchased the product. When I arrived home, I jumped in the shower to try out my new hair goodies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I applied the shampoo, and enjoyed the smell (the stylist stated that it has the smell of pina colodas...I don&#x27;t necessarily smell that, but there is a slight hint of coconut maybe pineapple...it could be the power of persuasion at work too...maybe it doesn&#x27;t smell like tropical fruit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; As I began to work the shampoo in, I noticed that my hair was getting globbed together, and was nearly impossible to rinse. My hair felt matted, unnaturally thick, and almost felt melted together. I rinsed the shampoo out the best I could, and I then applied the conditioner. This immediately fixed the issue the shampoo caused. I left the conditioner on while I showered and shaved. After I got out of the shower, I towel dried my hair, applied some heat-protectant to my hair, and blow dried. The outcome was anything but impressive. I have gotten the same exact results with the cheap versions of salon brands, as I did with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Needless to say, I finished the bottles. The results stayed consistent. In my experience, I truly have found that this product works no better than what you can find in your local discount stores.) I&#x27;m going to go back to organic and/or all-natural products. I was trying to steer clear of using chemically-laden products, but I bought into the stylist&#x27;s sales tactics. Oh...and just a side tip....(if you&#x27;re at all interested): I have discovered benefits to using a cold water/raw organic apple cider vinegar rinse. I have also experienced great results by adding a little pure tea tree oil to my shampoo. Just Google for proper dilution.mpoo. Just Google for proper dilution.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioning regime for dry or color-processed hair, by far -  love this stuff, and I&#x27;ll keep ordering it!  I give this particular item three stars because of the terrible packaging, however.  These shipped in a box without any padding inside, and instead the liter bottles were taped with clear packaging tape to a cardboard backing.  The tape was so sticky that, after I struggled for a few minutes to peel it off, it took me 20+ minutes to get the stickiness off the bottles using Goo Gone.  You might say it was unnecessary to Goo Gone the bottles, but they were literally so sticky from the tape that they would have been a nuisance to use in my shower.  So unfortunately this is a great product, but with terrible packaging!</li>
            <li> I have used many different professional products (Kenra, Rusk, WEN, etc) and this is by far my favorite! I use it everyday without it weighing my hair down. The protein strengthens hair and repairs damage, causing it to grow faster! (Which is my goal right now!) Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I get mine from ULTA which cost me almost $70.00&lt;br /&gt;When I bought it about 2 years ago my hair was a disaster and I knew I needed to invest on good shampoo&amp;conditioner. Glad I did! I saw results in 2 weeks of use that said its been my shampoo conditioner since. I work in one very well known store banana republic &amp; my clients always always compliment my hair. &amp; of course ask what I use to keep it that way. It&#x27;s healthy and I color my hair every 5 weeks and oh did I mention I got my hair brutally damaged by going from black hair to blonde hair! &amp; guess what shampoo&amp;conditioner was there to save it! I love this product and I wanted to save a half what I spend at the store so I ordered it here on AMAZON. packaging was GREAT, delivery was AMAZING cause came earlier then expected and price is UNBEATABLE!</li>
            <li> I have used Joico K-pack for almost 5 years now and have no doubt that it&#x27;s the best product on the market out there for dry, damaged or color-processed hair.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to order it online, but ... When it arrived it was both Shampoo and Conditioner packed in the padded USPS envelope. No box!&lt;br /&gt;Ok, no problem! Open the envelope, Conditioner is ok, pump is in place but the Shampoo pump is completely snapped off and broken.&lt;br /&gt;So I immediately contact the Seller and let them know about the problem. Then begins a week-long correspondence between myself and Seller. It takes them a whole day to answer me!&lt;br /&gt;They gave me a run around and in the end I just wanted a working pump-nothing more! They reported that the pump is on back order and told me that of have to wait. And I&#x27;d have to send the broken Shampoo bottle back and then get a replacement! Again, losing time and not having my product. Meanwhile, I am running out of product since both my husband and I use it together. I ended up ( thank God for amazon&#x27;s superior customer service ) getting all my money back and ordering from another seller just the pump. Beware, this company does not handle their problems very well. The product, however, is AWESOME. I have not used this Seller&#x27;s product yet, but generally Joico K-pack brings out health and beauty out of your hair. The best product I&#x27;ve ever tried and it works amazing!</li>
            <li> perfect for my hair, very happy with this product,&lt;br /&gt;I have curly , heavy hair, like it very much, try it for your self</li>
            <li> Its a great product, but I have to say, for the price is not worth it. There&#x27;s some better stuff out there.</li>
            <li> after I use this shampoo and conditioner, my hair is great!!!!  I really want to recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> I orginally got this product rom mu hair salon at a much higher price, I love the product and price offered by this company it really is a win win!</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible!! I have bought this product before from the salon and it was amazing, this was FAKE!!! It didn&#x27;t smell the same and absolutely did not work the same as Joico! Do not purchase this!!!!!</li>
            <li> The pump was broken, it didnt work, the smell wasnt the same, ive used this brand before i know what it does for my hair and what it should smell like.  I had ordered this on amazon before, and this time, the products i got from this seller is either very very old, quality damaged or fake product.  It does not make hair feel soft like it&#x27;s supposed to, it smells weird, and the pump was broken...Very disappointed and will not ever buy anything from this seller again.. i do not recommend</li>
            <li> It leaked and that is why it only got three stars I love this product and this has never happend before.</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft after using this and seems to be growing better and I have noticed it doesn&#x27;t fall out as much</li>
            <li> This has alcohol, urea(yeah, that&#x27;s right, urine!), formaldehyde, and a laundry list of icky harsh stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Sure it smells good and makes your hair appear healthier but it is not helping you!</li>
            <li> The hair stylist used this product on my hair and I loved it so I bought some. I feel it has helped my severly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Shampoo bottle wasl  damaged/crushed on top.  Also the pump on the shampoo bottle was broken.  Have to go out and buy one but in the meantime having to use other pump or pour out in hand.  Not a good savings.</li>
            <li> Ships on time, love this product. You can see and feel the difference in your hair after just one wash.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is great for protein treatments on my hair but I do not like the way my hair feel when I am done with the conditioning process. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel soft the way I want it to feel. This product is great for hair strengthening though.</li>
            <li> I was looking for natural hair products at a good price/quantity ratio due to all of the sulfates, etc. in most over the counter shampoos and conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the shampoo quality and smell. It lathers up very nicely and has a good scent. However, this is moot once you use the conditioner, which seems a little dry and has a very off-putting smell (in my opinion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the quantity to price value is good, I will likely go with the organic/natural competitors I found previously at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to be frizzy and these products keep the frizz down.  I love them and would recommend them</li>
            <li> The product was recommended to me by my stylist, i have not used it on a regular basis yet to comment on that. I just received this pack and the protect and shine serum in one package and both had leakage, i&#x27;m returning it and will look for them in the stores</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is the &amp;#34;Real Deal&amp;#34;, I&#x27;ve never used this product from a salon, just from Amazon.  But have been using this product every other day, for 2 weeks now and my hair does feel softer bouncier and much shinier!  I also use Redken Extreme Anti-Snap Leave-in after too, but that has always been great.  I bleach my hair every 2 months from medium brown to platinum blonde, I really needed something to help with breakage, I&#x27;m very happy with this and the price.  I called a local salon and asked how much they charge for these and they said $35.00 EACH bottle, $70.00 total. Then I immediately bought these :)</li>
            <li> I have nearly white hair, and that definitely is not natural. So, you can probably imagine the stress I put my hair through to get it that color. K-pak keeps my hair from frying and being frizzy. It feels so soft, you&#x27;d never believe I bleach it if you felt it.</li>
            <li> This has always been, and will always be, my favorite shampoo/conditioner duo. It completely restored my hair after dying it blonde, red, and blonde again. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it feeling greasy. I use it every day and absolutely adore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as shipping goes, I had no problems. My bottles came bubble wrapped with the pumps taped down. It arrived in a timely manner and the product was exactly what I wanted. And have you seen this price? It&#x27;s nearly 50% off salon prices! I was a bit worried, at such a cheap price, that the product would be diverted but it was not. It was everything I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I had my order fulfilled by Amazon. Always a good idea.</li>
            <li> The real catch is to only use it once a week though.  The conditioner has protein that will make the hair frizzy if you use it too often.</li>
            <li> This product came secured in thick plastic with the lids/pumps firmly protected.  I usually buy this product from a salon as was impressed that it was of same quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The build-up in my hair along with well water required a major miracle.Ifound it with joico. Thanks for the help.</li>
            <li> I used this very same product for years and loved it. My hair was always in great condition. Then I moved to an area where they don&#x27;t stock it in the beauty supply. I was happy to see it here on Amazon so I ordered the combo. I am more than a little disappointed .It is nothing like it was when I used it for years awhile back. It is a different product altogether. I buy Salon Selectives for a $1 and it works as good as this Joyco product. I was telling this to a friend and she said that the company had been sold since I last used it and it definitely is not the formula we used to use years ago. It is mediocre at best. But absolutely not worth the price I paid. I am going to consult my hair dresser for a recommendation on what is as good as this product used to be. Such a shame as before it was so good. No wonder the local BS does not&lt;br /&gt;carry it. Save your money and buy another product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner have a &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; smell to them.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner.  It was recommended for being gentle on your hair and scalp.  It really is gentle, it smells great.  I just love it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really feel a difference on my hair</li>
            <li> Warning:  Based on the photo, I thought I was ordering K-pak Color Therapy.  I received the regular K-pak instead.  I&#x27;ve used and like the product, so it&#x27;s not worth the hassle of returning, but I really do prefer the color therapy version since I color and highlight my hair.  Both liters came with pumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, thin color treated hair that takes daily abuse from the flat iron and blow dryer. I HAVE to wash daily or my hair looks oily and dirty. This product keeps my hair looking healthy and minimizes the damage. I don&#x27;t find that it weighs my hair down.  The scent is just ok. Not terrible or too strong, but just a little odd.  The scent doesn&#x27;t last though, so no big deal.  It&#x27;s a great product, and the price on amazon is fantastic.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Excellent product by far I have tried so many and this one is just by far the best one in the market! Love my hair!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  Usually buy it from Ulta but found it on Amazon - no going out to store  Convenient shopping from home</li>
            <li> Received a double pack of conditioner instead of a shampoo/conditioner set AND both bottles were split at the bottom and spilled all over the box and my other products. Amazon&#x27;s response was to give me free next day shipping on a re-order(less than wow factor when you&#x27;re already a Prime member, but I needed it ASAP). And had to ask for a supervisor to get them to contact the warehouse to verify the re-order would be the correct item. No product discounts, no free stuff, just &amp;#34;sorry&amp;#34; guess you&#x27;ll have to try again.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for a great product.  I have super thick hair, that is colored frequently and my hairdresser recommended this product.  My hair feels better than it has in years.  will buy again.</li>
            <li> I received  the Shampoo and Conditioner packed and sealed, however the shampoo had small hole in it and leaked out.</li>
            <li> Great for damaged and colored hair. Very pleased with this product! Also, doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair, very light and smells great!</li>
            <li> I have been a long time Joico user, but this is the first time I have purchased Joico from Amazon as opposed to the salon.  This product is not nearly up to par with what I normally buy at the salon.  The conditioner does not give my hair that soft, slick feeling and it does not detangle my hair at all.  Additionally, both bottles leaked during shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned:  you get what you pay for.  I&#x27;m very disappointed and I will NOT be ordering from this company again.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as described. There was no leaking in package. Price was excellent for product and size you get! Will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Amazing product addicted</li>
            <li> The only problem detected was the cap of the shampoo and conditioner. Once opened, it does not seal any more. For ship, I had to improvise with a cap of a bottle of water.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo &amp; conditioner &amp; good value!&lt;br /&gt;Love this big size + the pumps are easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;My hair LOVES this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product, I have very damaged hair from hair straightening. My stylist recommended it. I&#x27;ve noticed an incredible difference in the strengthening of my hair, and I&#x27;ve also noticed I haven&#x27;t had nearly as much breakage as I use too! Its amazing . Thank you joico!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Joico product since the late 1980&#x27;s and I was never disappointed. This K-pak series should only be used when your hair needs a little TLC from chemical damage or heat damage. But after a while when the damage has been repaired, go back to maybe their Moisture recovery series. Or whatever your hair type may be.</li>
            <li> Everything wAs as it should be</li>
            <li> Love this product, so nice of the seller to include a free reconstructor conditioner. Packaged great, no leaks. Priced good and will buy again</li>
            <li> Because there&#x27;s a difference, right? I have truly never come across a hair product that does what I want it to do, until I bought these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you know the feeling.  Combing through aisle after aisle of hair products with bright green bottles with ALL NATURAL AVOCADO HONEY SHEA VITAMIN E NOURISHING plastered all over their labels vouching for your attention with carefully engineered designs specifically created to look like it would be God&#x27;s gift to your hair. But without fail, every time you take home that new damaged-hair shampoo-conditioner set and it makes it feel soft for about 3 hours after you wash it, if you don&#x27;t blow-dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re anything like me, you&#x27;ve developed some pretty formidable trust issues from shopping for a solution to damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been searching for hair products that could help with healing my hair for going on three years now. I dyed it a whole lot more than I should&#x27;ve a few years back, and I could never get it to recover, especially since my hair grows back so slowly. And I tried shampoo after shampoo and oils, hair skin &amp; nails supplements, I tried not blowdrying it and washing it with cold water, but at the end of the day my hair my hair still made the Scarecrow look like he should be on a Garnier commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I came across this magnificent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pointed in its direction by a friend of my boyfriend&#x27;s, who said that she had horribly damaged hair before she started using these. And so, in one last desperate attempt to save mine from being dry and unmanageable forever, I ordered these on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that struck me first was the understated design of the product. They weren&#x27;t bright green. They didn&#x27;t sport pictures of 15 different types of oil and vegetables and natural ingredients that are supposed to make my hair feel whole again. It was like the difference between a UFC fighter and Jackie Chan.  And it struck me that the bottle doesn&#x27;t need to convince you of anything, because the product speaks for itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week for my hair to feel about 85% better, which is huge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It healed the parts of my hair that could be saved, and even some parts that I thought were completely lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve been looking for something to make your hair feel soft, shiny, and manageable again, LOOK NO FURTHER, if your hair can be saved, this is the shampoo and conditioner set that will be able to handle the job.</li>
            <li> This is now the only shampoo and conditioner I use on my hair. My hair is highlighted to a very blonde shade and has a fair amount of damage. I also flat iron and blow dry my hair regularly. This stuff is great and helps prevent and/or decrease breakage. I really like the smell too. I didn&#x27;t at first but I got used to it and now I like it. I make sure I always use detangler (I use the Johnson &amp; Johnson kids detangler in the green bottle) to help prevent breakage when combing my hair. I also always put Moroccan oil in my hair after every time I wash it. That stuff smells heavenly, makes your hair super shiny and sleek, and is great for your hair! Every hairdresser I&#x27;ve ever been to has recommended this shampoo and conditioner. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have bleached white hair that is in decent condition. It&#x27;s not fried but its not in the healthiest condition either. I baby my hair because I&#x27;m trying to grow it out while still bleaching my roots every month. I&#x27;d been using bed head recovery which is a moisture shampoo/condition. It worked good for a while and then I noticed my hair getting dry feeling and basically just my hair was getting use to it so it was time to switch. I already use joico color endure violet and LOVE it so I decided to go with this duo. The very first use I noticed a difference in my hair! After a few uses Its like I have new hair. It&#x27;s silky, full of body, less breakage, and less hair falling out. My hair feels like healthy virgin hair!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying this set if you have bleached hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good and left hair as any other regular shampoo. I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Delivery arrived and products had unusual tape over hand pumps.  The fragrant and texture is not true to Joico.  I am not positive but it seems like the bottles where all tampered with by diluting with lotion or some other product other than Joico.  I would have returned the item but I waited too long after purchase.  These two bottles of unusual content are suspicious.  I hate it!!  But sadly stuck with a $30 mistake.</li>
            <li> My hair was in HORRIBLE condition from frequent colorings and my own poor hair decisions. It was suggested that I consider purchasing this shampoo and conditioner. I was told it would make my hair feel and look healthy again and I would love it. I was skeptical--I mean how much good can shampoo and conditioner do when your hair has been turned to straw by chemicals? To my surprise, my hair actually feels like hair again. No more dry, brittle straw for me! I have soft, shiny BOUNCY hair again! Totally, totally worth it!</li>
            <li> The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is the smell.  Excellent product I&#x27;ve been using for years and normally pay $90 for the shampoo, conditioner and styling gel.  This was a bargain and I didn&#x27;t realize there was another bottle of reconstructor with the liter set.</li>
            <li> I ordered this before I discovered Salerm.  Is OK, but for VERY dry hair, it is not as good as Salerm Balsam stuff</li>
            <li> Left my hair super soft. The smell is great. The price is better than elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing. I&#x27;m never trying any other product or brand for my hair. This product delivers results, I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now, my hair has never felt silkier and smoother. I definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> I should have been born with blonde hair but there was a mix up. This combination I had to find out of state at a family home. After two days I was a believer. Blonde hair doesn&#x27;t shine like dark hair but I feel like I have Farrah Fawcett hair finally. It is a joy now to wash and dry my hair which is soft and full and beautiful. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Like the shampoo and conditioner, does not leave hair heavy or limp.  Wished the shampoo was available for color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is a great combination.  I have thick curly hair and its hard to find a good shampoo and conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave me greasy or under conditioned.  this works GREAT!</li>
            <li> By far the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever had. I&#x27;m a loyal customer of Joico and have been for many years, will continue to sing their praises. I have highly processed hair, (double lifted) and it always makes my hair feel and look like hair again when in reality it shouldn&#x27;t be possible.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time but my hair is still dry.  I will try Wen.</li>
            <li> I have to raving statements on this product.  I purchased because a friend mentioned it was good for dry hair.</li>
            <li> Shoulder length hair...leaves my hair shiny and non-frizzy.  A lot less flat iorning needed than usual.  Will continue buying this product.</li>
            <li> The item pictured is Joico K-Pak Revitalisant, not Joico K-Pak Reconstruct. I will try to order again, this time paying attention to item picture, not description.</li>
            <li> I found the magic combination to perfect hair, finally (at 40).  I use this product in conjunction with heat (dryer and curling iron); and also take several vitamins including omega oils.  I noticed if I take omega oil regularly, my hair does not get oily (your body will create and secrete oil if it is not provided - this goes for skin, too).  At first after using the product, I get a lot of soft shiny volume (dryer), so it must be set.  But when I curl it, it&#x27;s gorgeous.  It may work with air dried hair, too.  If you blow out, you must set it.  Best conditioner I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I love this product it leaves my hair super SOFT, it may be a little pricy but its worth it</li>
            <li> Really good Shampoo and Conditioner. Really strong smell is the only downside. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just really perfume heavy</li>
            <li> One of the pumps doesn&#x27;t work so now I have to leave it open and pour it out</li>
            <li> Very good product. Great price from this vendor as well</li>
            <li> drying, stripping, awful.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve found for very dry, thin hair - especially the conditioner which greatly reduces frizz and leaves my hair very soft. I use this in conjunction with the Deep-Penetrating Reconstructor and Conditioner.</li>
            <li> I loved how this made my hair feel. It was so clean and bouncy. Also I have long hair that tangles easily, this shampoo and conditioner eliminated that problem! I&#x27;m so used to conditioners working at first but then fading, these results never faded. The only con...I hated the way it smelled! It smelled great in the shower, but for some reason when it mixed with my hair, it stunk! So strange. If it wasn&#x27;t for that id buy it again. Now I use Joico Moisture therapy and am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love this product great for dry hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I moved to a different area and my hair was so dry and lifeless. I called my old stylist and she told me to try Joico. The price was outrageous in Ulta, so I checked Amazon..great deal, great product and the shipping was great!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses this and recommends it. I bleach my hair and this product keeps it looking great and lustrous.</li>
            <li> wife loves the product thank you</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner!! I have blonde hair and it is safe to say that these products have self handely saved my hair! I&#x27;ll never buy anything else!! :)</li>
            <li> Same product as in salons. The price was about the same as in the store. I&#x27;ll only buy it again if I&#x27;m too lazy to leave my house.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner.  It has done wonders for my hair</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo &amp; conditioner! It has been safe for my color-treated hair!</li>
            <li> Works good and products stands well.</li>
            <li> Have tried using other shampoos and conditioners but always go back to Joico Products....the best for my fine, wavy, long hair.</li>
            <li> Professional lines are only guaranteed when sold by a professional hair stylist. It is cheaper to buy it off of Amazon but the product is counterfeit, diluted, or expired. Stick to buying it from your hairstylist to guarantee the authenticity. Also, with k pak if your hair is not damaged it will make your hair feel like straw. Too much protein is not good for your hair so if you notice this switch to something moisturizing.</li>
            <li> i love it ,it&#x27;s the 3* time i bougth it&lt;br /&gt;I recomended for many people&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very good product</li>
            <li> I love using this and the bottles are super large all for a great price. They were shipped fast and well packaged so there were no leaks</li>
