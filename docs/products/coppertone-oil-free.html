            <li>It feels not oily at all, and very easy to absorb.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen.</li>
            <li>This one is better than most.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>it will be better if there were spf15 for faces</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m able to put makeup over it or blend it into my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does need to be applied more often since it is not waterproof or sweat proof.</li>
            <li>Love the consistency and the smell of this.  </li>
            <li>I love the light feel to it</li>
            <li>/&gt;This goes on easy.</li>
            <li>But, it&#x27;s working just fine.</li>
            <li>It is also getting harder to find in stores, so it is great to be able to order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>it is also fragrance free.</li>
            <li>I wanted a light weight sunscreen for my face that would not leave it oily and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I use it as a daytime moisturizer in the summer, and my skin feels silky smooth without that greasy feeling of some sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>Very greasy stimulate an eye, a face is special things should be able to use in the eyes, but it didn&#x27;t work in the eyes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very oily like some and works great on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I really like this sunblock for my face, much more than any of the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>but this is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It does not clog pores and provides adequate sun protection.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly.</li>
            <li>Has to be reapplied a little more often than I thought, but pretty good protection.</li>
            <li>anyway, worth the wait.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite face sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>well, i tried it on my hand first and absorbed very fast without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I love this lotion, but it contains the exact same ingredients as Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free sunblock - and costs about twice as much (per volume).  </li>
            <li>This keeps my skin clear, goes on smoothly, blends right away and doesn&#x27;t have any odor.</li>
            <li>very much recommend this</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure you put enough on to get the level of protection you need.</li>
            <li>When I received the product, I tried on my hand at first.</li>
            <li>This is the only sunscreen out of many I have tried that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
            <li>The price has increased since I first started using it though.  </li>
            <li>I use the large version at home and buy the tubes for my purse.</li>
            <li>He really likes this product and it is not greasy.</li>
            <li>It really is oil-free.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, and hope the company never stops making it!</li>
            <li>Love this product, very gentle on your skin I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>never found a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t break out my acneic skin.</li>
            <li>Do not put this anywhere near your eyes.</li>
            <li>Not heavy and sticky.</li>

            <li> I purchased this for my husband, could not find in a store here.  He really likes this product and it is not greasy. He used it every day.</li>
            <li> We used this in Mexico and it was great.</li>
            <li> I really like this sunblock for my face, much more than any of the others I&#x27;ve used. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;For one, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out.  And also, it&#x27;s compatable with my makeup. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I use mineral makeup, so I was concerned that my makeup would end up clumping up from this.  But, it&#x27;s working just fine. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I always wait a few minutes after I&#x27;ve applied the sunblock, to give it time to absorb into my skin, THEN I&#x27;ll brush on the mineral makeup.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I very much recommend this</li>
            <li> Smells like alcohole. I dont like its smelling. Also, it contains alcohol :( which is not good for skin</li>
            <li> Very greasy stimulate an eye, a face is special things should be able to use in the eyes, but it didn&#x27;t work in the eyes let eyes sting</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen. Has a good rating from EWG, and has *almost* no smell. As close to no smell as I&#x27;ve ever experienced with sunscreen. Not greasy, absorbs quickly. I use the large version at home and buy the tubes for my purse.</li>
            <li> It really is oil-free. It does discolor some dark clothing but I guess they all do. This one is better than most.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen for the face is wonderful if you have oily/combination acne-prone skin.  I love the light feel to it-I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s sliding off my face.  I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I think think this is good quality sunscreen. I am a man and this stuff does the job for me. I think there are nicer more expensive sunscreens out there but this is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Nice face sunscreen. Doesn&#x27;t leave your face feeling greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin clear, goes on smoothly, blends right away and doesn&#x27;t have any odor. It doesn&#x27;t stain my clothing or towels. Works great. I recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> well, i tried it on my hand first and absorbed very fast without feeling oily. it is also fragrance free. love it. it will be better if there were spf15 for faces so i can wear it daily for protection from the sun on my way to work and back home. anyway, worth the wait.</li>
            <li> never found a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t burn my sensitive skin and doesn&#x27;t break out my acneic skin. ALL THE WHILE BEING UNDER MY MAKEUP</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel greasy on your face</li>
            <li> This product is great for people that are prone to breakouts from sunscreen.  It does not clog pores and provides adequate sun protection.</li>
            <li> Love this product, very gentle on your skin I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews, after lots of research on various products.  I wanted a light weight sunscreen for my face that would not leave it oily and shiny.  This fits the bill and has no odor.  It did not irritate my skin and did a great job.  You just need to make sure you put enough on to get the level of protection you need.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mother. When I received the product, I tried on my hand at first. It feels not oily at all, and very easy to absorb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just spent the last half hour trying to rinse this out of my eyes. The burning is unbelievable. For the record, I was not swimming or sweating. For Coppertone to market this product as &amp;#34;faces&amp;#34; is unfathomable. Do not put this anywhere near your eyes. I definitely would not use this with children.</li>
            <li> Good face sunscreen not too oily</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, but it contains the exact same ingredients as Coppertone&#x27;s Oil Free sunblock - and costs about twice as much (per volume).  The labels containing the active and inactive ingredients are identical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing distinguishing this product is specific to your face is the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for those who want an oil free, fragrance free sun block. I use it as a daytime moisturizer in the summer, and my skin feels silky smooth without that greasy feeling of some sunscreens.  It has proven to be very effective on my face in preventing skin damage from the sun, so I give it five stars.  It is also getting harder to find in stores, so it is great to be able to order it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen out of many I have tried that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (I have rosaceae).  I highly recommend it, and hope the company never stops making it!</li>
            <li> By far my favorite face sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried numerous drugstore facial sunscreens and every one of them made my skin break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This goes on easy. Dries quickly. Doesn&#x27;t have that \\&quot;sunscreen\\&quot; smell. And I&#x27;m able to put makeup over it or blend it into my foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It WORKS!</li>
            <li> Has to be reapplied a little more often than I thought, but pretty good protection.</li>
            <li> Has a very nice feel to it. Not heavy and sticky. My skin can breathe with this sunscreen. Does need to be applied more often since it is not waterproof or sweat proof.</li>
            <li> Love the consistency and the smell of this.  It&#x27;s not very oily like some and works great on my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it all the time.</li>
            <li> I replaces all my facial moisturizers with Coppertone Faces.  It&#x27;s non-greasy, smell-less, keeps me protected and usually I can get it from my local stores.  The price has increased since I first started using it though.  I&#x27;d buy a crateful if I thought it wouldn&#x27;t go bad over a long haul.</li>
