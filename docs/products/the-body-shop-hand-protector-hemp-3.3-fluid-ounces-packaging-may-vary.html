            <li>but I kind of like it.</li>
            <li>Your hands reveal your true age, so it is REALLY important to take excellent care of them.</li>
            <li>Great product arrived right on time!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong smell wise</li>
            <li>This hand protector seems to do a good job of helping her hands heal and become smooth again.  </li>
            <li>and this is by far the best product...</li>
            <li>I like to apply it on my neck and arms before applying a very light perfume.</li>
            <li>Amazing for dry hands and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hand cream.</li>
            <li>These work much better than O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream, 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li>I use a dab when I get to work and one more before bed.</li>
            <li>I am convinced that the Body Shop Hemp hand protector is DEFINITELY the best hand cream found anywhere !!  </li>
            <li>Great product seller shipped very quickly...will buy again..</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>and it penetrates and softens my hands (and feet) like a baby&#x27;s butt :)</li>
            <li>I also appreciate being able to buy this on Amazon and not have to drive 10 miles one way to a Body Shop store in the mall.</li>
            <li>This is the most moisturizing product I have ever found.  </li>
            <li>I love this hand lotion.</li>
            <li>Day 2 probably 75% better.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>As it is a bit greasy I use it mostly at night.</li>
            <li>(I think washing hands is better than the use of hand sanitizer).</li>
            <li>Love love love this lotion and its protection and healing it gives also</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>this has been great for splits around finger nails that can get very sore</li>
            <li>It works much better than most others and doesn&#x27;t ball up.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this hand cream and have for years.</li>
            <li>I also love the scent which reminds me of sandlewood.</li>
            <li>She is but one more in their army of supporters.  </li>
            <li>Check out more of The Body Shop&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>They sure give themselves a lot of headroom for shipping a 3.3 oz tube of hand cream.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>but I like this better on my heels.  </li>
            <li>The trick is to NOT rub the excess onto the backs of my hands when he&#x27;s home. :-)</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>So many lotions have it.</li>
            <li>I love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about it but needed it one day and tried it out.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is made from hemp and it&#x27;s magical.</li>
            <li>It has a earthy smell that my husband doesn&#x27;t love, but he&#x27;s not a tree hugger, I like the smell.</li>
            <li>This product has been simply the best solution for my sons eczema.</li>
            <li>Safe to say it will become a &#x27;must have&#x27; in our house.</li>
            <li>this is probably a recycled metal and so better for the environment than all the plastic.</li>
            <li>It mostly smells like patchouli, which I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li>My wife and I love this hand lotion.</li>
            <li>In the winter it cracks and most lotions irritate my skin, instead of heal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I say it&#x27;s okay because the smell is almost intolerable for me.  </li>
            <li>The more I&#x27;ve used it, the more I&#x27;ve gotten use to the smell.  </li>
            <li>and still love this lotion.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>This hand creme is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I think it smells like a very clean and sexy hippie.</li>
            <li>Loved the fact in was able to be shipped free and so quickly.</li>
            <li>and my hands get pretty ragged even though I wear good gloves.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not very heavy, which is wonderful, but it does smell great, and she uses it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>The best for dry skin.</li>
            <li>Best dry skin lotion ever</li>
            <li>Best thing for dry hands.</li>
            <li>it is excellent for softening dry skin on hands and feet</li>
            <li>This is one of the best hand creams out there for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li>Best stuff ever for seriously dry hands!</li>
            <li>I like all of Body Shop&#x27;s products because they are natural and work really great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;VE ORDERED HER REFILLS ON AMAZON AND AM GLAD THEY HAVE IT AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li>Smells extremely earthy, which is awesome because I dislike floral scents.</li>
            <li>It comes in a metal tube that dispenses easily.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, but does smell &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; which could be used for both a man or woman.</li>
            <li>The smell is too strong, smells like grandma; but works on the skin</li>
            <li>Strong smell</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not fan of strong smell</li>
            <li>This is the best hand cream out there because it does such a superb job of moisturizing your delicate hands.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the scent but it can be too strong of an herb smell for some people.</li>
            <li>Super smooth hands that don&#x27;t smell like a nest of butterflies in an orgy!</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well, but I personally love it for the smell alone!</li>
            <li>WITHIN A WEEK SHE FELT A HUGE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>While he doesn&#x27;t put it on as often as he should, I can see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li>Since they closed shop in mall that carried it, I am happy to be able to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>but I enjoy spreading the word on saving money.</li>
            <li>My hands stay smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li>I enjoy earthy smells.</li>
            <li>this product - great for your feet make them feel smoothier - on my second tube - will continue to purchase</li>
            <li>I enjoy the &amp;#34;natural earthy&amp;#34</li>
            <li>--the product works great on hands, but is just generally terrific for problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only do I think it&#x27;s a great product for me--but I am keeping my father supplied with this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves your skin feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li>This works great for someone who works in a dental office and who is constantly washing her hands.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that if I wash my hands after I had the lotion on for awhile, my skin continues to feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the world&#x27;s best hand cream and it lasts a long time no matter how much you wash your hands.  </li>
            <li>Smell isn&#x27;t too strong and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It is well worth the money !</li>
            <li>This hand protector is great for my dry hands in the winter.</li>
            <li>You use your hands all day every day, so a good moisturizer is essential.</li>
            <li>I use Hemp Lip Balm too for the same reason and 1 or 2 applications during the day of both these products and I am good to go no matter the weather or the conditions.</li>
            <li>This line of hand lotion is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>This stuff has really helped my hands get to feeling better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is my absolute favorite hand cream (trust me</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>and this keeps them nice and soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the wild rose cream before I make this a staple.</li>
            <li>I prefer the natural smell and it really keeps your hands feeling good all day.</li>
            <li>When my wife was pregnant I used this on her feet and legs</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly into hands.</li>
            <li>Scent is unique... not sweet or cloying but distinctive and very nice.</li>
            <li>Also, I don&#x27;t find it to be more effective than other products.</li>
            <li>Skin feels extremely smooth after the first application.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs in my hands very quickly and the scent is very neutral.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong but very pleasing.  </li>
            <li>is finally under control and he isn&#x27;t so easily injured because his skin is so much more moisturized and protected.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, and fades pretty quickly, but still.</li>
            <li>Best lotion or tough hands</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;ve tried a lot)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so mositurizing, soaks in fast, and leaves your hands smooth all day (with consistant use of course)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Every person should own a tube of this especially living in Midwest freezing temperatures.  </li>
            <li>Easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li>The scent blends well with fresh wood shavings and motor oil.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth</li>
            <li>if its worth the price they charge.  </li>
            <li>I would urge you to sign up for emails at the Body Shop because right now they have a promotion on all hemp products...</li>
            <li>The fact that we can count it coming right to our door</li>
            <li>Not greasy, just right.</li>
            <li>Wonderful healing stuff, I buy it for daughter-in-law too; she&#x27;s a hard working new mommy.  </li>
            <li>Really works well, and being an old hippie chick, I love the Patchouli scent.</li>
            <li>He loves this cream because it doesn&#x27;t have a flowery/strong scent (the light scent doesn&#x27;t bother him, and he&#x27;s very sensitive to smells) and it WORKS.</li>
            <li>This is a great hemp based, hard working moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A friend was given a tube of this hand cream last year and the first time I used it I fell in love.  </li>
            <li>Thanks you!</li>
            <li>It helps my skin stay soft and smooth, even through the winter.</li>
            <li>Cannot recommend enough!!! :)</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, it smelled exactly like saw dust from pine lumber.  </li>
            <li>First off it does not have a feminine smell.</li>
            <li>When I applied this cream to my hands for the first time, I was taken aback by the scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is very minimal and neutral and the consistency of the product is really nice.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve tried many different lotions and prescriptions but who wants to put steroids on their babies?  </li>
            <li>Very soft, mild fragrance</li>
            <li>Just a few days using it significantly improved my skin, although the smell is more like medication.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something natural, healthy, in an eco friendly container to fix dry anything or heal stuff, you JUST FOUND IT~!</li>
            <li>GOOD for my winter DRY hands!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Eventually it goes away and is a million times more tolerable than dry cracked fingers.</li>
            <li>While it is a bit greasy at first, it&#x27;s quickly absorbed and leaves my hands soft &amp; hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>A little goes pretty far, which is good because it is on the pricey side.</li>
            <li>Excited to have found such a large tube!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this stuff during the winter months!!</li>
            <li>It has a strong medicinal smell that is not unpleasant but not pretty either</li>
            <li>My hands are very dry, and many hand creams just don&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li>It works well for my dry skin from excema and works better than many other products I have tried over the years..</li>
            <li>This is great stuff, as in my wife&#x27;s arthritis improved when she started using it on her hands a few months back.</li>
            <li>It is very condensed and</li>
            <li>SHE WASHES THEM SO MUCH.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>Soaks in fast and does not leave hands greasy.</li>
            <li>My wife&#x27;s been using this product for a couple of years now and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>and I really like the hemp scent.</li>
            <li>but I really like it.</li>
            <li>It works unusually well.  </li>
            <li>This really does the job when winter comes</li>
            <li>/&gt;Packaging - well, they don&#x27;t like the plastic too much, so</li>
            <li>Twist the cap on straight and it will keep the product inside.</li>
            <li>This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li>: Very.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy but conditions very well.</li>
            <li>Love that this product has a light scent, is thick and creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li>The product works very well on dry skin (hands, elbows, heels) but it does have a strong fragrance that lingers.  </li>
            <li>I mainly use it on my hands at night and it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing and will cure excessively dry skin if used daily together with the hemp hand wash from the Body Shop.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine for feet because they are far enough away from him.  </li>
            <li>ago or more keep price down</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even found it to last up to 2 days if I use mild hand soap.</li>
            <li>stuff is pretty thick and has a earthy smell suitable for both men and women.</li>
            <li>It is not unpleasant but just different.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I thought it would work a little better for my eczema</li>
            <li>Now, until it is absorbed, it is greasy, but that only lasts about a minute.</li>
            <li>I found this product a few years ago and I love it.</li>
            <li>The overall result is totally worth using.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, thick cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li>but it works fine for other reasons.</li>
            <li>It has definitely helped my dry cracked hands more than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li>However, it does have an odd smell-- not necessarily bad, just not something you&#x27;d willingly put in front of your face.</li>
            <li>I am a researcher who wash the hands very frequently.</li>
            <li>Its smell is a little strong</li>
            <li>Many reviews complain that this smell is unpleasant but I love it.</li>
            <li>Even after switching to my own soap the dry skin would flare up with little provocation.</li>
            <li>It works overnight to go from dry, rough hands to smooth as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Most lotions are designed to &amp;#34;rehydrate&amp;#34; skin and they do get my hands wet, but not much else.</li>
            <li>This is very rich and a little greasy at initial application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a nurse and frequently wash my hands.</li>
            <li>She never is completely healed from this, but it relieves some of the pain by helping to prevent the skin from cracking and splitting.</li>
            <li>my hands were at least 50% better with one application.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use this stuff, as any hand lotion feels greasy to me (and my skin is naturally a bit oily, so I don&#x27;t need it).  </li>
            <li>I am a professional chef who also happens to suffer from severe OCD</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much, just a tiny dollop.</li>
            <li>You can buy this directly from The Body Shop for $20, but via Amazon Prime it&#x27;s almost $28??</li>
            <li>This hand protector keeps my hands soft and moisturized without any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>Masculine, not a hint of fragrance.</li>
            <li>It made my hands look old.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Works wonderfully for protecting the hands in the harsh cold weather.</li>
            <li>Since it is organic, in this case, it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about chemicals irritating your eyes after use or extra amounts of oils affecting your skin.  </li>
            <li>This was actually recommended to me by a fellow dental professional who uses it in her office, as well.</li>
            <li>This hand cream is so smooth and thick that you think you are using one of the finest hand creams in the world.  </li>
            <li>This stuff does a great job at keeping my hands from drying out from the cold, dry air in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Works well for hydrating my hands because i live in a dry climate in Denver CO.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li>I get far fewer hangnails in our dry climate using this stuff just once a day.  </li>
            <li>It keeps your hands soft for a long time even after washing your hands several times.</li>
            <li>the cracks actually healed and the dry places were soft.</li>
            <li>It smells a little like dirt, very earthy.  </li>

            <li> but this product is effective.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best hand cream!</li>
            <li> but I kind of like it.</li>
            <li> Your hands reveal your true age, so it is REALLY important to take excellent care of them.</li>
            <li> Great product arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong smell wise</li>
            <li> This hand protector seems to do a good job of helping her hands heal and become smooth again.  </li>
            <li> and this is by far the best product...</li>
            <li> I like to apply it on my neck and arms before applying a very light perfume.</li>
            <li> Amazing for dry hands and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hand cream.</li>
            <li> These work much better than O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream, 3.4 oz.</li>
            <li> I use a dab when I get to work and one more before bed.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that the Body Shop Hemp hand protector is DEFINITELY the best hand cream found anywhere !!  </li>
            <li> Great product seller shipped very quickly...will buy again..</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> and it penetrates and softens my hands (and feet) like a baby&#x27;s butt :)</li>
            <li> I also appreciate being able to buy this on Amazon and not have to drive 10 miles one way to a Body Shop store in the mall.</li>
            <li> This is the most moisturizing product I have ever found.  </li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Day 2 probably 75% better.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> As it is a bit greasy I use it mostly at night.</li>
            <li> (I think washing hands is better than the use of hand sanitizer).</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion and its protection and healing it gives also</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> this has been great for splits around finger nails that can get very sore</li>
            <li> It works much better than most others and doesn&#x27;t ball up.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hand cream and have for years.</li>
            <li> I also love the scent which reminds me of sandlewood.</li>
            <li> She is but one more in their army of supporters.  </li>
            <li> Check out more of The Body Shop&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> They sure give themselves a lot of headroom for shipping a 3.3 oz tube of hand cream.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> but I like this better on my heels.  </li>
            <li> The trick is to NOT rub the excess onto the backs of my hands when he&#x27;s home. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> So many lotions have it.</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about it but needed it one day and tried it out.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is made from hemp and it&#x27;s magical.</li>
            <li> It has a earthy smell that my husband doesn&#x27;t love, but he&#x27;s not a tree hugger, I like the smell.</li>
            <li> This product has been simply the best solution for my sons eczema.</li>
            <li> Safe to say it will become a &#x27;must have&#x27; in our house.</li>
            <li> this is probably a recycled metal and so better for the environment than all the plastic.</li>
            <li> It mostly smells like patchouli, which I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this hand lotion.</li>
            <li> In the winter it cracks and most lotions irritate my skin, instead of heal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s okay because the smell is almost intolerable for me.  </li>
            <li> The more I&#x27;ve used it, the more I&#x27;ve gotten use to the smell.  </li>
            <li> and still love this lotion.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> This hand creme is fantastic!</li>
            <li> I think it smells like a very clean and sexy hippie.</li>
            <li> Loved the fact in was able to be shipped free and so quickly.</li>
            <li> and my hands get pretty ragged even though I wear good gloves.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not very heavy, which is wonderful, but it does smell great, and she uses it on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> The best for dry skin.</li>
            <li> Best dry skin lotion ever</li>
            <li> Best thing for dry hands.</li>
            <li> it is excellent for softening dry skin on hands and feet</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hand creams out there for dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for seriously dry hands!</li>
            <li> I like all of Body Shop&#x27;s products because they are natural and work really great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;VE ORDERED HER REFILLS ON AMAZON AND AM GLAD THEY HAVE IT AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> Smells extremely earthy, which is awesome because I dislike floral scents.</li>
            <li> It comes in a metal tube that dispenses easily.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, but does smell &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; which could be used for both a man or woman.</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong, smells like grandma; but works on the skin</li>
            <li> Strong smell</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not fan of strong smell</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream out there because it does such a superb job of moisturizing your delicate hands.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the scent but it can be too strong of an herb smell for some people.</li>
            <li> Super smooth hands that don&#x27;t smell like a nest of butterflies in an orgy!</li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well, but I personally love it for the smell alone!</li>
            <li> WITHIN A WEEK SHE FELT A HUGE DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> While he doesn&#x27;t put it on as often as he should, I can see a huge improvement.</li>
            <li> Since they closed shop in mall that carried it, I am happy to be able to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> but I enjoy spreading the word on saving money.</li>
            <li> My hands stay smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> I enjoy earthy smells.</li>
            <li> this product - great for your feet make them feel smoothier - on my second tube - will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> I enjoy the &amp;#34;natural earthy&amp;#34</li>
            <li> --the product works great on hands, but is just generally terrific for problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only do I think it&#x27;s a great product for me--but I am keeping my father supplied with this.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves your skin feel smooth and hydrated.</li>
            <li> This works great for someone who works in a dental office and who is constantly washing her hands.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that if I wash my hands after I had the lotion on for awhile, my skin continues to feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is the world&#x27;s best hand cream and it lasts a long time no matter how much you wash your hands.  </li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t too strong and super moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It is well worth the money !</li>
            <li> This hand protector is great for my dry hands in the winter.</li>
            <li> You use your hands all day every day, so a good moisturizer is essential.</li>
            <li> I use Hemp Lip Balm too for the same reason and 1 or 2 applications during the day of both these products and I am good to go no matter the weather or the conditions.</li>
            <li> This line of hand lotion is my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> This stuff has really helped my hands get to feeling better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is my absolute favorite hand cream (trust me</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> and this keeps them nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the wild rose cream before I make this a staple.</li>
            <li> I prefer the natural smell and it really keeps your hands feeling good all day.</li>
            <li> When my wife was pregnant I used this on her feet and legs</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly into hands.</li>
            <li> Scent is unique... not sweet or cloying but distinctive and very nice.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t find it to be more effective than other products.</li>
            <li> Skin feels extremely smooth after the first application.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs in my hands very quickly and the scent is very neutral.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong but very pleasing.  </li>
            <li> is finally under control and he isn&#x27;t so easily injured because his skin is so much more moisturized and protected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, and fades pretty quickly, but still.</li>
            <li> Best lotion or tough hands</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve tried a lot)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so mositurizing, soaks in fast, and leaves your hands smooth all day (with consistant use of course)&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Every person should own a tube of this especially living in Midwest freezing temperatures.  </li>
            <li> Easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> The scent blends well with fresh wood shavings and motor oil.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth</li>
            <li> if its worth the price they charge.  </li>
            <li> I would urge you to sign up for emails at the Body Shop because right now they have a promotion on all hemp products...</li>
            <li> The fact that we can count it coming right to our door</li>
            <li> Not greasy, just right.</li>
            <li> Wonderful healing stuff, I buy it for daughter-in-law too; she&#x27;s a hard working new mommy.  </li>
            <li> Really works well, and being an old hippie chick, I love the Patchouli scent.</li>
            <li> He loves this cream because it doesn&#x27;t have a flowery/strong scent (the light scent doesn&#x27;t bother him, and he&#x27;s very sensitive to smells) and it WORKS.</li>
            <li> This is a great hemp based, hard working moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A friend was given a tube of this hand cream last year and the first time I used it I fell in love.  </li>
            <li> Thanks you!</li>
            <li> It helps my skin stay soft and smooth, even through the winter.</li>
            <li> Cannot recommend enough!!! :)</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, it smelled exactly like saw dust from pine lumber.  </li>
            <li> First off it does not have a feminine smell.</li>
            <li> When I applied this cream to my hands for the first time, I was taken aback by the scent.</li>
            <li> The scent is very minimal and neutral and the consistency of the product is really nice.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve tried many different lotions and prescriptions but who wants to put steroids on their babies?  </li>
            <li> Very soft, mild fragrance</li>
            <li> Just a few days using it significantly improved my skin, although the smell is more like medication.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something natural, healthy, in an eco friendly container to fix dry anything or heal stuff, you JUST FOUND IT~!</li>
            <li> GOOD for my winter DRY hands!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Eventually it goes away and is a million times more tolerable than dry cracked fingers.</li>
            <li> While it is a bit greasy at first, it&#x27;s quickly absorbed and leaves my hands soft &amp; hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> A little goes pretty far, which is good because it is on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Excited to have found such a large tube!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff during the winter months!!</li>
            <li> It has a strong medicinal smell that is not unpleasant but not pretty either</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry, and many hand creams just don&#x27;t seem to work.</li>
            <li> It works well for my dry skin from excema and works better than many other products I have tried over the years..</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, as in my wife&#x27;s arthritis improved when she started using it on her hands a few months back.</li>
            <li> It is very condensed and</li>
            <li> SHE WASHES THEM SO MUCH.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> Soaks in fast and does not leave hands greasy.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s been using this product for a couple of years now and absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> and I really like the hemp scent.</li>
            <li> but I really like it.</li>
            <li> It works unusually well.  </li>
            <li> This really does the job when winter comes</li>
            <li> /&gt;Packaging - well, they don&#x27;t like the plastic too much, so</li>
            <li> Twist the cap on straight and it will keep the product inside.</li>
            <li> This really is a miracle product.</li>
            <li> : Very.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy but conditions very well.</li>
            <li> Love that this product has a light scent, is thick and creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> The product works very well on dry skin (hands, elbows, heels) but it does have a strong fragrance that lingers.  </li>
            <li> I mainly use it on my hands at night and it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and will cure excessively dry skin if used daily together with the hemp hand wash from the Body Shop.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s fine for feet because they are far enough away from him.  </li>
            <li> ago or more keep price down</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even found it to last up to 2 days if I use mild hand soap.</li>
            <li> stuff is pretty thick and has a earthy smell suitable for both men and women.</li>
            <li> It is not unpleasant but just different.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I thought it would work a little better for my eczema</li>
            <li> Now, until it is absorbed, it is greasy, but that only lasts about a minute.</li>
            <li> I found this product a few years ago and I love it.</li>
            <li> The overall result is totally worth using.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, thick cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
            <li> but it works fine for other reasons.</li>
            <li> It has definitely helped my dry cracked hands more than anything else I have tried.  </li>
            <li> However, it does have an odd smell-- not necessarily bad, just not something you&#x27;d willingly put in front of your face.</li>
            <li> I am a researcher who wash the hands very frequently.</li>
            <li> Its smell is a little strong</li>
            <li> Many reviews complain that this smell is unpleasant but I love it.</li>
            <li> Even after switching to my own soap the dry skin would flare up with little provocation.</li>
            <li> It works overnight to go from dry, rough hands to smooth as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Most lotions are designed to &amp;#34;rehydrate&amp;#34; skin and they do get my hands wet, but not much else.</li>
            <li> This is very rich and a little greasy at initial application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and frequently wash my hands.</li>
            <li> She never is completely healed from this, but it relieves some of the pain by helping to prevent the skin from cracking and splitting.</li>
            <li> my hands were at least 50% better with one application.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this stuff, as any hand lotion feels greasy to me (and my skin is naturally a bit oily, so I don&#x27;t need it).  </li>
            <li> I am a professional chef who also happens to suffer from severe OCD</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much, just a tiny dollop.</li>
            <li> You can buy this directly from The Body Shop for $20, but via Amazon Prime it&#x27;s almost $28??</li>
            <li> This hand protector keeps my hands soft and moisturized without any greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> Masculine, not a hint of fragrance.</li>
            <li> It made my hands look old.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for protecting the hands in the harsh cold weather.</li>
            <li> Since it is organic, in this case, it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about chemicals irritating your eyes after use or extra amounts of oils affecting your skin.  </li>
            <li> This was actually recommended to me by a fellow dental professional who uses it in her office, as well.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is so smooth and thick that you think you are using one of the finest hand creams in the world.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does a great job at keeping my hands from drying out from the cold, dry air in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Works well for hydrating my hands because i live in a dry climate in Denver CO.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I get far fewer hangnails in our dry climate using this stuff just once a day.  </li>
            <li> It keeps your hands soft for a long time even after washing your hands several times.</li>
            <li> the cracks actually healed and the dry places were soft.</li>
            <li> It smells a little like dirt, very earthy.  </li>
            <li> The scent is kind of strong and smells weird, but I&#x27;d rather have weird smelling hands than have cracked and dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The only product that I have found to heal the tiny cracks that come with dry weather &amp; chapped hands.</li>
            <li> This is very moisturizing, if you can get past the smell.</li>
            <li> It is the ONLY thing that helps sooth his hands, elbows and feet after a long day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a complete miracle worker, but it fixes my hands well enough that I can function without pain and they start to heal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Residue: This product is long lasting and seems to survive hand washing.</li>
            <li> Just a tiny amount goes a LONG way!</li>
            <li> This leads to dry, cracked skin, especially in the winter.</li>
            <li> My hands get incredibly dry and cracked during the winter, requiring that I cover them overnight with enough band-aids and Neosporin that my hands look mummified.  </li>
            <li> My husband washes his hands a lot and this is the only thing that helps his dry skin in the winter time.</li>
            <li> I have a thyroid disorder which causes terribly dry skin, especially my hands since I handle money and paperwork all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only thing that will take a dry, red patch of skin and heal it completely within a few days.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick past that goes on smoothly with complete absorption in just about a minute.  </li>
            <li> Base on the info from the environment working group, when exposed to UV light, retinol compounds break down and produce toxic free radicals that can damage DNA and cause gene mutations, a precursor to cancer.</li>
            <li> This long lasting characteristic is what makes this product so damn</li>
            <li> I buck hay all summer long</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Next time I buy him a tube, I&#x27;m going to order one for myself to use on my rough heels that I always get in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.</li>
            <li> Mother uses this because she has psoriasis on her hands and they have a tendency to split, crack and bleed, especially as she is a quilter and the fabric seems to catch on the rough skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of metal packaging but again, as long as it works</li>
            <li> Reminds me of linseed oil, of oil paints and stretched canvas.</li>
            <li> It does moisturize and I personally don&#x27;t think it smells too bad, everyone that has tried it seems to love it....</li>
            <li> His hands get so dry and weathered that they crack.</li>
            <li> and my hands get extremely dry and irritated</li>
            <li> and I break out in a rash from dry skin..</li>
            <li> If you have dry cracked hands and all the lotions and hand creams you&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t help, try this.</li>
            <li> SHE WAS BREAKING OUT IN A RASH AND HAD DRY CRACKS IN HER PALM AND ON HER FINGERS.</li>

            <li> My hands get dry to the point of cracking in the winter.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years--my elbows have always been dry and crack and the bottoms of my feet.  </li>
            <li> Because of this I get dry knuckles and hands that have a tendancy to crack duing the winter months.</li>
            <li> This tube lasts a long time, you only need a little bit..goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This keeps my hands feeling soft and healthy, and I&#x27;ve actually become a little addicted to it because I&#x27;m obsessed with having moisturized hands.</li>
            <li> My hands are so dry, but this cream has done miracles for me!</li>

            <li> We have purchased several of these and even a few as gifts.</li>
            <li> However, my partner&#x27;s hands are very dry, and I&#x27;ve been told several times that there is no better product on the market, so I&#x27;m just passing that along.</li>
            <li> Recommended by a doctor that uses it herself due to all the hand washing and sanitizing she has to do.</li>

            <li> B0046NJ0AS The Body Shop Hemp Hand Protector Small, 1.0-Fluid Ounce]]) to carry around in my bag.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a moment to soak in, but this is a small price to pay considering I was using either Vaseline or 99 cents cocoa butter lotion from Walmart before this.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m just not sure yet</li>
            <li> This is a difficult to treat but common medical condition.</li>
            <li> The scent is not very pleasant</li>
            <li> This causes my hands to go through all sorts of issues with working them hard then in an office.</li>
            <li> were so cracked and dried out that they were bloodshot red and stung so bad I would cry.</li>
            <li> It is thick and works ever so well.</li>
            <li> A bit greasy and not a very attractive smell.</li>
            <li> Usually lasts for about 5 hand washes too!</li>
            <li> but it is the one you&#x27;ll want to put on at night when you need serious help with dryness.</li>
            <li> Subtle yet lingering fragrance without overpowering.</li>

            <li> I am now in what I consider &amp;#34;remission&amp;#34; from the dry cracked horrible fingers.</li>
            <li> I use it almost every day and thank for it, my hands have managed to go through the cold winter.</li>
            <li> I dislike and have intolerance to artificial perfumes and scents.</li>
            <li> It is expensive for some hand crème!</li>
            <li> but I would not call it unpleasant.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is the best hand cream out there because it does such a superb job of moisturizing your delicate hands. Your hands reveal your true age, so it is REALLY important to take excellent care of them. You use your hands all day every day, so a good moisturizer is essential. I like all of Body Shop&#x27;s products because they are natural and work really great and this hand cream is no exception. I would urge you to sign up for emails at the Body Shop because right now they have a promotion on all hemp products...you can get 4 for $20. I am not affiliated with the Body Shop in any way but I enjoy spreading the word on saving money. If you sign up for their emails, you will be notified when they have promotions like these.</li>
            <li> have to reapply so often.  not sure will buy again.</li>
            <li> My boss had brought some for her dad and I tried some it feels good my hands are in water all day since I&#x27;m a nurses aide. My hands stay smooth and not oily.</li>
            <li> It may take a minute to get used to the scent, but just as soon as you use this thick, creamy and ULTRA MOISTURIZING hand cream (and foot cream too!) you will realize you need NOTHING else to keep your hands from drying, cracking or blistering.  This is the world&#x27;s best hand cream and it lasts a long time no matter how much you wash your hands.  I use Hemp Lip Balm too for the same reason and 1 or 2 applications during the day of both these products and I am good to go no matter the weather or the conditions.</li>
            <li> Wonderful healing stuff, I buy it for daughter-in-law too; she&#x27;s a hard working new mommy.  I use at times when I know I won&#x27;t have my hands in water for a while and every night.</li>
            <li> My son has very dry hands and he loves this hand cream. It doesn&#x27;t smell flowery, which is good.</li>
            <li> A friend was given a tube of this hand cream last year and the first time I used it I fell in love.  I buck hay all summer long and my hands get pretty ragged even though I wear good gloves.  This cream is so soothing.  I have my mom and sisters using it now, too!</li>
            <li> This hand protector is great for my dry hands in the winter. My hands can crack and bleed if I don&#x27;t use a moisturizer and this is one of my trusted remedies. I enjoy the scent but it can be too strong of an herb smell for some people. I like to use it at night. A little goes pretty far, which is good because it is on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> The best hand cream on the market!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of hand creams, and nothing can compare to this product. It works overnight to go from dry, rough hands to smooth as a baby&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Great product arrived right on time!</li>
            <li> I was looking for hand cream that would help my very dry hands.  I ordered this based on the recommendations and I have not been disappointed.  It has definitely helped my dry cracked hands more than anything else I have tried.  It has a strong medicinal smell that is not unpleasant but not pretty either so I only use it at night.  It is not hand cream you would want on your desk at the office but it is the one you&#x27;ll want to put on at night when you need serious help with dryness.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hand cream. I buy it for my father, who works with his hands doing carpentry, painting, landscaping and gardening. His hands get so dry and weathered that they crack. He loves this cream because it doesn&#x27;t have a flowery/strong scent (the light scent doesn&#x27;t bother him, and he&#x27;s very sensitive to smells) and it WORKS. That is the key. It also lasts a long time. He tends to use it at night because it is a little greasy. Next time I buy him a tube, I&#x27;m going to order one for myself to use on my rough heels that I always get in the winter.</li>
            <li> These work much better than O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Working Hands Cream, 3.4 oz. I been using generous amount  O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s for days and my hands would still chap. A store clerk at Bath &amp; Body recommanded me this lotion for $18 let me sampled them on my chapped hands. It felt great, moisturizing and feels my skin already repairing so I was convinced. One tube lasted 6 months. I&#x27;d still buy it if sales for $22</li>
            <li> This line of hand lotion is my absolute favorite. I prefer the natural smell and it really keeps your hands feeling good all day. Just recently found the body butter version on sale too. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I order this every month. Have one at work and also at home. It is very condensed and a dab will do you! My hands used to crack and fingers would split. Not so anymore. I use a dab when I get to work and one more before bed. Very soft, mild fragrance and I can still feel it on my hands after several washings. Best hand creme around!</li>
            <li> Use this stuff all the time. Works well for hydrating my hands because i live in a dry climate in Denver CO. It also doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, but does smell &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; which could be used for both a man or woman.</li>
            <li> Love this!!! Amazing for dry hands and smells wonderful!</li>
            <li> Did not do what I&#x27;d been told it would for my hands - still hurting cracks on the fingers.  It does feel good when using it.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. It keeps my hands from chaffing. I wear it at night with moisture gloves on. Thanks you!</li>
            <li> We use this constantly for my son who has severe eczema on his hands and face during the winter months.  Excited to have found such a large tube!  We&#x27;ve tried many different lotions and prescriptions but who wants to put steroids on their babies?  Love that this product has a light scent, is thick and creamy, but doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and lasts for a long time. Just a little bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Most lotions are designed to &amp;#34;rehydrate&amp;#34; skin and they do get my hands wet, but not much else. This stuff does a great job at keeping my hands from drying out from the cold, dry air in the winter.  The scent is kind of strong and smells weird, but I&#x27;d rather have weird smelling hands than have cracked and dry skin.  This stuff has really helped my hands get to feeling better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nurse and frequently wash my hands. This leads to dry, cracked skin, especially in the winter. This cream was recommended by the salesgirl at The Body Shop and I absolutely love it! Its smell is a little strong but I don&#x27;t mind it. It&#x27;s a nice, thick cream that doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all. It helps my skin stay soft and smooth, even through the winter.</li>
            <li> I use this every winter because it keeps my hands form getting chapped. Every night before I go to bed, I put it on and then wear cotton gloves to bed. Works like a charm....I also use it throughout the day. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time. It works well for my dry skin from excema and works better than many other products I have tried over the years..</li>
            <li> If your hands, or any part of your body is so sore and peeling, use this cream! If you just have very dry hands, this is for you.  I have used it for over 20 years now and would not give it up!</li>
            <li> Mother uses this because she has psoriasis on her hands and they have a tendency to split, crack and bleed, especially as she is a quilter and the fabric seems to catch on the rough skin.  This hand protector seems to do a good job of helping her hands heal and become smooth again.  She never is completely healed from this, but it relieves some of the pain by helping to prevent the skin from cracking and splitting.</li>
            <li> I am convinced that the Body Shop Hemp hand protector is DEFINITELY the best hand cream found anywhere !!  It is well worth the money !</li>
            <li> The best for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is a very thick cream. It moisturizes very well, but I personally love it for the smell alone! Many reviews complain that this smell is unpleasant but I love it. I enjoy earthy smells. I think it smells like a very clean and sexy hippie. Maybe this smell is just not for everyone! I like to apply it on my neck and arms before applying a very light perfume.</li>
            <li> We never go without our hemp hand protector!!!  Great product seller shipped very quickly...will buy again..This tube lasts a long time, you only need a little bit..goes a long way!</li>
            <li> this product - great for your feet make them feel smoothier - on my second tube - will continue to purchase</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for years and am very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Best cream on the market for cracked and I tried everything even at Okeefes working hands and this is by far the best product...</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing and will cure excessively dry skin if used daily together with the hemp hand wash from the Body Shop.</li>
            <li> The ONLY hand moisturizer that actually works</li>
            <li> Been using this on my hands for decades! Just a tiny amount goes a LONG way! It absorbs in my hands very quickly and the scent is very neutral.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this lotion anywhere except online! Came a day sooner than expected. I wash dishes for a job and my hands get extremely dry and irritated and I break out in a rash from dry skin.. This stuff makes it go away within a day!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my husbands needs.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this item does not arrived boxed. Therefore, it takes a bit of a beating during shipping. I returned the item after it&#x27;s appearance made it unacceptable for gifting.</li>
            <li> If you have dry cracked hands and all the lotions and hand creams you&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t help, try this. It is that good.</li>
            <li> I am a hairstylist so my hands are in water all day every day.&lt;br /&gt;This is my absolute favorite hand cream (trust me - I&#x27;ve tried a lot)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so mositurizing, soaks in fast, and leaves your hands smooth all day (with consistant use of course)&lt;br /&gt;I recomend it for anyone!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW WHO WORKS FOR A DOCTOR SO SHE HAS TO WASH HER HANDS ABOUT A THOUSAND TIMES A DAY. SHE WAS BREAKING OUT IN A RASH AND HAD DRY CRACKS IN HER PALM AND ON HER FINGERS. SHE TRIED EVERYTHING SHE COULD THINK OF. IN VEGAS I RAN INTO THE BODY SHOP STORE AND TRIED A SAMPLE OF THIS STUFF. IT WAS SO NICE I BOUGHT IT FOR MY MOTHER IN LAW. WITHIN A WEEK SHE FELT A HUGE DIFFERENCE AND IT PROTECTS HER HANDS EVEN THOUGH SHE WASHES THEM SO MUCH. I&#x27;VE ORDERED HER REFILLS ON AMAZON AND AM GLAD THEY HAVE IT AVAILABLE.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. I have pretty dry skin and it penetrates and softens my hands (and feet) like a baby&#x27;s butt :)</li>
            <li> The product was great until I read about retinyl palmitate. Base on the info from the environment working group, when exposed to UV light, retinol compounds break down and produce toxic free radicals that can damage DNA and cause gene mutations, a precursor to cancer. Do a search on retinyl palmitate!</li>
            <li> I get far fewer hangnails in our dry climate using this stuff just once a day.  It took a while to get used to the smell of it, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me now.  I also appreciate being able to buy this on Amazon and not have to drive 10 miles one way to a Body Shop store in the mall.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, but the smell is intense and not great. Also, I don&#x27;t find it to be more effective than other products.</li>
            <li> The best hand lotion I have ever used</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever for seriously dry hands! The only product that I have found to heal the tiny cracks that come with dry weather &amp; chapped hands. A must have for those in need of some winter relief!</li>
            <li> This is the most moisturizing product I have ever found.  I have very dry skin and this product has brought it back to life.  I&#x27;ve ordered the body cream and the foot cream, also.  Wonderful, wonderful products!!</li>
            <li> I love this hand lotion. I know that some people think that the smell is too herbal, but it is perfect for me. Usually lasts for about 5 hand washes too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hand cream. A bit greasy and not a very attractive smell. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, and fades pretty quickly, but still.</li>
            <li> Working in a mine is hell on the hands. This stuff is awesome. It smells very good (earthy) and it is not greasy. If you work in tough conditions and you have dry, nasty hands- get this.</li>
            <li> My hands were in such bad condition (dry, cracked, and painful) when this lotion was recommended to me by a friend.  After only one use, I could feel the healing begin!  Now I use it every night before bed, and my hands look great!</li>
            <li> wonderful restorative for suffering hands!</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best for hands! Really works well, and being an old hippie chick, I love the Patchouli scent. Works well on feet too! Sinks in after a minute, not greasy and stays through a washing or two.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  When I was working in food service my hands would Crack and bleed from all the hand washing. A friend bought me a tube of this hand cream to try. I have been using it ever since.  So happy when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best handcream I have ever used. Let me tell you why you should trust me. I have extreme contact dermatitis and my hands are always dry, cracked, sometimes with little blisters. They are incredibly painful. I have tried every single hand cream from cheap to crazy expensive, from Walmart to L&#x27;Occitane, to medical grade to no avail. I started just wearing bandaids on each finger to keep the cracks from spreading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; One day I was totally fed up and remembered I had never tried The Body Shop Hemp Hand Protector. I ordered this one and used it. Day 1 my hands were at least 50% better with one application. Day 2 probably 75% better. Day 3 even better!  Before the weeks end the cracks actually healed and the dry places were soft. I am now in what I consider &amp;#34;remission&amp;#34; from the dry cracked horrible fingers. Now for maintenance I use it once a day. I love it so much I ordered a second tube to keep in my purse. Just in case I feel the dryness coming I will have it with me. I don&#x27;t know why it works so well but it does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY cons I can see is the smell and packaging. I don&#x27;t like it, but it&#x27;s that good that I will overlook it. Eventually it goes away and is a million times more tolerable than dry cracked fingers. I&#x27;m not a fan of metal packaging but again, as long as it works I don&#x27;t care about it.</li>
            <li> My father is a mechanic and has the dryest cracked hands I have ever seen. I started using Hemp products at least ten years ago. I introduced my father to this product and he cant get enough of it. It is the ONLY thing that helps sooth his hands, elbows and feet after a long day.</li>
            <li> My husband works outside and this winter has been very hard on his hands.  Red/cracked and this product has helped greatly.  Recommended by a doctor that uses it herself due to all the hand washing and sanitizing she has to do.</li>
            <li> I thought it would work a little better for my eczema but it works fine for other reasons. It does moisturize and I personally don&#x27;t think it smells too bad, everyone that has tried it seems to love it....</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this stuff during the winter months!!</li>
            <li> This hand cream is awesome! It keeps your hands soft for a long time even after washing your hands several times.</li>
            <li> A friend told me how wonderful this cream is so I ordered some. Was disappointed that it has not helped my hands like I was expecting.I will continue to use this Hemp cream Md</li>
            <li> I have severely dry skin. Other lotions/ creams work, if I put them on every hour or two. THIS cream, however, lasts ALL DAY, unless you wash with a harsher soap. I&#x27;ve even found it to last up to 2 days if I use mild hand soap.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use this stuff, as any hand lotion feels greasy to me (and my skin is naturally a bit oily, so I don&#x27;t need it).  However, my partner&#x27;s hands are very dry, and I&#x27;ve been told several times that there is no better product on the market, so I&#x27;m just passing that along.</li>
            <li> Love it. Smell isn&#x27;t too strong and super moisturizing. I work in a kennel and I have to wash my hands 200 times a day which wears them out big time and this keeps them nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Most amazing cream I could have ever come across! I am a professional chef who also happens to suffer from severe OCD so I wash my hands about 28 billion times a day. I had tried everything you can imagine, from lotions to cremes to vaseline. Nothing worked! I&#x27;m talking about my hands were so cracked and dried out that they were bloodshot red and stung so bad I would cry. They would bleed and hurt to to touch. But this creme works miracles! I apply it every night before bed and wear fuzzy socks over them and when I wake up the next morning they are like babies cheeks! Cannot recommend enough!!! :)</li>
            <li> Best dry skin lotion ever</li>
            <li> Works extremely well but some may not like the smell of it. It is not unpleasant but just different. As it is a bit greasy I use it mostly at night. However, having been a nurse for years I vouch for it (I think washing hands is better than the use of hand sanitizer). I actually had calluses on the sides of my index fingers and use of this product at night resolved it. I recommend it but  be prepared for a &amp;#34;different&amp;#34; odor but I would not call it unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Best thing for dry hands. Soaks in fast and does not leave hands greasy.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lotion and its protection and healing it gives also the scent is great! It has a hint of patchouli in it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. Smells extremely earthy, which is awesome because I dislike floral scents.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, as in my wife&#x27;s arthritis improved when she started using it on her hands a few months back.</li>
            <li> this has been great for splits around finger nails that can get very sore</li>
            <li> When my wife was pregnant I used this on her feet and legs and she loved it. It works much better than most others and doesn&#x27;t ball up.</li>
            <li> I have used this product before... it is excellent for softening dry skin on hands and feet</li>
            <li> I bought this because I was always borrowing my friend&#x27;s.  It is the best I have ever found.  Try it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hand cream and have for years. I bought this for my husband whose hands are always terribly dry and cracking. While he doesn&#x27;t put it on as often as he should, I can see a huge improvement. While it is a bit greasy at first, it&#x27;s quickly absorbed and leaves my hands soft &amp; hydrated all day. I also love the scent which reminds me of sandlewood. If you are scent-free I&#x27;d not recommend it because of it.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever used. I have very dry scaly elbows and this is the only thing I&#x27;ve found that smooths them out. Great Stuff!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much, just a tiny dollop. It is thick and works ever so well. I can&#x27;t do without it in the winter. Best handcream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This all-natural hand moisturizer was recommended to my girlfriend by one of her friends.  It has been one of the best purchases of the year.  Even I have used it on more than one occasion, and I can agree with any great thing that could be said about The Body Shop and their products.  Since it is organic, in this case, it&#x27;s nice to not have to worry about chemicals irritating your eyes after use or extra amounts of oils affecting your skin.  This is a great hemp based, hard working moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My girlfriend swears by it now.  The smell is not very heavy, which is wonderful, but it does smell great, and she uses it on a daily basis.  She is but one more in their army of supporters.  Check out more of The Body Shop&#x27;s products.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt that they are against animal testing either.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my elbows and knees. Nothing I have ever tried has worked as well as this stuff for healing the skin there.  Excellent stuff. Highly recommend.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> My wife&#x27;s been using this product for a couple of years now and absolutely loves it. I can&#x27;t go wrong giving her this for Valentines or whenever. Got to wonder about Amazon Prime, though. You can buy this directly from The Body Shop for $20, but via Amazon Prime it&#x27;s almost $28?? They sure give themselves a lot of headroom for shipping a 3.3 oz tube of hand cream.</li>
            <li> Every person should own a tube of this especially living in Midwest freezing temperatures.  I finally got my husband to use lotion and brag about it&#x27;s traits.  He believes he had frost bite (self diagnosed after changing a tire in the snow).  Being a guitarist with cracked fingers paired with the frost bite, we finally found a cure.  If you suffer from either of these niggling symptoms, this is the hand lotion solution for you.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully for protecting the hands in the harsh cold weather. Loved the fact in was able to be shipped free and so quickly.</li>
            <li> My hands get incredibly dry and cracked during the winter, requiring that I cover them overnight with enough band-aids and Neosporin that my hands look mummified.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of hand creams and oils over the years, and this is the one I keep coming back to.  It&#x27;s not a complete miracle worker, but it fixes my hands well enough that I can function without pain and they start to heal.  Even my military husband, whose hands are exposed to all types of conditions and tasks, thought it worked well when he was having issues with dryness and peeling.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s titled Hand Protector but I use it on my raggedy heels.  The Body Shop has a hemp foot cream but I like this better on my heels.  The smell is....hempy...but if that doesn&#x27;t bother you or you can get used to it, it&#x27;s a great product.  The only downside for me is that my husband doesn&#x27;t like the smell.  That&#x27;s fine for feet because they are far enough away from him.  The trick is to NOT rub the excess onto the backs of my hands when he&#x27;s home. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Since they closed shop in mall that carried it, I am happy to be able to find on Amazon. This has no mineral oil, something I try to avoid. So many lotions have it. Not this!</li>
            <li> The smell is too strong, smells like grandma; but works on the skin</li>
            <li> I love this hand cream.  It was a great addition to my stocking!  I enjoy the &amp;#34;natural earthy&amp;#34; smell. My hands are a lot smoother since I started using it.</li>
            <li> My husband washes his hands a lot and this is the only thing that helps his dry skin in the winter time.</li>
            <li> It can be a bit greasy but it gets the job done. This is one of the best hand creams out there for dry winter skin. It heals cracking skin and I really like the hemp scent. It&#x27;s a bit strong smell wise but I really like it.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product. Subtle yet lingering fragrance without overpowering. Definitely softens skins without feeling greasy. Easily absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> The product works very well on dry skin (hands, elbows, heels) but it does have a strong fragrance that lingers.  I use something else in between using this product but this product is effective.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best hand cream! I have a thyroid disorder which causes terribly dry skin, especially my hands since I handle money and paperwork all day.  This hand protector keeps my hands soft and moisturized without any greasy residue.  And I actually love the earthy smell!</li>
            <li> It is absolutely excellent product for protecting and maintaining your hands. I use it almost every day and thank for it, my hands have managed to go through the cold winter.</li>
            <li> My skin is very dry and my hands crack in the winter.  This lotion works wonders to keep the cracking to a minimum and to heal once cracked.  I use it during the day and liberally when I go to bed at night.</li>
            <li> My friend got me a tiny trial size of this for a baby shower.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about it but needed it one day and tried it out.  I have some very dry spots on my face that require steroid crème.  I get an itchy rash in the winter as well.  This stuff is made from hemp and it&#x27;s magical. I have always been concerned about using the steroid crème and this hemp lotion works so well. It has a earthy smell that my husband doesn&#x27;t love, but he&#x27;s not a tree hugger, I like the smell. It&#x27;s not greasy.  I use it medicinally and for my cracked places on my hands/fingers.  It works unusually well.  If you&#x27;re looking for something natural, healthy, in an eco friendly container to fix dry anything or heal stuff, you JUST FOUND IT~!</li>
            <li> Super smooth hands that don&#x27;t smell like a nest of butterflies in an orgy!</li>
            <li> This stuff works great and overnight.  I have my hands in water constantly and during the winter they crack.  This fixes them overnight.  You have to use it every night though if your hands are constantly in water.</li>
            <li> This product has been simply the best solution for my sons eczema. We haven&#x27;t used steroids since we&#x27;ve started using this product. The fact that we can count it coming right to our door every month is simply amazing. In fact, I wouldn&#x27;t even know where to get it locally otherwise.</li>
            <li> I apply this every night before bed and it&#x27;s kept my hands from cracking during the dry winter here in Chicago. Safe to say it will become a &#x27;must have&#x27; in our house.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Strong smell but I kind of like it. I mainly use it on my hands at night and it moisturizes really well.</li>
            <li> I am a researcher who wash the hands very frequently. So I have very dry skin before using it. Just a few days using it significantly improved my skin, although the smell is more like medication.</li>
            <li> This really does the job when winter comes and it&#x27;s dry and cold outside.  If you work with cardboard, files, paper, boxes, etc. or outdoors, it will maintain your skin integrity, moisturizing and protecting. If you use too much it may feel a little greasy, but use a little less and it should be good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also helpful for dry cuticles.  I use it at least once or twice a day, especially before bedtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is herbal/grassy and not perfumey - which is great.  I dislike and have intolerance to artificial perfumes and scents. I can tolerate this scent with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men can use this and not feel girly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging - well, they don&#x27;t like the plastic too much, so this is probably a recycled metal and so better for the environment than all the plastic. Twist the cap on straight and it will keep the product inside. Don&#x27;t bend the tube, as it will probably create a crack and the product will come out.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  Absorbs quickly into hands.</li>
            <li> Great product, have used for years</li>
            <li> My hands are very dry, and many hand creams just don&#x27;t seem to work. This is very moisturizing, if you can get past the smell. It mostly smells like patchouli, which I don&#x27;t love.</li>
            <li> This really is a miracle product. My hands get dry to the point of cracking in the winter. The hemp hand protector softens them and serves as a protective barrier. The scent is very minimal and neutral and the consistency of the product is really nice. It does not leave the hands tacky or greasy.</li>
            <li> GOOD for my winter DRY hands!!!!!! Rid of callouses on thumbs and fore fingers! Yay!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years--my elbows have always been dry and crack and the bottoms of my feet.  I know it says hand protector, but that&#x27;s a misnomer--the product works great on hands, but is just generally terrific for problem areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case in point:  My 86 year old father suffers from really dry patchy skin.  the slightest bump or scrape caused him to bleed and scab.  We had tried a few product.  I brought him some of this and the dryness of his hands are arms is finally under control and he isn&#x27;t so easily injured because his skin is so much more moisturized and protected.  I think elder care facilities should look to this as a solution to skin issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only do I think it&#x27;s a great product for me--but I am keeping my father supplied with this.  Awesome!</li>
            <li> Excellent hand cream! My hands are so dry, but this cream has done miracles for me! I even use it on my feet! It&#x27;s not greasy and leaves your skin feel smooth and hydrated. It also smells good!</li>
            <li> The reviews all mention an earthy smell that had me worried because that could be anything.  When I first put it on, it smelled exactly like saw dust from pine lumber.  It&#x27;s strong but very pleasing.  It is a very thick past that goes on smoothly with complete absorption in just about a minute.  Skin feels extremely smooth after the first application.  Now, until it is absorbed, it is greasy, but that only lasts about a minute.</li>
            <li> My wife and I love this hand lotion. It does have an &#x27;earthy&#x27; smell but we both like it. We have purchased several of these and even a few as gifts.</li>
            <li> I am a man with very dry hands. I work in an office environment but in the evenings and weekends my hands get abused. This causes my hands to go through all sorts of issues with working them hard then in an office. Real tough skin never really gets to form. Because of this I get dry knuckles and hands that have a tendancy to crack duing the winter months. I found this product a few years ago and I love it. First off it does not have a feminine smell. It smells earthy and like nature. I like that about it. I just want my hands moist, not to smell like a Pina Colada. Second, this product does the job. It seems to last all day so I am not constantly reapplying. Because of this, a tube lasts me forever. It may be a litttle pricey up front, but it lasts longer than the other hand lotions I have tried.</li>
            <li> Smell: Masculine, not a hint of fragrance. Reminds me of linseed oil, of oil paints and stretched canvas. The scent blends well with fresh wood shavings and motor oil. I am never embarrassed by this scent, no one ever walks into a room with me and sniffs the air before asking who&#x27;s using hand cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Residue: This product is long lasting and seems to survive hand washing. However, it is not greasy and I never feel like it will weaken my grip or that I&#x27;m unconsciously smearing it on everything I touch. This long lasting characteristic is what makes this product so damn good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness: Very. I have battled with dry skin on my hands for over 3 years largely due to the washroom soap at my work. Even after switching to my own soap the dry skin would flare up with little provocation. It made my hands look old. This is a difficult to treat but common medical condition. caused by some soaps. This stuff cleared it up in a couple of days with just 1 application per day. Whatever it is, it&#x27;s powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 star review</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin. In the winter it cracks and most lotions irritate my skin, instead of heal them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only moisturizer that works for me (and I&#x27;ve tried them all). It&#x27;s the only thing that will take a dry, red patch of skin and heal it completely within a few days. I apply a liberal amount several times a day and let my skin absorb it without rubbing it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is pretty thick and has a earthy smell suitable for both men and women. It comes in a metal tube that dispenses easily. It leaves my hands silky, and not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this size to keep at home and the smaller size ([[ASIN:B0046NJ0AS The Body Shop Hemp Hand Protector Small, 1.0-Fluid Ounce]]) to carry around in my bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s vegetarian, fair trade, and against animal testing. It&#x27;s a bit pricey, but well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This cream works amazing for my husbands skin</li>
            <li> Great stuff love it. Best lotion or tough hands I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream!  And it smells so good!  I never get that split in my thumb anymore using this cream.</li>
            <li> This works great for someone who works in a dental office and who is constantly washing her hands. It isn&#x27;t greasy but conditions very well. I am not a big fan of the hemp smell but it works so well, I don&#x27;t care about the scent. I would definitely repurchase. This was actually recommended to me by a fellow dental professional who uses it in her office, as well. We got rid of all of our assorted hand creams at our office and everyone uses only this one. Thank you Body Shop for a great product.</li>
            <li> The only hand lotion that my husband uses! It smells so good.</li>
            <li> When I applied this cream to my hands for the first time, I was taken aback by the scent. The scent is not very pleasant but I&#x27;ve gotten use to it and it doesn&#x27;t bother me now. This is very rich and a little greasy at initial application. It takes a moment to soak in, but this is a small price to pay considering I was using either Vaseline or 99 cents cocoa butter lotion from Walmart before this. I wanted to get serious about keeping my body moisturized since I&#x27;m officially in the later half of my 20s. This keeps my hands feeling soft and healthy, and I&#x27;ve actually become a little addicted to it because I&#x27;m obsessed with having moisturized hands. I&#x27;m going to try the wild rose cream before I make this a staple.</li>
            <li> Perfect for just shaved legs. Moisturizing lasts all day on very dry skin. Scent is unique... not sweet or cloying but distinctive and very nice. Spreads luxuriously as it&#x27;s warmed by your hands. Highly recommended. I&#x27;m never without it in my bath kit. Perfect size for travel, too.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome.  It&#x27;s not girly smelling at all.  It has a earthy smell.  Not greasy, just right.</li>
            <li> Have used for years. Works great!</li>
            <li> I say it&#x27;s okay because the smell is almost intolerable for me.  I bought it for my husband to try out since he has extremely rough, dry and cracked hands, but after the first use he hated it due to the smell.  The more I&#x27;ve used it, the more I&#x27;ve gotten use to the smell.  The overall result is totally worth using.  It smells a little like dirt, very earthy.  And I find that the smell stays on your hand until it eventually wears off.  I also noticed that if I wash my hands after I had the lotion on for awhile, my skin continues to feel smooth.  I would recommend giving this a try in hopes you can tolerate the smell!  And I&#x27;m just not sure yet if its worth the price they charge.  It is expensive for some hand crème!</li>
            <li> One of the best hand creams, works like a charm. I&#x27;m not fan of strong smell that&#x27;s why taking away one star.</li>
            <li> I have lots of skin issues: psoriasis, eczema, etc. and still love this lotion. It stays. It lasts for hours. Excellent stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used on hands and face .started using 10 yrs. ago or more keep price down</li>
            <li> I love it.  Bought two.  One was a gift and she was ecstatic.</li>
            <li> This hand creme is fantastic! It is extremely moisturizing for those with dry hands. However, it does have an odd smell-- not necessarily bad, just not something you&#x27;d willingly put in front of your face. The smell dissepates in 30 min or so.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is so smooth and thick that you think you are using one of the finest hand creams in the world.  The packaging from the person who sold it to me was pretty awful though.</li>
