            <li>The Sun Guard is a very light cream that is the perfect for your morning routine,</li>
            <li>It is somewhat geisha like (in the sense of making your skin tone look more even and lighter); however, this effect definately works best when used under a foundation.</li>
            <li>Amazon has the cheapest price and the product is superior...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product ~ does the job and doesn&#x27;t clog the pores.  </li>

            <li>My complexion has never looked better.</li>
            <li>We are glad we found it here.</li>
            <li>I bought the product before I read the EWG( Environmental Working Group) report on safe sunscreens.</li>
            <li>Will use the product then purchase a safe sunscreen.</li>
            <li>The price is also much better</li>
            <li>It is so much cheaper than in store and great products that recommended by a doctor.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Feels really smooth on the skin.</li>
            <li>I experienced no white undertone or pilling as was mentioned in another review.</li>
            <li>I would love a message or e-mail from the seller to tell me if this is normal.</li>
            <li>Well, I think she is right on both accounts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve  used this product for several years and love it.  </li>
            <li>I find most of their other products are not all that really!</li>
            <li>Blends really well over the make up.</li>
            <li>But really like it.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product and I&#x27;m very please with the results.</li>
            <li>The cream I received is very - gloopy/gunky.  </li>
            <li>I have possibly the most sensitive skin in the world.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this item before from a different seller, it came in original safety sealed box and it was perfectly fine, this one did not and does not have the same consistency.</li>
            <li>For those with naturally oily skin this is a gift!</li>
            <li>I use it near my eyes and it does not bother my eyes.</li>
            <li>If I use even the tiniest bit too much, then it balls up into white particles which end up on my clothes and in my hair.</li>
            <li>Within 4 weeks of using the Obagi C line, I have seen a considerable improvement in my complexion.</li>
            <li>and I will be able to see the Obagi effects at least ....</li>
            <li>completely absorbs.  </li>
            <li>This product does not come in original sealed Obagi box and it is very dried out.</li>
            <li>I have tried hundreds of products labeled \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; in vain, because I always get red, blotchy, sometimes peely skin after I apply them to my face.</li>
            <li>really would recomend it if you want to avoid dark spots</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Was</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is thick, not thin and runny like other products.  </li>
            <li> I can only use a little.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, and the tube lasts for 4 months.</li>

            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s also the combination of vitamin c and less preservative.</li>

            <li> The chemicals used in sunscreens are worse for you than the sun.</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that this was a moisturizer with vitamin c and 30 spf. :(</li>
            <li> Either way, I think I need to return this and get something that moisturizes. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have finally found sking care that I&#x27;m staying with.  My complexion has never looked better. I use Roc Retinol Wrinkle Cream at night, and along with my Obagi day care, I&#x27;m very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like Obagi product excluding the eye cream and gel..I find most of their other products are not all that really!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have melasma and this works great to help keep it under control.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve  used this product for several years and love it.  The Sun Guard is a very light cream that is the perfect for your morning routine,</li>
            <li> This is the only sunscreen I have found that does not give your skin an oily appearance. For those with naturally oily skin this is a gift! It is matte like, and goes on white, and needs to be rubbed in well. It is somewhat geisha like (in the sense of making your skin tone look more even and lighter); however, this effect definately works best when used under a foundation. The price at $17 is something not to pass up.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome, I&#x27;ve used it for years and buy it here at a lower price. Great Value!</li>
            <li> I have been using Obagi sunguard for over ten years. I play sports and other sun screens will run off when I sweat and get in my eyes but not Obaji. Its not oil at all. It soaks into my skin and I cant tell its there. It doesn&#x27;t smell all tropical like other sunscreens either.</li>
            <li> I have possibly the most sensitive skin in the world. I have tried hundreds of products labeled \\&quot;for sensitive skin\\&quot; in vain, because I always get red, blotchy, sometimes peely skin after I apply them to my face. But this sunscreen does not do that to my skin. I think it&#x27;s because it is a mineral-based sunscreen, rather than chemical-based. Maybe it&#x27;s also the combination of vitamin c and less preservative. I&#x27;m not sure... but it works. I don&#x27;t burn, and my skin doesn&#x27;t protest.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is thick, not thin and runny like other products.  It will stay on and I recommend it, especially for the summer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s our 3rd tube. We are glad we found it here. About a 30% savings from retail. They never go on sale anywhere.</li>
            <li> I live in AZ and use this under my makeup everyday.  Non-greasy all day! This is a great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> Feels really smooth on the skin. Blends really well over the make up. Protects the skin.&lt;br /&gt;I really would recomend it if you want to avoid dark spots</li>
            <li> I have no complaints with the seller great job great service. I bought the product before I read the EWG( Environmental Working Group) report on safe sunscreens. Will use the product then purchase a safe sunscreen. The chemicals used in sunscreens are worse for you than the sun.</li>
            <li> I did use a different sun screen from Obagi and thought I try this one. It is too thick for me and leave a white film on my face.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well under makeup.  Can flake off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin: combination, fair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better for my skin: Eucerin, Alba sunscreens</li>
            <li> Been using Ogagi Sunscreen for over 5 years...It is great, non-greasy / oily, and is great under make-up.  Amazon has the cheapest price and the product is superior...I will always buy my Obagi products here on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Watch out for expiration date. I ordered May 14 2016. The expiration date is October 2016. YOur money is down the drain. But really like it. I am allergic to all other sun blocks. This one is great. I use it near my eyes and it does not bother my eyes.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and even in the sun.  It&#x27;s the best out there.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and I&#x27;m very please with the results.</li>
            <li> I can only use a little. If I use even the tiniest bit too much, then it balls up into white particles which end up on my clothes and in my hair. Gross! Also, it does not seem to have any moisturizing properties and if I put it over or under a moisturizer it balls up into white particles again. Is this supposed to happen?? I was under the impression that this was a moisturizer with vitamin c and 30 spf. :( It seems to be only SPF. I would love a message or e-mail from the seller to tell me if this is normal. Either way, I think I need to return this and get something that moisturizes. :(</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product ~ does the job and doesn&#x27;t clog the pores.  It is non-greasy and its consistency doesn&#x27;t change.</li>
            <li> Within 4 weeks of using the Obagi C line, I have seen a considerable improvement in my complexion. The price is also much better then what I pay at my doctors office.  A little bit goes a long way, and the tube lasts for 4 months.</li>
            <li> This product does not come in original sealed Obagi box and it is very dried out. I have purchased this item before from a different seller, it came in original safety sealed box and it was perfectly fine, this one did not and does not have the same consistency. I believe this product is expired therefore the box was discarded before it was mailed to me.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product - doesn&#x27;t melt / creep into eyes</li>
            <li> After I bought this from Amazon, my aunt (who is a doctor and sells and recommends Obagi products) told me that I run the risk of buying a knock off or getting charged extra.  Well, I think she is right on both accounts.  The cream I received is very - gloopy/gunky.  I understand this could be because of the sunscreen - but even Neutrogena SPF 30 skincare does not feel so heavy and absorbs much easier.  I have used it for a long time thinking maybe it was just how the cream was and I will be able to see the Obagi effects at least .... nope my skin has not improved!  I believe it is too late to return - but I wish I knew to buy only from verified sellers before I bought this!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this online. It is so much cheaper than in store and great products that recommended by a doctor.</li>
            <li> use as daily sunscreen. completely absorbs.  have used for years</li>
            <li> Obagi sunscreen is the only product I can trust to prevent from sun damage.  I use it all through the year.</li>
            <li> The product was as advertized.  I experienced no white undertone or pilling as was mentioned in another review. Was delivered on time. I&#x27;m looking forward to using this product for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Was recommended by by PMD.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I usually breakout with other SPF products but this one feels great and no breakouts!</li>
