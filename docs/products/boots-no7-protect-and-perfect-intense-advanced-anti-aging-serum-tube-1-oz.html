    <ol>
            <li> I luv, luv, luv this product! It is the softest, silkiest feeling when applying and there are visable changes to my skin!</li>
            <li> My skin feels smooth and soft. I use it before my creams</li>
            <li> New product for me and so far meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> Boots No 7 is always a good product.</li>
            <li> Love it. Always looking for a miracle product. Tried a lot. Always come back to Boots. Great results &amp; pretty good price !</li>
            <li> goes on nice leaves my skin feeling nice but no visible improvements.</li>
            <li> I am just nearing the end of this bottle and have to give it 2 thumbs up - more if I had them. I am sixty years old, a sun worshipper for my lifetime and I had the wrinkles to show for it, all in the laugh and frown areas. I would say my face looks much smoother after having used this for several weeks. I think all of the hype the dermatologists are giving this product is very true. I can see the difference and my skin is smoother than it was ten years ago. I recommend applying twice daily, but you will see the results. I have had no adverse reactions to ths product, breakouts and such, as my skin will do that with different products. If it was a little less expensive, I would bathe in it!</li>
            <li> No.7 is No. 1 in my book</li>
            <li> I love Boots #7 products!!</li>
            <li> Rate it at 3 1/2 stars.  It&#x27;s good but other less expensive products seem to be as good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Boots No. 7 Intense Serum for years and love the way it feels and looks on my skin.</li>
            <li> Boots makes great facial products.  I have wrinkles for sure but softer appearing.  Have been using for several years.</li>
            <li> The product had a subtle scent to it.  I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all without putting my nose super close to it. It did have a very chemically smell though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The serum felt very nice and creamy.  I smoothed into my face nicely.  It didn&#x27;t seem very moisturizing though which is my number one thing to look for in facial products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I didn&#x27;t care too much for was, without thinking, I stuck my hand under the faucet.  The product that was still on my hand was super hard to get off with just water.  It had the same effect as an oil, most similar to coconut oil.  I totally did not expect that and it kind of turned me off of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I didn&#x27;t care too much for this product.  But, in it&#x27;s defense, I have no use for a product of this nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> The only moisturizer I use and it makes a huge difference in the tone of my skin!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but it works really well. I&#x27;m 56 years old and I&#x27;m told I look like I&#x27;m in my 30s. I&#x27;m not bragging , proud yes , I want other women who feel like they are getting up there in years and do not want surgery or needles put in your face. Try it. What can it hurt</li>
            <li> This stuff is great it really works</li>
            <li> This product is as terrific as the reviews say it is. It&#x27;s light and I&#x27;ve seen a visible difference with daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product about a week,  I haven&#x27;t applied the product everyday nor twice a day as planned.  However, I was starting to cleanse my face this morning and noticed the fine lines were tremendously diminished.  I thought about what I had been doing and recalled I had just started using No 7 serum.  I was pleasantly surprised since I hadn&#x27;t used it as directed.  I&#x27;ve used many products, including my own ideas, for smoother, line defying results. My own ideas had worked better than most store bought products.  With other purchased products I don&#x27;t usually  see much change even over a long period of time.  I&#x27;m happy with the results for No 7.  I think I&#x27;ll start using it as directed and hopefully see &amp;#34;WOW&amp;#34; results. Will probably be a little pricey to do so.</li>
            <li> Love this cream!  Amy, 51</li>
            <li> Feels wonderful on my skin!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well...only problem is that you never know when the product is going to run out, because the tube is not transparent, not even translucent.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a couple of months, mornings and night, along with their day and night moisturizer.  I really do not see any improvement at all.</li>
            <li> This has parabens in it! Very disappointed in the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I generally love Boots products but I have been using this for some weeks and don&#x27;t think this really does anything for your skin. I would not waste my money on this product again.</li>
