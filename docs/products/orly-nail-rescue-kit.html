            <li>I tried a lot of nail glues and tapes but not all are effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li>About every five days, I remove my polish and reapply more Orly where needed to the tips.  </li>
            <li>I see the price has gone up even more since I bought it here.  </li>
            <li>I got your attention through that title :-)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>The product is OK, and does rescue the nail.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any on hand, but I am still ok with how it looks.  </li>
            <li>Like magic ,the kit mended my nail.</li>
            <li>and I thought i really should post a review so others will know how great this has been for my damaged nails.</li>
            <li>I also love the Orly Top2 Bottom top coat.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to grow out the nail -</li>
            <li>This is a must buy for any ladies that mind their nails :)</li>
            <li>Great idea Thank you so much</li>
            <li>do not pay more than 12 dollars dor it</li>
            <li>I post nail art on Instagram and also review products so my pictures look best when my nails are long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a day now, and happy and excited to say, it really did its job</li>
            <li>this product will allow you to have many snag free days.</li>
            <li>It is soooo easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use,better than any wrap type product.if your nails split ,this is the answer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s SO easy.</li>
            <li>And if I can do it easily ANYONE can do it.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This kit is easy to use on the go and saves you until you can get home to tend the injured nail.</li>
            <li>Works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>3 easy steps.</li>
            <li>It seems to be just as strong as the products she used at the salon.  </li>
            <li>After a week it is holding strong and no signs of chipping.</li>
            <li>The CA glue dries almost instantly, so it&#x27;s important to be very quick.</li>
            <li>Glue is fine; powder is fine, I guess.</li>
            <li>It looked fine.</li>
            <li>The instructions say that you should buff it smooth after it dries.</li>
            <li>sand to reach a smooth surface</li>
            <li>So amazing really.  </li>
            <li>All I had to do was refile the remaining fix on that nail so that the part where the fix came off was smooth.</li>
            <li>This Rescue Kit is an absolute &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for any manicure kit you own.  </li>
            <li>I then smooth out the nail with the sander that comes with the kit and paint my nails.</li>
            <li>that gets it extremely smooth and shiney.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried tissues, glues, sprinkle on powders with various results - none great.  </li>
            <li>Ok, this nail &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; may not last forever, but it&#x27;s a pretty great temporary fix.</li>
            <li>I am fortunate in that my nails are strong and they can quickly grow to great long lengths.  </li>
            <li>On my first attempt using this product I followed the directions and it created more thickness than I needed.</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC FOR A QUICK REPAIR.  </li>
            <li>So one full week</li>
            <li>Worked surprisingly well, but it doesn&#x27;t last forever.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true to its name.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure to buff it out really well</li>
            <li>Super easy to use - I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>I used so many nail menders over the years, they are good but usually need time and patience to apply.</li>
            <li>So pretty!  </li>
            <li>Its nice to have a 10 nails the same length now.  </li>
            <li>just enough to stop the cracks and prevent the nails from catching on everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All Orly products are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>problem: a split nail on the right hand that refuses to heal for now over 5 years.</li>
            <li>My nail broke right at the edge of the nail bed</li>
            <li>My right thumb always has a split that snags  on things.</li>
            <li>I found the Orly Nail Rescue kit after watching a professional successfully repair one of my nails and decided to see if there was a similar product for home use.</li>
            <li>but, to my sheer surprise, it was very simple and worked great.</li>
            <li>When the glue chips off, it takes the outer layer of the nail with it, leaving you with even more fragile nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First cracked nail solution I have seen that works.  </li>
            <li>I tried it two more times with the same result.  </li>
            <li>, This stuff absolutely saved me!</li>
            <li>Still, anything super fine like that can lodge itself deep in the lungs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really works!</li>
            <li>The smaller the split, tear or break the better.</li>
            <li>It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>But this is protecting is very well, and each time that lasts almost one full week before it starts to separate from the surface of the nail and can be removed, cleaned and a new one put in place.</li>
            <li>I love having long nails.  </li>
            <li>I love growing my nails long  </li>
            <li>At the very least, that will be awesome for skying, as putting gloves on often resulted in the nail splitting further.</li>
            <li>At the very least, that will be awesome for skying, as putting gloves on often resulted in the nail splitting further.</li>
            <li>Unlike the damage done by applying acrylic nails to the whole nail bed...this is just on the tips.  </li>
            <li>(sanding paper, very fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>and they got to their very longest</li>
            <li>But, I really had no choice but to go get help.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend you give it a try!</li>
            <li>It really blended with my nail. .</li>
            <li>Brush on glue, dip the nail in powder, buff and the nail is ready to polish.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this is the fastest fix iv ever used, very practical</li>
            <li>and I could never leave the surface smooth enough</li>
            <li>I appreciated the Sally&#x27;s coupon I received from my purchase</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>MORE importantly, when i get a nail that splits and snags I immediately apply this fix and no more snagging!  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life....I can grow fingernails to paint and my new hobby...stamping.  </li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for, it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long for it to set.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway, back to my original problem nail.</li>
            <li>is so much better then that other one I used to save my nail.</li>
            <li>I read mixed reviews on other sites and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would hold together a complete tear all the way through - but after two days, it&#x27;s still holding strong</li>
            <li>I was never able to have ALL my nails be nice at once.</li>
            <li>I truly don&#x27;t think I can live without this product!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only the top layer of the nail that is affected, but the split nail gets caught in various things, separating 2 layers of the nail and causing pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I would most likely need to come back for another repair.  </li>
            <li>I keep my nails trimmed super short.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product and would not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it</li>
            <li>This was quick and easy and lasts for at least 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>for helping the split to cure / recover, progress is very slow, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a good 6 months</li>
            <li>for helping the split to cure / recover, progress is very slow, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a good 6 months</li>
            <li>I know I have a new friend with the name Orly.</li>
            <li>Let it dry for a minute, then buff and reapply for a super strength repair.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions, you put on the nail glue and quickly dip your finger nail into the nail powder and let all of it dry, then follow it with a buffing.</li>
            <li>I have one particular nail that will not grow more than like a 16th of an inch without splitting down the middle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s normal CA glue as far as I can see/</li>
            <li>So the key is to get them when they first appear.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It will last five to six days, then I repeat - but the process takes only about five minutes at the most - so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took a bit getting used to buffing the patches down to get a smooth application</li>
            <li>I also used it on a toenail that was split down the middle to keep it from splitting more as I let it grow out.</li>
            <li>I keep my nails polished with clear coat</li>
            <li>You can use a ridge filler before the clear coat if you want a smoother finish.  </li>
            <li>I have a lengthwise split in my thumbnail caused by a natural defect in the nail..</li>
            <li>(I keep my nails natural, with no polish on them).  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to have them professionally done</li>
            <li>If too much pressure is put on the nail which is cracked, it will inevitably crack again.</li>
            <li>but I take it a step further and really buff it with a four sided file....</li>
            <li>The next time i used it i immediately top it with a gel glue, followed by my regular base coat, and i got great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works but the glue dries up in container before the powder is anywhere near used up.</li>
            <li>NO MESS.  </li>
            <li>So I applied it on a clean buffed damaged nail, dipped it into the powder, dried and then buffed.</li>
            <li>However, I saw this and decided to give it a try first, especially since it was only 6.99 at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>After two separate tries I just threw it out and went back to super glue and cut up tea bag paper.</li>
            <li>I can even use clear polish because it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>Because they were so long, I cracked 3 of them very close to the nail bed.  </li>
            <li>Three months of applying this every 2 weeks under my gel manicures and I am back to normal</li>
            <li>I fixed my own nail in just a couple minutes, and I&#x27;m horrible at doing my nails on my own.</li>
            <li>great stuff  hold broken nail until it is long enough to cut back and not be</li>
            <li>The repair last pretty long until the nail grows out.</li>
            <li>The issue that I had was that the nail glue dried quickly and you had excess powder after dipping your nail</li>
            <li>Make sure your nails are bare before applying, and apply thin layers of product for a natural look.</li>
            <li>I have 1 nail on each hand that splits down the middle to the quick.  </li>
            <li>If you have the time to repeat process at least twice to get a smoothish  repair, fine.</li>
            <li>I actually get the kind of breaks where it&#x27;s like a hangnail and super painful to even try to get off .</li>
            <li>Now, once issue I did notice -- my nails are long and therefore the tiny container of acrylic was just way too small for my entire nail to lay down into it and expect an even coat; so, I put the powder in another container which worked just great.  </li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected.</li>
            <li>I have only used this product once so far, but it worked well on my pinky nail</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several cracks and having this on them has prevented them from breaking off completely.</li>
            <li>Just one thin coat ( I used Opi-Tickle My France-y , lovely nude shade})  as I want to see if the Kit will do</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly and even though it was slightly lumpy after smoothing it seemed to work.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works like magic to allow my fragile, weak nails to grow without splitting, or bending and breaking.  </li>
            <li>I only applied the liquid glue to the big tear on my thumb nail, dipped in the powder, let dry for a few minutes and did a second coat just to make sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve since replaced the acrylic repair 3 times as the break grows out and not a single problem.  </li>
            <li>and this is still sheer enough for  me to go around with clear polish.  </li>
            <li>(no color for me yet because I&#x27;m just beginning to get my nails healthy after a few months of gel polish and the resulting removal with harsh polish removal, all but destroyed them).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked flawlessley; I made sure I used a moderate coat of glue (not too thick and evenly spread); dipped the nail into the acrylic; pulled it out and waited for it to thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li>First time using I was nervous because me and any acrylic products just do not get along; I figured I would mess this up big time....</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for, I just thought it would of been a little bigger...</li>
            <li>One comment, it isn&#x27;t hard to file down after you&#x27;ve applied the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear it without any polish over the top.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s advertised for half as much, elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It has a slight texture to it and is matte unless you really file it and buff it well.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I post nail art on Instagram and also review products so my pictures look best when my nails are long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a day now, and happy and excited to say, it really did its job</li>
            <li> this product will allow you to have many snag free days.</li>
            <li> It is soooo easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use,better than any wrap type product.if your nails split ,this is the answer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s SO easy.</li>
            <li> And if I can do it easily ANYONE can do it.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This kit is easy to use on the go and saves you until you can get home to tend the injured nail.</li>
            <li> Works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> 3 easy steps.</li>
            <li> It seems to be just as strong as the products she used at the salon.  </li>
            <li> After a week it is holding strong and no signs of chipping.</li>
            <li> The CA glue dries almost instantly, so it&#x27;s important to be very quick.</li>
            <li> Glue is fine; powder is fine, I guess.</li>
            <li> It looked fine.</li>
            <li> The instructions say that you should buff it smooth after it dries.</li>
            <li> sand to reach a smooth surface</li>
            <li> So amazing really.  </li>
            <li> All I had to do was refile the remaining fix on that nail so that the part where the fix came off was smooth.</li>
            <li> This Rescue Kit is an absolute &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for any manicure kit you own.  </li>
            <li> I then smooth out the nail with the sander that comes with the kit and paint my nails.</li>
            <li> that gets it extremely smooth and shiney.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried tissues, glues, sprinkle on powders with various results - none great.  </li>
            <li> Ok, this nail &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; may not last forever, but it&#x27;s a pretty great temporary fix.</li>
            <li> I am fortunate in that my nails are strong and they can quickly grow to great long lengths.  </li>
            <li> On my first attempt using this product I followed the directions and it created more thickness than I needed.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC FOR A QUICK REPAIR.  </li>
            <li> So one full week</li>
            <li> Worked surprisingly well, but it doesn&#x27;t last forever.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true to its name.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure to buff it out really well</li>
            <li> Super easy to use - I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I used so many nail menders over the years, they are good but usually need time and patience to apply.</li>
            <li> So pretty!  </li>
            <li> Its nice to have a 10 nails the same length now.  </li>
            <li> just enough to stop the cracks and prevent the nails from catching on everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All Orly products are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> problem: a split nail on the right hand that refuses to heal for now over 5 years.</li>
            <li> My nail broke right at the edge of the nail bed</li>
            <li> My right thumb always has a split that snags  on things.</li>
            <li> I found the Orly Nail Rescue kit after watching a professional successfully repair one of my nails and decided to see if there was a similar product for home use.</li>
            <li> but, to my sheer surprise, it was very simple and worked great.</li>
            <li> When the glue chips off, it takes the outer layer of the nail with it, leaving you with even more fragile nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First cracked nail solution I have seen that works.  </li>
            <li> I tried it two more times with the same result.  </li>
            <li> , This stuff absolutely saved me!</li>
            <li> Still, anything super fine like that can lodge itself deep in the lungs.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really works!</li>
            <li> The smaller the split, tear or break the better.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> But this is protecting is very well, and each time that lasts almost one full week before it starts to separate from the surface of the nail and can be removed, cleaned and a new one put in place.</li>
            <li> I love having long nails.  </li>
            <li> I love growing my nails long  </li>
            <li> At the very least, that will be awesome for skying, as putting gloves on often resulted in the nail splitting further.</li>
            <li> At the very least, that will be awesome for skying, as putting gloves on often resulted in the nail splitting further.</li>
            <li> Unlike the damage done by applying acrylic nails to the whole nail bed...this is just on the tips.  </li>
            <li> (sanding paper, very fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> and they got to their very longest</li>
            <li> But, I really had no choice but to go get help.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend you give it a try!</li>
            <li> It really blended with my nail. .</li>
            <li> Brush on glue, dip the nail in powder, buff and the nail is ready to polish.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is the fastest fix iv ever used, very practical</li>
            <li> and I could never leave the surface smooth enough</li>
            <li> I appreciated the Sally&#x27;s coupon I received from my purchase</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> MORE importantly, when i get a nail that splits and snags I immediately apply this fix and no more snagging!  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life....I can grow fingernails to paint and my new hobby...stamping.  </li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long for it to set.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, back to my original problem nail.</li>
            <li> is so much better then that other one I used to save my nail.</li>
            <li> I read mixed reviews on other sites and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would hold together a complete tear all the way through - but after two days, it&#x27;s still holding strong</li>
            <li> I was never able to have ALL my nails be nice at once.</li>
            <li> I truly don&#x27;t think I can live without this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only the top layer of the nail that is affected, but the split nail gets caught in various things, separating 2 layers of the nail and causing pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I would most likely need to come back for another repair.  </li>
            <li> I keep my nails trimmed super short.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product and would not hesitate to purchase again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This was quick and easy and lasts for at least 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> for helping the split to cure / recover, progress is very slow, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a good 6 months</li>
            <li> for helping the split to cure / recover, progress is very slow, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a good 6 months</li>
            <li> I know I have a new friend with the name Orly.</li>
            <li> Let it dry for a minute, then buff and reapply for a super strength repair.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions, you put on the nail glue and quickly dip your finger nail into the nail powder and let all of it dry, then follow it with a buffing.</li>
            <li> I have one particular nail that will not grow more than like a 16th of an inch without splitting down the middle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s normal CA glue as far as I can see/</li>
            <li> So the key is to get them when they first appear.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It will last five to six days, then I repeat - but the process takes only about five minutes at the most - so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took a bit getting used to buffing the patches down to get a smooth application</li>
            <li> I also used it on a toenail that was split down the middle to keep it from splitting more as I let it grow out.</li>
            <li> I keep my nails polished with clear coat</li>
            <li> You can use a ridge filler before the clear coat if you want a smoother finish.  </li>
            <li> I have a lengthwise split in my thumbnail caused by a natural defect in the nail..</li>
            <li> (I keep my nails natural, with no polish on them).  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to have them professionally done</li>
            <li> If too much pressure is put on the nail which is cracked, it will inevitably crack again.</li>
            <li> but I take it a step further and really buff it with a four sided file....</li>
            <li> The next time i used it i immediately top it with a gel glue, followed by my regular base coat, and i got great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product works but the glue dries up in container before the powder is anywhere near used up.</li>
            <li> NO MESS.  </li>
            <li> So I applied it on a clean buffed damaged nail, dipped it into the powder, dried and then buffed.</li>
            <li> However, I saw this and decided to give it a try first, especially since it was only 6.99 at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> After two separate tries I just threw it out and went back to super glue and cut up tea bag paper.</li>
            <li> I can even use clear polish because it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> Because they were so long, I cracked 3 of them very close to the nail bed.  </li>
            <li> Three months of applying this every 2 weeks under my gel manicures and I am back to normal</li>
            <li> I fixed my own nail in just a couple minutes, and I&#x27;m horrible at doing my nails on my own.</li>
            <li> great stuff  hold broken nail until it is long enough to cut back and not be</li>
            <li> The repair last pretty long until the nail grows out.</li>
            <li> The issue that I had was that the nail glue dried quickly and you had excess powder after dipping your nail</li>
            <li> Make sure your nails are bare before applying, and apply thin layers of product for a natural look.</li>
            <li> I have 1 nail on each hand that splits down the middle to the quick.  </li>
            <li> If you have the time to repeat process at least twice to get a smoothish  repair, fine.</li>
            <li> I actually get the kind of breaks where it&#x27;s like a hangnail and super painful to even try to get off .</li>
            <li> Now, once issue I did notice -- my nails are long and therefore the tiny container of acrylic was just way too small for my entire nail to lay down into it and expect an even coat; so, I put the powder in another container which worked just great.  </li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product once so far, but it worked well on my pinky nail</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several cracks and having this on them has prevented them from breaking off completely.</li>
            <li> Just one thin coat ( I used Opi-Tickle My France-y , lovely nude shade})  as I want to see if the Kit will do</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly and even though it was slightly lumpy after smoothing it seemed to work.  </li>
            <li> This stuff works like magic to allow my fragile, weak nails to grow without splitting, or bending and breaking.  </li>
            <li> I only applied the liquid glue to the big tear on my thumb nail, dipped in the powder, let dry for a few minutes and did a second coat just to make sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve since replaced the acrylic repair 3 times as the break grows out and not a single problem.  </li>
            <li> and this is still sheer enough for  me to go around with clear polish.  </li>
            <li> (no color for me yet because I&#x27;m just beginning to get my nails healthy after a few months of gel polish and the resulting removal with harsh polish removal, all but destroyed them).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked flawlessley; I made sure I used a moderate coat of glue (not too thick and evenly spread); dipped the nail into the acrylic; pulled it out and waited for it to thoroughly dry.</li>
            <li> First time using I was nervous because me and any acrylic products just do not get along; I figured I would mess this up big time....</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for, I just thought it would of been a little bigger...</li>
            <li> One comment, it isn&#x27;t hard to file down after you&#x27;ve applied the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear it without any polish over the top.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s advertised for half as much, elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It has a slight texture to it and is matte unless you really file it and buff it well.</li>
            <li> I wish I could still get the old other brand.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really disappointing when you nail is finally getting nice and long.  </li>
            <li> The repairs are lasting a long timel  </li>
            <li> Occasionally, I will leave them to grow too long.  </li>
            <li> and I just just use a stylus to apply a drip of the liquid on the split and then sprinkle the powder over the drip, then QUICKLY mash the material down with the stylus so it doesn&#x27;t make a thick spot... then file the patch to blend in with the rest of my thumb nail.</li>
            <li> I did TWO coats on that one and maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s lasted so long.</li>
            <li> (being so long a nail and all).  </li>
            <li> (given my nails are long</li>
            <li> I have had long nails for almost 30 years now and have certainly tried every so called repair product out there at least once, but none of them really did what they were supposed to do, or at least didn&#x27;t do it for very long.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Results: my nail looks somewhat weird for sure with half its surface covered by this glass+CA substance.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because of the other good reviews and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product several times in different kinds of nail trauma (big slipts, small splits, cracks, etc)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s immediately dry to the touch, but I found that it needs some time to harden fully in depth.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> that are dry and break</li>
            <li> and occasionally it splits down even further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have nails that are always chipping, breaking, peeling, splitting, etc... and this product has saved me from cutting down my nails on so many occasions.</li>
            <li> There is nothing more painful than your nail breaking and then getting caught in your hair or on your clothes and ripping to the nail bed.</li>
            <li> but at least it kept my nail chip together and prevented from completely breaking.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s rough like sand paper otherwise).</li>
            <li> (once I spent 15 minutes working on it) so the polish could sit evenly on the nail.</li>
            <li> It takes no time to dry, and I usually apply a second coat, repeating the process.  </li>
            <li> Have used other nail repair kits.</li>
            <li> I wish other mfg.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the Orly product is the same</li>
            <li> this helps extremely when I crack my nails.</li>
            <li> No, sometimes you have to apply and sand down after a couple days.  </li>
            <li> I just sat down to apply this Orly product</li>
            <li> when I broke them it was way down on the nail bed</li>
            <li> so I have been filing them down each week as they grow.</li>
            <li> and if you stamp a pattern on the nail polish, you can&#x27;t see the slight irregularities where the Orly bonds.  </li>
            <li> I have a nail split at the &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; half way across the width.  </li>
            <li> first time i used it i was in a hurry and didnt have time to coat it with a base coat, it started chipping the next day.</li>
            <li> one bottle of CA glue, with a little brush applicator.</li>
            <li> one little jar of \\&quot;powder\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It looks like acrylics have been put on the 2 nails, which makes them a little thicker.  </li>
            <li> Then I file with the little buffer provided -</li>
            <li> /&gt;The other products had an plastic covering that didn&#x27;t stay and usually washed off before even going to work.</li>
            <li> It leaves a hard finish on just the ends of my nails like a french manicure would be, then I file smooth and apply a hard base coat which smooths it out for applications of nail polish</li>
            <li> The problem is that it is impossible to hide that the nail has been repaired, because it gets a different texture than the other nails, especially when I put polish on.</li>
            <li> It was never smooth.</li>
            <li> If your nails are like mine (paper thin and fragile)</li>
            <li> After it dried I used an emory board to take off the excess cloth</li>
            <li> but after a few times I have the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I just brush some of the glue over the nail tip and about halfway down the nail then immediately press the nail into the small jar of powder.</li>
            <li> I have spliting and breaking nails due to hand washing continually, because of my job in the medical profession and I am allergic to the glue from fake nails.</li>
            <li> You do have to be careful using the powder as the container is very small</li>
            <li> apply the glue, then pour the powder over the nail with a small spoon (over the powder container, so I don&#x27;t waste any).  </li>
            <li> For the usual nail tears that grow ou</li>
            <li> small sanding pad.</li>
            <li> The glue, the powder and even a small nail file.  </li>
            <li> I usually put a band aid on my finger when this happens so I don&#x27;t snag it and people don&#x27;t see it .</li>
            <li> I can just use this and sweep polish over it and no more pain or embarsment.</li>
            <li> Apply glue, dip in powder, dry then try to use totally useless emery square.</li>
            <li> It was hard to keep an bandaide on until the nail grew up because of the handwashing</li>
            <li> It works well, but the glue rapidly becomes too thick.</li>
            <li> So tired of small cracks or breaks running my manicure.</li>
            <li> The included buffer is useless (too small, very little effect).</li>
            <li> painful to cut the nail so short.  </li>
            <li> Then I reapplied the clear base coat that I had on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t seen this method shared to all of us with impossibly weak nails.</li>
            <li> it works: apply the CA glue on the nail (the broken part / part to protect), and immediately dip the part with the glue into the jar.</li>
            <li> After losing a nail when it was damaged, it grew back in with a split...so annoying.  </li>
            <li> I put the cloth nail over my broken nail and put on the glue</li>
            <li> Nail is VERY difficult to buff down, even with all the tools I have to do so.</li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> Another thing is that the base coat and nail polish would sort of &amp;#34;sink&amp;#34; into the repaired area, leaving the finishing with lots of little holes and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical with this product as well, but Sally&#x27;s Beauty recommended it</li>
            <li> It catches on everything and made me afraid to grow out that thumbnail.  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have to use the crazy glue tea bag trick anymore and glue my fingers together</li>
            <li> I bought it not knowing anything about the product but in desperate need of keeping one nail from continuing to split.</li>
            <li> but hate, hate it when I break one of them at a time and have to trim that nail short to prevent painful breakage that also takes away some of the nail bed skin too (ouch!).</li>
            <li> This is very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It is painful when they split, so</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I fixed my own nail in just a couple minutes, and I&#x27;m horrible at doing my nails on my own. It was tearing off from both sides and now it&#x27;s solid. I found this product for under $10 at Sally&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> When the glue chips off, it takes the outer layer of the nail with it, leaving you with even more fragile nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the glue DOES chip off.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised!  I put this stuff on all of my nails now before I paint them (just because I have flimsy nails but I like to grow them out).</li>
            <li> Have used other nail repair kits. I wish I could still get the old other brand. This is very difficult to use. Apply glue, dip in powder, dry then try to use totally useless emery square. If you have the time to repeat process at least twice to get a smoothish  repair, fine. After two separate tries I just threw it out and went back to super glue and cut up tea bag paper. I wish other mfg. still made their repair/sculpting kit.</li>
            <li> First cracked nail solution I have seen that works.  Is it the perfect solution?  No, sometimes you have to apply and sand down after a couple days.  But it seems to be the only solution so it gets 5 of these 10 sided circles.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with two of my fingernails splitting along the ridge and thought this was a perfect solution.  I followed the directions exactly and even though it was slightly lumpy after smoothing it seemed to work.  Two days later it peeled off both nails.  I tried it two more times with the same result.  After the third try (six nails) I ran out of glue and I&#x27;m left with a lot of sand.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> My nails have been breaking since I use a knitting machine and push the needles with my fingers. Somehow the nails get damaged.&lt;br /&gt;This kit is great. It appears to be the same stuff you use when getting acrylic nails. You paint on some of the glue with the brush, dip your nail into the container and then buff it.  The repairs are lasting a long timel  You do have to be careful using the powder as the container is very small and I have had it fall and spill it&#x27;s contents.  Do it on a table and be careful.&lt;br /&gt;It has saved my hands from looking like a wreck.</li>
            <li> Ok, this nail &amp;#34;cure&amp;#34; may not last forever, but it&#x27;s a pretty great temporary fix. Make sure your nails are bare before applying, and apply thin layers of product for a natural look. It&#x27;s like the break disappears! Super easy to use - I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life....I can grow fingernails to paint and my new hobby...stamping.  This stuff works like magic to allow my fragile, weak nails to grow without splitting, or bending and breaking.  It leaves a hard finish on just the ends of my nails like a french manicure would be, then I file smooth and apply a hard base coat which smooths it out for applications of nail polish and if you stamp a pattern on the nail polish, you can&#x27;t see the slight irregularities where the Orly bonds.  About every five days, I remove my polish and reapply more Orly where needed to the tips.  I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t seen this method shared to all of us with impossibly weak nails. Unlike the damage done by applying acrylic nails to the whole nail bed...this is just on the tips.  I see the price has gone up even more since I bought it here.  It&#x27;s advertised for half as much, elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for, I just thought it would of been a little bigger...</li>
            <li> I have a lengthwise split in my thumbnail caused by a natural defect in the nail.. It catches on everything and made me afraid to grow out that thumbnail.  On my first attempt using this product I followed the directions and it created more thickness than I needed. Now that has grown out and I just just use a stylus to apply a drip of the liquid on the split and then sprinkle the powder over the drip, then QUICKLY mash the material down with the stylus so it doesn&#x27;t make a thick spot... then file the patch to blend in with the rest of my thumb nail. I can even use clear polish because it&#x27;s barely noticeable.  Its nice to have a 10 nails the same length now.  OH I dip that thumb in alcohol before I apply this product in case the split has germs or fungus in it. For the usual nail tears that grow ou</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t really what I expected. The instructions say that you should buff it smooth after it dries. I buffed and buffed. It was never smooth.</li>
            <li> great stuff...works and protects very well...recommended!</li>
            <li> This is a good item for splitting nails that just will not stop splitting.</li>
            <li> Never been so thankful for a product in all my life! I just could not get my nails to grow after using press on&#x27;s that destroyed my nails, This stuff absolutely saved me! With every tear or split, I just repair it again with my kit and my nails have finally started growing out, THANK YOU ORLY!!</li>
            <li> I got your attention through that title :-)&lt;br /&gt;The problem: a split nail on the right hand that refuses to heal for now over 5 years. MDs have no clue and do nto know anything about nails it seems. Basically a split from the end of the nail going towards the hand. It&#x27;s only the top layer of the nail that is affected, but the split nail gets caught in various things, separating 2 layers of the nail and causing pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this product is:&lt;br /&gt;- one bottle of CA glue, with a little brush applicator. It&#x27;s normal CA glue as far as I can see/read.&lt;br /&gt;- one little jar of \\&quot;powder\\&quot;. As I have experience building R/C models, I believe that the powder is super-fine beads of glass. I&#x27;d recommend to NOT inhale any of it, but it&#x27;s not asbestos, so should not toxic. Still, anything super fine like that can lodge itself deep in the lungs.&lt;br /&gt;- s small sanding pad. (sanding paper, very fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works: apply the CA glue on the nail (the broken part / part to protect), and immediately dip the part with the glue into the jar. The CA glue dries almost instantly, so it&#x27;s important to be very quick. immediately try to remove anything sticking to the skin, so that the glue is only on the nail. I believe some would put a piece of paper between the edge of the nail and the skin, but I&#x27;m a guy and do not care about having the smoothest fingertips :-)&lt;br /&gt;Let it harden for 10-15 minutes. It&#x27;s immediately dry to the touch, but I found that it needs some time to harden fully in depth.&lt;br /&gt;Then sand to reach a smooth surface (it&#x27;s rough like sand paper otherwise). In my case, add another layer of CA glue, and dip, then wait and sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: my nail looks somewhat weird for sure with half its surface covered by this glass+CA substance. But this is protecting is very well, and each time that lasts almost one full week before it starts to separate from the surface of the nail and can be removed, cleaned and a new one put in place. So it&#x27;s a lot more efficient and convenient than putting a band-aid on the fingertip. As this is only on the nail, that doesn&#x27;t affect typing speed and accuracy on a computer keyboard.&lt;br /&gt;As for helping the split to cure / recover, progress is very slow, but I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a good 6 months I think before having a final verdict. At the very least, that will be awesome for skying, as putting gloves on often resulted in the nail splitting further. With this in place, gloves are not a problem anymore.fficient and convenient than putting a band-aid on the fingertip.

            <li> WORKED GREAT.  NO MESS.  FANTASTIC FOR A QUICK REPAIR.  TOOK IT OVERSEAS WITH ME.  NEEDED IT.  GLAD I HAD IT.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this!  I love having long nails.  I am fortunate in that my nails are strong and they can quickly grow to great long lengths.  Occasionally, I will leave them to grow too long.  Over the holiday last year, I let them keep growing and they got to their very longest I&#x27;ve ever had them.  So pretty!  So amazing really.  Well, I wont do that again.  Because they were so long, I cracked 3 of them very close to the nail bed.  I dislike getting my nails done at the salon (I keep my nails natural, with no polish on them).  But, I really had no choice but to go get help.  The lady was wonderful and she did a great job fixing the three cracked nails.  But, she said it was temporary and I would most likely need to come back for another repair.  I understood what she was saying as I didn&#x27;t want a lot of product on the nails, just enough to stop the cracks and prevent the nails from catching on everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I got home, I came on Amazon looking to see if they had anything that could help me.  I found this kit and it&#x27;s very similar to what the lady at the nail salon used.  It is soooo easy to use.  It comes with everything you need.  The glue, the powder and even a small nail file.  It seems to be just as strong as the products she used at the salon.  I&#x27;m very happy to have my emergency nail kit.</li>
            <li> This product was simple to use! I only applied the liquid glue to the big tear on my thumb nail, dipped in the powder, let dry for a few minutes and did a second coat just to make sure. Sanded the rough edges with the included buffer and presto my nail was fixed. I then applied my regular gel mani overtop (using gelish foundation, polish and topcoat). After a week it is holding strong and no signs of chipping. The repair is invisible with polish. I would highly recommend this product and would not hesitate to purchase again. Now I don&#x27;t have to use the crazy glue tea bag trick anymore and glue my fingers together anymore lol!</li>
            <li> This really works! Easy to use,better than any wrap type product.if your nails split ,this is the answer.</li>
            <li> I tend to get rips in my nails running horizontally across the nail and it&#x27;s really disappointing when you nail is finally getting nice and long.  I tried this product because of the other good reviews and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  I have only used this product once so far, but it worked well on my pinky nail so I could paint my nails up for a formal function and not worry about it breaking off during the event.  The hold lasted about 5 days for me and now it is about time to re-apply since I see the rip re-emerging.  One comment, it isn&#x27;t hard to file down after you&#x27;ve applied the product, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to wear it without any polish over the top.  It has a slight texture to it and is matte unless you really file it and buff it well.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this. FInally something for my nails that doesn&#x27;t require six hands to apply!  It&#x27;s SO easy. I have one particular nail that will not grow more than like a 16th of an inch without splitting down the middle. It snags on everything and I have to file it all the way back to the fingertip and occasionally it splits down even further!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is magic.  I have not had to reapply to that fingertip, although I did fix another nail and part of the fix stuff popped off...but the thing is, the part that was actually split was still covered. All I had to do was refile the remaining fix on that nail so that the part where the fix came off was smooth. Then I reapplied the clear base coat that I had on. (no color for me yet because I&#x27;m just beginning to get my nails healthy after a few months of gel polish and the resulting removal with harsh polish removal, all but destroyed them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, back to my original problem nail. I did TWO coats on that one and maybe that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s lasted so long. I applied it on the 15th of July and today is the 22nd.  So one full week and it&#x27;s still on and the nail is growing out. MORE importantly, when i get a nail that splits and snags I immediately apply this fix and no more snagging!  The smaller the split, tear or break the better. So the key is to get them when they first appear. If your nails are like mine (paper thin and fragile) this product will allow you to have many snag free days. And if I can do it easily ANYONE can do it.</li>
            <li> I was never able to have ALL my nails be nice at once.This kit is&lt;br /&gt;really great, and I don&#x27;t have to have them professionally done&lt;br /&gt;anymore! People complement my manicure all the time!</li>
            <li> I have has a vertical split in my thumbnail for a year.  Three months of applying this every 2 weeks under my gel manicures and I am back to normal&lt;br /&gt;  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This Rescue Kit is an absolute &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34; for any manicure kit you own.  I have had long nails for almost 30 years now and have certainly tried every so called repair product out there at least once, but none of them really did what they were supposed to do, or at least didn&#x27;t do it for very long.  I was skeptical with this product as well, but Sally&#x27;s Beauty recommended it so I figured I&#x27;d try it.  Boy am I every glad I did.  First time using I was nervous because me and any acrylic products just do not get along; I figured I would mess this up big time....but, to my sheer surprise, it was very simple and worked great. My nail broke right at the edge of the nail bed and I was sure this would not support it (being so long a nail and all).  It worked flawlessley; I made sure I used a moderate coat of glue (not too thick and evenly spread); dipped the nail into the acrylic; pulled it out and waited for it to thoroughly dry. Now, once issue I did notice -- my nails are long and therefore the tiny container of acrylic was just way too small for my entire nail to lay down into it and expect an even coat; so, I put the powder in another container which worked just great.  I&#x27;ve since replaced the acrylic repair 3 times as the break grows out and not a single problem.  I just love this stuff and will be buying much more of it to keep on hand.  I highly recommend you give it a try!</li>
            <li> The product is OK, and does rescue the nail. The problem is that it is impossible to hide that the nail has been repaired, because it gets a different texture than the other nails, especially when I put polish on.</li>
            <li> I have 2 nails that tear on the side of the nail bed above the tip.&lt;br /&gt;Very painful to cut the nail so short.  This was quick and easy and lasts for at least 2 weeks.  So happy I found this product.</li>
            <li> This actually works. I bought it not knowing anything about the product but in desperate need of keeping one nail from continuing to split. Easy to use, doesn&#x27;t change color, works and looks good.</li>
            <li> I have 1 nail on each hand that splits down the middle to the quick.  It is painful when they split, so I keep my nails trimmed super short. I was going to buy a gel resin, silk wraps, and setting spray.  This would have cost over $20.  However, I saw this and decided to give it a try first, especially since it was only 6.99 at Sally&#x27;s. It is easy to use.  You brush on the glue and immediately dip your nail into the powder jar.  Let it dry for a minute, then buff and reapply for a super strength repair.  I keep my nails polished with clear coat and this is still sheer enough for  me to go around with clear polish.  You can use a ridge filler before the clear coat if you want a smoother finish.  I didn&#x27;t have any on hand, but I am still ok with how it looks.  This is easier and quicker than doing a DIY silk wrap! It looks like acrylics have been put on the 2 nails, which makes them a little thicker.  I am very happy with the strength of these 2 nails.</li>
            <li> Worked surprisingly well, but it doesn&#x27;t last forever.  If too much pressure is put on the nail which is cracked, it will inevitably crack again. The buffer is a MUST if you don&#x27;t want your nails to look sandy.</li>
            <li> I love growing my nails long  but hate, hate it when I break one of them at a time and have to trim that nail short to prevent painful breakage that also takes away some of the nail bed skin too (ouch!). I tried a lot of nail glues and tapes but not all are effective and easy to use. Enter this Orly Nail Rescue Kit to the rescue (no pun intended). It&#x27;s true to its name.  So I applied it on a clean buffed damaged nail, dipped it into the powder, dried and then buffed. After buffing , I waited several minutes and applied nail polish. Just one thin coat ( I used Opi-Tickle My France-y , lovely nude shade})  as I want to see if the Kit will do it&#x27;s job. I wanted to make it water resistant with the nail polish. That&#x27;s it.  It&#x27;s been a day now, and happy and excited to say, it really did its job .Then I looked thru my nail polish; I can&#x27;t see the breakage on my nail. Like magic ,the kit mended my nail. So out of curiosity, I removed my polish and looked closely at my mended nail. It really blended with my nail. . so I am not waiting for a week to write this review. I know I have a new friend with the name Orly.</li>
            <li> I just sat down to apply this Orly product and I thought i really should post a review so others will know how great this has been for my damaged nails. My right thumb always has a split that snags  on things. I just brush some of the glue over the nail tip and about halfway down the nail then immediately press the nail into the small jar of powder. This dries immediately. I then smooth out the nail with the sander that comes with the kit and paint my nails. It lasts  for a good week then I file it off and reapply. This product gives the split nail plenty of time to grow out. I also love the Orly Top2 Bottom top coat. All Orly products are well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> This kit contains everything you need for those pesky split nails.  The brush on glue is easy to use without excess glue and the powder makes a great seal while the nail grows out</li>
            <li> It works well, but the glue rapidly becomes too thick. What can I do?</li>
            <li> great stuff  hold broken nail until it is long enough to cut back and not be&lt;br /&gt;a ripped jagged edge  a must for my nails that are dry and break</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I have issues with my fingernails cracking on the side and thought that this would be the best way to go to save my nails and overall it works but not quite as well as I was hoping. I followed the directions, you put on the nail glue and quickly dip your finger nail into the nail powder and let all of it dry, then follow it with a buffing. The issue that I had was that the nail glue dried quickly and you had excess powder after dipping your nail and I had to do this process multiple times to get the desired strength. Also, I noticed that it only lasted a week. I believe that this product will work well if you want to temporarily save the nail so I can grow out and then trim it off.</li>
            <li> I carry this in my purse all the time. There is nothing more painful than your nail breaking and then getting caught in your hair or on your clothes and ripping to the nail bed. Ouch. This kit is easy to use on the go and saves you until you can get home to tend the injured nail.</li>
            <li> After losing a nail when it was damaged, it grew back in with a split...so annoying.  I tried this product and I&#x27;ve been able to grow out the nail - no split!  I didn&#x27;t expect that to happen - I just wanted something to cover the nail - but what a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply the glue, then pour the powder over the nail with a small spoon (over the powder container, so I don&#x27;t waste any).  It takes no time to dry, and I usually apply a second coat, repeating the process.  Then I file with the little buffer provided - but I take it a step further and really buff it with a four sided file....that gets it extremely smooth and shiney.  I can go with or without polish after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will last five to six days, then I repeat - but the process takes only about five minutes at the most - so no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has changed my ability to grow out a damaged nail - and I will use it any time I have a split.  Oh - and the nail beneath is NOT damaged!</li>
            <li> Glue is fine; powder is fine, I guess. Nail is VERY difficult to buff down, even with all the tools I have to do so. The included buffer is useless (too small, very little effect). I guess I don&#x27;t understand why everyone is raving about this kit.</li>
            <li> EASY to use, and works great!</li>
            <li> I am in a bowling league and my thumbnail on my bowling hand would get damaged from bowling.  I started using this product and it has helped to lessen the damage to my nail.  I also used it on a toenail that was split down the middle to keep it from splitting more as I let it grow out.</li>
            <li> I have struggled to find a good home nail repair kit that both lasts and doesn&#x27;t show.  I&#x27;ve tried tissues, glues, sprinkle on powders with various results - none great.  I found the Orly Nail Rescue kit after watching a professional successfully repair one of my nails and decided to see if there was a similar product for home use. Brush on glue, dip the nail in powder, buff and the nail is ready to polish. Not sure if the Orly product is the same but it&#x27;s by far the best home nail repair product I&#x27;ve tried. I read mixed reviews on other sites and wasn&#x27;t sure if this would hold together a complete tear all the way through - but after two days, it&#x27;s still holding strong (given my nails are long - they get a lot of pressure).  I&#x27;ve posted an image to show that there is still no sign of the tear.  One possible caveat is that I do use gel polish which probably adds to the strength of the repair.</li>
            <li> I used so many nail menders over the years, they are good but usually need time and patience to apply. This product is the fastest fix I&#x27;v ever used .. dip on the go !&lt;br /&gt;the first time i used it i was in a hurry and didnt have time to coat it with a base coat, it started chipping the next day. but at least it kept my nail chip together and prevented from completely breaking. The next time i used it i immediately top it with a gel glue, followed by my regular base coat, and i got great results.&lt;br /&gt;this is the fastest fix iv ever used, very practical and i will order a second piece now already to keep it in my office for emergency!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product. I always used another product that is no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;This is so much better then that other one I used to save my nail. My nails always seem to break halfway up the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot remove it so I fear the nail getting caught on something and being ripped off with a lot of pain.&lt;br /&gt;This worked so great. I put the cloth nail over my broken nail and put on the glue and that was it. After it dried I used an emory board to take off the excess cloth and I polished my nail. I could have even left my nails with out polish. It looked fine. I will never be without this kit. It works.</li>
            <li> I have always had issues with my nails breaking and splitting . I actually get the kind of breaks where it&#x27;s like a hangnail and super painful to even try to get off . I usually put a band aid on my finger when this happens so I don&#x27;t snag it and people don&#x27;t see it . This is a great product ! It&#x27;s almost like an acrylic overlay that holds the nail in place until it grows out . I can just use this and sweep polish over it and no more pain or embarsment. This is a must buy for any ladies that mind their nails :)</li>
            <li> I tried this product several times in different kinds of nail trauma (big slipts, small splits, cracks, etc) and I never got this to work (and yes, I read the instructions).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everytime the thing would fall off in 2 or 3 days and I could never leave the surface smooth enough (once I spent 15 minutes working on it) so the polish could sit evenly on the nail. Another thing is that the base coat and nail polish would sort of &amp;#34;sink&amp;#34; into the repaired area, leaving the finishing with lots of little holes and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Works well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This stuff is definitely a nail saver. I post nail art on Instagram and also review products so my pictures look best when my nails are long. I&#x27;ve had several cracks and having this on them has prevented them from breaking off completely. It&#x27;s really easy to apply. Just make sure to buff it out really well or your nails will look bumpy</li>
            <li> This has got to be one of the best nail purchases I have ever made. Seriously! I have nails that are always chipping, breaking, peeling, splitting, etc... and this product has saved me from cutting down my nails on so many occasions. I truly don&#x27;t think I can live without this product!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product. It was shipped on time. I would order again</li>
            <li> Needed an alternative for a discontinued product; the staff at Sally&#x27;s recommended this.  It is AWSOME!  I have a nail split at the &amp;#34;quick&amp;#34; half way across the width.  I didn&#x27;t quite follow instructions.  I put a layer of glue, then a piece of teabag cloth, another glue coat, then did the powder dip and buffing.  It has been holding for a week.  Strong and looks great; love it.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as described. I bought it for the 2nd time.</li>
            <li> What a nail saver!!! So tired of small cracks or breaks running my manicure. Great idea Thank you so much</li>
            <li> This is the best best best product I love it. I have the weakest nails and always got acrylics this helps extremely when I crack my nails. Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> when I broke them it was way down on the nail bed and I have been just holding out because I font want to lose the length so I have been filing them down each week as they grow. Thankfully another 2-3 weeks and they should be gone. I am so happy I started to use Orly Nail rescue as it has been a life saver! I now have one at the office and one for home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a bit getting used to buffing the patches down to get a smooth application but after a few times I have the hang of it. As a blogger that does a ton of nail polish reviews this saved my swatch hand.</li>
            <li> This product works but the glue dries up in container before the powder is anywhere near used up. But this seller is out of mind to ask 49 dollars for this kit. do not pay more than 12 dollars dor it</li>
            <li> I love this repair kit! It saved my thumbnail. 3 easy steps. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, it is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t take long for it to set. The repair last pretty long until the nail grows out. I have spliting and breaking nails due to hand washing continually, because of my job in the medical profession and I am allergic to the glue from fake nails. It was hard to keep an bandaide on until the nail grew up because of the handwashing also.&lt;br /&gt;The other products had an plastic covering that didn&#x27;t stay and usually washed off before even going to work. I appreciated the Sally&#x27;s coupon I received from my purchase also and now know to look for this product there at the Sally&#x27;s shop when I need another supply. Thanks</li>
