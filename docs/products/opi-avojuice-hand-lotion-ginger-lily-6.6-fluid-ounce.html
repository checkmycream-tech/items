            <li>The Ginger Lily lotion scent is not heavy like some of those alcohol-based perfumes.  </li>
            <li>so I am constantly washing my hands &amp; using hand sanitizer, which really takes a toll on your skin.</li>
            <li>They absorb so well and make hands and feet feel SO soft to the touch</li>
            <li>but that doesn&#x27;t last long absorbs very fast into skin</li>

            <li> the lotion smells wonderful and feels great on my skin..but it only lasts about an hour if that long..the bottle is also small for the pricing..</li>
            <li> Awesome lotion, very light and smells great! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin oily or greasy and it soaks in quickly leaving your skin feeling softer and smoother than ever! This is my favorite lotion and I won&#x27;t use anything else. It&#x27;s perfect for any need, face, hands, legs, feet, etc.</li>
            <li> The size pictured is 20 ox this is not what is sold  6.6oz is sold.  Picture is misleading&lt;br /&gt;Seller needs to be very CLEAR in their description!  The product is fabulous the seller is not&lt;br /&gt;clear in their description and needs to be to avoid buyers feeling jipped.&lt;br /&gt;I ALMOST bought this then bought elsewhere because of it</li>
            <li> love the smell and its a light weight lotion I like in the hot wheather, dont worry it&#x27;s not watery i have very dry skin and it stays moisturized for the entire day</li>
            <li> This is seriously my favorite hand lotion ever. The ginger lily fragrance is one of my favorites. Vanilla snowflake is also heavenly. They&#x27;re kind of pricy for hand lotion, but (super-frugal, penny-pinching me) finds it worth it. Never greasy, amazing scents... I ask for new bottles every Christmas in case someone else feels like splurging on my behalf. Because we all know that&#x27;s even better.</li>
            <li> My best friend told me about this product. Tried it, loved it, got one as a gift for a friend. She loved it and her husband even liked it!!!! Now that&#x27;s a good product!!!! The ginger lily smells really nice! Just a very light scent. It goes on very light and creamy. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I love OPI&#x27;s AvoJuice.  The lotion sinks into your skin.  While you can tell (slightly) that you have applied some lotion, your fingers may feel a little slippier, it does not feel greasy nor does it leave residue on anything you handle.  Aching skin immediately feels easier and less itchy or painful.  The Ginger Lily lotion scent is not heavy like some of those alcohol-based perfumes.

            <li> I love this stuff. First the smell is amazing not overpowering at all. The lotion itself is very good.
