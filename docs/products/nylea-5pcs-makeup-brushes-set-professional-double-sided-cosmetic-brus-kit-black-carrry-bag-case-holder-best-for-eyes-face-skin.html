            <li>and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li>Fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li>Good brushes work well</li>
            <li>I find the bigger angled one perfect for getting the eyeshadow in the crease line, and if you angle it to align with your eyelashes, you get a perfect cat-eye look.</li>

            <li>I love these brushes!</li>
            <li>My favorite part is the fact that is has two sides on each brush!</li>
            <li>Love it!  </li>
            <li>It fits great into your purse to take with you to work, or it is easy to pack to take with you if you go on a trip somewhere.  </li>
            <li>(p.s the price is amazing for the quality)</li>
            <li>found the quality of the bristles to be amazing.</li>
            <li>I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li>Although I received this at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review, it does not change my opinion.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.are my own.</li>
            <li>Nice Makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Nice brush set I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Nice product, will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I honestly like having the option of not washing my brushes for a day or two, so</li>
            <li>The brush picked up a nice amount of the makeup and allowed me to tap off the access without removing all of the makeup from the brush as I tapped.</li>
            <li>They also come in a nice bag that stores them.</li>
            <li>They came in a nice pouch with a slot for each brush, and even a zippered side slot for extras.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*I received this item at a promotional rate in exchange for an honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li>received a discount on these brushes however my reviews remain honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li>packaging is so nice and sleek.</li>
            <li>This set of double-ended brushes comes in its own roomy case.  </li>
            <li>Nice brushes, liked them</li>
            <li>These were a gift to my girlfriend, and I must say she was very impressed after I told her how much they cost.</li>
            <li>None of these brushes are suitable for powder.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>but you will probably not be too impressed.ushes are suitable for powder.</li>
            <li>I also find that these work well with eyebrow powder or gel eyeliner - they&#x27;re more precise and good for smudging the under-eye area.</li>
            <li>Very happy it came quickly and was exactly what it portrayed the product to be.</li>
            <li>These are pretty great makeup brushes, though I do find some of them to be on the stiffer side.</li>
            <li>For somebody who it not too concerned about using the exact &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; brush, this set is great.  </li>
            <li>If you are building your makeup brush collection these are a nice start at a pretty fair price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I did use them to contour just the other day and the angled brushes were perfect for applying contour powder on the side of my nose and in the hollows of my cheek bones - they are shaped just the right way to make a beautiful and flawless line, you just have to get a fluffier brush to actually blend the product in.</li>
            <li>the picture below, I used most of the brushes for my makeup look.</li>
            <li>What I like most is even though its 5 brushes it&#x27;s really more like 10 because they have a brush on both ends</li>
            <li>She also said she wished the set were more complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the feel of these brushes.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is dual-sided</li>
            <li>great thing about these is that they&#x27;re double-sided, so they save space, and every makeup artist wannabe knows just how much space makeup brushes and applicators can take up.</li>
            <li>what so ever with hairs falling off your face, the foundation brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li>These were ordered as a gift, and they were pleased with them.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the travel case</li>
            <li>top eyeliner brush/Lip brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li>and they hold up through washing and all the love</li>
            <li>i love ittt </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>These are a great set of brushes and very compact since they are double-sided.</li>
            <li>Great brushes, fast with shipping.</li>
            <li>These are a perfect set for one just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>eyeliner--*this is shaped more like a &#x27;push brush&#x27;, used to &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; eyeliner into lash line (1) and lip brush (6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not find the concealer brush (8) worked well for concealing, I had to blend it out with my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it would probably work better for a cream eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>but it would probably work better for a cream eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>They also come in this adorable case that holds the brushes in place.</li>
            <li>I would agree that a cover or cap would be helpful to avoid spreading makeup all over the bag, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>And I love the carrying case .</li>
            <li>But take a close look at the product photos to make sure these are the style you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really excited about these makeup brushes!</li>
            <li>They were not really that impressive.</li>
            <li>it can also be used for more precise contouring.&lt;br</li>
            <li>which makes this a good brush set to own if you are experienced in makeup because you would know how to use the detail aspect of the brush set because if you are beginner it can be confusing if you don&#x27;t know what brush can be used for what purpose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful leather case with a nice pouch to carry the make up or other</li>
            <li>brushes move easily across the skin, and they are flexible.  </li>
            <li>I love that they are easy to clean without ruining the bristles.</li>
            <li>The carry pouch makes them easy to toss into your purse or bag.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These brushes are super soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I did not notice any streaks from the brushes after applying my full face of makeup, even while I was outdoor (where it is most noticeable).</li>
            <li>This is a fine set of brushes.  </li>
            <li>The foundation and contour brushes worked just fine.</li>
            <li>The set worked fine, it just felt clumsier and not quite as suited to my needs than what I am used to.</li>

            <li>Nice brushes, very soft and work well :)</li>
            <li>I cant say much about the brush quality since it was a gift, all i know is that the brushes have a nice length and look fabulous.</li>
            <li>They also fit really comfortably in your hand because they&#x27;re light in weight.</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE beauty fan and &#x27;collector of all things makeup&#x27;</li>
            <li>They also are comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it’s great value for what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the brushes for a month or so and like the way the feel against my skin and apply my makeup--evenly and smoothly.</li>
            <li>Free product sample received in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a great set of makeup brushes and I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>come in a neat case that holds each brush securely in its place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The makeup brushes are so cute, it&#x27;s perfect for a young girl who&#x27;s just starting out.</li>

            <li>This is a fantastic set of brushes.</li>
            <li>firm i guess is the best description.  </li>
            <li>definitely think these work as well as my MAC brushes without the expense and with a great variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They come in a great case that has a zip up pocket, so you can store either your drivers license, some cash, or extra makeup to take along with you.  </li>
            <li>nice brushes fast shipping</li>
            <li>The case is nice and the extra pocket is nice design.</li>
            <li>The quality is good and the plethora of brushes can be used for many different things -- whether it&#x27;s on the eyes or face.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!  </li>
            <li>These would be perfect in a hard case that the lid would slid off easy to take in and out and put the lid on when you done.</li>
            <li>think  these brushes are pretty useful - they make a great addition to your makeup kit, particularly if you like smokey eye look and contouring.</li>
            <li>Very Nice.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be this nice for the price, actually went back and purchased 3 more for my daughters</li>
            <li>They are easy to clean and dry fairly quickly, which is great if you are using it while traveling.  </li>
            <li>use baby shampoo to clean my makeup brushes, after washing I rinse clean and use a towel or paper towel to reshape the bristles.</li>
            <li>I noticed a comment from someone about the bristles not being soft enough, but I think they are of wonderful quality, but they are ..</li>
            <li>I love that the brushes come in such a handy carrying case, I can take it on the go since every brush I would need for a full daytime makeup look is included in this set.</li>
            <li>I actually liked the angled eyebrow brush and the eyeliner flat top brush.</li>
            <li>I actually liked the angled eyebrow brush and the eyeliner flat top brush.</li>
            <li>The brushes are really good quality, pretty, and so soft.</li>
            <li>I love how modern and sleek they look.</li>
            <li>I love my brushes fast &amp; prompt delivery</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have not had any issues using these brushes and my daughter is just learning and these have made it so much easier for her to actually be able to apply the make up</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how their original price is $39.99 because they&#x27;re worth maybe $7.</li>
            <li>Now I have some brushes I can take with me to do a quick fix when I need</li>
            <li>The case is nice and is compact enough to fit into my makeup case.  </li>
            <li>The brushes come with a nice little pouch to store them in, and they have been holding on very strong, she is still using them to this day.</li>
            <li>I have used mine and am very pleased, They are well made and functional because you can use both side with different shades.</li>
            <li>concealer brush (8) and the lip brush (6) are pretty much interchangeable.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very classy and stylish to travel with.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are super soft ,and using my elf brush cleaner, are super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>so I was pretty excited when I was offered a sample of these brushes to test and review.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Double sided brushes with very smooth soft bristles.  </li>
            <li>They work just fine and loved the little case/zipper</li>
            <li>but, overall, a nice item.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny</li>
            <li>They apply my makeup perfectly with little to no fall out, and they&#x27;re very simple to clean.</li>
            <li>These are very well made and seem great quality but were not exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristle/hair is soft, very close-knit together, and fine easy movement of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are easy to clean with a mild soap and they dry quickly.  </li>
            <li>The black and white make them very attractive.</li>
            <li>I think they&#x27;re good for beginners because they&#x27;re very light and aren&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li>I defiantly recommend anyone getting these, they are great for traveling and everyday use!</li>
            <li>uses:&lt;br /&gt;The blending brush (7) Is one of those great multi-use brushes that can be used for smudging and blending eyeliner (main use), applying and blending concealer, creating a smoky eye (pick up some dark eyeshadow with it and blend it out around</li>
            <li>I like them very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very modern looking.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>And I love the black and white look, super cute!</li>
            <li>first thing I noticed about this five piece set is the case it comes in.</li>
            <li>It is 5pc set, but because of double sided brush, it is like getting 10 pcs brush set.&lt;br /&gt;Brush holding case is ok.  </li>
            <li>But when actually applying makeup, some brushes feels more stiffer than what I am used to it.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed and they hold makeup pretty well.  </li>
            <li>and I love the extra compartment built on it.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Love that its double ended, makes it easier.</li>
            <li>and you are still getting so many different brush tips this way</li>
            <li>At first look these are some pretty brushes and well-organized.</li>
            <li>These brushes are super inexpensive with decent quality.</li>
            <li>I love the variety, especially the angled brushes for brows and creases.  </li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described</li>
            <li>Simple, yet elegant.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was cheap but was pleasantly surprised by its quality.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>ended flat top eyeliner and lip</li>
            <li>If you are a beginner this set could be a fun and cheap way to experiment with some different brush styles and figure out what works for you.</li>
            <li>If you are a beginner this set could be a fun and cheap way to experiment with some different brush styles and figure out what works for you.</li>
            <li>But the brushes are clearly pictured and after taking a second look there is nothing that indicates that the brush I was looking for was in this set, so that was my own fault.  </li>
            <li>Even though there are some obvious typos regarding what the brush hairs are made up of, it&#x27;s pretty easy to guess that they are synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a nice black nylon?</li>
            <li>Personally, I just store my brushes in a mug for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Length:&lt;br /&gt;double ended large foundation and large angled contour brush:</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t need to repurchase any time soon, but when I do need new brushes, I will be back for these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would call these ok quality but definitely not “extremely high quality.”</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t as soft as I would like for applying foundation or concealer  - they actually tend to leave visible scrapes and even take off some of the previously applied product, so I don&#x27;t find them ideal for blending.</li>
            <li>As bit as nice as much more expensive brushes I have purchased.</li>
            <li>a whole make up look with this dual-purpose brush set.</li>
            <li>but it does have the smaller brushes for detailed work to smudge the eyeshadow and place color on the lid.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>wife tried them out and says they work really well.</li>
            <li>Blending is very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I enjoy the various sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li>They make putting my eye makeup on much easier.</li>
            <li>The case is very simple, looks cheap and insignificant, but it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes...</li>
            <li>I pot them through very well.</li>
            <li>I will still have these in years to come, just really well made brushes.</li>
            <li>really like this set</li>
            <li>The whole set is very well designed and packaged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really 10 brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They pick up and hold product very well.</li>
            <li>these dont&#x27; work very well</li>
            <li>A nice fluffy blending brush for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>My conclusion is this is an okay set, especially for traveling (because of the size and dual-ended nature of the brushes) but it is not my preferred set or complete.</li>
            <li>A nice fluffy blending brush for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>My conclusion is this is an okay set, especially for traveling (because of the size and dual-ended nature of the brushes) but it is not my preferred set or complete.</li>
            <li>They range from nearly microscopic to very large.</li>
            <li>The brush set includes concealer brushes,foundation brushes, detailed pointy brushes, a flat eyeliner brush that is angled, a lip brush etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was in desperate need of new ones and these are just the perfect brushes.</li>
            <li>When there is a list price of 39.99 with a discount of 27.00, that tells me that the product is probably worth the discounted price and that the list price is extremely inflated to make it look like a better deal than it actually is.</li>
            <li>I was worried they would stain quickly because of the white color, but I haven&#x27;t run into that problem yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x27;double ended blending (7) and angled eyeshadow brush (2)&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;double ended concealer (8) and eye brow brush (</li>
            <li>synthetic bristles are very soft and apply the make up very well.</li>
            <li>Nylea makeup brush set is very pretty, I love the black and white color combo.</li>
            <li>very soft!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>High quality from end to end.</li>
            <li>The dual ends on the brushes are highly efficient when travelling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes don&#x27;t pick up and hold onto makeup as well as some of the other makeup brushes I own, but they do still work well enough to use.</li>
            <li>3)&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;double ended flat top</li>
            <li>As you&#x27;re applying makeup you may need to get a little more on your brush than you&#x27;re used to season the brushes.</li>
            <li>I wish it was a little thicker for better application.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the dual tips because they take up so little room</li>
            <li>Not stiff and prickly and very well made.  </li>
            <li>soft real synthetic hairs do not fall out, even while applying my makeup.</li>
            <li>Recieved my brushes and I just wished they would&#x27;ve been more softer not to harsh on your face</li>
            <li>The brush does not fall apart when I use it, and I&#x27;ve been using them everyday :)</li>
            <li>Not comfortable bag case for every day using, but for traveling will be ok.</li>
            <li>It fits into her purse easily and has several double sided brushes for whatever make-up she needs to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&#x27;double ended large foundation (4) and large angled contour brush (</li>
            <li>The bristles are a bit stiff and they don&#x27;t seem to hold as much product as other brands, but it&#x27;s a fair trade off for the set&#x27;s portability and compactness.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can live without them too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While these are okay brushes for the price, for my needs this set is missing some vital</li>
            <li>The quality of the synthetic hair is very soft and durable.</li>
            <li>The bristles on the brush are very soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The brushes are extremely soft!</li>
            <li>Also, while the case is nice I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll actually use it.  </li>
            <li>The supplied blending brush (7) is too small for blending out large areas, it is more suited to details such as smoking out eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>five piece professional make up brush is very soft</li>
            <li>I love these brushes because they&#x27;re double sided and take up less space.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s only for the large brush though.</li>
            <li>These brushes were a bit smaller than I expected, but should work fine.  </li>
            <li>I like how soft the bristles are.  </li>
            <li>Bushed are soft and convenient.  </li>
            <li>The reason for this being that each of the five makeup brushes is double ended, so you&#x27;re really getting two kinds of brushes on each piece.</li>
            <li>I could only compare their gentle caress to that of angel kisses.</li>
            <li>(5)pc professional look and feel.</li>
            <li>did not care for the brush bristles, they were like silicone vs natural hair</li>
            <li>No shedding so far even though my 2 year old used one to paint the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li>I added a purse-sized kabuki brush, and now the set is complete for my needs.  </li>
            <li>These are not big fluffy brushes, they&#x27;re  flat, so they are OK for gently applying makeup and contour powder/cream, but not for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This reduces the amount of time spent fumbling around for the right brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The case also has a zippered compartment so you can easily store cotton swabs, blush, eyeliner, or even a small compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>small eyeshadow brushes are a bit stiff, too, but they actually work just great.</li>
            <li>come in their own little carry case and each brush is held in place with a black elastic band and the largest brush</li>
            <li>I noticed that the large brush holder has a bit of Velcro so you can open to add the brush, then close the holder back up</li>
            <li>is best for cream and wet eyeshadow but is suitable for patting on dry eyeshadow although I found it stiff and a little uncomfortable on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>is best for cream and wet eyeshadow but is suitable for patting on dry eyeshadow although I found it stiff and a little uncomfortable on my eyelids.</li>
            <li>They even had the forethought to use Velcro to secure the larger brush so you didn&#x27;t have to smash it down into the elastic!</li>
            <li>Not only were they soft, but when it came to application they far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In general, while I like the portability and the fact that these are made of synthetic hair, I do wish some of them were just a bit softer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are so silky soft and applying make-up with them is simply a breeze.</li>
            <li>They come with a basic black organizer that might be useful for traveling.</li>
            <li>brush is very soft at touch, but its stuff enough to apply makeup with some control, especially when applying eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>So far they don&#x27;t apply much makeup to your face, but she told me you&#x27;ve got to give them a little time to loosen up.</li>
            <li>Brushes were soft bristles but too flat to work with</li>

            <li> But again you can always research brushes and use them the way you feel it would work best for your makeup application.</li>

            <li> and I would have no problems recommending these quality wise.</li>
            <li> and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way.</li>
            <li> Fit the bill perfectly.</li>
            <li> Good brushes work well</li>
            <li> I find the bigger angled one perfect for getting the eyeshadow in the crease line, and if you angle it to align with your eyelashes, you get a perfect cat-eye look.</li>
            <li> attractive brushes, fine quality, handy!  </li>
            <li> Love them, great product</li>

            <li> My favorite part is the fact that is has two sides on each brush!</li>
            <li> Love it!  </li>
            <li> It fits great into your purse to take with you to work, or it is easy to pack to take with you if you go on a trip somewhere.  </li>
            <li> (p.s the price is amazing for the quality)</li>
            <li> found the quality of the bristles to be amazing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Although I received this at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review, it does not change my opinion.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.are my own.</li>
            <li> Nice Makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice brush set I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Nice product, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I honestly like having the option of not washing my brushes for a day or two, so</li>
            <li> The brush picked up a nice amount of the makeup and allowed me to tap off the access without removing all of the makeup from the brush as I tapped.</li>
            <li> They also come in a nice bag that stores them.</li>
            <li> They came in a nice pouch with a slot for each brush, and even a zippered side slot for extras.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*I received this item at a promotional rate in exchange for an honest, unbiased review</li>
            <li> received a discount on these brushes however my reviews remain honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> packaging is so nice and sleek.</li>
            <li> This set of double-ended brushes comes in its own roomy case.  </li>
            <li> Nice brushes, liked them</li>
            <li> These were a gift to my girlfriend, and I must say she was very impressed after I told her how much they cost.</li>
            <li> None of these brushes are suitable for powder.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> but you will probably not be too impressed.ushes are suitable for powder.</li>
            <li> I also find that these work well with eyebrow powder or gel eyeliner - they&#x27;re more precise and good for smudging the under-eye area.</li>
            <li> Very happy it came quickly and was exactly what it portrayed the product to be.</li>
            <li> These are pretty great makeup brushes, though I do find some of them to be on the stiffer side.</li>
            <li> For somebody who it not too concerned about using the exact &amp;#34;right&amp;#34; brush, this set is great.  </li>
            <li> If you are building your makeup brush collection these are a nice start at a pretty fair price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I did use them to contour just the other day and the angled brushes were perfect for applying contour powder on the side of my nose and in the hollows of my cheek bones - they are shaped just the right way to make a beautiful and flawless line, you just have to get a fluffier brush to actually blend the product in.</li>
            <li> the picture below, I used most of the brushes for my makeup look.</li>
            <li> What I like most is even though its 5 brushes it&#x27;s really more like 10 because they have a brush on both ends</li>
            <li> She also said she wished the set were more complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the feel of these brushes.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is dual-sided</li>
            <li> great thing about these is that they&#x27;re double-sided, so they save space, and every makeup artist wannabe knows just how much space makeup brushes and applicators can take up.</li>
            <li> what so ever with hairs falling off your face, the foundation brush is my favorite.</li>
            <li> These were ordered as a gift, and they were pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the travel case</li>
            <li> top eyeliner brush/Lip brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> and they hold up through washing and all the love</li>
            <li> i love ittt </li>
            <li> I love them.</li>
            <li> These are a great set of brushes and very compact since they are double-sided.</li>
            <li> Great brushes, fast with shipping.</li>
            <li> These are a perfect set for one just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> eyeliner--*this is shaped more like a &#x27;push brush&#x27;, used to &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; eyeliner into lash line (1) and lip brush (6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not find the concealer brush (8) worked well for concealing, I had to blend it out with my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it would probably work better for a cream eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> but it would probably work better for a cream eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> They also come in this adorable case that holds the brushes in place.</li>
            <li> I would agree that a cover or cap would be helpful to avoid spreading makeup all over the bag, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> And I love the carrying case .</li>
            <li> But take a close look at the product photos to make sure these are the style you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about these makeup brushes!</li>
            <li> They were not really that impressive.</li>
            <li> it can also be used for more precise contouring.&lt;br</li>
            <li> which makes this a good brush set to own if you are experienced in makeup because you would know how to use the detail aspect of the brush set because if you are beginner it can be confusing if you don&#x27;t know what brush can be used for what purpose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a beautiful leather case with a nice pouch to carry the make up or other</li>
            <li> brushes move easily across the skin, and they are flexible.  </li>
            <li> I love that they are easy to clean without ruining the bristles.</li>
            <li> The carry pouch makes them easy to toss into your purse or bag.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These brushes are super soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any streaks from the brushes after applying my full face of makeup, even while I was outdoor (where it is most noticeable).</li>
            <li> This is a fine set of brushes.  </li>
            <li> The foundation and contour brushes worked just fine.</li>
            <li> The set worked fine, it just felt clumsier and not quite as suited to my needs than what I am used to.</li>

            <li> Nice brushes, very soft and work well :)</li>
            <li> I cant say much about the brush quality since it was a gift, all i know is that the brushes have a nice length and look fabulous.</li>
            <li> They also fit really comfortably in your hand because they&#x27;re light in weight.</li>

            <li> think  these brushes are pretty useful - they make a great addition to your makeup kit, particularly if you like smokey eye look and contouring.</li>
            <li> Very Nice.  Wasn&#x27;t expecting them to be this nice for the price, actually went back and purchased 3 more for my daughters</li>
            <li> They are easy to clean and dry fairly quickly, which is great if you are using it while traveling.  </li>
            <li> use baby shampoo to clean my makeup brushes, after washing I rinse clean and use a towel or paper towel to reshape the bristles.</li>
            <li> I noticed a comment from someone about the bristles not being soft enough, but I think they are of wonderful quality, but they are ..</li>
            <li> I love that the brushes come in such a handy carrying case, I can take it on the go since every brush I would need for a full daytime makeup look is included in this set.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the angled eyebrow brush and the eyeliner flat top brush.</li>
            <li> I actually liked the angled eyebrow brush and the eyeliner flat top brush.</li>
            <li> The brushes are really good quality, pretty, and so soft.</li>
            <li> I love how modern and sleek they look.</li>
            <li> I love my brushes fast &amp; prompt delivery</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have not had any issues using these brushes and my daughter is just learning and these have made it so much easier for her to actually be able to apply the make up</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how their original price is $39.99 because they&#x27;re worth maybe $7.</li>
            <li> Now I have some brushes I can take with me to do a quick fix when I need</li>
            <li> The case is nice and is compact enough to fit into my makeup case.  </li>
            <li> The brushes come with a nice little pouch to store them in, and they have been holding on very strong, she is still using them to this day.</li>
            <li> I have used mine and am very pleased, They are well made and functional because you can use both side with different shades.</li>
            <li> concealer brush (8) and the lip brush (6) are pretty much interchangeable.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very classy and stylish to travel with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are super soft ,and using my elf brush cleaner, are super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> so I was pretty excited when I was offered a sample of these brushes to test and review.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Double sided brushes with very smooth soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> They work just fine and loved the little case/zipper</li>
            <li> but, overall, a nice item.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny</li>
            <li> They apply my makeup perfectly with little to no fall out, and they&#x27;re very simple to clean.</li>
            <li> These are very well made and seem great quality but were not exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristle/hair is soft, very close-knit together, and fine easy movement of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are easy to clean with a mild soap and they dry quickly.  </li>
            <li> The black and white make them very attractive.</li>
            <li> I think they&#x27;re good for beginners because they&#x27;re very light and aren&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li> I defiantly recommend anyone getting these, they are great for traveling and everyday use!</li>
            <li> uses:&lt;br /&gt;The blending brush (7) Is one of those great multi-use brushes that can be used for smudging and blending eyeliner (main use), applying and blending concealer, creating a smoky eye (pick up some dark eyeshadow with it and blend it out around</li>
            <li> I like them very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very modern looking.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> And I love the black and white look, super cute!</li>
            <li> first thing I noticed about this five piece set is the case it comes in.</li>
            <li> It is 5pc set, but because of double sided brush, it is like getting 10 pcs brush set.&lt;br /&gt;Brush holding case is ok.  </li>
            <li> But when actually applying makeup, some brushes feels more stiffer than what I am used to it.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed and they hold makeup pretty well.  </li>
            <li> and I love the extra compartment built on it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Love that its double ended, makes it easier.</li>
            <li> and you are still getting so many different brush tips this way</li>
            <li> At first look these are some pretty brushes and well-organized.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super inexpensive with decent quality.</li>
            <li> I love the variety, especially the angled brushes for brows and creases.  </li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described</li>
            <li> Simple, yet elegant.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was cheap but was pleasantly surprised by its quality.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> ended flat top eyeliner and lip</li>
            <li> If you are a beginner this set could be a fun and cheap way to experiment with some different brush styles and figure out what works for you.</li>
            <li> If you are a beginner this set could be a fun and cheap way to experiment with some different brush styles and figure out what works for you.</li>
            <li> But the brushes are clearly pictured and after taking a second look there is nothing that indicates that the brush I was looking for was in this set, so that was my own fault.  </li>
            <li> Even though there are some obvious typos regarding what the brush hairs are made up of, it&#x27;s pretty easy to guess that they are synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a nice black nylon?</li>
            <li> Personally, I just store my brushes in a mug for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Length:&lt;br /&gt;double ended large foundation and large angled contour brush:</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t need to repurchase any time soon, but when I do need new brushes, I will be back for these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would call these ok quality but definitely not “extremely high quality.”</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t as soft as I would like for applying foundation or concealer  - they actually tend to leave visible scrapes and even take off some of the previously applied product, so I don&#x27;t find them ideal for blending.</li>
            <li> As bit as nice as much more expensive brushes I have purchased.</li>
            <li> a whole make up look with this dual-purpose brush set.</li>
            <li> but it does have the smaller brushes for detailed work to smudge the eyeshadow and place color on the lid.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> wife tried them out and says they work really well.</li>
            <li> Blending is very easy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I enjoy the various sizes of brushes.</li>
            <li> They make putting my eye makeup on much easier.</li>
            <li> The case is very simple, looks cheap and insignificant, but it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes...</li>
            <li> I pot them through very well.</li>
            <li> I will still have these in years to come, just really well made brushes.</li>
            <li> really like this set</li>
            <li> The whole set is very well designed and packaged.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really 10 brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They pick up and hold product very well.</li>
            <li> these dont&#x27; work very well</li>
            <li> A nice fluffy blending brush for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> My conclusion is this is an okay set, especially for traveling (because of the size and dual-ended nature of the brushes) but it is not my preferred set or complete.</li>

            <li> My conclusion is this is an okay set, especially for traveling (because of the size and dual-ended nature of the brushes) but it is not my preferred set or complete.</li>
            <li> They range from nearly microscopic to very large.</li>
            <li> The brush set includes concealer brushes,foundation brushes, detailed pointy brushes, a flat eyeliner brush that is angled, a lip brush etc.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need of new ones and these are just the perfect brushes.</li>
            <li> When there is a list price of 39.99 with a discount of 27.00, that tells me that the product is probably worth the discounted price and that the list price is extremely inflated to make it look like a better deal than it actually is.</li>
            <li> I was worried they would stain quickly because of the white color, but I haven&#x27;t run into that problem yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;double ended blending (7) and angled eyeshadow brush (2)&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;double ended concealer (8) and eye brow brush (</li>
            <li> synthetic bristles are very soft and apply the make up very well.</li>
            <li> Nylea makeup brush set is very pretty, I love the black and white color combo.</li>
            <li> very soft!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> High quality from end to end.</li>
            <li> The dual ends on the brushes are highly efficient when travelling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes don&#x27;t pick up and hold onto makeup as well as some of the other makeup brushes I own, but they do still work well enough to use.</li>
            <li> 3)&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;double ended flat top</li>
            <li> As you&#x27;re applying makeup you may need to get a little more on your brush than you&#x27;re used to season the brushes.</li>
            <li> I wish it was a little thicker for better application.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the dual tips because they take up so little room</li>
            <li> Not stiff and prickly and very well made.  </li>
            <li> soft real synthetic hairs do not fall out, even while applying my makeup.</li>
            <li> Recieved my brushes and I just wished they would&#x27;ve been more softer not to harsh on your face</li>
            <li> The brush does not fall apart when I use it, and I&#x27;ve been using them everyday :)</li>
            <li> Not comfortable bag case for every day using, but for traveling will be ok.</li>
            <li> It fits into her purse easily and has several double sided brushes for whatever make-up she needs to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;double ended large foundation (4) and large angled contour brush (</li>
            <li> The bristles are a bit stiff and they don&#x27;t seem to hold as much product as other brands, but it&#x27;s a fair trade off for the set&#x27;s portability and compactness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can live without them too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While these are okay brushes for the price, for my needs this set is missing some vital</li>
            <li> The quality of the synthetic hair is very soft and durable.</li>
            <li> The bristles on the brush are very soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The brushes are extremely soft!</li>
            <li> Also, while the case is nice I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll actually use it.  </li>
            <li> The supplied blending brush (7) is too small for blending out large areas, it is more suited to details such as smoking out eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> five piece professional make up brush is very soft</li>
            <li> I love these brushes because they&#x27;re double sided and take up less space.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s only for the large brush though.</li>
            <li> These brushes were a bit smaller than I expected, but should work fine.  </li>
            <li> I like how soft the bristles are.  </li>
            <li> Bushed are soft and convenient.  </li>
            <li> The reason for this being that each of the five makeup brushes is double ended, so you&#x27;re really getting two kinds of brushes on each piece.</li>
            <li> I could only compare their gentle caress to that of angel kisses.</li>
            <li> (5)pc professional look and feel.</li>
            <li> did not care for the brush bristles, they were like silicone vs natural hair</li>
            <li> No shedding so far even though my 2 year old used one to paint the bathroom mirror.</li>
            <li> I added a purse-sized kabuki brush, and now the set is complete for my needs.  </li>
            <li> These are not big fluffy brushes, they&#x27;re  flat, so they are OK for gently applying makeup and contour powder/cream, but not for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This reduces the amount of time spent fumbling around for the right brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The case also has a zippered compartment so you can easily store cotton swabs, blush, eyeliner, or even a small compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> small eyeshadow brushes are a bit stiff, too, but they actually work just great.</li>
            <li> come in their own little carry case and each brush is held in place with a black elastic band and the largest brush</li>
            <li> I noticed that the large brush holder has a bit of Velcro so you can open to add the brush, then close the holder back up</li>
            <li> is best for cream and wet eyeshadow but is suitable for patting on dry eyeshadow although I found it stiff and a little uncomfortable on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> is best for cream and wet eyeshadow but is suitable for patting on dry eyeshadow although I found it stiff and a little uncomfortable on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> They even had the forethought to use Velcro to secure the larger brush so you didn&#x27;t have to smash it down into the elastic!</li>
            <li> Not only were they soft, but when it came to application they far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In general, while I like the portability and the fact that these are made of synthetic hair, I do wish some of them were just a bit softer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are so silky soft and applying make-up with them is simply a breeze.</li>
            <li> They come with a basic black organizer that might be useful for traveling.</li>
            <li> brush is very soft at touch, but its stuff enough to apply makeup with some control, especially when applying eye makeup.  </li>
            <li> So far they don&#x27;t apply much makeup to your face, but she told me you&#x27;ve got to give them a little time to loosen up.</li>
            <li> Brushes were soft bristles but too flat to work with</li>
            <li> Since these are double sided you can&#x27;t stand them upright to finish drying, so just lay them flat on a towel until they are dry enough to put back into the case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The snap on the case is pretty hard to close</li>
            <li> When placing back into the case you do have to be careful not to bend the brush hairs back as you slide the brush into the holder.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t care for the case once used its not very convenient to get them back in once you have pulled them out.</li>
            <li> They are not too soft and not too firm...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for brushes like these for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Actually there is no large powder brush which is one of the things I needed.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not like double ended brushes because they are hard to store but this set comes with a magnetic case.</li>
            <li> Synthetic by definition is fake, so “Real Sintetic Hair - no fake or false hairs” is completely inaccurate.</li>
            <li> problem I encountered is that since they are double sided some of the larger brushes can be a little difficult to get back into the loop of the case without fraying the brush so keeping them in the plastic sheaths that they come in really helps to solve this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> like that these brushes are dual sided and they are black and white in color.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I like the black &amp; white color scheme of the brush and the handle.</li>
            <li> The only reason for not a 5 star is that I wish the case would have been a little sturdier.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the case - it looked cheap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had them for a few days</li>
            <li> Something big and fluffy to apply blush and bronzer</li>
            <li> I bought one set for me and the other will be for my daughter for Christmas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;Other</li>
            <li> The only one I have yet to test is the small angled one used for eyeliner (I think).</li>
            <li> They are tightly compacted and do not have the fluffy feel like a traditional powder brush.  </li>
            <li> The only thing missing was a fluffy blending crease brush</li>
            <li> I usually buy cheapo brushes at Target and they last a few months.</li>
            <li> You aren&#x27;t weighed down carrying 10 brushes.</li>
            <li> I did not really like the eyeshadow brush because of the stiff and scratchy feel of it</li>
            <li> I did not really like the eyeshadow brush because of the stiff and scratchy feel of it</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the button on the bag is a little hard to close</li>
            <li> Brushs are a little hard so not good for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> From what I&#x27;ve seen, professionals tend to favor the stiffer bristles for more control , I however am a rank amateur and need the fluffier</li>
            <li> There is a little shedding on the powder brush but the wife used some mineral oil and cleaned the brush</li>
            <li> bristles don&#x27;t fall off, but they seem a little stiff.</li>
            <li> so it takes up less space, and that the carrying case also has a side zipper!</li>
            <li> Too stiff and synthetic for face</li>
            <li> just that it&#x27;s kinda hard to blend eyeshadow in your eyes, instead of blending</li>
            <li> At least what I would imagine an angel&#x27;s kiss to be like..</li>
            <li> In the description it states that these come with a leather case, yet I received them in a nylon case with a very small makeup pouch attached.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about these were the horrible smell of the bristles of the brushes.</li>
            <li> a lot of room for makeup&lt;br /&gt;Zipper for makeup storage seems weak</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really can not go wrong with them</li>

    <ol>
            <li> These are not as described. Synthetic by definition is fake, so “Real Sintetic Hair - no fake or false hairs” is completely inaccurate. The synthetic nylon is slippery and does not hold powdered or compressed product well. The double sided configuration is nice but a bit awkward to use. I would call these ok quality but definitely not “extremely high quality.” The case is nice and the extra pocket is nice design. When there is a list price of 39.99 with a discount of 27.00, that tells me that the product is probably worth the discounted price and that the list price is extremely inflated to make it look like a better deal than it actually is.</li>
            <li> I got this for my wife.  It fits into her purse easily and has several double sided brushes for whatever make-up she needs to use.  The only reason for not a 5 star is that I wish the case would have been a little sturdier.  but, overall, a nice item.</li>
            <li> I received this product for testing and review purposes.&lt;br /&gt;This five piece professional make up brush is very soft and it&#x27;s very classy and stylish to travel with.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I noticed about this five piece set is the case it comes in. It is vinyl material with a zipper front pocket and then it has a snap button latch and when you open it has two flaps and your five brushes are presented in elastic loops for the protection and storage of the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;I like that these brushes are dual sided and they are black and white in color.&lt;br /&gt;The synthetic bristles are very soft and apply the make up very well. There is a lot of detail on these brushes not only with the color but also with the logo and The brand Nylea. The brush set includes concealer brushes,foundation brushes, detailed pointy brushes, a flat eyeliner brush that is angled, a lip brush etc.&lt;br /&gt;I feel you can almost do a whole make up look with this dual-purpose brush set. The only thing missing was a fluffy blending crease brush but it does have the smaller brushes for detailed work to smudge the eyeshadow and place color on the lid.&lt;br /&gt;In the picture below, I used most of the brushes for my makeup look. In reality I see a 10pc makeup brush set instead of 5 because they are dual ended which makes this a good brush set to own if you are experienced in makeup because you would know how to use the detail aspect of the brush set because if you are beginner it can be confusing if you don&#x27;t know what brush can be used for what purpose. But again you can always research brushes and use them the way you feel it would work best for your makeup application.</li>
            <li> These Nylea makeup brushes are great quality. The black and white make them very attractive. What I like most is even though its 5 brushes it&#x27;s really more like 10 because they have a brush on both ends and they are all different sizes. I have washed the brushes a couple times already and they hold up perfectly. The bag it comes in is great also since it has flaps to cover the brushes to protect them. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the button on the bag is a little hard to close it might just be a fluke with mine though so I will still give it 5 stars since the brushes are awesome! I purchased this during a promotional pricing period for testing and the views I have expressed are my own.</li>
            <li> Brushs are a little hard so not good for sensitive skin like mine.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about these were the horrible smell of the bristles of the brushes. I let them air out over night and the smell is gone. The quality of the synthetic hair is very soft and durable. In the description it states that these come with a leather case, yet I received them in a nylon case with a very small makeup pouch attached. The handles feel well made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife tried them out and says they work really well. As you&#x27;re applying makeup you may need to get a little more on your brush than you&#x27;re used to season the brushes. So far they don&#x27;t apply much makeup to your face, but she told me you&#x27;ve got to give them a little time to loosen up. She also said she wished the set were more complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, they are good makeup brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product sample provided for testing and review</li>
            <li> This is a fine set of brushes.  One of the ways to determine the quality of the brush is to run your fingers through it.  The bristle/hair is soft, very close-knit together, and fine easy movement of the bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good brushes move easily across the skin, and they are flexible.  This set is just that.  And, they are double per each brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can find which works best for your makeup and which tip of each brush works best.  There are foundation bushes, eyeshadow brushes, eyeliner, rouge, etc.  Pick what works for you, don&#x27;t define to specific types.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel of these brushes.  And with 5 double-sided, you can be selective.  They wash easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carrying Case:  This is a nice black nylon? carrying case.  It holds each brush separately.  PLUS there is a zippered pouch for some make-up accessories.  Great for the bag, great for travel, keeping it in once piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very attractive brushes, fine quality, handy!  Review for product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the nicest travel makeup brushes for me! I love that it is dual-sided so it takes up less space, and that the carrying case also has a side zipper! The elastic keeps it in place so I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing any, Its not as great as my sigma brushes but for the price it works wonderful! It doesn&#x27;t shed like mac brushes which is great because i hate when the brush ends up all over my face instead of staying on the brush. Although I received this at a discounted rate for my honest unbiased review, it does not change my opinion. These are great for on the go, Even great for touch ups! And I love the black and white look, super cute!</li>
            <li> There are several things that I like about these brushes.  I like how soft the bristles are.  I like that they are double-sided.  They also are comfortable to hold.  The drawbacks for me are the size of the eye-shadow brush.  I wish it was a little thicker for better application.  Also, while the case is nice I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ll actually use it.  I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll take the time every time to return the brush to it&#x27;s slot after each use.  I also wish that there was something included to describe what each brush is for or a stamp of some sort on each end of the brush.  There&#x27;s just nothing included to let you know what each brush should be used for.  I&#x27;ve only had them for a few days so I can&#x27;t speak to the durability of these brushes but I plan to update my review once I&#x27;ve been using them for a while.</li>
            <li> I got  Nylea makeup brush set couple days ago. The brushes are really good quality, pretty, and so soft. The set have a good variation of all kinds of the brushes. These are great, I turned out to use the set  every time I apply makeup.  Highly recommend!!!!  Worth every penny</li>
            <li> These are pretty great makeup brushes, though I do find some of them to be on the stiffer side. They aren&#x27;t as soft as I would like for applying foundation or concealer  - they actually tend to leave visible scrapes and even take off some of the previously applied product, so I don&#x27;t find them ideal for blending. However, I did use them to contour just the other day and the angled brushes were perfect for applying contour powder on the side of my nose and in the hollows of my cheek bones - they are shaped just the right way to make a beautiful and flawless line, you just have to get a fluffier brush to actually blend the product in. These are not big fluffy brushes, they&#x27;re  flat, so they are OK for gently applying makeup and contour powder/cream, but not for blending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small eyeshadow brushes are a bit stiff, too, but they actually work just great. I find the bigger angled one perfect for getting the eyeshadow in the crease line, and if you angle it to align with your eyelashes, you get a perfect cat-eye look. I also find that these work well with eyebrow powder or gel eyeliner - they&#x27;re more precise and good for smudging the under-eye area. Blending is very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The great thing about these is that they&#x27;re double-sided, so they save space, and every makeup artist wannabe knows just how much space makeup brushes and applicators can take up. They come with a basic black organizer that might be useful for traveling. Personally, I just store my brushes in a mug for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think  these brushes are pretty useful - they make a great addition to your makeup kit, particularly if you like smokey eye look and contouring. In general, while I like the portability and the fact that these are made of synthetic hair, I do wish some of them were just a bit softer. It would also be awesome to see at leas one kabuki style brush in the set. Something big and fluffy to apply blush and bronzer with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of the product for evaluation purposes. All opinions are my own.are my own.</li>
            <li> Nice Makeup brushes. It is 5pc set, but because of double sided brush, it is like getting 10 pcs brush set.&lt;br /&gt;Brush holding case is ok.  Nothing fancy, but I can keep all brushes together in one place, great space saver.  .&lt;br /&gt;This brush is very soft at touch, but its stuff enough to apply makeup with some control, especially when applying eye makeup.  But when actually applying makeup, some brushes feels more stiffer than what I am used to it.  Overall, it’s great value for what you are getting.&lt;br /&gt;I received this brushes for evolution.</li>
            <li> Brochure some recommendations or suggestions for the use of brushes. brings nothing in writing.</li>
            <li> I bought one set for me and the other will be for my daughter for Christmas. I have used mine and am very pleased, They are well made and functional because you can use both side with different shades.</li>
            <li> I got these for myself while I was shopping for things for my daughter. I like them very much. They seem to be of good quality and I enjoy the various sizes of brushes. They make putting my eye makeup on much easier.</li>
            <li> They were not really that impressive. I guess I&#x27;m just not used to the texture.</li>
            <li> Nice brushes, very soft and work well :)</li>
            <li> I cant say much about the brush quality since it was a gift, all i know is that the brushes have a nice length and look fabulous. Double side is a plus. The case is very simple, looks cheap and insignificant, but it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> Recieved my brushes and I just wished they would&#x27;ve been more softer not to harsh on your face but besides that the quality of the brushes are great. They do they job just that it&#x27;s kinda hard to blend eyeshadow in your eyes, instead of blending it seems to to take off the eyeshadow instead. These are great for traveling and keeping it in your purse for touch ups. I also like that it comes it with makeup brush bag to store the brushes, keeps them in place. Especially in your purse, that way they won&#x27;t go all over the place. The brushes also do not shed which is  great! I have not have any issues what so ever with hairs falling off your face, the foundation brush is my favorite. It applys foundation how it&#x27;s supposed to and does it&#x27;s work correctly.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes...</li>
            <li> Very happy it came quickly and was exactly what it portrayed the product to be. Nice brush set I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very nice set of brushes to address all of your makeup needs.  I love that they are easy to clean without ruining the bristles.</li>
            <li> Bushed are soft and convenient.  Helpful to have brushes at both ends.</li>
            <li> very soft! good quality.</li>
            <li> These brushes were a bit smaller than I expected, but should work fine.  I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the case - it looked cheap.  These were ordered as a gift, and they were pleased with them.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes but I don&#x27;t care for the case once used its not very convenient to get them back in once you have pulled them out. These would be perfect in a hard case that the lid would slid off easy to take in and out and put the lid on when you done.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best brushes I have ever used. Would recommend to someone who is a beginner in makeup because i got these when i was a beginner and they have been with me ever since. Great quality, the hairs of the brush don&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice makeup brush set.  Not stiff and prickly and very well made.  They don&#x27;t shed and they hold makeup pretty well.  This set comes in a pouch, so perfect for putting in my purse.</li>
            <li> Great brushes! Definitely a must have.</li>
            <li> A very nice set of brushes. Completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are super soft ,and using my elf brush cleaner, are super easy to clean. The brush does not fall apart when I use it, and I&#x27;ve been using them everyday :) I am in love with the travel case it comes with it is really good quality and I love the extra compartment built on it. I defiantly recommend anyone getting these, they are great for traveling and everyday use! (p.s the price is amazing for the quality)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the brushes for a month or so and like the way the feel against my skin and apply my makeup--evenly and smoothly. I would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Free product sample received in exchange for an unbiased review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Nylea makeup brush set is very pretty, I love the black and white color combo. I also like the double sided brushes and the way they look displayed in the carry case. Even though there are some obvious typos regarding what the brush hairs are made up of, it&#x27;s pretty easy to guess that they are synthetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes don&#x27;t pick up and hold onto makeup as well as some of the other makeup brushes I own, but they do still work well enough to use. The carry pouch makes them easy to toss into your purse or bag. When placing back into the case you do have to be careful not to bend the brush hairs back as you slide the brush into the holder. I noticed that the large brush holder has a bit of Velcro so you can open to add the brush, then close the holder back up, it&#x27;s only for the large brush though. The case also has a zippered compartment so you can easily store cotton swabs, blush, eyeliner, or even a small compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes that are included in this set are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Large foundation/Angled contour brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medium sized foundation brush/Eye shadow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blending brush/Angled eye shadow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Concealer brush/Eye brow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flat top eyeliner brush/Lip brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use baby shampoo to clean my makeup brushes, after washing I rinse clean and use a towel or paper towel to reshape the bristles. Since these are double sided you can&#x27;t stand them upright to finish drying, so just lay them flat on a towel until they are dry enough to put back into the case. This is a pretty set of makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Nice product, will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing 5 piece set of makeup brushes! I believe that a girl can NEVER have enough makeup brushes. I honestly like having the option of not washing my brushes for a day or two, so having a bunch is a definite yes for me.. I loved the look of these, so I couldn&#x27;t wait to see how they held up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The set is advertised as 5 pieces, but I would actually consider it as 11.. The reason for this being that each of the five makeup brushes is double ended, so you&#x27;re really getting two kinds of brushes on each piece. They also come in a very nice traveling case! That makes eleven...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are extremely soft! I could only compare their gentle caress to that of angel kisses. At least what I would imagine an angel&#x27;s kiss to be like.. They apply my makeup perfectly with little to no fall out, and they&#x27;re very simple to clean. I was worried they would stain quickly because of the white color, but I haven&#x27;t run into that problem yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great set of makeup brushes and I would definitely buy again. These would make a VERY nice gift. I highly recommend them. (I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.)</li>
            <li> Love these brushes! Use them daily. So functional! I&#x27;ve had them a while now and they hold up through washing and all the love I pot them through very well. I will still have these in years to come, just really well made brushes.</li>
            <li> Good brushes...bristles don&#x27;t fall off, but they seem a little stiff.</li>
            <li> You are technically getting 10 brushes because these brushes are double ended. The quality is good and the plethora of brushes can be used for many different things -- whether it&#x27;s on the eyes or face.</li>
            <li> I received these promptly after ordering.&lt;br /&gt;They come in a neat case that holds each brush securely in its place.&lt;br /&gt;I found the quality of the bristles to be amazing. Not only were they soft, but when it came to application they far exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;High quality bristles&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery&lt;br /&gt;Nice case&lt;br /&gt;Nice even application&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The snap on the case is pretty hard to close&lt;br /&gt;Not a lot of room for makeup&lt;br /&gt;Zipper for makeup storage seems weak</li>
            <li> gooooddd i love ittt </li>
            <li> I love them. These makeup brushes are a great replacement. The dual ends make for great use, very soft and provide excellent makeup coverage.</li>
            <li> The makeup brushes are so cute, it&#x27;s perfect for a young girl who&#x27;s just starting out. I think they&#x27;re good for beginners because they&#x27;re very light and aren&#x27;t very thick. Also it comes with a traveling case so you can take it with you when you&#x27;re out somewhere. It has a pouch so you can put your makeup inside too. I love these brushes because they&#x27;re double sided and take up less space.  I love how modern and sleek they look. They also fit really comfortably in your hand because they&#x27;re light in weight. Now I have some brushes I can take with me to do a quick fix when I need it.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however it does not affect my thoughts or opinions.</li>
            <li> The softest makeup brushes I have ever used! High quality from end to end. (5)pc professional look and feel. I usually do not like double ended brushes because they are hard to store but this set comes with a magnetic case. The case holds the brushes in place and keeps them in perfect condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soft real synthetic hairs do not fall out, even while applying my makeup. The brush picked up a nice amount of the makeup and allowed me to tap off the access without removing all of the makeup from the brush as I tapped. Application was flawless, the brushes glide over the skin nicely giving me an even coverage. I did not notice any streaks from the brushes after applying my full face of makeup, even while I was outdoor (where it is most noticeable). I love that the brushes come in such a handy carrying case, I can take it on the go since every brush I would need for a full daytime makeup look is included in this set. Sample provided for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Would work well for acrylic paint, not makeup! Too stiff and synthetic for face</li>
            <li> These are a great set of brushes and very compact since they are double-sided. They also come in a nice bag that stores them.</li>
            <li> My daughter is happy with it</li>
            <li> These are cheap. I don&#x27;t know how their original price is $39.99 because they&#x27;re worth maybe $7.</li>
            <li> did not care for the brush bristles, they were like silicone vs natural hair so makeup could not be applied well.thank you</li>
            <li> Love them, great product</li>
            <li> I love my brushes fast &amp; prompt delivery</li>
            <li> Brushes were soft bristles but too flat to work with</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! My favorite part is the fact that is has two sides on each brush!</li>
            <li> Great brushes, fast with shipping. Very satisfied and I  would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Very nice set. Love that its double ended, makes it easier.</li>
            <li> Nylea 5pcs Makeup Brushes Set - This is a very nice set of make - up brushes. I LOVE the dual tips because they take up so little room and you are still getting so many different brush tips this way 10 tips instead of 5 but only the space of 5 brushes.&lt;br /&gt;They are so silky soft and applying make-up with them is simply a breeze. These are a perfect set for one just starting out.&lt;br /&gt;They come in their own little carry case and each brush is held in place with a black elastic band and the largest brush you can actually lift up the band so that you do not damage the bristles of the brush and that one is held in place with some velcro too.&lt;br /&gt;We have not had any issues using these brushes and my daughter is just learning and these have made it so much easier for her to actually be able to apply the make up properly.&lt;br /&gt;We really like this set it is so comfortable to use them and they are so silky.&lt;br /&gt;Really can not go wrong with them and they have a money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;these are the brushes that are included -&lt;br /&gt;Brushes set contains and Length:&lt;br /&gt;double ended large foundation and large angled contour brush: 175 (mm)&lt;br /&gt;double ended middle foundation brush and eyeshadow brush: 165(mm)&lt;br /&gt;double ended blending and angled eyeshadow brush:130(mm)&lt;br /&gt;double ended concealer eye brow brush:138(mm)&lt;br /&gt;double ended flat top eyeliner and lip brush:145(mm)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;received these for free to give my review of them</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE beauty fan and &#x27;collector of all things makeup&#x27; so I was pretty excited when I was offered a sample of these brushes to test and review. At first look these are some pretty brushes and well-organized. They came in a nice pouch with a slot for each brush, and even a zippered side slot for extras. They even had the forethought to use Velcro to secure the larger brush so you didn&#x27;t have to smash it down into the elastic! I decided to do a breakdown of each brush, because some people don&#x27;t know what all these are for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to identify these brushes I numbered them and identified them here, although some brushes have multiple uses. (Please note these brushes are not actually printed with numbers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;double ended large foundation (4) and large angled contour brush (9)&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;double ended middle foundation brush (5) and eyeshadow brush (10)&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;double ended blending (7) and angled eyeshadow brush (2)&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;double ended concealer (8) and eye brow brush (3)&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;double ended flat top eyeliner--*this is shaped more like a &#x27;push brush&#x27;, used to &amp;#34;push&amp;#34; eyeliner into lash line (1) and lip brush (6)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Other uses:&lt;br /&gt;The blending brush (7) Is one of those great multi-use brushes that can be used for smudging and blending eyeliner (main use), applying and blending concealer, creating a smoky eye (pick up some dark eyeshadow with it and blend it out around eyes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The angled eyeshadow brush (2) can also be used for applying concealer to smaller detail areas like under the eyes, around the nose, etc. it can also be used for more precise contouring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The concealer brush (8) and the lip brush (6) are pretty much interchangeable. It is personal preference, as I prefer (6) for concealing and either of these brush styles can be used as a lip brush. I did not find the concealer brush (8) worked well for concealing, I had to blend it out with my finger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While these are okay brushes for the price, for my needs this set is missing some vital parts.&lt;br /&gt;1. A powder brush. None of these brushes are suitable for powder.&lt;br /&gt;2. A blush/bronzer brush, preferably one for each.&lt;br /&gt;3. A nice fluffy blending brush for eyeshadow. The eyeshadow brush supplied (10) is best for cream and wet eyeshadow but is suitable for patting on dry eyeshadow although I found it stiff and a little uncomfortable on my eyelids. The supplied blending brush (7) is too small for blending out large areas, it is more suited to details such as smoking out eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;&#x27; My conclusion is this is an okay set, especially for traveling (because of the size and dual-ended nature of the brushes) but it is not my preferred set or complete. The foundation and contour brushes worked just fine. I actually liked the angled eyebrow brush and the eyeliner flat top brush. The blending brush worked alright for blending out my eyeliner. I did not really like the eyeshadow brush because of the stiff and scratchy feel of it but it would probably work better for a cream eyeshadow. The concealer brush did not work well for me but I prefer to use a fluffier brush to blend it out. The angled eyeshadow brush worked well for creating a crease but I had no way to blend it out. The set worked fine, it just felt clumsier and not quite as suited to my needs than what I am used to. If you are a beginner this set could be a fun and cheap way to experiment with some different brush styles and figure out what works for you. If you are experienced with makeup brushes you are probably an expert at improvising and can make this work but you will probably not be too impressed.ushes are suitable for powder. 2.

            <li> This is a fantastic set of brushes. Specifically, the range of sizes. They range from nearly microscopic to very large. The brushes are two-sided which makes using them easier. You can literally have two brushes in your hand at the same time. This reduces the amount of time spent fumbling around for the right brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the case is premium. It&#x27;s a beautiful leather case with a nice pouch to carry the make up or other items needed within reach while doing your make up. It is very handy. The whole set is very well designed and packaged.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really excited about these makeup brushes! I was in desperate need of new ones and these are just the perfect brushes. I usually buy cheapo brushes at Target and they last a few months. These brushes are beautifully made. They don&#x27;t shed!! They also come in this adorable case that holds the brushes in place. I would agree that a cover or cap would be helpful to avoid spreading makeup all over the bag, but it&#x27;s ok. I can live without them too. I like the black &amp; white color scheme of the brush and the handle. :) I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t need to repurchase any time soon, but when I do need new brushes, I will be back for these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I received this item at a promotional rate in exchange for an honest, unbiased review*</li>
            <li> .  These are very well made and seem great quality but were not exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;Double sided brushes with very smooth soft bristles.  No shedding so far even though my 2 year old used one to paint the bathroom mirror. The only one I have yet to test is the small angled one used for eyeliner (I think). I noticed a comment from someone about the bristles not being soft enough, but I think they are of wonderful quality, but they are .. firm i guess is the best description.  They are tightly compacted and do not have the fluffy feel like a traditional powder brush.  From what I&#x27;ve seen, professionals tend to favor the stiffer bristles for more control , I however am a rank amateur and need the fluffier models.&lt;br /&gt;  Actually there is no large powder brush which is one of the things I needed.  But the brushes are clearly pictured and after taking a second look there is nothing that indicates that the brush I was looking for was in this set, so that was my own fault.  And I love the carrying case . There are slots for the brushes and also a zippered pouch . Received a discount for product testing /review  and I would have no problems recommending these quality wise. But take a close look at the product photos to make sure these are the style you&#x27;re looking for</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this brush set. I&#x27;m so pleased I did.&lt;br /&gt;These brushes are super soft and beautiful. The case they come in has a zippered pouch allowing you to bring some of your essential make up along with the brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bonus that you may not notice from the pictures is that every brush is double sided! It&#x27;s really 10 brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One problem I encountered is that since they are double sided some of the larger brushes can be a little difficult to get back into the loop of the case without fraying the brush so keeping them in the plastic sheaths that they come in really helps to solve this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think these work as well as my MAC brushes without the expense and with a great variety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a discount on these brushes however my reviews remain honest and unbiased.</li>
            <li> What a great makeup brush set.  It states that it is a 5 piece set, but in actuality, they are double sided brushes, so you get 10 brushes in 5.  They come in a great case that has a zip up pocket, so you can store either your drivers license, some cash, or extra makeup to take along with you.  It fits great into your purse to take with you to work, or it is easy to pack to take with you if you go on a trip somewhere.  I am very happy with the quality of the brushes.  They are easy to clean and dry fairly quickly, which is great if you are using it while traveling.  I would recommend these highly.&lt;br /&gt;I was provided a sample for review and I did not promise a good rating in return, nor am I affiliated with this company or compensated in any way. I am just a regular Amazon customer who shops a lot on Amazon and enjoys sharing my experiences with others so that they can make an informative buying decision.</li>
            <li> These brushes are super inexpensive with decent quality. There is a little shedding on the powder brush but the wife used some mineral oil and cleaned the brush while fluffing it, the rest all brushes are great! If you are building your makeup brush collection these are a nice start at a pretty fair price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is so nice and sleek. It&#x27;s very modern looking. The dual ends on the brushes are highly efficient when travelling. You aren&#x27;t weighed down carrying 10 brushes. You can take 5 dual ended brushes and achieve the same outcome. The bristles on the brush are very soft. They pick up and hold product very well. The included case protects the brushes on the go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wife gives her thumbs up on these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample was provided for review purposes.</li>
            <li> This set of double-ended brushes comes in its own roomy case.  I love the variety, especially the angled brushes for brows and creases.  The bristles are a bit stiff and they don&#x27;t seem to hold as much product as other brands, but it&#x27;s a fair trade off for the set&#x27;s portability and compactness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes are easy to clean with a mild soap and they dry quickly.  I added a purse-sized kabuki brush, and now the set is complete for my needs.  This is a great addition to a gym bag, travel bag, or day bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product received for review.</li>

            <li> Simple, yet elegant. They do as they say, and they do it well. These were a gift to my girlfriend, and I must say she was very impressed after I told her how much they cost.
