            <li>Awesome find!</li>

            <li>Good buy for the money</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>It was perfect thanks</li>
            <li>Perfect for holding a braid together - very versatile.</li>
            <li>Nice, works as described.</li>
            <li>I love these combs.</li>
            <li>Love these...</li>
            <li>Love them.  </li>
            <li>I did love the style and</li>
            <li>zag part and used the combs to pull up the sides of my hair to add more volume to the top of my head.</li>
            <li>Love those!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>Interlocks perfectly and works much better than similar comb from Vidal Sasson</li>
            <li>These are my favorite hairclips but they break easy.</li>
            <li>Breaks to easy</li>
            <li>If you have curly hair like me it shows all the beautiful big curls, but keeps them away from my face.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine textured curly hair.</li>
            <li>I would love to get one made with higher quality materials.</li>
            <li>I love them, they were exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I like the looser fit of the comb, but most of my hair ends up outside the comb after an hour because it is too easy for my hair to fall out of the extension below the two combs.</li>
            <li>Worth the money to try it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t tell you how long I have been looking for this item, I am very pleased with products and price.</li>
            <li>but I like it very much</li>
            <li>I would definitely buy more if I could save on shipping.</li>
            <li>is perfect for pulling your hair back but leaving a long flow in the back versus a pony tail.</li>
            <li>This holds your hair similar to the 80&#x27;s banana clip - but way better - doesn&#x27;t feel like its pulling your hair like those old contraptions (I still have some and have used them on occasion).</li>
            <li>Old school but affective!!!</li>
            <li>Need more Dark colors.</li>
            <li>If you have hair like I do, I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>I love these little things!&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works in my hair as long as I don&#x27;t move my head quickly, otherwise it falls out.  </li>
            <li>Works especially well when you curl your hair first.</li>
            <li>This was just what I was looking for from the early 80&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>This does not work well with 4C natural hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is naturally wavy curls.</li>
            <li>For you young ladies - google banana clip and you will see the difference between this and the old</li>
            <li>I bought several many years ago and I am down to the last one which is about to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(My regular banana clips have lasted for a decade, but the new ones I bought also broke immediately, so I assume it&#x27;s the type of plastics now used.)</li>
            <li>I love this item and they are so hard to find!</li>
            <li>This comb will hold all your hair if it is very long and very curly.</li>
            <li>I love how this especially makes my hair look in the back which i usually don&#x27;t bother even looking.</li>

            <li> My hair is extremely thick and curly.</li>
            <li> Too expensive, you can buy a brown one for half the price.</li>

            <li> I like the looser fit of the comb, but most of my hair ends up outside the comb after an hour because it is too easy for my hair to fall out of the extension below the two combs. Maybe my shoulder length hair is too short for this type of comb.</li>
            <li> This comb will hold all your hair if it is very long and very curly. Too expensive, you can buy a brown one for half the price.</li>
            <li> So disappointed. This does not work well with 4C natural hair.</li>
            <li> Wish it was medal.  Breaks to easy,  Use it every day</li>

            <li> This broke the second time I wore it. I did love the style and how it made my hair look. I would love to get one made with higher quality materials.

            <li> I love this! I just took off the zig zag part and used the combs to pull up the sides of my hair to add more volume to the top of my head. Works especially well when you curl your hair first. I always have a supply of them!</li>
            <li> Love those!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
