            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Great product and makes shaving super easy, can&#x27;t get easier than this!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s much slower since he doesn&#x27;t have very good control.  </li>
            <li>I found the HeadBlade to be very comfortable and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and thorough and no worries about proper blade angle to get the best shave.</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing more of the lotions and blades.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>A friend of mine recommended this to me and I am glad he did.</li>
            <li>Love my Headblade.</li>
            <li>really glad I got it.</li>
            <li>and yes it does leave a nice smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
            <li>and we would recommend this to anyone who needs to keep their melon smooth!</li>
            <li>Came with many samples of head lube lotion, head pre-scrub, and shaving lotion.</li>
            <li>Glides right over a very prominent vein.  </li>
            <li>Love this thing should got one years ago easy to use</li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works, it&#x27;s easy to use, and while it looks like a toy</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to use</li>
            <li>I was an early adopter and my first shaver was still working great after many years.</li>
            <li>Feels smooth.</li>
            <li>now have used this product for a month, and can comfortably leave feedback on it with confidence.  </li>
            <li>Clean easy shave</li>
            <li>smooth shave</li>
            <li>the idea was good if it worked better than a regular razor.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and was amazing my first try.</li>
            <li>This is also super easy to use while shaving in the shower</li>
            <li>Best used in the shower where it&#x27;s easier to feel the rough spots you missed at first.</li>
            <li>The first day it cut a hole on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>It is super quick and easy use and glides along smoothly</li>
            <li>The included Head Slick shaving gel is awesome though.</li>
            <li>If you are bald, this is the fastest and easiest way to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li>I love the shave gel and really appreciate the samples that was provided with the kit.</li>
            <li>Overall it is a good product, cuts my head well</li>
            <li>Husband gets a quick clean shave every time.</li>
            <li>Good value in the box (especially if you need a refill)!  </li>
            <li>So refreshing these days to speak to a real person.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>The Headblade gave a much closer shave and was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that I do not get a very close shave and the blades wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li>It took a few days to get used to it, but it works great.</li>
            <li>but I do not think it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>Good luck paying the high price for a low quality design.</li>
            <li>(I am a Black Man with curly hair), and is a fair price.</li>
            <li>I tried the headblade out when I first started shaving my head, hoping it would be easier.  </li>
            <li>First time shaving my head and no cuts at all.</li>
            <li>standard razor is better</li>
            <li>First time shaved like a champ.</li>
            <li>The Headblade is the only way I&#x27;ll be able to maintain this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Got it for my husband - he absolutely loves it!  </li>
            <li>If this product had higher quality blades commensurate with the price I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Have been pretty nervous about using a &#x27;real&#x27; razor on my head.  </li>
            <li>All in all I love the HeadBlade and look forward to using it for a long time!</li>
            <li>The HeadBlade itself makes getting even the areas in the back of your head easy with the wheels and pivoting blades.</li>
            <li>This little gadget (and it is small - about the size of a Hot Wheel) gave me the best head shave</li>
            <li>Much smoother shave and quicker than electric razors.  </li>
            <li>no lie.... 4 mins to shave my whole head.</li>
            <li>and I think I really like it.</li>
            <li>and I feel like it speeds up the whole process.</li>
            <li>Left my head bowling ball smooth.</li>
            <li>The absolute ease of shaving your head without any nicks or cuts as it glides so effortlessly across my dome.</li>
            <li>, it is VERY effective.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>Thanks, I&#x27;ll be recommending to all my head shaving friends.</li>
            <li>bought this for my husband and he absolutely  loves it..</li>
            <li>Now, I can shave my head clean by myself - had to ask my wife&#x27;s help with a regular razor..</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend as a gift for any spouse whose husband has chosen to go with the Mr. Clean image.</li>
            <li>I envisioned myself using the ATX like an old school palm-pocket comb, and that is exactly how it works.  </li>
            <li>And the Head Slick in the kit has prevented any kind of razor bumps/burns from shaving.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Smooth action and takes away the hair in a single movement!</li>
            <li>I just wanted a new 5 blade model.</li>
            <li>I recently made the decision to keep my head shaved on a consistent basis.</li>
            <li>No more barbershop for me :))</li>
            <li>It takes a little longer, but is much better overall.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I even tried an old school bic to see and it was just a joke.</li>
            <li>My wife has checked me so far after each shave and can&#x27;t find any areas I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>Headblade makes shaving your head so much easier than using a standard razor.</li>
            <li>I was an early adopted of the head blade system.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I cannot compare this to any other method of shaving your head, safety razor, straight razor or electric razor, I highly recommend this kit if you are looking to start shaving your head...</li>
            <li>The only problem was my husband has large hands so putting it on the middle finger as illustrated</li>
            <li>It barely fits on his index or ring.</li>
            <li>Very convenient and far easier to wield than your typical hand-held razor.  </li>
            <li>The shaving products are fine, but not really anything out of the ordinary.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving for more than 2 years using regular shavers with no problems Used Headblade and cut myself twice, even though I was very careful and slow while using it.</li>
            <li>Much faster and easier than any previously tried product.</li>
            <li>Less nicks and much faster...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for other HeadBlade stuff such as the aftershave lotion ( I just use my facial after shave lotion for my head as well ) .</li>

            <li> though i can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing, I can totally feel with one hand that I&#x27;m shaving 100% with the other, and have not had any little &amp;#34;mohawks&amp;#34; left over.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I tried the headblade out when I first started shaving my head, hoping it would be easier.  I&#x27;m not a fan of cartridge razors anyway, but a regular cartridge razor (Mach 3, etc) works just as well as this thing.  After I switched to DE razors for my face, I tried them out on my head as well.  It takes a little longer, but is much better overall.</li>
            <li> I recently made the decision to keep my head shaved on a consistent basis. This is a great product!!! Regular razors are not designed for the head and thus are not really safe or comfortabl for shaving heads. I found the HeadBlade to be very comfortable and very easy to use. I love the shave gel and really appreciate the samples that was provided with the kit. I will be purchasing more of the lotions and blades. Great Product HeadBlade.</li>
            <li> Great product. First time shaving my head and no cuts at all. Feels smooth.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product but was very happy with my first shave. I plan to keep using it!</li>
            <li> The figure hole is small for my finger.  The first day it cut a hole on top of my head.  the idea was good if it worked better than a regular razor.</li>
            <li> This is great but I&#x27;ve decided that shaving my head enough to maintain that look is a total pain in the butt. Good razor though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for two weeks now. I love it. I shave my head in the shower and I do it totally by feel. It took a few days to get used to it, but it works great. I use one hand to steer the headblade and the other to feel my scalp and see where I need attention. A friend of mine recommended this to me and I am glad he did.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit for my husband and he LOVES it!!  Great product and makes shaving super easy, can&#x27;t get easier than this!</li>
            <li> Have been pretty nervous about using a &#x27;real&#x27; razor on my head.  But this is working out really great.  Much smoother shave and quicker than electric razors.  Glides right over a very prominent vein.  I am sold--getting rid of the electrics!</li>
            <li> The product is well built and simple enough to use. Like ANY razor product you need to be careful or else you will get nicked. Overall it is a good product, cuts my head well (I am a Black Man with curly hair), and is a fair price.</li>
            <li> novelty item.....standard razor is better</li>
            <li> Finally something that doesn&#x27;t take chunks out of my hubby&#x27;s head!  He loves the Headblade!</li>
            <li> After reviewing several options to begin shaving my head, previously using a hair trimmer without a clip on it, I opted for the Headblade ATX Kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design of the ATX shaver makes the process very simple.  I envisioned myself using the ATX like an old school palm-pocket comb, and that is exactly how it works.  It did take a few minutes to get used to the stroke of the ATX, but once I got the hang of it, it worked like a champ.  I have  shaved my head a few times now, and each time it gets easier and faster to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I cannot compare this to any other method of shaving your head, safety razor, straight razor or electric razor, I highly recommend this kit if you are looking to start shaving your head...it works well and is easy to use!!</li>
            <li> Love my Headblade. So easy to use. Nice even movement without fumbling like a razor. First time shaved like a champ. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Husband gets a quick clean shave every time. Much faster and easier than any previously tried product. Makes daily shaving less of a chore!</li>
            <li> I will never buy another Razor again. Head Blade was awesome it showed up fast and no lie.... 4 mins to shave my whole head. no nicks or cuts. I will buy for life.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this razor a couple times since I got it and I think I really like it. It is super quick and easy use and glides along smoothly so I don&#x27;t worry about cutting myself. This is also super easy to use while shaving in the shower and I feel like it speeds up the whole process. I recommend to anyone who shaves their head regularly.</li>
            <li> Left my head bowling ball smooth. Best used in the shower where it&#x27;s easier to feel the rough spots you missed at first.</li>
            <li> Wow. I&#x27;ve been terrified of shaving my head forever. I heard about Headblade when it launched years ago (when I still had hair) and filed it away for the time when it would be needed.&lt;br /&gt;40 yesterday..&lt;br /&gt;It arrived today.&lt;br /&gt;Shiny already.&lt;br /&gt;The unit was great to use. I even tried an old school bic to see and it was just a joke. The Headblade is the only way I&#x27;ll be able to maintain this.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really glad I got it.</li>
            <li> After hearing a lot of hype about the headblade and reading everyone&#x27;s experience regarding the product... I thought you know what the heck lets try it out.  As soon as I received my headblade; I ran upstairs, tried it out and yes it does leave a nice smooth shave.  It&#x27;s light weight and easy to use and I am happy that I purchased a headblade ATX.</li>
            <li> This is the best headblade to date! Smooth action and takes away the hair in a single movement! Awesome product</li>
            <li> This is one of the best inventions of all time. In the bald community this bad boy is an absolute life saver. I don&#x27;t know how life existed before Headblade! There is no question that I now have a marriage with this product for life. The absolute ease of shaving your head without any nicks or cuts as it glides so effortlessly across my dome. I can&#x27;t say thank you enough to Headblade! Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product. Now, I can shave my head clean by myself - had to ask my wife&#x27;s help with a regular razor.. It&#x27;s very easy to use and works perfect.</li>
            <li> I finally gave up and started shaving my head.  I wouldn&#x27;t have done this step if I hadn&#x27;t seen this product and watched the YouTube video demonstrating how to use it.  I knew using a standard razor as I do for my face would cause issues because of how you have to hold it.&lt;br /&gt;I now have used this product for a month, and can comfortably leave feedback on it with confidence.  I LOVE IT.  It works, it&#x27;s easy to use, and while it looks like a toy and I have to keep my boys from it, it is VERY effective.&lt;br /&gt;Even though i can&#x27;t see what I&#x27;m doing, I can totally feel with one hand that I&#x27;m shaving 100% with the other, and have not had any little &amp;#34;mohawks&amp;#34; left over.  My wife has checked me so far after each shave and can&#x27;t find any areas I&#x27;ve missed.&lt;br /&gt;Word of warning - don&#x27;t let that mentholated Slick shaving gel get in your eyes...... ouch!!</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Clean easy shave</li>
            <li> My husband asked for the HeadBlade ATX Kit and had been using the HeadBlade Sport for a few years...smooth shave and we would recommend this to anyone who needs to keep their melon smooth!</li>
            <li> Bought the Headblade as a gift for my husband. We&#x27;ve been using clippers to shave his head once a week. The Headblade gave a much closer shave and was so easy to use. The only problem was my husband has large hands so putting it on the middle finger as illustrated was nearly impossible. It barely fits on his index or ring. He can still use it but it&#x27;s much slower since he doesn&#x27;t have very good control.  All and all, great product but they need to consider men with larger hands.</li>
            <li> Good value in the box (especially if you need a refill)!  If you are bald, this is the fastest and easiest way to get a clean shave.</li>
            <li> Headblade makes shaving your head so much easier than using a standard razor. Customer service is great. So refreshing these days to speak to a real person.  Thanks, I&#x27;ll be recommending to all my head shaving friends.</li>
            <li> I have used this 5 times and each time the clip that holds the blade to the device keeps falling off. Amazon says I can&#x27;t return it because of shipping problems. I replaced the clip and the same thing occurs. Good luck paying the high price for a low quality design.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving for more than 2 years using regular shavers with no problems Used Headblade and cut myself twice, even though I was very careful and slow while using it.</li>
            <li> Headblade just is not a good product.  Husband was excited to revive razor but was very disappointed when he used it.  Service was great though.</li>
            <li> if you are trying to stay bald using an electric razor and its taking you 45 minutes to shave use this product in the shower. No need for any gel just comb from front to back starting at the center. if I can do it you can do it.</li>
            <li> This little gadget (and it is small - about the size of a Hot Wheel) gave me the best head shave I&#x27;ve ever had. Very smooth and thorough and no worries about proper blade angle to get the best shave. The shaving products are fine, but not really anything out of the ordinary. I&#x27;ve shaved a half-dozen times since I got this and the blades remain sharp. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I was an early adopted of the head blade system.  The ATX is no exception.  I always feel great in the morning when I shave my head.&lt;br /&gt;Just so you know, I have tried most shave creams, but the HB cream seems to work best....</li>
            <li> If you are going to start shaving your head smooth then this is a great kit to start off with. I think that the Gillette Mach 3 razor and blade is the best way to shave your head. But the HeadBlade ATX is a close second. I am using both. I use the shaving cream from HeadBlade every time I shave my head. I don&#x27;t particularly care for other HeadBlade stuff such as the aftershave lotion ( I just use my facial after shave lotion for my head as well ) .</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband - he absolutely loves it!  Very convenient and far easier to wield than your typical hand-held razor.  He says the &amp;#34;Head Slick&amp;#34; solution is the way to go instead of your typical shaving cream.  Would definitely recommend as a gift for any spouse whose husband has chosen to go with the Mr. Clean image.</li>
            <li> Love this thing should got one years ago easy to use</li>
            <li> Love HeadBlade products! I was an early adopter and my first shaver was still working great after many years. I just wanted a new 5 blade model. It shipped quickly and was amazing my first try. Great product, great seller. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Did not like it. Despite the ease of use, it did not give me a close of a shave as desired. And I cut myself worse with the blade than I have ever have with even a cheap Bic razor. I am staying with my Hydro 5 blades. The included Head Slick shaving gel is awesome though.</li>
            <li> Shaving your head can be a difficult and tedious task. I like the design of the Headblade ATX but I do not think it&#x27;s worth the money. I have noticed that I do not get a very close shave and the blades wear out very quickly. Replacement blades are very expensive. If this product had higher quality blades commensurate with the price I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband and he absolutely  loves it.. it works great and it arrived so quickly</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Very easy to use. And good quality blades. No more barbershop for me :))</li>
            <li> Bought it because I shave my head and standard razors were cutting it. Less nicks and much faster... excellent product</li>
            <li> The so called ATX razor was no better at navigating my bumpy head than a standard razor. I in fact had to go over it THREE times due to it&#x27;s poor cutting performance, and it actually nicked me which had never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend passing on what seems to be a gimmicky razor with no real benefit.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. Came with many samples of head lube lotion, head pre-scrub, and shaving lotion. I can shave my entire head in the shower in under five minutes with this. Very easy to use. I was afraid it was a gimmick that would not work well, but I was wrong. The HeadSlick lotion for shaving is mentholated and feels great on the head. I would suggest buying additional HeadLube (aftershave lotion) and HeadScrub (pre-shave gritty scrub). With everyday shaving, I go through one blade every 3-4 weeks. I have not experienced the red bumps or rash I used to get with regular four blade razors. I don&#x27;t know if this is from the HeadSlick product or the head blades themselves. I would not suggest regular shaving cream like I use to use. Use the product that comes with this kit.</li>
            <li> Great product! My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Awesome kit.....as advertised....great price!</li>
            <li> Will definitely keep ordering</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the HeadBlade! I got it after a friend of mine said it&#x27;s what he uses exclusively and I can see why. The HeadBlade itself makes getting even the areas in the back of your head easy with the wheels and pivoting blades. And the Head Slick in the kit has prevented any kind of razor bumps/burns from shaving. All in all I love the HeadBlade and look forward to using it for a long time!</li>
