            <li>I was once told I smelled nice while wearing it...</li>
            <li>Because its considered a hazardous liquid, it cannot be returned to Amazon.</li>
            <li>When it came it was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li>Good stuff :)</li>
            <li>Honestly, there is fowl play about with the &#x27;Voyage&#x27; series.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice smelling non-feminine but non-macho fragrance.</li>
            <li>The bottle alone looks really nice in a collection.</li>
            <li>Nice colone,  but wears off after like 30 - 40 minutes.</li>

            <li>NICE FOR MY LADY TO SMELL ON ME</li>

            <li>My husband really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li>It has this nice melon/apple note that is a good change-up from the citrus that most summertime aquatic fragrances are centered around.  </li>

            <li>Got this for my husband and he really liked the smell</li>

            <li>Lovely scent.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased that version of Nautica.</li>
            <li>My fiance was very happy, especially with the size.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really safe blind-buy.</li>
            <li>I have not found another cologne I like better than this one.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot and this one gets the most compliments</li>
            <li>and I personally think it&#x27;s smells the best.</li>
            <li>My Axe is better and cheaper than this</li>
            <li>I dont know how to better describe it</li>
            <li>But, it is truly ok for me.  </li>
            <li>I love it with the price that I paid.</li>
            <li>If you love Eternity, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>love it.....</li>
            <li>smell deliciuos!! :-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will probably just have to spend more money and get something that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Authentic Nautica product.</li>
            <li>Definitely really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been my favorite for years</li>
            <li>and I love avoiding department store prices.</li>
            <li>but this one stays for the entire day, and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This cologne is in my top 5</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see many people mention this, but there is a cucumber-like scent in this cologne.</li>
            <li>I love this cologne....</li>
            <li>Not overpowering and all my lady friends love it.</li>
            <li>My friend gets most everything from amazon,so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite.</li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend and i love the way it smells on him when he runs out will be ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li>doesnt realy make it authentic at all.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I just wonder how many people did all these 5 star reviews deceive.</li>
            <li>BOD Man is a better and way cheaper fragrance than this or Tommy Hilfiger for $25.</li>
            <li>great cologne for a college kid who doesnt want to break his bank, but wants to get the girls.</li>
            <li>love the frangrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li>#winning</li>
            <li>It is a hit with many women.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he hasn&#x27;t really used it yet, but it came in great condition</li>
            <li>and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>so I go to a lot of houses a day and love this fragrance</li>
            <li>I read most of the reviews and decided to go for it</li>
            <li>love this cologne and for the price ever better</li>
            <li>I will buy more.</li>
            <li>Therefore I love it.</li>
            <li>but that is okay</li>
            <li>plan on getting more cologne by Nautica</li>
            <li>Great and fast delivery</li>
            <li>Smells more like alcohol than anything else</li>
            <li>The smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li>It is nice light scent, stays on my body for atleast 1 day , on clothes it will stay 2-4 hours if you spray 3-4 pumps.</li>
            <li>Well, a week in to owning this, and I&#x27;m 90% sure this is not a legit bottle of Nautica Voyage cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s discounted price and not a penny more.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;s favorite colognes.</li>
            <li>Sure, if I put my nose up to where I sprayed it</li>
            <li>I was looking for more woodsy.</li>
            <li>This, to me, smells more like an abercrimbie model.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I took a chance and purchased this.</li>
            <li>Though I love the Nautica men&#x27;s fragrances, I couldn&#x27;t believe the price they were asking.  </li>
            <li>hyped it up to be, but It&#x27;s a good, strong, and clean scent.</li>
            <li>I am upset with Amazon for allowing this product to be sold under what I had viewed to be a reputable website to buy from until now.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love this one.</li>
            <li>my family enjoyed this gifts</li>
            <li>i love this product .</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>

            <li>Great product fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li>Bought this at a really solid discount through Amazon, and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>I got more compliments wearing this at work than some of my Creed fragrances, and they cost $200 or more.</li>
            <li>and I love this scent</li>

            <li>this is one of my husbands favorite scents i love when he wears it .  </li>
            <li>What I like most about Voyage is that there&#x27;s this root-beer like fizz in the mix of it all as well.</li>
            <li>It has turned into one of our favorites for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>

            <li>The price is even better from amazon.</li>
            <li>Probably more of a summer fragrance.</li>
            <li>Boy, was I glad I didn&#x27;t shell out</li>
            <li>have gotten so many compliments from co-workers, and friends who think I paid a fortune for this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nautica</li>

            <li>I am most impresses about shipping it was shipped a day after I purchased and arrived in the Caribbean 1 day after</li>
            <li>wish they made a stronger version and charged more (aka, parfume).</li>
            <li>Outstanding clean/summer day scent.</li>
            <li>Overall it was a good deal for a nice sized bottle of some really good smelling cologne.</li>
            <li>By far my favorite cologne, i took a chance since the price was so good and tyre revieus were so good.....</li>
            <li>This is really the best bang for buck out there right now for cologne.</li>
            <li>It lasts all day, I get compliments constantly on how good I smell, I just love it!!  </li>

            <li>Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice clean aquatic.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome, and I am usually all over the Giorgio Armani, this is definitely a good tie with Acqua di Gio.</li>
            <li>nice clean fragrance, no cloying scent...</li>
            <li>Nice clean scent</li>
            <li>Smells pretty nice, it was very clean and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>

            <li>Great with the old school smell!!</li>
            <li>Quick shipping and smells amazing :)</li>
            <li>and noticed it was much stronger and more pleasant than mine.</li>
            <li>Very clean smelling.</li>
            <li>Very clean smell.</li>
            <li>Very clean and fragrant smell.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean and soapy.  </li>
            <li>What really got me about it was the amazing price!</li>
            <li>I recommend this to anyone who wants to smell amazing!</li>
            <li>still is pretty good</li>
            <li>First tried the cologne at a friends house and loved the smell</li>
            <li>It smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>Its perfect ... n stays long.</li>
            <li>For the price offered, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>If you wanna find a hot girls who likes a good cologne, get this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Smells awesome, lasts a long time, my girlfriend likes it.</li>
            <li>I did pretty good research before buying this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice sweet smelling cologne for guys.</li>
            <li>Really Nice cool scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty good.</li>
            <li>it works pretty good for me</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been paying attention to deals abt this fragrance for a long time and this is the best I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li>Be sure to have your signature scent for those special outings!</li>
            <li>It has good longevity that lasts about 10 hours strong, and the sillage is just right.</li>
            <li>But, that&#x27;s how great this scent is...not over-powering, long-lasting, crisp and clean and reeking of sexuality</li>
            <li>Smells good better than Nautica Pure</li>
            <li>First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li>I purchased this because of the great price and thought it would be great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Great product, fresh scent that is intriguing but not over powering.</li>
            <li>Nice scent but wears off rather quickly</li>
            <li>you ever gone in clubs/dances and brush by many men smelling a mixture of their sweat + strong and repugnant perfume?</li>
            <li>I sprayed 3-5 times on my neck and its way to refreshing but its strong.</li>
            <li>Nice smell but mild.</li>
            <li>It is also fairly potent for an aquatic fragrance, so easy on the trigger, two-three sprays on chest/neck will do it.  </li>
            <li>But it fades kind of quickly, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, even though I like the scent.</li>
            <li>It smells great, and I regularly get compliments from people telling me I smell nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it very much!</li>
            <li>This is a great cologne for any young man!</li>
            <li>This product was too good to be true; and the only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the customer service was great</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is easily the best cologne money can buy and as long as Nautica is producing it</li>
            <li>I like the crisp fresh scent, it&#x27;s light and very appealing, good for the evenings.</li>
            <li>new favorite!!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Can I tell you, this stuff is so clean and reshreshing and just so yummy!</li>
            <li>Original at such a great price!</li>
            <li>Clean, bright, soap fresh with sensual undertones.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s right, more so than the Ives Saint Laurent&#x27;s, the Gucci&#x27;s, the Bvlgari&#x27;s and even the Creeds!</li>
            <li>Very sweet</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many compliments by the ladies, this is highly recommended as a conservative option with a good manly fragrance.</li>
            <li>I bought Nautica Voyage without smelling it before hand and it was a great choice, the price was more than reasonable and it smells light and clean.</li>
            <li>My wife gifted it to me, thank you very much Shaminder !!</li>
            <li>I have been using this Nautica Men&#x27;s Cologne for many years now and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li>But this cologne has a cheap smell, it lasts for sure, hours maybe days, again it was from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Voyage smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t overpower you, nor does it completely impregnate you like others.</li>
            <li>Nautica &amp;#34;Island Voyage&amp;#34; is better, but this is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li>good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
            <li>never thought Cotty products would qualify as anything more than cheap.</li>
            <li>most important test is of course the smell.</li>
            <li>it still will hold a light watery scent sure to not scare anyone</li>
            <li>I am sure others might like it but for my liking the smell is too light.</li>
            <li>Ok it is cheap.</li>
            <li>She obviously has incredible taste....</li>
            <li>When i opened the box to get a whiff of it for the first time i immediatly was satisfied and it put a huge smile on my face i am extremly happy.</li>
            <li>they love it, also it smells smoothly and doesnt make me go nausiated,</li>
            <li>I find many scents overbearing and offensive, but I really enjoy smelling Nautica Voyage.</li>
            <li>, this is the best $18 I&#x27;ve ever spent.</li>
            <li>exactly how well I would like it and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Wife likes it which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li>Was shipped in time and is ideal for daily office usage.</li>
            <li>when i went to work and a girl who never talked to me told me straight: &#x27;&#x27; you smell good&#x27;&#x27; like that without shyness or whatever .....</li>

            <li>People will make excuses to stand near you just so they can smell it, very nice smell.</li>
            <li>Very clean scent with light citrus and fruit, almost watermelon.</li>
            <li>I sprayed this one time, and after about the 6th hour it was still so strong it nearly gave me a headache, but the scent is very nice</li>
            <li>It smells familiar to many people.  </li>
            <li>I ended up buying two other colognes, both excellent:  Skulls and Roses and Armani Code.  </li>
            <li>Sweet smelling drydown...almost an unisex perfume!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say for sure because I&#x27;ve never tried the original one</li>
            <li>It is too sweet smelling for being a man&#x27;s cologne!.</li>
            <li>Very quick delivery....</li>
            <li>The clean smell has attracted many females to compliment me on what I was wearing.</li>
            <li>Alot of reviews said they loved this, went and smelled it at Macy&#x27;s and decided it was amazing and ordered it here the same day.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li>I have had many different colognes, though this was a great surprise for the price.</li>
            <li>Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a fragrance that lasted longer than most, with a clean scent.</li>
            <li>What a fantastic cologne, at an even more fantastic price.</li>
            <li>clean smelling, love it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if mine is authentic or not, but the fragrance is nice and stays for quite some time (not the whole day).</li>
            <li>You just got out of the shower, and your whole body just happens to smell naturally fresh and great.</li>
            <li>At first I was pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>The aroma fades very quickly both on skin and on clothes.</li>
            <li>We also received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li>It is clean and refreshing and a pleasure to wear.</li>
            <li>This one is nice and clean, mild, on the sweeter side.  </li>
            <li>Can easily get 24 hours out of this.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell inoffensive and could be mistaken for a strong soap.</li>
            <li>Strong, but not too strong to the point of being overbearing.</li>
            <li>A sub-par toilette spray, smells too strong and &amp;#34;febreze&amp;#34; like for a man&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>that being said if you&#x27;re looking for something decent to wear without offending people this is a good bet</li>
            <li>This is sort of a classic cologne and smells really good.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend gave his bottle away as it was way to strong on him just using even two sprays.</li>
            <li>Good size pack in decent price .</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like extremely strong scents either.</li>
            <li>However.....this is way too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just too strong for</li>
            <li>it is definitely a strong contender.</li>
            <li>not overbearing or to strong @ all.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong.</li>
            <li>: kinda smelled a bit like axe without the strong fragrance</li>
            <li>For the price i didn&#x27;t expect this cologne to be so strong, two sprays</li>
            <li>The smell is not that much strong.</li>
            <li>If you dislike or you are allergic to strong smelling cologne, then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>Really strong smell, a bit too chemically for my taste.</li>
            <li>Not too strong.</li>
            <li>super fast and sure, the product is good, inexpensive ............&lt;br /&gt;Great .</li>
            <li>The best way for to describe it is think of like a nice fresh body wash and makes you feel fresh and clean, this is pretty much that smell.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My special lady friend loves the scent and I love the price.</li>
            <li>The top lid of the bottle came with a malfunction so right now since the fragrance and the price paid is OK</li>
            <li>The apple, lotus, and mimosa notes blend very nicely to create a perfect casual summer cologne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Lasts the whole day, very refreshing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very safe fragrance that can&#x27;t really disappoint.  </li>
            <li>This arrived much earlier than expected, great size for the price, and always smells great!</li>
            <li>First bottle of this was amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first day or two was amazing.</li>
            <li>This perfume is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>Its always better to smell sweet instead of</li>
            <li>I like my Cool Water better and wish I saved my money.  </li>
            <li>It perfect for around the house use or average wear .</li>
            <li>I like this a bit better than Cool Water even.</li>
            <li>ladies love cool j</li>
            <li>I had a first date planned with this girl, and i kind of forgot until she reminded me, and i thought &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like true love.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s crisp and nice.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t smell pretty on her S/O, not feminine at all...just a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing amazing, but it smells clean, fresh, and ocean-y.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, fresh and clean sort of smell.  </li>
            <li>Wanna smell fresh, clean &amp; nice ?</li>
            <li>THIS is hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn!!  </li>
            <li>A fresh and clean smell - kind of what I would expect Hollister Newport Beach to smell like if it were adapted as a cologne.</li>
            <li>It got a fresh scent and NOT too strong!</li>
            <li>The Nautica Voyage is an excellent fragrance and keeps the fragrance alive for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The price offered by Amazon is great and it ways higher on stores.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances &amp; I love being able to get it at such an amazing price through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Very clean and refreshing for any activity; whiter on a date or at the office Nautica Voyage will last the day and keep you in the good graces of those around you.</li>
            <li>The cologne arrived in good condition and appears to be new.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance is pretty linear, but it doesn&#x27;t matter if its great throughout the whole period.</li>
            <li>My wife is fine with it.</li>
            <li>An elegant, fresh, clean, and soothing scent that you are able to put on anytime of day for any occasion.</li>
            <li>I remember when my first bottle cost me over $50, so to get it at such a bargain price is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>But one spray does the job just fine.</li>
            <li>thats fine with me.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great, but it would be better If it lasts long</li>
            <li>scent is pretty great, very manly and what I would imagine VIP would smell like.</li>
            <li>Amazon delivered quickly!</li>
            <li>It was also super cheap!  </li>
            <li>I am pregnant and haven&#x27;t been able to stand any fragrances but this cologne didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>This quickly became my favorite cologne for anytime use.</li>
            <li>Luckily I was able to purchase it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li>but it goes away quick!</li>
            <li>It is pleasant, soft and soothing, not in a flowery way.  </li>
            <li>Its not too strong where it would offend your coworkers but its light at the end of day.</li>
            <li>I gave it a quick spray on my wrist (free cologne!)</li>
            <li>and then it quickly became my favorite smell of summer of 2012.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too strong and smells cheap (to me).</li>
            <li>Its a very nice fruity, soapy floral scent and since there is no citrus in it like typical aquatics, it is not harsh at all and very very pleasant to the nose.  </li>
            <li>but it has like a mild smell, more like a smell of alcohol and not like</li>
            <li>He wore this before I met him and when he ran out, I was quick to buy him more.</li>
            <li>I used this perfume in the past and got too many compliments, I first got it as a gift from a good friend of mine, but after smelling it and getting many good compliments at work and at the stores I bought me 3 more bottles</li>
            <li>Overall though not a bad buy and has an excellent fresh smell with a hint of sweetness to it.</li>
            <li>It is the real thing that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li>This cologne is strong, it lasts all day and smells great after only 1 spritz of it.</li>
            <li>This is really surprising, I am impressed by the performance of the fragrance, it does last a very long</li>
            <li>Also doesn&#x27;t have any type of overwhelming smell it to, just a nice natural smell!</li>
            <li>I loved this product and was very pleased with It and will other things when I need something else .I</li>
            <li>It is my first perfume by NAUTICA but the only thing i can say is it&#x27;s simply tremendously perfect sent and incredible deep powerful but also</li>

            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this fragance, too cheap, although it&#x27;s a fresh and modern scent; for  kool guys, I love it !</li>
            <li>The smell is not much durable but for the price is very good.</li>
            <li>Great price, it is the real thing and a large amount of it.</li>
            <li>It is much better than nautica classic and pretty good for its value.</li>
            <li>I tested the Nautica Voyage in Macy&#x27;s and it smelled good and the little amount that I put on my wrist lasted for a good 6-7 hours.</li>
            <li>If you want a relative cheap, fresh and very good perfume this is the one.</li>
            <li>A very pleasant and refreshing scent for a man who likes a fragrance that is not overwhelming to his women.</li>
            <li>The product is as advertised, has a fresh, groomed and manly scent and most important doesn&#x27;t smell like my father or grandfather.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, the ladies at work all enjoy it, and the smell last all day.  </li>
            <li>Great scent for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>Yes, it was cheap and it does linger.</li>

            <li>This is a headache-inducing, cheap smelling fragrance.</li>
            <li>Light Breezy Smell.</li>
            <li>It smells great and is fairly big for the price.</li>
            <li>Spend your money on genuine products, not this garbage.</li>
            <li>This scent is great, especially for the price point (under $20?).</li>
            <li>Those are the only words that I have to say as for the price it smells great.</li>
            <li>Probably that is why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li>Thought I should give this cologne a try since it is a name brand for a cheap price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the perfect everyday colonge.</li>
            <li>Fantastic.</li>
            <li>my all time favorite for daily use - price is good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s indeed incredible to find an item that worth such a token amount .</li>
            <li>I wish they could tell us how old the colognes are when we buy them, but then again that probably ain&#x27;t a good marketing strategy for them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft but smells good</li>
            <li>, THAT&#x27;S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!! :)</li>
            <li>Beautiful scent, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>With a refreshing smell will not bother others around you only with a good smell</li>
            <li>It has a really good smell but the biggest problem is that the smell does not even last more than an hour unless i spray myself</li>
            <li>It has a soft, &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; ( in a good way ) smell to it.  </li>
            <li>This is nowhere near as good of a product.  </li>
            <li>but after getting the bottle I have experienced what many others have experienced here on amazon where the scent is not exactly the same.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it came right on time.</li>
            <li>I love mens cologne and this has a nice clean sort of smell to it while still staying masculine.</li>
            <li>and we both love the clean, fresh and light smell.</li>
            <li>And for such a great price, it was definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>It a really cool cologne for the price..something u can wear to work that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li>The parfume is no to strong but is cool.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks, Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Purchased for my fianc&amp;eacute;e and he absolutely loves the smell!!!</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves the scent and said he wont wear anything else now!!!</li>
            <li>It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li>it smells very fresh.</li>
            <li>To me it seems like a very fresh aroma with an aquatic bouquet just as you&#x27;d suspect by looking at the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes in a very nice blue packing.</li>
            <li>She said it smells very fresh.</li>
            <li>Very fresh like grass/ocean kinda thing.</li>
            <li>Very fresh.</li>
            <li>very clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>Great smell and pretty cheap as far</li>
            <li>I ordered it from Amazon due to the incredible savings over getting it at the mall.  </li>
            <li>The sticker on the bottom of the bottle confirmed this - the original references the name Nautica and who produced the product.  </li>
            <li>Smells great, price is great, but doesnt last a long time.</li>
            <li>This fragance is really good, it&#x27;s for a cool gentleman who wants a fresh aroma.</li>
            <li>got many compliments for this, not so bold but neither dull, perfect mix</li>
            <li>Excellent, but the smell is so familiar there&#x27;s no way to stand out, but I suppose if you&#x27;re buying one of the most highly rated colognes on Amazon you&#x27;re not necessarily looking for a truly unique smell anyway, right?</li>
            <li>The light clean smell does not bother my sinus.</li>
            <li>Cheap cologne, a clean beachy scent, won&#x27;t turn heads but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It is super strong.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and Lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Excellent, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not extreme smell, but it good.</li>
            <li>so i highly recommend it for a nice summer day/night fragrance.</li>
            <li>Nautica Voyage, has a smooth scent that is not to strong, but just right for anyone to enjoy.</li>
            <li>and so did I. Fresh, clean smell and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li>very fresh and clean...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has strong smell of rose to it but in a masculine way.  </li>
            <li>not too strong, but just good enough to show your identity</li>
            <li>It also stays on your clothes, though a bit mild, for about 18-24 hours making it a perfect choice for an everyday cologne.</li>
            <li>My husband was very pleasantly surprised at choosing a scent by description and having it be very accurately described!</li>
            <li>its def something to buy especially for the AMAZING price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such an amazing scent!</li>
            <li>If you have the extra twenty dollars, give it a try, it&#x27;s liked for a reason!</li>
            <li>Price was worth the smell!</li>
            <li>clean... masculine... nice... strong...</li>
            <li>I suppose, the best way to summarize it would be to state that the first note is enticing, the second note works perfectly with my body chemistry and third note is strong/deep as it last throughout the day.</li>
            <li>One word to describe the smell of this: Fresh!</li>
            <li>The original one from the dept store lasts for a 8-10 hrs if not more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe in love at first sight?</li>
            <li>I received a stamped bottle with the sticker on the bottom and it smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>the first time i use it, its ok maybe bcoz the perfume on the pipe</li>
            <li>Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is an original.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li>When I first bought this, the scent lasted more than a day.</li>
            <li>i get this  perfu the smell is so FRESH!</li>
            <li>Lasts long and is a great value&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>As others have stated it smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>I originally purchased it for my son and now my boyfriend.</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I even told me boyfriend he has a 80% of getting laid more often ;)</li>
            <li>The first person to tell me how lovely I smelled was a friend&#x27;s girlfriend.</li>
            <li>You know that guy who walks past you wearing that awesome cologne</li>
            <li>Voyage smells fresh!</li>
            <li>boyfriend is quite pleased and says it&#x27;s \\&quot;exactly what he wanted in a cologne.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>At first not too sure...</li>
            <li>Worth the price !</li>
            <li>So as someone who rarely buys any cologne, I can say this one is definitely worth it for this cheap, and its genuine!</li>
            <li>excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li>Wonderful smell from the past.</li>
            <li>A product that does not appear to be original because the fragrance does not smell and always use that perfume</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick, received in 4 days even on Super Saver shipping!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and just love the way it smells so much!</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The cologne&#x27;s been in a warehouse, barely handled, and never seeing the light-of-day, which for products like these, is a good thing, I think.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li>great smell lasts long</li>
            <li>For the price ($12 if you buy on Amazon), it&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
            <li>You smell fresh!</li>
            <li>Smells fresh!</li>
            <li>, I am glad I took the chance on it with out smelling it first.</li>
            <li>I would be willing to pay more to not have to keep re-upping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most everyone likes that it has a crisp, clean scent..  </li>
            <li>At first, I thought the smell would be very unique</li>
            <li>Smell is amazing and new in retail packaging.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s lasted very long and it smells great.</li>
            <li>It smells clean.  </li>
            <li>i have endured many a epic adventure riding the fumes of this magical scent.</li>
            <li>At last I can buy my favorite cologne and it arrives just in time.tried it and its amazing</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell, not musky and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It is clean and refined.</li>
            <li>Cheap and worthy.</li>
            <li>Really clean, aquatic scent as the name states.</li>
            <li>Clean smell</li>
            <li>Clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li>I buy this eau de toilette on a regular basis and this is by far the best price i ever paid.</li>
            <li>The smell carries and is a clean crispy type.</li>
            <li>This scent is one of my favorites; it&#x27;s clean and inviting, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li>Fresh, light, smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is another clean smells for my boyfriend</li>
            <li>The one star that I gave was only for the nice glass bottle that was able to fool me into buying it.</li>
            <li>and he loves wearing it, but he goes through cologne so quickly and Pi isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite colognes... elegant and masculine</li>
            <li>This cologne smells co clean.  </li>
            <li>It has a soft, light smell, nothing &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; or over-bearing, which is nice for my tastes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean, Almost soapy scent.</li>
            <li>The mild ones were either too mild or too short-lasting, and the strong ones are too overbearing.</li>
            <li>Good product, good price, but overrated aquatic scent that is too common.</li>
            <li>I have bought a few as gifts for friends and family smells really good and everyone liked the Nautica</li>
            <li>He loved the smell and wears a lot for his social events.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never tried this scent it will likely be a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>Nautica Voyage is a very nice Perfume and stays long.</li>
            <li>I like to keep this in the car for a quick fresh clean smelling fragrance!</li>
            <li>Been using Nautica for two years, love it and get a ton of positive feedback on it.</li>
            <li>This has a wonderful fresh smell, lasts long, and is priced so reasonably.</li>
            <li>I use about 3-4 sprays right after the shower, and I can&#x27;t tell if I just get used to the smell or if it wears off after a few hours but best way to tell is if your shirt lingers the scent when you take it off</li>
            <li>I am pleased with fragrance and the bottle has a very nice heavy feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>nothing special here.</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t wear it for special occasions or nights out.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever smelled but between special occasions</li>
            <li>You guys were right!  </li>
            <li>Fragrance goes away right away!</li>
            <li>you are aware of the fabric that you&#x27;re wearing and know for sure that it is safe to spray cologne directly on it, then I would strongly suggest you do that.</li>
            <li>Its so fresh, clean, and smooth.</li>
            <li>It has a light, clean, fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li>I love this perfume - soothing, and strong, very masculine.</li>
            <li>It is a crisp, clean fragrance that is not overpowering, which is important since I work in a \\&quot;Fragrance Free Zone\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Guys if u live Not strong, but nice great cologne this is great not only does it remind me of my home country</li>
            <li>smells good, cheap deal, but does not stay long.</li>
            <li>Sweet and sexy is how I would describe it haha.</li>
            <li>It worked out great just as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li>Great product as expected</li>

            <li>Good lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>Love the price and fast shipping from this vendor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the real deal:)</li>
            <li>Compared to Cool Water by Davidoff, it blows it away.</li>
            <li>Intially its good for couple of hours only.</li>
            <li>smell good when spray later no smell at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- cool bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t get the Cool Water similarity.</li>
            <li>Cool water isn&#x27;t sweet.</li>
            <li>Get this instead of Cool Water.</li>
            <li>Its a cool earthy smell.</li>
            <li>I love the smell:  light and not overpowering, but able to last all day.  </li>
            <li>how u smell sweet so&amp;#34</li>
            <li>such a good price i bought 2</li>
            <li>Dad loved it - solid choice.</li>
            <li>Smells like sweet pickle juice and ripened hachiya persimmon.  </li>
            <li>It smells sweet, with a snap of pickling spice(dill,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m female but loved men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>My legend grows with every spray of this sweet nectar.</li>
            <li>Light, airy, and fresh.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has such an airy, pleasant, fresh, clean, aquatic scent to it.</li>
            <li>Not too sweet or girly.</li>
            <li>only good for a couple of hours</li>
            <li>Though the smell doesn&#x27;t last a lot, it is still good.</li>
            <li>It smells just as good as the last bottle I had from Macys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I stored it in a cool place so</li>
            <li>It has such an airy, pleasant, fresh, clean, aquatic scent to it.</li>
            <li>True story.</li>
            <li>It is a good size bottle and smells terrific.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t blow me out of the water, but it does have a good scent that seems to last awhile.</li>
            <li>(I wouldnt say the whole day that&#x27;s for sure).</li>
            <li>,the smell is so cool with that price, ......................</li>
            <li>/&gt;Certainly reminds me of walking on a cool beach with salt</li>
            <li>Bought mine from Amazon using prime, and while it does smell really good, it doesn&#x27;t last 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a fragrance that will offend anyone but any more than 2-3 sprays is too much.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have had several women comment that I smell good while wearing this product.  </li>
            <li>and I still love it just as much as the day I received it.</li>
            <li>feel the spritzer could be better, it doesn&#x27;t disperse very well.</li>
            <li>recommended to all guys that want a good smell for a low price</li>
            <li>I.&lt;br /&gt;It smells phenomenal very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>I bought this together with Cool Water.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fresh and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>i love it  and fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very inviting smell and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Just to make sure if it really lasted I checked how a shirt smelled a day after I wore it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it is a pretty average cologne, with a nice scent and a good durability.</li>
            <li>then the good smell vanished and a funky smell was next.</li>
            <li>This scent is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li>$20 for 3.4oz can&#x27;t really beat that anywhere for most colognes like this one.</li>
            <li>If you wear it in the morning ( specific pressure points on your body will give you the maximum effect ) and you can smell the light notes of it next morning on the clothes you wore yesterday, thats the mark of an awesome perfume.</li>
            <li>This is a quality fragrance that smells fresh and light.  </li>
            <li>They are somewhat sweet and floral.</li>
            <li>I like - L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey by Issey Miyake, Chrome by Azzaro, Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani, Cool Water by Davidoff, CK One , CK</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells good, but somewhat of a generic smell...</li>
            <li>I wore this for more than a year straight every day.</li>
            <li>Smells good and last for hours&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>By the way, the color of the bottle is cool.</li>
            <li>thank you nautica for making my midnight dreams come true.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t last all day but still lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Good for the daily use.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this same perfume for years and it has always been good.</li>
            <li>What I love so much about this fragrance is its longevity.  </li>
            <li>I find, like most aquatic fragrances it is best appreciated during the late spring/summer seasons.  </li>
            <li>Good fragrance, the price is similar to what you would find in your neighborhood department store / fragrance store (despite the comps posted on the listing).</li>
            <li>A good add to any collection, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>Big bottle, so good value.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good for the entire day.</li>
            <li>I have some fragrances that cost six times as much as Nautica Voyage that have not gotten me nearly as many compliments.  </li>
            <li>Of couse the smell fades a bit by the end of the day, but it has lasted much longer than others I paid more for</li>
            <li>Good staying power with 4-5 sprays, can still smell it the next day.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>it smells really cool.</li>
            <li>The smell is really good, but it merely last like an hour or so.</li>
            <li>so the bottle should last a good while.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but it&#x27;s just too overpowering to my senses.</li>
            <li>Not bad product</li>
            <li>Very large bottle too!</li>
            <li>went fully by reviews and ratings, never smelled or heard of it, love the smell and last all day easily!</li>
            <li>I really love this fragrance, it&#x27;s not too strong or too soft</li>
            <li>But the smell is not so strong as when I first put it on.</li>
            <li>Great clean scent that remains pleasing, calming and crisp after a long day.</li>
            <li>first time use you will get hit by the strong smell.</li>
            <li>The scent does provide a nice fresh clean smell, although the projection is a 0/10...this is a soft skin scent...</li>
            <li>Smell is sweet and mild.</li>
            <li>the smell is still there and almost as strong as it was when I first applied it.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not as strong when you first sprayed it.</li>
            <li>This is a very easy to wear cologne and with the performance to back it up at such a great price.</li>
            <li>But, I went with the star rating of other reviewers, hoping that I had stumbled upon a great find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Amazing great long lasting scent</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good scent, true to the franchise, if you are a Nautica enthusiast, i recommend it!</li>
            <li>I was using Cool Water for many years but this by far beats it!!</li>
            <li>Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>Fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li>If you like fresh and clean fragrances this one is for you.</li>
            <li>Scent is SO FRESH and CLEAN.</li>
            <li>Voyage has a fresh and clean smell.  </li>

            <li>If you need a clean, fresh, breezey cologne to wear all day, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li>love it and for less than $20 i get more compliments than with most $100 brands</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell clean and fresh at all.</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean scent reminds me of breezy spring/ summer sunny days.</li>
            <li>Arrive quickly.</li>
            <li>Not overpowering, super cologne.</li>
            <li>Quick and timely delivery of product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a SUPER price</li>
            <li>I like it and the price was super affordable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the Super Mario of colognes.  </li>
            <li>The fragrance is somewhat mild.</li>
            <li>ademas la entrega es super rapida del mismo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smell ok but like the nautica blue better</li>
            <li>she quickly identified the imposter.</li>
            <li>SHIPPING WAS QUICK..</li>
            <li>I cannot believe I was so lucky to find this on Amazon;</li>
            <li>Quick ship.</li>
            <li>a super smelly guy spray it on your clothes a day before you wear it.</li>
            <li>and I got it really quickly</li>
            <li>I can get like a quick sniff of it</li>
            <li>Quick delivery meets req...</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t understand why it expired so quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this scent but it does not last more than an hour.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a decent smelling spray and for under 20 bucks a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li>and you hope dissipates quickly before you start choking on its intruding head.</li>
            <li>but with how quickly this fades</li>
            <li>however the only thing which i dont really like about this is that the projection/longevity on this thing is not that great at all until</li>
            <li>And maybe a spray on the front of your underwear if you&#x27;re feeling lucky.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it begins to wear off quickly after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;dont</li>
            <li>Anyone who wants a good smelling cologne that is not too strong and also affordable should definitely check this one out.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from fragrancenet because the one with super saver shipping wouldn&#x27;t ship to my address</li>
            <li>Luckily I found this on here.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nothing more to me than a decent knockoff.  </li>
            <li>Its super long-lasting.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and lasts pretty long</li>
            <li>Shipping is really quick as well.</li>
            <li>ordered 1 more for future use..  :)&lt;</li>
            <li>Came quick and and it&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li>I like a cologne that lasts a good long while, even if it&#x27;s a bit strong at first.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s a generous amount and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>and I got my refund quickly.</li>
            <li>It was really quick..</li>
            <li>I get quickly after I made my order.</li>
            <li>and it was delivered really quick</li>
            <li>But it disappears quickly after about 2~3 hours.</li>
            <li>But i was lucky to purchase this one.</li>
            <li>The scent is very masculine, clean, and refreshing- increases after dancing or sweating at the gym.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing, unlike most colognes that are over powering, this is just the right hint and lasts long!</li>
            <li>Clean, crisp and fresh!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and smooth transaction.  </li>
            <li>P. Again a must buy no regrets smells amazing</li>
            <li>last time i had a bottle was 2007 &amp; only buying it now since my all time favorite Gucci Envy is discontiued &amp; cost $300 for 3.4oz lol</li>
            <li>Fresh masculine fragrance that’s light and not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I ordered this on Friday and received it on Monday, very fast!</li>
            <li>A light, masculine scent perfect for everyday.  </li>
            <li>In the future I will probably buy this more as a gift this worth my money :)</li>
            <li>If you are wondering to go with Nautica Blue or Nautica Voyage, Let me tell you, Voyage is by far superior!</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>Smells exactly like a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li>It has a unique masculine scent that will leave your wife wanting you more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a light, clean scented cologne, which is strong, but certainly far from overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and lasts long</li>
            <li>The cool, fresh and manly aroma is not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li>smile sweet</li>
            <li>Has a slightly sweet fresh smell.</li>
            <li>It is a straight-up fresh aquatic fragrance, but it has some cool twists that others do not have.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s crisp, clean and sweet without it being nauseating...</li>
            <li>Great product, my second time buying this particular cologne.</li>
            <li>I read in another review that this was light enough to be worn at a multitude of occasions, Which is nice because what you wear on a Saturday night isn&#x27;t always right for work as well and some dudes struggle with that.</li>
            <li>Not so grate for special occasions but overall a nice cologne .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very fresh and clean smelling, and is really genderless.</li>
            <li>My new favorite...</li>
            <li>My new Favorite.</li>
            <li>This is his new favorite scent..</li>
            <li>The new one I just bought sprays better.</li>
            <li>It has in fact become my husband&#x27;s new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>My new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li>The price I paid online for the Nautica Voyage is half of that Kohl&#x27;s, this a great deal</li>
            <li>Lol my wife want let me ware it less</li>
            <li>got it for less than 15 and what can i say always a great deal here</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good, I put one spray on my wrist and it does last for awhile.</li>
            <li>Long lasting smell, and in my opinion, one of the best scents on the market!</li>
            <li>Just a nice fresh clean simple scent.</li>
            <li>Recommended for those who are not too much for the strong macho scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since the cologne is quite strong when first sprayed on, you can&#x27;t really spray that much or it would be overwhelming.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very relaxing and easy on the nose.</li>
            <li>Clean, fresh, masculine, and not to overwhelming</li>
            <li>Long lasting scent and an excellent price!</li>
            <li>Perfect to brighten-up your spirits and lasts long enough.</li>
            <li>Lasts along time and has a mild fresh smell to it.</li>
            <li>it really doesnt its just that its not so strong.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell, it actually last long for a cheaper cologne, I like to mix colognes to amplify the smells, but this one alone is very good,</li>
            <li>Watching the huge number of positive reviews, I ordered this perfume.</li>
            <li>Love it, long lasting and smells great.</li>
            <li>only thing I would add is that buyers should be aware that cologne is made of chemicals and can change it&#x27;s scent when exposed to warm temperatures and light.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s the real thing!!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product to say the least!</li>
            <li>Some of the much more expensive colognes such as ralph polo and especially my favorite Acqua di gio are slightly better but for this price its easily worth the purchase!</li>
            <li>It is delivered on the promise delivery date and just in time for my last spray on the one on hand, I always grab two bottles of this for it is much more convenient and cheaper!</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY FAST shipping!!</li>
            <li>Lasts for 2 hours then kinda fades but it&#x27;s still there for the whole day!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon!!</li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle, and have two more stocked up!</li>
            <li>I bet even Obama can attract lots of hot girls with this!</li>
            <li>In this case(fake), only from the top or bottom (for easy repackage of return items or demos).</li>
            <li>fragrance like this should go easily for more in in the mid $40&#x27;s range.</li>
            <li>It is a crisp, clean, linen smell but just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t believe other comments, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice long lasting scent, and many take notice of this product.</li>
            <li>The one that I loved had a single piece plastic cap, and the smell was VERY nice and lasted (strongly) all day, and several days following until the shirt was washed.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is very popular, Amazaon had it at half the price of retail stores.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and crisp almost like cucumbers and ocean waves!</li>
            <li>will purchase again but with the size of the bottle and how little I need to smell great</li>
            <li>This cologne is cheap, smells amazing and lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li>I usually have high dollar smells, but this one is awesome for the price.  </li>
            <li>I was an avid wearer in my high school years and have been through many fragrances.  </li>
            <li>Smells great a little bit after its used, but definitely lasts the whole day and is a good scent for the money.</li>
            <li>However this is a few steps up from Cool Water and is a much longer lasting fresh clean scent that any guy would appreciate as it goes all day and does attract the compliments that you get from time to time wearing a good cologne and with Amazon you can always guarantee timely delivery and good prices.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why this is so cheap on here, but it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>But with the amazing longevity, it can even last in the winter.</li>
            <li>It also comes in a heavy duty , attractive glass bottle.</li>
            <li>Not one of those cheap knockoffs, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Great value and with everyday use this bottle lasts me about a year.</li>
            <li>With such a economical price, the fragrance is truly amazing.</li>
            <li>They do not smell the same, but they both smell amazing.</li>
            <li>Still price was low to my surprise as it was about 50% off almost which is amazing.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing with just one simple spray.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday perfume, especially during the summer, but it&#x27;s amazing all around.</li>
            <li>Feels fresh.</li>
            <li>Drives the ladies wild :-)</li>
            <li>and of course FRESH.</li>
            <li>Good aquatic fragrance, not very expensive...can be worn day &amp; night  all through spring and summer.</li>
            <li>Its fresh and lavenderish.</li>
            <li>My favorite by far.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells fresh.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth the price in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>definitely worth the buy for any guy</li>
            <li>This one is different but a nice change.</li>
            <li>I had to spray it 3 or four times to get any distinct scent.</li>
            <li>Worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Naturally, the hotter it gets the more beastly it&#x27;ll be.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This scent is not overpowering and has a nice &amp;#34;day later scent&amp;#34; too.</li>
            <li>If you like a citrusy cologne, light ,  not heavy, and lasts and smells good the next day on your body or clothes----but never tried it yet, trust me!</li>
            <li>This is a very item to purchase if you come to a party, going on a date, or traveling the smell is good and lasted until the next day.</li>
            <li>So if you want to smell fresh but not</li>
            <li>fresh scent, one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>money is worth.</li>
            <li>inexpensive but smells fresh and beachy</li>
            <li>I figured it was worth a shot and ordered 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li>Voyage gives you a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>Nice bottle, blue colored liquid, but no fragrance.</li>
            <li>Like it!&lt;br /&gt;Its fragrance is ok.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts longer and worth the amount paid for it.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and woody.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t smell it after 15 minutes but people still seem to notice it hours later.</li>
            <li>worth the price you pay.</li>
            <li>Sophisticated manly classy smell.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
            <li>Fresh.  </li>
            <li>Was not really crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne so far.</li>
            <li>and I got to say it was worth the 16 buck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>overall a nice cologne.</li>
            <li>It is a cool crisp summer scent</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the fragrance on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This is my most complimented cologne by far.</li>
            <li>I was very dissapointed with this item its smelled good for about 5 second</li>
            <li>It has a fresh summery scent.</li>
            <li>It stinks real good!  :-)  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>but I think for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Absolutely masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li>reviews that mostly ships directly from Amazon be a knockoff.  </li>
            <li>The cologne smells extremely fresh and aquatic and lasted all the way through the day without issue.  </li>
            <li>I was actually able to smell it clearly on my shirt at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li>It unfortunately is worth</li>
            <li>I was looking for something citrusy and fresh but this just turned out to be overpowering.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that it smells nice, and lasts for several hours after it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
            <li>I believe but the kind in the stores last a lot longer</li>
            <li>It is a mellow fresh scent.</li>
            <li>so you have to be careful with the amount you use per spray if you want to use more than a spray or two as it is potent.</li>
            <li>I prefer much cheaper GAP perfume since it is much better and lasts much longer than this one.</li>
            <li>; fragrance, Nautica Voyage is easily worth the 20 dollars</li>
            <li>Nice fragrance, stays on for an entire day without problem!</li>
            <li>, it just has that just hoped out of the shower fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a blind-buy.</li>
            <li>Fresh shower smell.</li>
            <li>but I where it to work at FedEx to keep me smelling fresh</li>
            <li>Turns out that I personally dislike it; and all the favorable reviews at Amazon won&#x27;t change what my own sense of smell tells me.  </li>
            <li>The scent is light but noticable, pretty crisp and pleasent.</li>
            <li>So its rare I find one I can tolerate on me.</li>
            <li>Worth the 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>Light, crisp scent may ware off a little too quickly but otherwise it smells good</li>
            <li>Its very fresh and very comforting to women.</li>
            <li>It goes on great and dry down is amazing.</li>
            <li>After months of use, and many positive comments i believe its real, and not fake.</li>
            <li>Is it smooth but not weak.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to a friend, it&#x27;s a very cool fragrance suitable for office and for any other time.</li>
            <li>i was convince right the way that this perfume got something really powerful you can&#x27;t even suspect!!!!guys tha one is for you</li>
            <li>I thought at the price it was worth the risk right?</li>
            <li>A very nice heavy weight bottle too.</li>
            <li>Very clean and soft smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>After buying the first which I had planned on keeping at work, I loved it so much I immediately purchased a second for home.</li>
            <li>i will buy it again before the other bottle finishes smells that good</li>
            <li>This scent is long lasting and smells very good.</li>
            <li>This one - Nautica Voyage, however was one perfume that I felt was just right.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s priced right.  </li>
            <li>Boy was I right.  </li>
            <li>Works well for a right out of the shower scent, gym or activity scent.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m stuck with it which I don&#x27;t believe is right because the product is DEFECTIVE.</li>
            <li>I just did to you right now :</li>
            <li>it right here on amazon.com</li>
            <li>So, I did my research and stumbled upon Nautica Voyager right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Well I can say they were right</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>It is just the right size.</li>
            <li>It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li>I ended up selling it right when I got it because it is nothing like Island Voyage</li>
            <li>Get alot of positive comments on this one!</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent, and decent projection.</li>
            <li>but it does have a clean smell that my wife really likes.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t exactly have the most masculine smell to it but</li>
            <li>It really smells like a Clean shower in a bottle.</li>
            <li>In a nutshell &amp;#34;Nautica Voyage&amp;#34; is a decent scent for going to work, church, or on a  cheap date.  </li>
            <li>I think the scent is good, and it&#x27;s the real deal, a quality product, though the scent does not stick around on me for too long.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very nice (not strong and over bearing).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong scents...</li>
            <li>It is somewhat strong (I have a very sensitive sense of smell)</li>
            <li>not very special as I thought would it be, but, for the money you pay is good perfurm.</li>
            <li>I am ordering one more possibly two simply due to the price and the successful delivery of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>The scent lasts for a very long time and it makes him smell extremely sexy!</li>
            <li>glad I did as it&#x27;s the same cool, crisp, fresh fragrance that can work anywhere, anytime.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant smell that&#x27;s strong enough to be smelled from a few feet away, but not so strong that it kicks you in the nose and demands, \\&quot;SMELL ME!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This cologne is very inexpensive making a good choice for any one that enjoys a refreshing smell that is not to overbearing as some of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>This smell is pure bliss mixed with sexual delights!</li>
            <li>Really fresh, young, cool and clean.</li>
            <li>but, this is surprisingly a great clean and long lasting smell.</li>
            <li>It smells like nothing special, and it&#x27;s honestly very overpowering.</li>
            <li>Brilliant Smell, but does not last very long</li>
            <li>For less than $20, this is possibly the best cologne you can get at the price.</li>
            <li>Although, it won&#x27;t replace Lucky as my favorite daily cologne</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, crisp scent that stands out and does not wear off.</li>
            <li>Great smell but has a tendency to go overboard.</li>
            <li>Great smell for the small price.</li>
            <li>This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s even more amazing is the longevity, it last for the entire day 12-24 hours</li>
            <li>A goody for cheap its a fresh scent ocean smell with fresh summer notes for any age  not heavy at all</li>
            <li>have used 10 different brands in last 5 years and this is the one I liked the most.</li>
            <li>I would&#x27;t buy this if you are a true fan of the real cologne.</li>
            <li>Smells like a fresh ocean breeze coming over a field of very manly flowers!</li>
            <li>Whether this is your first cologne or you have been wearing it for years this is definitely worth a shot and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>if completely fulfilled my expectations, and I go back to place another order for future purchases with these excellent merchandise</li>
            <li>is really good , but i think this is fake , the smell stay for 1 hour top!</li>
            <li>I recommend this perfume has good aroma, the smell remains until the next day , shipping was fast grateful thanks for everything</li>
            <li>Very light fresh  smell but not not close to Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li>When I first sprayed it on, I got the strong chemical scent, which is normal at first.</li>
            <li>My husband really wanted this cologne and the POLO Red, and they were both pretty pricey!!!!  </li>
            <li>For me, it has been hard to find something that is mild, pleasant, long-lasting and yet economical.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product, but I have gotten better compliments using other brands.</li>
            <li>Nice Packaging, I unboxed and then put a little on my hands, smell fresh and clean not too strong but sober instead</li>
            <li>great cologne, especially considering it&#x27;s low price.</li>
            <li>I do admit that the third day of wearing it I got the mysterious cat urine smell that some people on basenotes talked about (LOL).</li>
            <li>SMELLS GOOD... JUST NOT VERY STRONG</li>
            <li>Its a refreshing floral fruit sent, a great casual blend for summer or spring days.</li>
            <li>To sum up everyone elses comments: great lasting scent for a low price.</li>
            <li>This is 100% real, smells amazing, and I sprayed a very tiny bit on my arm just to test it out 5 hours ago..</li>
            <li>if some like not very strong perfume good for them.</li>
            <li>Product as well as the service were both great and will definitely look forward to being a future customer.</li>
            <li>Good for less than $15.</li>
            <li>This perfurm has a wonderful smell, I use it everyday and everyone like it, especially me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clean and fresh and very masculine.  </li>
            <li>Simply the best in fragrance neither strong nor too weak.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, Voyage has lasting power no less excellent than the more expensive ones, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>does not long even more than an Hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has a mixed scent of smelling really good, with a tiny hint of it smelling sweet, but not over powering.</li>
            <li>It has a clean smell, with strong notes of green apple, and reminds me of something similar to clean laundry on a warm spring day.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing fastener (since it&#x27;s a true EDT) and you will smell like this (albeit with less potency) throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re on a tight budget in the fragrance department, but you still want to smell good, this is it.</li>
            <li>Maybe this is my fault for buying it when it was on sale but the smell faded away very fast.</li>
            <li>It is also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>I got very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much</li>
            <li>Price is very reasonable too.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of it very much.</li>
            <li>I like this cologne very much.</li>
            <li>It is that good - not overpowering, but fresh and clean - subtle.</li>
            <li>S/H charges were reasonable and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li>I had never smelled the scent before and was a little scared but bought it anyways because of all the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li>but it turns out to be good but not unique at all.  </li>
            <li>a nice low key fresh smell my new favorite.</li>
            <li>The bottle came in its original package and was brand new.  </li>
            <li>Fresh, clean and still masculine.</li>
            <li>is moderate , neither too mild, nor too strong..</li>
            <li>Far better than the classic.</li>
            <li>a snap.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is calm, not too strong and not too mild, not professional but</li>
            <li>16 year old sophomore and ALL THE LADIES LOVE IT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>With so many high reviews that this product got, I completely ignored the handful of them that warned of theories that it may be a tampered with product.  </li>
            <li>While its first tone elicits the most compliments, its later tones towards the end of the day gets girls that hug me to linger just a little bit longer and say how good i smell.</li>
            <li>Nice clean smell that is a decent value, would compare the smell to other clean/water/shower/fresh scent sprays.</li>
            <li>However, this fragrance does not smell cheap in any regard and holds an integrity that is very clean and sharp.</li>
            <li>My first reaction upon smelling this the first time was...</li>
            <li>Also, make sure you get the 3.4 once because it is actually cheaper then the 1.7!</li>
            <li>At first, I was putting it on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for about 4 years now and still get compliments consistently from people all of the time.</li>
            <li>Scent on this perfume is pretty...</li>
            <li>My first day wearing the Nautica Voyage I received compliments.  </li>
            <li>at first I didn&#x27;t like the scent</li>
            <li>Girls get in close and want to smell it  ;)  </li>
            <li>One to three sprays of this scent, and you&#x27;ll be able to smell it the next day.</li>
            <li>I have this in my car for emergencies ;-)</li>
            <li>It does not last for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>, the notes and actual smell of the fragrance is stunning.</li>
            <li>Smells fresh,mild to strong,cool,and crisp.</li>
            <li>i actually have 3 bottles of this cologne among others but definetly my favorite.</li>
            <li>at first I would catch myself getting a whiff of it when Im doing something else and going</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed having elegant and manly perfume, but I usually dislike the big punch associated with most of them.</li>
            <li>Better than Nautica Blue</li>
            <li>and I really like that stuff too!</li>
            <li>It smells terrific w/o being overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells great....or at least it did smell great.  </li>
            <li>When I first got it, I used it every day.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not much of a cologne wearer to be honest.  </li>
            <li>i have received today Nautica Voyage , after my first use i ordered another nautica voyage .</li>
            <li>As described, thanks!</li>
            <li>And the best part is finding it for such a small price</li>
            <li>I much prefer Curve Wave by Liz Claiborne for a fresh spring/summer scent.  </li>
            <li>Makes my mouth water when I smell it ; )</li>
            <li>The first day I wore it, this hot girl at work started talking to me</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say try it out first if you&#x27;re into those kinds of aquatic scents.</li>
            <li>When it first came out, it was 50 dollars at the men&#x27;s cologne counter in department store.</li>
            <li>crisp and succulent, boy i loves me some nautica</li>
            <li>First I would like to say that I swear by this fragrance.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not fake</li>
            <li>I was concerned that this was going to be only ok since it wasn&#x27;t an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; cologne.</li>
            <li>I love this smell being a male, I wish I could bathe in it</li>
            <li>I recommend you buy from amazon only because, I received the Authentic one from them.</li>
            <li>Give your woman one of your shirts to wear, it&#x27;s guaranteed to smell like Voyage weeks later, regardless of how many times you wash it.</li>
            <li>But it misses the most essential quality of a men&#x27;s perfume: duration of fragrance.</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t give a second try.</li>
            <li>I was reading the reviews before buying and say many people that got fakes, so i became worried before buying but decided to get it anyways thinking the chances were low.</li>
            <li>The scent last all day with many complements.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>Seems everyone loves this stuff ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first cologne i&#x27;ve ever bought after searching online for an inexpensive fragrance for men.</li>
            <li>so thats why i would put this on my top ten</li>
            <li>Funny, isn&#x27;t it....</li>
            <li>When women in your vicinity randomly say some one smells delicious</li>
            <li>First time buying online</li>
            <li>My wife, who is much younger than I, love it.</li>
            <li>Great scent long lasting.</li>
            <li>I love this product, as this is my second time ordering this product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have always been an avid cologne consumer.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t the first time i&#x27;ve ordered and used it.</li>
            <li>lecture.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal if you want to wear a cologne that makes it seem like you&#x27;re not even wearing a cologne !</li>
            <li>After the first spray I realized--this smells like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li>On my understand  this type of fragance is for a hot weather &amp;#34;hot days&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have received many compliments and definitely recommend this scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was the first time I have purchased this cologne</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day too, my girlfriend loves it ;)</li>
            <li>This was my first gift for my fiance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really noticed that girls get closer to me, just so that they can smell me!</li>
            <li>ALMOST PURCHASED IN STORE FOR MUCH HIGHER PRICE.</li>
            <li>very affordable!</li>
            <li>If you havent smelled it, it smells exactly like Curve.</li>
            <li>It does not last for more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Though it last through out the day but please do not smell like this, your anti-perspirant and deodorant should smell classier and better.</li>
            <li>Got compliments from people not really associated with these kind of responses.  </li>
            <li>First time purchased from amazon.  </li>
            <li>The bottle size is 3.4 Oz which I believe last for more than a year.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>first i got mine from deals breaker 100% legit so no problem there.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The first time i have the Nautica pefumer.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried this - I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Long lasting and great smelling, that&#x27;s all you can ask for.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to take the chance, then go ahead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>smells great and the smell is also long lasting, girls will give you compliments ,and guys will be asking you what product you use</li>
            <li>I have always enjoyed having elegant and manly perfume, but I usually dislike the big punch associated with most of them.</li>
            <li>Smells ok but does not last</li>
            <li>and nautica blue is better in my opinion</li>
            <li>is certainly better than Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li>It feels a lot more \\&quot;real\\&quot; than blue did.</li>
            <li>but it is a worthwhile upgrade to Nautica blue.</li>
            <li>I first smelled it on a co-worker at work and after about a month of smelling it as he walked by, I had to ask him what it was.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>I tested several fragrances at Herberger&#x27;s one day, this was the one I fell in love with, won&#x27;t buy anything</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly.</li>
            <li>The first night I tried this cologne</li>
            <li>Some compliments were when I had first spray it</li>
            <li>Was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li>this is the exact product that comes out of a store.</li>
            <li>Just got shipment price was great was not sure if it was not the real nautica</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>Well not only was I pleased with the aroma but also the staying power of the cologne.</li>
            <li>Women were commenting on it the first night I wore it</li>
            <li>You will be moving around hours later and still catch scents of voyage clinging to you and working its magic.</li>
            <li>only gripe is that there is a sour/green apple smell thrown in, making it sometimes smell more fruity than &amp;#34;clean/fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>and you are ready to go!  </li>
            <li>, I really liked the lotion, what I expected.</li>
            <li>This has been one of my favorite colognes for a long time I get constant compliments on how great I smell daily!!!</li>
            <li>The package also came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>It is the real deal!</li>
            <li>Not fake.</li>
            <li>It looks exactly like what came in the mail.</li>
            <li>Exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t be certain that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Nautica or not, but the price is right.</li>
            <li>The panties just fall off the women when i wear this cologne ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this cologne is the duration.</li>
            <li>I really like the smell, not over powering and feels fresh.</li>
            <li>so Amazon&#x27;s deal is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>I remember when I first started wearing it, I always got compliments.</li>
            <li>I constantly get commented from the ladies, saying they love the way I smell.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it smells generic like most</li>
            <li>Everyone that has smelled it has told me its smells really good, and a few of my friends have asked where I got it.</li>
            <li>Lasts a good bit of time and even works under heavy loads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say that for this price, it&#x27;s a damned good everyday cologne.</li>
            <li>Also, when I spray it on my body it takes a few hours to start smelling good.  </li>
            <li>Gives me the confidence that comes from knowing that you are smelling good all day through that comes with a few sprays of Nautica Voyage in the morning or evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cologne is a perfect casual summer cologne.</li>
            <li>but I think that it is best suited for office wear or casual day wear.</li>
            <li>I just got a fake one, to good to be true!!</li>
            <li>It has a very nice smell, particularly, I use it for everyday.</li>
            <li>I was hoping it to be a little more strong charactered.</li>
            <li>This cologne has a unique long lasting odour and is very good for daily use.</li>
            <li>Its a nice masculine scent not too harsh n very mild with scent ov fresh waters.</li>
            <li>High quality cologne at a super price, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li>This smells really good and is quite a bit less than you can find it  in the stores!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long though is great for college students.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t regret my purchase at all...describing scents is nearly impossible for me, but I will say that this is light and would be best used in summer.  </li>
            <li>Very nice scent on this one and long lasting.</li>
            <li>The scent is very nice and long lasting.</li>
            <li>but it definitely has a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; scent that I&#x27;m almost positive anyone would love.</li>
            <li>Definitely a young, fresh, clean scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering but is very long-lasting.</li>
            <li>The price was discounted, so I can&#x27;t say I would buy it at full price, though, and I&#x27;m sure to move on to other fragrances/brands until I find a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li>The scent is mildly strong and you just can&#x27;t bare, but to smell this fragrance over and over again.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s a fake, but it still smells pretty good</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok not so strong and no long lasting.</li>
            <li>Sharp note just kind of stings the nose.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the cologne smelled nice.</li>
            <li>This one from amazon is noticeably lighter smell to it, and though it pretty much smells the same in terms of the scent, to me the bottle from amazon has a slightly more alcohol smell to it.</li>
            <li>It has a warm smell- not too sharp but still pronounced.</li>
            <li>Love the scent and by far one of my new favorites but it sure doesn&#x27;t long as everyone promotes in here.</li>
            <li>Cologne has nice clean smell to it but would not recommend purchase as it is a VERY heavy cologne.</li>
            <li>am very thankful to have found FragranceNet now that is a great company, not only did they send me a new item they sent a lot of free stuff like samples of other fragrances and a pocket mirror.</li>
            <li>Overall, its a very sweet scent, and very masculine for a sweet scent too.</li>
            <li>, too bad was a great value for a nice scent.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;d like a summer scent that reminds you of sailing on bright blue waters then definitely give Nautica a try...</li>
            <li>I spray it in the toilet after I take a dump, because it smells slightly better than feces.  </li>
            <li>As the middle class keep the economic momentum with that zeal, which is quality and progressive economic goals, nautica voyage plays it part by alienating the young self confident with the old and more experienced.</li>
            <li>like it, not aggressive, soft and nice for daily use</li>
            <li>Bought this cause a relative gave me one as a present and loved it, so I bought another</li>
            <li>Both smell good, but there&#x27;s an obvious inconsistency in final product.</li>
            <li>This one definitely hits the mark of \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; but it can also be worn with an elegant suit and not throw it off too much.</li>
            <li>I expected it to be more powerful</li>
            <li>Smells good but only last 1 hour.</li>
            <li>the smell is perfect, fresh unlike other Eau De Toilette that gives headache not only to me but to others as well and furthermore not many eau de toilets that I can wear when I just want to smell great without advertising to others in a very loud, noticeable or not needed way especially when working out in sports clubs.</li>
            <li>Good for everyday use, does not last for long, but for the money you put in, definitively a good purchase.</li>
            <li>This has definitely been satisfying and smooth, and I instantly got a compliment at how I smelled the first time I used this perfume when hanging out with a friend (girl).</li>
            <li>not as long lasting as stated but good a good everyday scent.</li>
            <li>This has definitely been satisfying and smooth, and I instantly got a compliment at how I smelled the first time I used this perfume when hanging out with a friend (girl).</li>
            <li>From there, I can&#x27;t really review any further because you don&#x27;t now me and what you think smells good is pretty much a personal preference issue.</li>
            <li>this is a very light clean everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li>and I can still smell it - not as strong as when he first puts it on, but it&#x27;s definitely there.</li>
            <li>I went to buy it because of its positive review</li>
            <li>If you havent figured that one out as yet, all the positive reviews should tell you so.</li>
            <li>I was using Polo Sport for a long time, if you love Polo sport, you will like this.</li>
            <li>I use about 3-4 sprays in the morning but by midday, it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li>First of all, very well packaged.</li>
            <li>but I really need to smell it first before I buy.</li>
            <li>and I was not expecting it to be as great as it is based on the price, but decided to test due to the low cost.  </li>
            <li>Definately the real deal not a fake.</li>
            <li>The item arrived in a few days and I was very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>It lasts a long time on me (most of the day).</li>
            <li>the smell lasts for a long time and it makes me wanna jump on top of my husband .</li>
            <li>This is the real deal not a fake.</li>
            <li>the good ones usually cost a lot.</li>
            <li>By the way, I&#x27;m 22 years old, just in case you&#x27;re wondering if this is old man cologne, it most definitely isn&#x27;t haha.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a huge cologne aficionado but this is the most accessible and best-smelling</li>
            <li>The pump action on the spray bottle has stopped working.now I am stuck with a full bottle of cologne and no way to use it.</li>
            <li>Very nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li>Last all day and smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Is a great perfume, not so strong and no so weak, sweet and fruitsy, it last on my skin about 4 hours more or less.</li>
            <li>Wanted to write this review because this definitely has too many high reviews for the smell.</li>
            <li>Delivered it on time to my friend in US, yesterday I got if and the smell is very unique out of this world, it does not stay that long</li>
            <li>but most comments were when it was later in the night when most other colognes had worn off.</li>
            <li>Price for a very decent product.</li>
            <li>Light, crisp and last all day.</li>
            <li>Easy to open box.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>And while that still is my favorite cologne, my bottle ran dry about a week ago.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know those hot girls that give out free samples of Red Bulls??</li>
            <li>A perfume does not have to be always strong enough to leave an impression.</li>
            <li>Despite all the marketing, cool water is actually more &#x27;green&#x27; than aquatic to me.</li>
            <li>it smells good last long</li>
            <li>Smells good but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li>The product is legit , smell good and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as a signature scent but more of an everyday use for work, gym, etc which lasts like the full day.</li>
            <li>It smells so good and last long too.</li>
            <li>I put on 3 sprays and it lasted for hours smelling the same and just as strong.</li>
            <li>Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>but it isnt strong enough.</li>
            <li>Nautica Blue is very good too, but the scent isn&#x27;t long lasting.</li>
            <li>but once again I was proven wrong worth every penny and the fragrance easily competes with top shelf cologne!</li>
            <li>You need to apply this perfume in large quantities for it to stay on.</li>
            <li>or so that you&#x27;d spend to buy a large bottle.</li>
            <li>I will certainly be buying this or another cologne from the seller.</li>
            <li>I will be surprise, I went on and get this cologne just by pure reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try this perfume, I really hope it&#x27;s just the way described in the positive comments I have heard from the&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this cologne if you want to smell amazing and receive endless compliments/</li>
            <li>Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>Sometimes he actually claims to get more miles per gallon because his stress levels go down from the smell and help him cruise through the air better.</li>
            <li>Well you will when you get this cologne and spray it on for the first time and many other times to come</li>
            <li>It is a Pretty nice perfume with nice fragrance, I used it everyday and smell does last for entire day.</li>
            <li>This was my favorite when it first came on the market almost 10 years ago, but haven&#x27;t used it in quite some time while cycling through other scents.</li>
            <li>I receive many compliments about this fragrance on a daily basis… it drives the women wild!</li>
            <li>but I guess with the price like that my expectation should not be very high.</li>
            <li>I really hope amazon doesn&#x27;t stop carrying this clogne anytime soon because I definitely will be back to order more!</li>
            <li>The real cologne is very good - this stuff they sell on Amazon is fake.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s not too strong like other brands and the smell is simple.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and having bought this cologne several times from multiple places, you can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it to any cologne connisuer!</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>

            <li>Seems to smell real</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up really liking the smell.  </li>
            <li>Thanks from Vzla</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance&lt;</li>
            <li>I was drawn to Nautica Voyage, but the salesperson said it was cheap and wouldn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li>According to others, the scent is long-lasting, but not too intense.  </li>
            <li>its very sexxyyy</li>
            <li>Thanks....</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Very ligt effect.</li>
            <li>It shipped really fast too, thanks.</li>
            <li>so this makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>and he really likes it too.  </li>
            <li>And with the price, you really can&#x27;t get any</li>
            <li>It is not of a quality to be really called an eau de toilette or</li>
            <li>Thanks so much 😁</li>
            <li>Defiantly more than what I expected..</li>
            <li>Gave as gift which was appreciated.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I would absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li>it really</li>
            <li>i got mine from SavingsClub and it appears to be real.</li>
            <li>Got it fast w/ Prime...</li>
            <li>got complimented more than i expected</li>
            <li>A genuine Nautica will have a Nautica sticker on it (it will say &#x27;Nautica Voyage&#x27; in big letters).  </li>
            <li>This is a really inexpensive cologne I was not expecting it to smell</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The bottle looks like its real</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I am very choosy when it comes to scents/aromas that I wear.  </li>
            <li>The stuff doesn&#x27;t like the real stuff.  </li>
            <li>Seller sent items really fast.</li>
            <li>The price was extremely reasonable, so I was worried.</li>
            <li>really don&#x27;t know how to review a cologne.</li>
            <li>Cologne is one if those things you really just have to try.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cost much here on amazon</li>
            <li>Men get ready to set sail, with the freshest smelling invigorating cologne by Nautica.</li>
            <li>was more than I expected.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The one that I got said &amp;#34;Coty&amp;#34; on it, plus when I opened the package it smelled very moldy, I even washed the bottle with soap to get rid of it(probably had moisture in the box before it was wrapped at the factory).  </li>
            <li>Reliable, fast, quality products...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Women drools on me(kidding) but really, they keep asking me about my cologne</li>
            <li>Real men stuff</li>
            <li>Sarcasm aside I really like the cologne.</li>
            <li>you could spray a bunch on you if you really wanted to</li>
            <li>thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li>but it dies away too fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping every time.</li>
            <li>When I purchase it at a store it lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li>And I imagine as much as you want, because no one I encountered found it overpowering, no matter if pumped on one spray, or six.</li>
            <li>I did and I got the real one.</li>
            <li>Just buy it from amazon for the real deal</li>
            <li>I got another from Macy&#x27;s it lasts a whole day.</li>
            <li>Where you spray it (side of neck, chest, on clothes, on skin), how much you put on (one spray or 3), when you put it on (after a shower in the morning, after working out, before going out at night).</li>
            <li>real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really I did.</li>
            <li>THANKS.</li>
            <li>Very affordable from seller.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Really like the smell.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I didn&#x27;t really care how this would smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good cologne is worth spending a few extra bucks on(in my opinion).</li>
            <li>I really like the scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>My spouse really appreciated this gift.</li>
            <li>100% REAL.</li>
            <li>I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li>i bought my first bottle at Ross and it has smelled amazing and has lasted long enough.</li>
            <li>And I imagine as much as you want, because no one I encountered found it overpowering, no matter if pumped on one spray, or six.  </li>
            <li>the price, this really a beast.</li>
            <li>Very calming and not too overpowerful.</li>
            <li>so you walk the rest of your life smelling like fast food and</li>
            <li>I suggest this highly!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a cologne that doesn&#x27;t fade fast</li>
            <li>I really like it :x</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive but one of my preferred</li>
            <li>Fast shipment too.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Light enough for summer and work.  </li>
            <li>It is really a shame</li>
            <li>Nautica is a pleasant and refreshing after shave that has a very subtle fragrance that  is quietly noticeable.</li>
            <li>Really smells good&lt;</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and bottle was packaged well.</li>
            <li>It is a gentle scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I was really nervous while buying this perfume online</li>
            <li>Ships really fast.</li>
            <li>Shipped Fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This can&#x27;t be the real one.</li>
            <li>Yeah one of them went out of her way to tell me that I smell really</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about cologne, but I like this product.  </li>
            <li>Masculine, fresh out of the shower smell, durable.</li>
            <li>hours later(at very close</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>2 SPRAYS LASTS ME MY WHOLE SCHOOLDAY.</li>
            <li>very simple,light,ordinary and does not serve the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li>Lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li>I will buy again thanks</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Nothing groundbreaking, but a very well done summertime scent.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>so I wont complain to much about it.</li>
            <li>Got it much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the real deal...</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon Support for this Nautica delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very versatile and long-lasting.</li>
            <li>#34;you smell very manly, I like it.&amp;#34; 1 Spray lasted 24 hours, and that compliment I received was in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>Cologne is really subjective</li>
            <li>3.4 oz of this cologne for $20 is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li>Although, the price is really competetive</li>
            <li>really to put in my every day collection, and trust me when I got it</li>
            <li>Seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li>Too much</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not offensive, unless you really overdo it.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a gift for a friend of mine and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a very fragrant cologne.</li>
            <li>I have some people saying the smell stays for whole day.</li>
            <li>The prices is reasonable to expect from this product.</li>
            <li>Frangrances are a matter of preference and I did not care much for this fragrance.</li>
            <li>The price was exceptionally reasonable.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>bottle itself looks very well made and looks classy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fake,cheap imposter, not the real deal,Not even close....</li>
            <li>Anyone that has had the real thing will smell the difference.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it at this price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It looks genuine to</li>
            <li>We both really like the smell.</li>
            <li>I am thinking it is an imposter as I have used Nautica in the past and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten several complements wearing this scent, and I must say I do enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Despite the price, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all unlike stuff like Axe and such.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>It has a gentle scent, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>As others have written, this seems to be very comparable to $70 brands.  </li>
            <li>thats with not having put much on too</li>
            <li>Very synthetic.</li>
            <li>much else to say</li>
            <li>Wanted try something different and cheap.</li>
            <li>The real thing&amp;faat delivery</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>unless if it is the real stuff, then this perfume is s</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li>What can I say, scents are very subjective and this one just isn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li>smells better than I expected..</li>
            <li>Not the real deal.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really change much.</li>
            <li>If anything, it just got really soapy.</li>
            <li>It came really fast with my membership.</li>
            <li>She says it&#x27;s very distinctive from the others I have.  </li>
            <li>Goes for whole day.</li>
            <li>I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future.</li>
            <li>Very Good.......Excellent</li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY cologne I liked out of an entire cologne outlet I went through.</li>
            <li>I have smelled and tested hundreds of colognes, and Voyage is near the top for a lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li>Somewhat akin to Cool Water, but better, and oh so long lasting.</li>
            <li>The bottle itself is nice and heavy and the stuff inside</li>
            <li>Scent is nice but only seems to last an hour or so, then I can&#x27;t detect it any longer.</li>
            <li>its just a pleasant smell that&#x27;s really subtle and welcoming.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the exact smell, but it is kind of a sweeter, manly smell.</li>
            <li>Nice everyday Cologne</li>
            <li>and you only need a tiny bit for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>The smell is soft, light which makes it soft to smell to the nostrils.</li>
            <li>It smelled nice and while I noticed the scent only lasted an hour or two, I got a 3.4 ounce bottle when I only paid for a 1.7 ounce bottle</li>
            <li>&quot; seeing that it&#x27;s only around $20 dollars, gladly, I was surprised.</li>
            <li>Smooth,fresh, Nice for everyday</li>
            <li>To be honest, I had never heard of the product until just recently and when my wife and I visited the local mall to get a sniff test, there were no salespeople at the mens cologne section for me to test before ordering.  </li>
            <li>Practically this cologne is likely to help you with your vehicles mileage of you own a dragon or giant bald eagle(depending on country).</li>
            <li>I own: Curve,Chrome, Acqua Di Gio, Jean Paul Gaultier, Issey Mikaye and Dolce and Gabbana to name a few.</li>
            <li>Take into account that where I live it tends to be around warm and somewhat hot all year round, so take that into consideration for the performance I got out of</li>
            <li>Although it lasts a fair amount of hours it smells kinda cheap and similar to so many other common inexpensive retail brands</li>
            <li>smells pretty good only being beat by polo black for me</li>
            <li>Wow!!!</li>
            <li>Not too bold; not too subtle, but a clean, just-showered fresh scent that last for most of the day.</li>
            <li>smells really gd and is not weak at all,great price also.i will buy this again.</li>
            <li>I mean really good</li>
            <li>but I took a chance - wow - great stuff - not too heavy - not too overpowering - nice, subtle.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, fresh, acuatic, long lasting frangrance.</li>
            <li>This is good parfum, the price is low in comparison with other seller.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still going strong all day long.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts amazingly long, but also isn&#x27;t so spicy and strong that everyone is avoiding you.</li>
            <li>It seems to last longer than other colognes, but it does not smell good.</li>
            <li>The smell was still good, but seemed not as potent and dissipated drastically about 15 minutes after application, at least compared to how it was the first few times.  </li>
            <li>Very strong, only need about 4 squirts to last ALL DAY.</li>
            <li>I have compared it to an original one and varies with the package, also the fragance feels different.</li>
            <li>Much more so than other</li>
            <li>Smells just like the original, but doesn&#x27;t last even an hour.  </li>
            <li>It smell great, but it does not last long, only stay for like 2-3 hours and after that the smells gone</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and oceany and my girlfriends love it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, maybe an hour tops and starts fading after 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>You can really tell a difference between wearing this from the first few hours to the end - makes it enjoyable to wear.</li>
            <li>I tried the original at Macy&#x27;s and a vast difference in scent and in durability.</li>
            <li>All I can tell you, from my experience, is that I get more compliments about how I smell than any other cologne I&#x27;ve worn.  </li>
            <li>Smells great and really long lasting, sometimes i still smell it on my clothes a day or 2 later</li>
            <li>Stronger scent than the very cheap version from Nautica, seems to last a little longer throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;- Price is right, I used to spend 40-60 dollar on cologne, but in recent years find this type of value makes much more sense</li>
            <li>Nautica Voyage is a realistic option for somebody who wants to spend under twenty dollars on cologne.</li>
            <li>SUCH a CLEAN smell</li>
            <li>It has a range of probably 5-10 feet when fresh (less than two hours old), and can be smelled from just over an arm&#x27;s length away for most of the day.  </li>
            <li>First off, bought this directly from Amazon and it is the real thing.</li>
            <li>Girls are constantly asking what the smell is and how clean it smells.</li>
            <li>The smell is lovely not only does it last long, it&#x27;s pretty cheap compare to a retail store.</li>
            <li>Definitely a salty, clean, soapy aquatic sent.</li>
            <li>nice smeel and long lasting fragrance..</li>
            <li>Smells nice, last relatively long as well.</li>
            <li>If only there was some way of getting the scent through to my potential tinder matches, I know they&#x27;d swipe right so much more frequently!</li>
            <li>I honestly purchased this due to the great price a few weeks ago, and had never smelled it previously.</li>
            <li>THE FRAGANCE OF NAUTICA SMELLS SOFT AND VERY GENTLE.</li>
            <li>Highly suggest!The shipping was fast and it is way cheaper then anything you could buy in a store.</li>
            <li>Ive always loved colognes that are clean, and not so heavy and dark</li>
            <li>A little on the strong side but still smells good and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Smells great, i am new to this cologne game</li>
            <li>Long lasting, very fresh, clean, citrus.</li>
            <li>Fresh, Clean smelling &amp; long lasting... recommended to me by a lady I admire very much.</li>
            <li>am not a professional, but I think that this is genuine because the smell remains for days.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>For the price I got this cologne I am pretty surprised at its result.</li>
            <li>Not quite the same as Cool Water as others have suggested.  </li>
            <li>My husband used cool water by David for years and he also loves nautica blue.</li>
            <li>I love it because it lasts for more than a few hours like so much of the other watered-</li>
            <li>The description says nautica voyage, which I&#x27;ve used in the past and really liked.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t a problem for me since i could just swap it out with the one from the old bottle, but it something to be concerned with if this is your first purchase.</li>
            <li>Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz has a good essence, but it has not a good fixation.</li>
            <li>Generally I like fragrances that are fresh and/or citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t do reviews, well this product sucked so much</li>
            <li>Nice, but no more than that.</li>
            <li>Similar to cool water, but somehow not as refined.  </li>
            <li>By far, this colonge wears off FAST!</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell, but occasionally it smells...</li>
            <li>I like it very much and it should last a long time....waiting for compliments!...:)</li>
            <li>down junk that is so readily available!</li>
            <li>As much as I love the smell, The Eau De Toilette is code for watered down cologne.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant enough, not strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s citrusy, with just enough sweetness to take the edge off, and the right kind of florals to round it out.</li>
            <li>I guess I got what I paid for this time, if that means a nice bottle of clear liquid that very slightly smells like the real thing for about five minutes.</li>
            <li>Found a new one to add to my collection!</li>
            <li>Voyage and Burberry for Men are now the two scents I cannot live without!</li>
            <li>This is a nice smelling man&#x27;s cologne that doesn&#x27;t smell girly like Allure Homme Sport for instance and doesn&#x27;t have a very heavy fragrance like Hugo Boss.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean, slight musk and spice aroma.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve received more compliments on it when on me than my Acqua Di Gio, Issey Miyake and Polo Black put together.</li>
            <li>I love this product, Price was about half comparing to store.</li>
            <li>This bottle was twice the size,and more than half the price than a bottle I received from a retail store.</li>
            <li>however the main problem is not the scent but the fact that the the bottle leaks.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered and would expect no less....</li>
            <li>and I get 8 hours with decent projection *5 feet* and sillage.</li>
            <li>The smell is decent.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different and if you&#x27;ve tried many different colognes by now, you should already know this.</li>
            <li>eerrrr, its good, not too heavy but not lasting</li>
            <li>After doing some research, I decided to try this particularly for its reported longevity.</li>
            <li>It is even a lighter color than a older one that I keep in my office.</li>
            <li>The scent is neutral enough that it doesn&#x27;t clash with my deoderant or beard oil, but still prominent enough to dominate their scents.</li>
            <li>If any one can help me find the older version made by Lancaster please email me at wallstreetcpa14@aol.com</li>
            <li>i kinda didn&#x27;t like nautical until i smelled this particular version...</li>
            <li>, the smell is so fresh and everyone smell like it, i have allergies and it didn&#x27;t annoying to my nose, perfect choice.</li>
            <li>24 hours later, put on the same uniform and head to work without putting on another spray and one of my cute co-workers</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell the same and doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour.</li>
            <li>Kinda like addidas moves with a lil bit longer lasting scent that actually smells better with time.  </li>
            <li>Only thing is that the smell of it fades away quickly</li>
            <li>For some reason this looks original but this one smells funky alcoholic than the original one.</li>
            <li>first of all, i dint know what it would smell like, so it was a blind buy for me, but when i first smelled it, i fell in love with the smell, and for $20 it beats most colognes in the same price... will buy this again...</li>
            <li>I asked for a refund and actually got it extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite, and I have some much more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li>The scent is strong &amp; not very flattering.</li>
            <li>Needed some new cologne and took a chance on ordering this from Amazon since it was highly rated and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>Poor excuse for what a very good cologne when you buy the real thing.</li>
            <li>The only problem is there are much better smelling colognes out there for only a little more.</li>
            <li>It may be a fairly inexpensive bottle of cologne, but it&#x27;s got a long lasting scent that I&#x27;ve been complimented on regularly.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, fair price, the reason for the two stars is the scent was very weak like the cologne was old.</li>
            <li>it starts off with a fresh \\&quot;I-just-took-a-shower\\&quot; scent but then has a slight sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I saw how highly rated it was.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>highly recomended for night hangouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this to any man.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s incredibly high ratings and reviews.</li>
            <li>This is for my high school son.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it on a high level date.</li>
            <li>This cologne smells fresh, somewhat reminiscent of the ocean, but with a tiny hint of sweetness that&#x27;s just enough for a guy to still be able to wear it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>used to be a regular user of Lacoste White (as it has a great scent that seems to last forever), but the prices don&#x27;t even compare (Lacoste White&#x27;s $55 for 3.4oz on Amazon)!</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can see why it is rated as high by others.</li>
            <li>Way better than other sprays I have used so far.</li>
            <li>Definitely one of my favorite colognes, smells alot like \\&quot;Adidas Moves for Men\\&quot; but slightly less distinct.</li>
            <li>This is by far my most complimented fragrance and no matter what other fragrance</li>
            <li>From reading the reviews, there is this one and a little bit cheaper one that Nautica sells and it sound like both were good but spending a few more dollars would get you this one that has a good smell that lasts throughout the day and so far, it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li>Ladies, this is the sort of cologne that will make you follow a complete stranger around the grocery store just to catch a whiff of it!!</li>
            <li>I was expecting something a little more</li>
            <li>and I had bought it without having ever smelled it.&lt;br /&gt;However, in the coming few days - I started liking it for its subtleness and fresh clean smell -</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly, was in new packaging, and is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>but he use it anyways smell is not that strong other man perfume</li>
            <li>Overall a crisp, clean smelling cologne but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>My young son-inlay also uses it and really likes it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much to say about Voyage that hasn&#x27;t been said so far, so I&#x27;ll address the seller I purchased this cologne</li>
            <li>Definitely far from the real deal.</li>
            <li>So far I really like this.</li>
            <li>try l&#x27;eau d&#x27;issey  ... weird name but smells great.</li>
            <li>was not home when delivery was attempted during normal working hours</li>
            <li>Waste of money for me, better I even bought it online at the knockoff price instead of the Macy&#x27;s truckload price.</li>
            <li>With most aquatic fragrances, they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>Voyage is a true aquatic, that lasts amazingly long.</li>
            <li>A couple sprays in the morning and a few more around my lunch hour</li>
            <li>it is so energetic and last long too.</li>
            <li>been using it for months just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a placebo effect, but the cologne doesn&#x27;t last long for me.</li>
            <li>Some may have gotten knockoffs but it is well worth the effort to buy and exchange if you receive the low quality knockoff.</li>
            <li>It is super strong and last for half the day with one spray.</li>
            <li>It last on clothes for pretty much 2 days.</li>
            <li>Definitely authentic cologne , 1 spray last all day long .</li>
            <li>A normal fragance, but</li>
            <li>This is a buy worth buying and will last quite a while.</li>
            <li>This has become one of my favorite colognes, and it is now in heavy rotation along with Armani Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I paid like 1/3 normal retail price.&lt;br</li>
            <li>pretty good for blind choice</li>
            <li>Most colognes will where off in a few hours</li>
            <li>Aqua Di Gio by Armani is his favorite, but that&#x27;s too pricey for everyday wear.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor, pony up a few more bucks and buy your cologne from a reliable brick and mortar store, lest you run the risk of getting a tampered with bottle like me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This Eau De Toilette (or perfume as I will simply refer to it) lasts about as long as most deodorant sprays on the market nowadays.</li>
            <li>This is more like an everyday cologne</li>
            <li>I was reluctant to buy this since I normally pay $65.00 for this cologne.</li>
            <li>Really nice and fresh scent not many perfumes stay with me for long</li>
            <li>Its light and fresh, its lasts long but not too long.</li>
            <li>and I use it for casual events and when I hit the town at night that has lead to being complimented on how great it smells.</li>
            <li>I am glad I spent the 20 bucks for this, it has an amazingly fresh aquatic scent that lasts hours and gets compliments like ive never seen, I have burberry touch, FCUD for him, Obsession, Lacoste essential, and kenneth cole black, this smells right up there with them!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s definitely a let down after loving Armani Code the year before.</li>
            <li>Layman&#x27;s way of describing the smell would be to imagine a nice looking guy wearing white shirt, half buttoned up with sleeves rolled up, sitting at the beach, smiling.</li>
            <li>imagine a nice looking guy wearing white shirt, half buttoned up with sleeves rolled up, sitting at the beach, smiling.&#x27;</li>
            <li>I received my purchase in less time than I expected and the product is good.</li>
            <li>The bottle I got was just about water, you could barley smell it right from the bottle or after 2 to 3 minutes later on your skin.  </li>
            <li>Definitely the right cologne to take on a date.</li>
            <li>The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last forever but it doesn&#x27;t wear off right away either.</li>
            <li>the only concern i have about this cologne is it leaves stains on cloths if sprayed at a closer range but comes right off after washing the clothe.</li>
            <li>Oh yeah, and this one will get you compliments left and right.  </li>
            <li>Product is exactly as expected, including manufacture&#x27;s original packaging (with cellophane wrapping).</li>
            <li>Cause all of protection and came before expected also it was in original package .</li>
            <li>for new conquests.</li>
            <li>I went looking for a new cologne.  </li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s new fave.</li>
            <li>Came well packaged, brand new with the plastic still in tact.</li>
            <li>My new fav cologne.</li>
            <li>Well, live and learn.</li>
            <li>It is a new perfume in my selection</li>
            <li>When I purchsae this product it was listed as new.</li>
            <li>In fact everytime I think of new york in summer of 2012 - I think of this smell.</li>
            <li>I am always looking for a new scent.</li>
            <li>Was looking to add something new to my cologne collection and came across &amp;#34;Nautica Voyage&amp;#34; on sale at &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>My new fav smell.</li>
            <li>The design is curved back and flat front, easy to hold and spray.</li>
            <li>Product is certainly not the original.</li>
            <li>They need to be masculine without being overly powerful and they must last all day.  </li>
            <li>Overall to get the same effect as my older bottle I may have to spray more, and maybe in in the future I am going to have to try it in the store again to see if it changed before I buy it again on amazon.</li>
            <li>Looks like Nautica spent more on the outer glass than on the inner liquid spray.</li>
            <li>Nice subtle but manly smell.</li>
            <li>I like the smell, is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>It smells good but very subtle.</li>
            <li>It is not really a suit and tie scent per se, but if you want something relaxing to wear casually, this one is excellent, although you can pull it off at the office well during summertime.  </li>
            <li>its only ok the smell is not long lasting .</li>
            <li>Yet it has very classy smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;That was the second time I wore it going out, and dare I say the fragrance is very much a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in my opinion there are \\&quot;better\\&quot; colognes out there, but they will cost you upwards of $80-100 for a 3.4oz bottle.</li>
            <li>very fast shipping and its definitely the designer brand.</li>
            <li>It has a very classy smell and i would definately buy it again</li>
            <li>This scent is definitely a winner at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>You have to put you nose very near to feel the scent.</li>
            <li>He tells me everyday how many complements he gets about how he smells, but cause it&#x27;s just right, not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li>i was right near my local retail store, and i ran in.</li>
            <li>But for the first few months, it was tremendous</li>
            <li>The smell also does not last for long nor is it strong at all to begin with.</li>
            <li>Just what I have been looking for, not too strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Good deal.for the amount but seems slightly watered down.  </li>
            <li>have the exact same bottle from a departmental store, it seems in the originals, the shrink-wraps can be opened from the sides as well.</li>
            <li>Mine came today and the scent is still the same when my sister first bought it for me.</li>
            <li>Pretty solid.</li>
            <li>Other than that scent alone has me coming back for more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since 2007, Its fresh aroma lasts long and it&#x27;s noticeable.</li>
            <li>I am getting married at the beach next month</li>
            <li>I tried buying a perfume over the net the first time.</li>
            <li>I give it a 2.5/5 stars, I never bought this cologne before so its my first time actually trying out this cologne.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience with this cologne, but I thought at this price why not add it to the arsenal (I try to keep 4 or 5 different fragrances at all times</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE</li>
            <li>Usually this is my favorite cologne</li>
            <li>(at far as I know)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in my mailbox, product unopened still sealed in plastic wrap!</li>
            <li>Nautica voyage passed that personal test and i&#x27;m happy that I found another compliment catcher and at least a temporary distraction from coolwater and curve which are still my personal favorites and always be.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this cologne to others interested.</li>
            <li>It seems it is diluted and not exactly 100% original.</li>
            <li>or it will be LOUD!</li>
            <li>What you ultimately get is an appealing and addictive accord that persists for several hours before settling into a skin scent around the 3 to 5 hour mark.</li>
            <li>Excellent, get it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>on.&lt;br /&gt;The exact same thing sold at the mall (the ones close to me anyway) sells between $25 and $30</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smells last for 6-8 hours but can be smelled up to 10-12 hours up close ;)</li>
            <li>Finally, I found a good everyday colonge that last.</li>
            <li>but I find it a little bit strong at times</li>
            <li>Mine smells fine and lasted long enough.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent but not great, it has a nice ocean breezy summer day kinda scent.</li>
            <li>, good smell the fragrance is lasting, not strong for daily use</li>
            <li>or I had it so long that the scent had began to not smell right</li>
            <li>Its a great cologne for everyday use and has an out of the ordinary fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get this fantastic long lasting scent from the minuscule amount that the sprayer puts out.</li>
            <li>This smells fine for my 13 year old son, but I would recommend for my husband because the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I had previously bought this same exact size fragrance at a department store for twice the price, so needless to say, I was very happy with the price.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping, product just as expected</li>
            <li>The bottle I had received is properly marked by Nautica, it had the sticker on the bottom of the bottle and is exactly the same as the one I bought from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li>You use it for the first time, it smell ok not great.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite scents cool and casual</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s recomended for special ocations or other activities</li>
            <li>Just recieved it today and it was a total fake; the smell was very different from the original (not in a good way), and the bottom didnt have a serial number.</li>
            <li>I recommend if you are just trying to smell a bit better especially for this price.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down</li>
            <li>This is the same cologne that received better marks than more expensive competitors on various websites, but you don&#x27;t need a silly review with subjectively attributed points to know that this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I did get a number of positive comments about it from my female friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have received numerous positive comments about what I am wearing.  </li>
            <li>Very clean, light, fresh smell that lasts at least the day for me, and I don&#x27;t bath in it if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li>He received this the Christmas of 2013 and still has more than a half left of it.</li>
            <li>actually prefer Lucky as my daily cologne</li>
            <li>scent is very soft and gentle, last for another 5 hours</li>
            <li>Also, I am very particular about the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; smell from colognes that are similarly priced; this does not have that problem.</li>
            <li>it is strong but not a strong scent.</li>
            <li>( i bought a large bottle from macys and it had the same plastic cap as Amazons bottle.)</li>
            <li>He&#x27;ll be the one smelling himself afterall.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle: simple, large, durable glass.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:</li>
            <li>but the 3.4 oz actually is quite large (the $40-$50 one at stores).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but still has a little weight to it.  </li>
            <li>The scent lasts about twice as long when sprayed on fabric than when sprayed directly on skin, as with most other colognes/</li>
            <li>I have only bought this for the past two years and at this price, I am ordering two extra bottles because it is a very nice male cologne.</li>
            <li>It should also have some sort of stamp of numbers (my original Nautica from the store had 4 numbers in black dot ink).  </li>
            <li>This is a decent cologne, it is long lasting, cheap, and it&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li>this is just an average aquatic scent, i mainly wear it to work because the price is right.</li>
            <li>Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li>out of them all this is the clear winner.</li>
            <li>I want to be clear</li>
            <li>So masculine...</li>
            <li>For guys that want a bit of a stronger and mature scent I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li>I particularly enjoy the scent for a few minutes after application in the morning, but within an hour I no longer notice it, as it has combined with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Starting with a very fruity vibe, with some lavenderish-cleanish-fresh smell.</li>
            <li>This product has far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>After buying this one from Amazon direct, my doubts are now confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Go to fragrances.net for a complete breakdown of the scent composition.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve seen warnings about possible fakes, but my bottle has the sticker and serial number on the bottom that I&#x27;ve heard is indicative of the real deal.</li>
            <li>Ordered directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>It does not hurt my 20 months old son&#x27;s nostrils when I take him.</li>
            <li>I also had my wife smell my shirt where I sprayed different spots with the &#x27;real&#x27; bottle and the bottle from Amazon...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>really the product is such that it describes the seller.</li>
            <li>My old spice deodorant have a stronger smell than this.</li>
            <li>Amazon is BY FAR the cheapest place to buy this cologne.(the 1.0 oz in retail stores are around $30)</li>
            <li>Its not heavy-</li>
            <li>Soft and sensual.</li>
            <li>I was using old spice wolferang before I believe, and this blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li>And was well received by senior citizen as well as a young man.</li>
            <li>I decided to try something different and needed it fast, so I went to amazon.</li>
            <li>WITH HIS NATURAL BODY SCENT</li>
            <li>This actually smells very close to Paris Hilton for Men</li>
            <li>It does not smell the same as the real thing.</li>
            <li>Really recommend it is on of my personal favorites.</li>
            <li>I was surprised, and I started to think wild &amp;#34;am</li>
            <li>Smells just like the old nautica competition I used to wear.</li>
            <li>Uncertain of authenticity or how old product is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy sprayer or a person who &amp;#34;bathes&amp;#34; in their cologne, so that wasn&#x27;t the reason.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s masculine.</li>
            <li>If I keep using this stuff,i&#x27;m going to an early grave.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to receive the number of compliments that I get while wearing this.</li>
            <li>though I got mine directly from Amazon</li>
            <li>I was never much of a cologne wearer, perhaps some Old Spice back in college decades ago, but I wanted to see what was available.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 26 yrs old</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy again when I run out... highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for the last 4-5 months, and really like the smell.</li>
            <li>This is the same product I tried in the store, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Not only that it really helps my dragon</li>
            <li>it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t recommend to spend (nearly $20) on it.</li>
            <li>but wow, I cant stand how this smells.</li>
            <li>+ years old.  </li>
            <li>Bought mine direct from Amazon.</li>
            <li>i bought this expecting something at least ok.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper than in the local retail stores.  </li>
            <li>Nautica Blue lasts 3 times as much</li>
            <li>Scent lasts about 15 mins, and not even the same Nautica Voyage smell as the real stuff.</li>
            <li>Can be chloeing if too much applied, 2 sprays were enough for me.</li>
            <li>and i bought it directly from amazon,</li>
            <li>this perfume is a kind of mix, firts spray on my skin feels and smells like island voyage nautica, smells like the sea, but few minutes later smells like blue seduccion by Antonio Banderas.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that as a EDT type cologne it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a full parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Keep in mind it doesn&#x27;t last as long as full parfums.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh enough but doesn&#x27;t last until lunchtime.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if I have gotten used to its fragrance or not, but it does not last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li>It is a good casual scent that anyone can pull off.</li>
            <li>Great for everyday casual use, and the price is right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The subject line pretty much describes what you get on this bottle.</li>
            <li>and I get the most compliments for this in comparison to my other brand name and more expensive bottles.</li>
            <li>I smelled nearly every other scent available, but this one was definitely the winner!</li>
            <li>which this and the previous purchase (Cool Water).</li>
            <li>it seems to me like water with little drops of colony, you can use it to remove ink or clean your keyboard .</li>
            <li>On clean, remotely moist skin it will last 8-12 hours.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the first was a bad batch but the second bottle was great.</li>
            <li>Stays with you most of the day and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I ordered this perfume after looking at the reviews, but for my disappointment or may be I&#x27;m the chosen one I got the same exact bottle with good packing but not a perfume in though.</li>
            <li>There were few people claiming that this is not an original product.</li>
            <li>My original review was dead wrong:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some colognes seem to fade quickly to the person wearing it, (but people nearby can still smell it many hours later) but Nautica Voyage seems to lose it&#x27;s scent not only to the wearer but also anyone else nearby approximately 3-4 hours after application.</li>
            <li>You would like it if you love subtle fragrance smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;ll be able to use it all :(</li>
            <li>A decent smelling, low price cologn.</li>
            <li>Fresh and long lasting, dont know how you can beat the price either.</li>
            <li>As long you get if from amazon directly you will get the real one.</li>
            <li>, I sprayed it on last night so it has decent staying power.  </li>
            <li>This fragrance gives me that, finding others out there who like what I like, and say so to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is ridiculously low, compared to all the value that I receive as a direct result of others valuation of it, how much I personally value it, and how much it is sold here for, compared to how much I have seen department stores sell the same size for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This seems to last decently throughout the day with no problem.</li>
            <li>Read the following review and mine is the exact same. &#x27;</li>
            <li>but I do know it is just not the same as my older bottle from Macy&#x27;s,</li>
            <li>It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!</li>
            <li>I purchased this, Nautica Classic and Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very subtle and nice to wear at day-time or night-time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>However, it certainly lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>my fave cool water smell can&#x27;t go wrong very calm scent will buy again</li>
            <li>I highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It opens its top-notes with a fruity presence that smells likes apples and settles quickly into a fresh/clean/floral green accord and settles its base in a very pleasant and masculine woody/aquatic contrast.  </li>
            <li>not necessarily sour though).</li>
            <li>Fantastic, this stuff costs me usually about $70 bucks.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this was genuine or not</li>
            <li>but there were no more boxes of this available.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it is the original or not, but smells exactly the same and a fourth of the price.</li>
            <li>What is interesting was that Blue was my everyday scent, and I think I probably won&#x27;t go back to it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>/&gt;\\&quot;The scent is very week and not long lasting ...</li>
            <li>This cologne had a very fresh scent and it last for half the day.</li>
            <li>With a limited experience in wearing men&#x27;s cologne, I was not really sure how or where to apply this stuff with the little spray bottle, but have learned that one puff spray on my chest, under my shirt, works great and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The smell lingers for quite a long time, and the smell is breezy, slightly musky - light and oceanic, but still masculine.</li>
            <li>Withing a week or two, the smell hardly lasted and it wasn&#x27;t strong.</li>
            <li>Made a complaint, got an email saying they were sorry, and they shipped out a second bottle free of charge, nice!</li>
            <li>also the scent was not lasting more than an hardly an hour.</li>
            <li>Smell is very oceanic and stays for a long time!</li>
            <li>Every year my husband gets a new cologne, last year it was Nautica</li>
            <li>, I only stop using it to try new ones</li>
            <li>only downside was the atomizer on the new bottle</li>
            <li>This is the real deal (sticker on bottom) and the scent lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>Scent different, bottle top was odd, scent last only for a couple hours.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it does last much....</li>
            <li>It last&#x27; pretty long.</li>
            <li>Personally, I feel it is worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li>This is one of the least expensive colognes I&#x27;ve bought, but the best performing.</li>
            <li>honestly I thought I would hate because it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li>Nice, soft scent... quite casual.</li>
            <li>And the very first few sprays</li>
            <li>The low price made me wonder if it was original, and after comparing it with the other one I bought from a local store a while ago, seems legit.</li>
            <li>The size is major and it is indeed legit - compared at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I think its a pretty casual sent so its good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The other (the one that I received) has a cheaper, plastic cap, and a more harsh, alcoholy scent to it.</li>
            <li>3.4 oz bottle should last me for a while since this eau de toilette spray is strong enough where it doesn&#x27;t not need to be heavily used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells light and airy (if thats a word), not overpowering but will not last as long as some other stronger scents.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh and also a little musky.  </li>
            <li>Nice smell, but weak and short lasting.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne at less than half the cost at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Under the sticker there is a serial number that will be hard to spot unless you&#x27;re under the light.</li>
            <li>and I find the smell quite pleasant and nostalgic (of what, I don&#x27;t know!)</li>
            <li>Definitely a fragrance for a younger guy in high school or college.</li>
            <li>if its even fake or real ( genuine) cologne.</li>
            <li>I generally apply it before work, and it&#x27;s still noticeable when I&#x27;m getting home ~10</li>
            <li>Speaking of packaging I generally prefer and recommend finding an online store you trust, and getting your colognes, EDT, and perfumes from there.</li>
            <li>There is a clear difference between these class of Nautica&#x27;s and the class of say Christian Dior perfumes.</li>
            <li>It smells artificial and synthetic at first, but dissipates to an OK smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Me personally, I would much rather use a cologne that smelled just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but lasts long rather than vice-versa.</li>
            <li>The one made by lancaster is much nicer, smoother, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Definitely smells masculine,</li>
            <li>I like a simple, masculine, old-fashioned fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Ordered two bottles directly from Amazon, not 3rd party seller.</li>
            <li>Apparently, you have to buy it from a legit seller.  </li>
            <li>I am a 23 year old male and have never worn perfume/deodorant in my life.</li>
            <li>I was barely using any of it.  </li>
            <li>Amazon offers the same at rock bottom price.</li>
            <li>I use it daily before going to work and so far haven&#x27;t received any complaints about it.</li>
            <li>my gf told me that she can only perceive the scent when her nose is in direct contact with my skin.</li>
            <li>You should definitely give this a try if you are sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li>I got mine direct from Amazon and not a third party</li>
            <li>While everything looks identical this product had no scent and was barely distinguishable.</li>
            <li>Even after using a lot, barely lasts for couple of hours.</li>
            <li>info: 21 year old, Male in college.</li>
            <li>I am now on my third bottle, and get compliments quite frequently on this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have no regrets to date.</li>
            <li>The smell seemed barely there</li>
            <li>Classy smell that lasts until the next day!</li>
            <li>Normally this cologne is $30-40 in the store for the larger bottle, so it&#x27;s definitely cheaper</li>
            <li>I actually like it as much as I like his more expensive colognes, like Hugo.</li>
            <li>The smell is OK but not great</li>
            <li>I got the fake kind.  </li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d get tired of strange women walking up to me telling me I smell nice.</li>
            <li>It is not too strong and not too subtle.</li>
            <li>I was kinda getting tired of them myself since I have been using them for more than 2 years ( switching between them ).</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I was heart broken to find that this was not the voyage that I know and love.</li>
            <li>Out of the three, I think this may hit the sweet spot by a small margin over island voyage for scent.</li>
            <li>Nice fresh fragrance for men...not to overpowering-for casual use everyday.</li>
            <li>Smells clean, but not as sharp as expected.</li>
            <li>MUCH less money spent on this than at the stores I usually purchase cologne from and smell just as good and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>2nd you can use this product anytime of the year especially if you live in Florida like I do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in proximity to a lot of people and in very social settings.  </li>
            <li>It smells fresh, clean and airy, not too heavy or thick.</li>
            <li>I still have profound respect and continue to come back with reliance to this one.</li>
            <li>Going to test on something I&#x27;m not wearing to make sure I&#x27;m not just getting so used to the scent that I can&#x27;t detect it, but my other cologne I can still smell the next morning from just one spray (it&#x27;s not strong or overbearing, just long-lasting, seemingly unlike this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To say the least, I was NOT disappointed.  </li>
            <li>5 stars because the product is exactly as stated and only costed me a mere $15 free shipping.</li>
            <li>I am usually allergic to cologne and it makes me sneeze or gives me a headache, but this has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t make me sick and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li>but my girlfriend can pick up a dirty hoodie from last week and it will still smell good.</li>
            <li>It truly does seem that the spray and tube did indeed have the actual cologne in it when I first got it, but the liquid in the bottle has been watered down with some alcohol.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price is a major value, as I&#x27;ve seen Voyage at department stores for nearly double the price....</li>
            <li>Voyage goes on a little scratchy at first, but after 15 minutes</li>
            <li>It blends down with some soapy notes, with the fruit staying in there strong; I can also get a little musk in there.</li>
            <li>it came in at about one half the cost I&#x27;d been paying at a national Department Store whose first initial is \\&quot;M\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>All these colognes are fake, the bottles looks nothing like the real thing, smells absolutely nothing like the real thing</li>
            <li>so I have the hygiene habits of a acne-ridden teenage boy apparently.  </li>
            <li>, I also picked up the well rated Nautica Blue at the same time to compare and all I can say is WOW, stay away from Blue and stick with Voyage, world of difference!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>i would recomend to any teenage to mid adult male.</li>
            <li>This heavy glass cologne bottle accidentally landed head first on my carpet.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t toss your heavy glass bottle head first</li>
            <li>my first bottle had a heavy metal cap.</li>
            <li>Like someone let a bottle of Windex ferment on a hot beach for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>a lower end for everyday use and a higher end for going out to parties or events.</li>
            <li>Smells clean -nothing pretentious, just enough for being noted-</li>
            <li>This stuff is really watered down and</li>
            <li>Considering gucci and other high end cologne is over 100$</li>
            <li>You really had to be looking for it and of course have previous knowledge about</li>
            <li>Far as the longevity you make think it does not last long</li>
            <li>but i was surprised that this will long last than the lacoste that i bought here in amazon ..</li>
            <li>product didnt come on time, however, it didnt come super late either.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not too harsh on the nose and the fragrance stays fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li>The smell was pure alcohol, a sort of vodka smell, and then only a slight hint of the actual cologne.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a heavenly smell cologne, but at least it is somewhat cheap, but I don&#x27;t encourage you to buy a big perfume bottle like this one, since you will have to stick to it for a very long time.</li>
            <li>Was a little hesitant to buy, but it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li>But the major fault i found out is, it doesn&#x27;t be for long time</li>
            <li>Having used Davidoff Cool Water as my standard go-to everyday scent I decided to try Nautica Voyage and equally found myself in agreement with the other reviewers who made the comparison.</li>
            <li>I was needing some new spray since my other was either running low</li>
            <li>I still had a little left in the old bottle and the fragrance is the same as far as I can</li>
            <li>all the bad reviews before purchasing this!&lt;br /&gt;the seller is giving me a refund.&lt;br /&gt;1/5 star for product but good customer service</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was once told I smelled nice while wearing it...</li>
            <li> Because its considered a hazardous liquid, it cannot be returned to Amazon.</li>
            <li> When it came it was nicely packaged.</li>
            <li> Good stuff :)</li>
            <li> Honestly, there is fowl play about with the &#x27;Voyage&#x27; series.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice smelling non-feminine but non-macho fragrance.</li>
            <li> The bottle alone looks really nice in a collection.</li>
            <li> Nice colone,  but wears off after like 30 - 40 minutes.</li>

            <li> NICE FOR MY LADY TO SMELL ON ME</li>

            <li> My husband really liked the fragrance.</li>
            <li> It has this nice melon/apple note that is a good change-up from the citrus that most summertime aquatic fragrances are centered around.  </li>
            <li> There is a nice salty air scent as well.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he really liked the smell</li>
            <li> I bough this for my fried and he liked it a lot.</li>

            <li> Lovely scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased that version of Nautica.</li>
            <li> My fiance was very happy, especially with the size.</li>
            <li> and i love it.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a really safe blind-buy.</li>
            <li> I have not found another cologne I like better than this one.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot and this one gets the most compliments</li>
            <li> and I personally think it&#x27;s smells the best.</li>
            <li> My Axe is better and cheaper than this</li>
            <li> I dont know how to better describe it</li>
            <li> But, it is truly ok for me.  </li>
            <li> I love it with the price that I paid.</li>
            <li> If you love Eternity, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> love it.....</li>
            <li> smell deliciuos!! :-)</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will probably just have to spend more money and get something that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Authentic Nautica product.</li>
            <li> Definitely really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite for years</li>
            <li> and I love avoiding department store prices.</li>
            <li> but this one stays for the entire day, and it smells awesome.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This cologne is in my top 5</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see many people mention this, but there is a cucumber-like scent in this cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne....</li>
            <li> Not overpowering and all my lady friends love it.</li>
            <li> My friend gets most everything from amazon,so I gave it a shot.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend and i love the way it smells on him when he runs out will be ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li> doesnt realy make it authentic at all.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I just wonder how many people did all these 5 star reviews deceive.</li>
            <li> BOD Man is a better and way cheaper fragrance than this or Tommy Hilfiger for $25.</li>
            <li> great cologne for a college kid who doesnt want to break his bank, but wants to get the girls.</li>
            <li> love the frangrance.&lt;br</li>
            <li> #winning</li>
            <li> It is a hit with many women.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he hasn&#x27;t really used it yet, but it came in great condition</li>
            <li> and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> so I go to a lot of houses a day and love this fragrance</li>
            <li> I read most of the reviews and decided to go for it</li>
            <li> love this cologne and for the price ever better</li>
            <li> I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Therefore I love it.</li>
            <li> but that is okay</li>
            <li> plan on getting more cologne by Nautica</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Smells more like alcohol than anything else</li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t absolutely love it.  </li>
            <li> It is nice light scent, stays on my body for atleast 1 day , on clothes it will stay 2-4 hours if you spray 3-4 pumps.</li>
            <li> Well, a week in to owning this, and I&#x27;m 90% sure this is not a legit bottle of Nautica Voyage cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s discounted price and not a penny more.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;s favorite colognes.</li>
            <li> Sure, if I put my nose up to where I sprayed it</li>
            <li> I was looking for more woodsy.</li>
            <li> This, to me, smells more like an abercrimbie model.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I took a chance and purchased this.</li>
            <li> Though I love the Nautica men&#x27;s fragrances, I couldn&#x27;t believe the price they were asking.  </li>
            <li> hyped it up to be, but It&#x27;s a good, strong, and clean scent.</li>
            <li> I am upset with Amazon for allowing this product to be sold under what I had viewed to be a reputable website to buy from until now.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love this one.</li>
            <li> my family enjoyed this gifts</li>
            <li> i love this product .</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> feel better about being under me.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this at a really solid discount through Amazon, and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li> I got more compliments wearing this at work than some of my Creed fragrances, and they cost $200 or more.</li>
            <li> and I love this scent</li>

            <li> this is one of my husbands favorite scents i love when he wears it .  </li>
            <li> What I like most about Voyage is that there&#x27;s this root-beer like fizz in the mix of it all as well.</li>
            <li> It has turned into one of our favorites for sure.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> But this product has gotten me so many compliments I&#x27;ve lost count</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve received many complements on it.</li>
            <li> The price is even better from amazon.</li>
            <li> Probably more of a summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> Boy, was I glad I didn&#x27;t shell out</li>
            <li> have gotten so many compliments from co-workers, and friends who think I paid a fortune for this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nautica</li>
            <li> But this is my favorite one.</li>

            <li> I am most impresses about shipping it was shipped a day after I purchased and arrived in the Caribbean 1 day after</li>
            <li> wish they made a stronger version and charged more (aka, parfume).</li>
            <li> Outstanding clean/summer day scent.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a good deal for a nice sized bottle of some really good smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> By far my favorite cologne, i took a chance since the price was so good and tyre revieus were so good.....</li>
            <li> This is really the best bang for buck out there right now for cologne.</li>
            <li> It lasts all day, I get compliments constantly on how good I smell, I just love it!!  </li>
            <li> super parfume with super price!!!</li>

            <li> My hubby smells so good - Fresh and Clean Scent!  </li>
            <li> quite pleasant, not overbearingly strong, but &#x27;just right&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice clean aquatic.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome, and I am usually all over the Giorgio Armani, this is definitely a good tie with Acqua di Gio.</li>
            <li> nice clean fragrance, no cloying scent...</li>
            <li> Nice clean scent</li>
            <li> Smells pretty nice, it was very clean and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> Nice affordable price and specially for what you are getting</li>
            <li> Great with the old school smell!!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and smells amazing :)</li>
            <li> and noticed it was much stronger and more pleasant than mine.</li>
            <li> Very clean smelling.</li>
            <li> Very clean smell.</li>
            <li> Very clean and fragrant smell.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean and soapy.  </li>
            <li> What really got me about it was the amazing price!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants to smell amazing!</li>
            <li> still is pretty good</li>
            <li> First tried the cologne at a friends house and loved the smell</li>
            <li> It smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> Its perfect ... n stays long.</li>
            <li> For the price offered, it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> If you wanna find a hot girls who likes a good cologne, get this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Smells awesome, lasts a long time, my girlfriend likes it.</li>
            <li> I did pretty good research before buying this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sweet smelling cologne for guys.</li>
            <li> Really Nice cool scent.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good.</li>
            <li> it works pretty good for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying attention to deals abt this fragrance for a long time and this is the best I&#x27;ve got.</li>
            <li> Be sure to have your signature scent for those special outings!</li>
            <li> It has good longevity that lasts about 10 hours strong, and the sillage is just right.</li>
            <li> But, that&#x27;s how great this scent is...not over-powering, long-lasting, crisp and clean and reeking of sexuality</li>
            <li> Smells good better than Nautica Pure</li>
            <li> First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed at all!</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the great price and thought it would be great for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Great product, fresh scent that is intriguing but not over powering.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but wears off rather quickly</li>
            <li> you ever gone in clubs/dances and brush by many men smelling a mixture of their sweat + strong and repugnant perfume?</li>
            <li> I sprayed 3-5 times on my neck and its way to refreshing but its strong.</li>
            <li> Nice smell but mild.</li>
            <li> It is also fairly potent for an aquatic fragrance, so easy on the trigger, two-three sprays on chest/neck will do it.  </li>
            <li> But it fades kind of quickly, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, even though I like the scent.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and I regularly get compliments from people telling me I smell nice.</li>
            <li> I liked it very much!</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne for any young man!</li>
            <li> This product was too good to be true; and the only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the customer service was great</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is easily the best cologne money can buy and as long as Nautica is producing it</li>
            <li> I like the crisp fresh scent, it&#x27;s light and very appealing, good for the evenings.</li>
            <li> new favorite!!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Can I tell you, this stuff is so clean and reshreshing and just so yummy!</li>
            <li> Original at such a great price!</li>
            <li> Clean, bright, soap fresh with sensual undertones.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s right, more so than the Ives Saint Laurent&#x27;s, the Gucci&#x27;s, the Bvlgari&#x27;s and even the Creeds!</li>
            <li> Very sweet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many compliments by the ladies, this is highly recommended as a conservative option with a good manly fragrance.</li>
            <li> I bought Nautica Voyage without smelling it before hand and it was a great choice, the price was more than reasonable and it smells light and clean.</li>
            <li> My wife gifted it to me, thank you very much Shaminder !!</li>
            <li> I have been using this Nautica Men&#x27;s Cologne for many years now and it is fantastic.</li>
            <li> But this cologne has a cheap smell, it lasts for sure, hours maybe days, again it was from Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Voyage smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t overpower you, nor does it completely impregnate you like others.</li>
            <li> Nautica &amp;#34;Island Voyage&amp;#34; is better, but this is pretty nice.  </li>
            <li> good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
            <li> never thought Cotty products would qualify as anything more than cheap.</li>
            <li> most important test is of course the smell.</li>
            <li> it still will hold a light watery scent sure to not scare anyone</li>
            <li> I am sure others might like it but for my liking the smell is too light.</li>
            <li> Ok it is cheap.</li>
            <li> She obviously has incredible taste....</li>
            <li> When i opened the box to get a whiff of it for the first time i immediatly was satisfied and it put a huge smile on my face i am extremly happy.</li>

            <li> Smells great, it does last for about 10 hours, it has a nice clean smell to it.</li>
            <li> People will make excuses to stand near you just so they can smell it, very nice smell.</li>
            <li> Very clean scent with light citrus and fruit, almost watermelon.</li>
            <li> I sprayed this one time, and after about the 6th hour it was still so strong it nearly gave me a headache, but the scent is very nice</li>
            <li> It smells familiar to many people.  </li>
            <li> I ended up buying two other colognes, both excellent:  Skulls and Roses and Armani Code.  </li>
            <li> Sweet smelling drydown...almost an unisex perfume!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say for sure because I&#x27;ve never tried the original one</li>
            <li> It is too sweet smelling for being a man&#x27;s cologne!.</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery....</li>
            <li> The clean smell has attracted many females to compliment me on what I was wearing.</li>
            <li> Alot of reviews said they loved this, went and smelled it at Macy&#x27;s and decided it was amazing and ordered it here the same day.&lt;br /&gt;Mine</li>
            <li> I have had many different colognes, though this was a great surprise for the price.</li>
            <li> Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fragrance that lasted longer than most, with a clean scent.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic cologne, at an even more fantastic price.</li>
            <li> clean smelling, love it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine is authentic or not, but the fragrance is nice and stays for quite some time (not the whole day).</li>
            <li> You just got out of the shower, and your whole body just happens to smell naturally fresh and great.</li>
            <li> At first I was pretty happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> The aroma fades very quickly both on skin and on clothes.</li>
            <li> We also received it very quickly.  </li>
            <li> It is clean and refreshing and a pleasure to wear.</li>
            <li> This one is nice and clean, mild, on the sweeter side.  </li>
            <li> Can easily get 24 hours out of this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell inoffensive and could be mistaken for a strong soap.</li>
            <li> Strong, but not too strong to the point of being overbearing.</li>
            <li> A sub-par toilette spray, smells too strong and &amp;#34;febreze&amp;#34; like for a man&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> that being said if you&#x27;re looking for something decent to wear without offending people this is a good bet</li>
            <li> This is sort of a classic cologne and smells really good.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend gave his bottle away as it was way to strong on him just using even two sprays.</li>
            <li> Good size pack in decent price .</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like extremely strong scents either.</li>
            <li> However.....this is way too strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just too strong for</li>
            <li> it is definitely a strong contender.</li>
            <li> not overbearing or to strong @ all.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong.</li>
            <li> : kinda smelled a bit like axe without the strong fragrance</li>
            <li> For the price i didn&#x27;t expect this cologne to be so strong, two sprays</li>
            <li> The smell is not that much strong.</li>
            <li> If you dislike or you are allergic to strong smelling cologne, then this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> Really strong smell, a bit too chemically for my taste.</li>
            <li> Not too strong.</li>
            <li> super fast and sure, the product is good, inexpensive ............&lt;br /&gt;Great .</li>
            <li> The best way for to describe it is think of like a nice fresh body wash and makes you feel fresh and clean, this is pretty much that smell.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My special lady friend loves the scent and I love the price.</li>
            <li> The top lid of the bottle came with a malfunction so right now since the fragrance and the price paid is OK</li>
            <li> The apple, lotus, and mimosa notes blend very nicely to create a perfect casual summer cologne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lasts the whole day, very refreshing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very safe fragrance that can&#x27;t really disappoint.  </li>
            <li> This arrived much earlier than expected, great size for the price, and always smells great!</li>
            <li> First bottle of this was amazing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first day or two was amazing.</li>
            <li> This perfume is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> Its always better to smell sweet instead of</li>
            <li> I like my Cool Water better and wish I saved my money.  </li>
            <li> It perfect for around the house use or average wear .</li>
            <li> I like this a bit better than Cool Water even.</li>
            <li> ladies love cool j</li>
            <li> I had a first date planned with this girl, and i kind of forgot until she reminded me, and i thought &amp;#34;oh</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like true love.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s crisp and nice.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t smell pretty on her S/O, not feminine at all...just a nice fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing amazing, but it smells clean, fresh, and ocean-y.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice, fresh and clean sort of smell.  </li>
            <li> Wanna smell fresh, clean &amp; nice ?</li>
            <li> THIS is hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn!!  </li>
            <li> A fresh and clean smell - kind of what I would expect Hollister Newport Beach to smell like if it were adapted as a cologne.</li>
            <li> It got a fresh scent and NOT too strong!</li>
            <li> The Nautica Voyage is an excellent fragrance and keeps the fragrance alive for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The price offered by Amazon is great and it ways higher on stores.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances &amp; I love being able to get it at such an amazing price through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Very clean and refreshing for any activity; whiter on a date or at the office Nautica Voyage will last the day and keep you in the good graces of those around you.</li>
            <li> The cologne arrived in good condition and appears to be new.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance is pretty linear, but it doesn&#x27;t matter if its great throughout the whole period.</li>
            <li> My wife is fine with it.</li>
            <li> An elegant, fresh, clean, and soothing scent that you are able to put on anytime of day for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I remember when my first bottle cost me over $50, so to get it at such a bargain price is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> But one spray does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> thats fine with me.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s just fine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but it would be better If it lasts long</li>
            <li> scent is pretty great, very manly and what I would imagine VIP would smell like.</li>
            <li> Amazon delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> It was also super cheap!  </li>
            <li> I am pregnant and haven&#x27;t been able to stand any fragrances but this cologne didn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> This quickly became my favorite cologne for anytime use.</li>
            <li> Luckily I was able to purchase it off of Amazon.</li>
            <li> but it goes away quick!</li>
            <li> It is pleasant, soft and soothing, not in a flowery way.  </li>
            <li> Its not too strong where it would offend your coworkers but its light at the end of day.</li>
            <li> I gave it a quick spray on my wrist (free cologne!)</li>
            <li> and then it quickly became my favorite smell of summer of 2012.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too strong and smells cheap (to me).</li>
            <li> Its a very nice fruity, soapy floral scent and since there is no citrus in it like typical aquatics, it is not harsh at all and very very pleasant to the nose.  </li>
            <li> but it has like a mild smell, more like a smell of alcohol and not like</li>
            <li> He wore this before I met him and when he ran out, I was quick to buy him more.</li>
            <li> I used this perfume in the past and got too many compliments, I first got it as a gift from a good friend of mine, but after smelling it and getting many good compliments at work and at the stores I bought me 3 more bottles</li>
            <li> Overall though not a bad buy and has an excellent fresh smell with a hint of sweetness to it.</li>
            <li> It is the real thing that&#x27;s for sure!</li>
            <li> This cologne is strong, it lasts all day and smells great after only 1 spritz of it.</li>
            <li> This is really surprising, I am impressed by the performance of the fragrance, it does last a very long</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t have any type of overwhelming smell it to, just a nice natural smell!</li>
            <li> I loved this product and was very pleased with It and will other things when I need something else .I</li>

            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this fragance, too cheap, although it&#x27;s a fresh and modern scent; for  kool guys, I love it !</li>
            <li> The smell is not much durable but for the price is very good.</li>
            <li> Great price, it is the real thing and a large amount of it.</li>
            <li> It is much better than nautica classic and pretty good for its value.</li>
            <li> I tested the Nautica Voyage in Macy&#x27;s and it smelled good and the little amount that I put on my wrist lasted for a good 6-7 hours.</li>
            <li> If you want a relative cheap, fresh and very good perfume this is the one.</li>
            <li> A very pleasant and refreshing scent for a man who likes a fragrance that is not overwhelming to his women.</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised, has a fresh, groomed and manly scent and most important doesn&#x27;t smell like my father or grandfather.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, the ladies at work all enjoy it, and the smell last all day.  </li>

            <li> I wish they could tell us how old the colognes are when we buy them, but then again that probably ain&#x27;t a good marketing strategy for them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but smells good</li>
            <li> , THAT&#x27;S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!! :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> With a refreshing smell will not bother others around you only with a good smell</li>
            <li> It has a really good smell but the biggest problem is that the smell does not even last more than an hour unless i spray myself</li>
            <li> It has a soft, &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; ( in a good way ) smell to it.  </li>
            <li> This is nowhere near as good of a product.  </li>
            <li> but after getting the bottle I have experienced what many others have experienced here on amazon where the scent is not exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it came right on time.</li>
            <li> I love mens cologne and this has a nice clean sort of smell to it while still staying masculine.</li>
            <li> and we both love the clean, fresh and light smell.</li>
            <li> And for such a great price, it was definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> It a really cool cologne for the price..something u can wear to work that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> The parfume is no to strong but is cool.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks, Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my fianc&amp;eacute;e and he absolutely loves the smell!!!</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves the scent and said he wont wear anything else now!!!</li>
            <li> It is very useful and practical.</li>
            <li> it smells very fresh.</li>
            <li> To me it seems like a very fresh aroma with an aquatic bouquet just as you&#x27;d suspect by looking at the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes in a very nice blue packing.</li>
            <li> She said it smells very fresh.</li>
            <li> Very fresh like grass/ocean kinda thing.</li>
            <li> Very fresh.</li>
            <li> very clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> Great smell and pretty cheap as far</li>
            <li> I ordered it from Amazon due to the incredible savings over getting it at the mall.  </li>
            <li> The sticker on the bottom of the bottle confirmed this - the original references the name Nautica and who produced the product.  </li>
            <li> Smells great, price is great, but doesnt last a long time.</li>
            <li> This fragance is really good, it&#x27;s for a cool gentleman who wants a fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> got many compliments for this, not so bold but neither dull, perfect mix</li>
            <li> Excellent, but the smell is so familiar there&#x27;s no way to stand out, but I suppose if you&#x27;re buying one of the most highly rated colognes on Amazon you&#x27;re not necessarily looking for a truly unique smell anyway, right?</li>
            <li> The light clean smell does not bother my sinus.</li>
            <li> Cheap cologne, a clean beachy scent, won&#x27;t turn heads but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It is super strong.</li>
            <li> Smells nice and Lasts a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Excellent, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not extreme smell, but it good.</li>
            <li> so i highly recommend it for a nice summer day/night fragrance.</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage, has a smooth scent that is not to strong, but just right for anyone to enjoy.</li>
            <li> and so did I. Fresh, clean smell and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> very fresh and clean...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has strong smell of rose to it but in a masculine way.  </li>
            <li> not too strong, but just good enough to show your identity</li>
            <li> It also stays on your clothes, though a bit mild, for about 18-24 hours making it a perfect choice for an everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleasantly surprised at choosing a scent by description and having it be very accurately described!</li>
            <li> its def something to buy especially for the AMAZING price!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such an amazing scent!</li>
            <li> If you have the extra twenty dollars, give it a try, it&#x27;s liked for a reason!</li>
            <li> Price was worth the smell!</li>
            <li> clean... masculine... nice... strong...</li>
            <li> I suppose, the best way to summarize it would be to state that the first note is enticing, the second note works perfectly with my body chemistry and third note is strong/deep as it last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> One word to describe the smell of this: Fresh!</li>
            <li> The original one from the dept store lasts for a 8-10 hrs if not more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe in love at first sight?</li>
            <li> I received a stamped bottle with the sticker on the bottom and it smells great and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> the first time i use it, its ok maybe bcoz the perfume on the pipe</li>
            <li> Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is an original.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts long.</li>
            <li> When I first bought this, the scent lasted more than a day.</li>
            <li> i get this  perfu the smell is so FRESH!</li>
            <li> Lasts long and is a great value&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> As others have stated it smells great and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I originally purchased it for my son and now my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I even told me boyfriend he has a 80% of getting laid more often ;)</li>
            <li> The first person to tell me how lovely I smelled was a friend&#x27;s girlfriend.</li>
            <li> You know that guy who walks past you wearing that awesome cologne</li>
            <li> Voyage smells fresh!</li>
            <li> boyfriend is quite pleased and says it&#x27;s \\&quot;exactly what he wanted in a cologne.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> At first not too sure...</li>
            <li> Worth the price !</li>
            <li> So as someone who rarely buys any cologne, I can say this one is definitely worth it for this cheap, and its genuine!</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell from the past.</li>
            <li> A product that does not appear to be original because the fragrance does not smell and always use that perfume</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, received in 4 days even on Super Saver shipping!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and just love the way it smells so much!</li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The cologne&#x27;s been in a warehouse, barely handled, and never seeing the light-of-day, which for products like these, is a good thing, I think.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original.</li>
            <li> great smell lasts long</li>
            <li> For the price ($12 if you buy on Amazon), it&#x27;s worth every cent!</li>
            <li> You smell fresh!</li>
            <li> Smells fresh!</li>
            <li> , I am glad I took the chance on it with out smelling it first.</li>
            <li> I would be willing to pay more to not have to keep re-upping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most everyone likes that it has a crisp, clean scent..  </li>
            <li> At first, I thought the smell would be very unique</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing and new in retail packaging.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s lasted very long and it smells great.</li>
            <li> It smells clean.  </li>
            <li> i have endured many a epic adventure riding the fumes of this magical scent.</li>
            <li> At last I can buy my favorite cologne and it arrives just in time.tried it and its amazing</li>
            <li> It has a clean smell, not musky and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> It is clean and refined.</li>
            <li> Cheap and worthy.</li>
            <li> Really clean, aquatic scent as the name states.</li>
            <li> Clean smell</li>
            <li> Clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I buy this eau de toilette on a regular basis and this is by far the best price i ever paid.</li>
            <li> The smell carries and is a clean crispy type.</li>
            <li> This scent is one of my favorites; it&#x27;s clean and inviting, but not overbearing.</li>
            <li> Fresh, light, smooth.  </li>
            <li> This is another clean smells for my boyfriend</li>
            <li> The one star that I gave was only for the nice glass bottle that was able to fool me into buying it.</li>
            <li> and he loves wearing it, but he goes through cologne so quickly and Pi isn&#x27;t cheap.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes... elegant and masculine</li>
            <li> This cologne smells co clean.  </li>
            <li> It has a soft, light smell, nothing &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; or over-bearing, which is nice for my tastes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clean, Almost soapy scent.</li>
            <li> The mild ones were either too mild or too short-lasting, and the strong ones are too overbearing.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, but overrated aquatic scent that is too common.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few as gifts for friends and family smells really good and everyone liked the Nautica</li>
            <li> He loved the smell and wears a lot for his social events.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried this scent it will likely be a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage is a very nice Perfume and stays long.</li>
            <li> I like to keep this in the car for a quick fresh clean smelling fragrance!</li>
            <li> Been using Nautica for two years, love it and get a ton of positive feedback on it.</li>
            <li> This has a wonderful fresh smell, lasts long, and is priced so reasonably.</li>
            <li> I use about 3-4 sprays right after the shower, and I can&#x27;t tell if I just get used to the smell or if it wears off after a few hours but best way to tell is if your shirt lingers the scent when you take it off</li>
            <li> I am pleased with fragrance and the bottle has a very nice heavy feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> nothing special here.</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t wear it for special occasions or nights out.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever smelled but between special occasions</li>
            <li> You guys were right!  </li>
            <li> Fragrance goes away right away!</li>
            <li> you are aware of the fabric that you&#x27;re wearing and know for sure that it is safe to spray cologne directly on it, then I would strongly suggest you do that.</li>
            <li> Its so fresh, clean, and smooth.</li>
            <li> It has a light, clean, fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume - soothing, and strong, very masculine.</li>
            <li> It is a crisp, clean fragrance that is not overpowering, which is important since I work in a \\&quot;Fragrance Free Zone\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Guys if u live Not strong, but nice great cologne this is great not only does it remind me of my home country</li>
            <li> smells good, cheap deal, but does not stay long.</li>
            <li> Sweet and sexy is how I would describe it haha.</li>
            <li> It worked out great just as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> Great product as expected</li>

            <li> Good lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the price and fast shipping from this vendor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the real deal:)</li>
            <li> Compared to Cool Water by Davidoff, it blows it away.</li>
            <li> Intially its good for couple of hours only.</li>
            <li> smell good when spray later no smell at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- cool bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t get the Cool Water similarity.</li>
            <li> Cool water isn&#x27;t sweet.</li>
            <li> Get this instead of Cool Water.</li>
            <li> Its a cool earthy smell.</li>
            <li> I love the smell:  light and not overpowering, but able to last all day.  </li>
            <li> how u smell sweet so&amp;#34</li>
            <li> such a good price i bought 2</li>
            <li> Dad loved it - solid choice.</li>
            <li> Smells like sweet pickle juice and ripened hachiya persimmon.  </li>
            <li> It smells sweet, with a snap of pickling spice(dill,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m female but loved men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> My legend grows with every spray of this sweet nectar.</li>
            <li> Light, airy, and fresh.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has such an airy, pleasant, fresh, clean, aquatic scent to it.</li>
            <li> Not too sweet or girly.</li>
            <li> only good for a couple of hours</li>
            <li> Though the smell doesn&#x27;t last a lot, it is still good.</li>
            <li> It smells just as good as the last bottle I had from Macys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I stored it in a cool place so</li>
            <li> It has such an airy, pleasant, fresh, clean, aquatic scent to it.</li>
            <li> True story.</li>
            <li> It is a good size bottle and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t blow me out of the water, but it does have a good scent that seems to last awhile.</li>
            <li> (I wouldnt say the whole day that&#x27;s for sure).</li>
            <li> ,the smell is so cool with that price, ......................</li>
            <li> /&gt;Certainly reminds me of walking on a cool beach with salt</li>
            <li> Bought mine from Amazon using prime, and while it does smell really good, it doesn&#x27;t last 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a fragrance that will offend anyone but any more than 2-3 sprays is too much.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have had several women comment that I smell good while wearing this product.  </li>
            <li> and I still love it just as much as the day I received it.</li>
            <li> feel the spritzer could be better, it doesn&#x27;t disperse very well.</li>
            <li> recommended to all guys that want a good smell for a low price</li>
            <li> I.&lt;br /&gt;It smells phenomenal very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> I bought this together with Cool Water.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and fresh and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> i love it  and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very inviting smell and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Just to make sure if it really lasted I checked how a shirt smelled a day after I wore it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it is a pretty average cologne, with a nice scent and a good durability.</li>
            <li> then the good smell vanished and a funky smell was next.</li>
            <li> This scent is light and fresh.  </li>
            <li> $20 for 3.4oz can&#x27;t really beat that anywhere for most colognes like this one.</li>
            <li> If you wear it in the morning ( specific pressure points on your body will give you the maximum effect ) and you can smell the light notes of it next morning on the clothes you wore yesterday, thats the mark of an awesome perfume.</li>
            <li> This is a quality fragrance that smells fresh and light.  </li>
            <li> They are somewhat sweet and floral.</li>
            <li> I like - L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey by Issey Miyake, Chrome by Azzaro, Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani, Cool Water by Davidoff, CK One , CK</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells good, but somewhat of a generic smell...</li>
            <li> I wore this for more than a year straight every day.</li>
            <li> Smells good and last for hours&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> By the way, the color of the bottle is cool.</li>
            <li> thank you nautica for making my midnight dreams come true.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t last all day but still lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Good for the daily use.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this same perfume for years and it has always been good.</li>
            <li> What I love so much about this fragrance is its longevity.  </li>
            <li> I find, like most aquatic fragrances it is best appreciated during the late spring/summer seasons.  </li>
            <li> Good fragrance, the price is similar to what you would find in your neighborhood department store / fragrance store (despite the comps posted on the listing).</li>
            <li> A good add to any collection, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Big bottle, so good value.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good for the entire day.</li>
            <li> I have some fragrances that cost six times as much as Nautica Voyage that have not gotten me nearly as many compliments.  </li>
            <li> Of couse the smell fades a bit by the end of the day, but it has lasted much longer than others I paid more for</li>
            <li> Good staying power with 4-5 sprays, can still smell it the next day.</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> it smells really cool.</li>
            <li> The smell is really good, but it merely last like an hour or so.</li>
            <li> so the bottle should last a good while.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but it&#x27;s just too overpowering to my senses.</li>
            <li> Not bad product</li>
            <li> Very large bottle too!</li>
            <li> went fully by reviews and ratings, never smelled or heard of it, love the smell and last all day easily!</li>
            <li> I really love this fragrance, it&#x27;s not too strong or too soft</li>
            <li> But the smell is not so strong as when I first put it on.</li>
            <li> Great clean scent that remains pleasing, calming and crisp after a long day.</li>
            <li> first time use you will get hit by the strong smell.</li>
            <li> The scent does provide a nice fresh clean smell, although the projection is a 0/10...this is a soft skin scent...</li>
            <li> Smell is sweet and mild.</li>
            <li> the smell is still there and almost as strong as it was when I first applied it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not as strong when you first sprayed it.</li>
            <li> This is a very easy to wear cologne and with the performance to back it up at such a great price.</li>
            <li> But, I went with the star rating of other reviewers, hoping that I had stumbled upon a great find on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Amazing great long lasting scent</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a good scent, true to the franchise, if you are a Nautica enthusiast, i recommend it!</li>
            <li> I was using Cool Water for many years but this by far beats it!!</li>
            <li> Fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> Fresh clean scent.</li>
            <li> If you like fresh and clean fragrances this one is for you.</li>
            <li> Scent is SO FRESH and CLEAN.</li>
            <li> Voyage has a fresh and clean smell.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, this had been the best thing from Nautica i have ever bought.</li>
            <li> a go to for a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> If you need a clean, fresh, breezey cologne to wear all day, this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> love it and for less than $20 i get more compliments than with most $100 brands</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell clean and fresh at all.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean scent reminds me of breezy spring/ summer sunny days.</li>
            <li> Arrive quickly.</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, super cologne.</li>
            <li> Quick and timely delivery of product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a SUPER price</li>
            <li> I like it and the price was super affordable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Super Mario of colognes.  </li>
            <li> The fragrance is somewhat mild.</li>
            <li> ademas la entrega es super rapida del mismo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smell ok but like the nautica blue better</li>
            <li> she quickly identified the imposter.</li>
            <li> SHIPPING WAS QUICK..</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I was so lucky to find this on Amazon;</li>
            <li> Quick ship.</li>
            <li> a super smelly guy spray it on your clothes a day before you wear it.</li>
            <li> and I got it really quickly</li>
            <li> I can get like a quick sniff of it</li>
            <li> Quick delivery meets req...</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t understand why it expired so quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this scent but it does not last more than an hour.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a decent smelling spray and for under 20 bucks a worthwhile purchase.</li>
            <li> and you hope dissipates quickly before you start choking on its intruding head.</li>
            <li> but with how quickly this fades</li>
            <li> however the only thing which i dont really like about this is that the projection/longevity on this thing is not that great at all until</li>
            <li> And maybe a spray on the front of your underwear if you&#x27;re feeling lucky.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it begins to wear off quickly after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;dont</li>
            <li> Anyone who wants a good smelling cologne that is not too strong and also affordable should definitely check this one out.</li>
            <li> I ordered this from fragrancenet because the one with super saver shipping wouldn&#x27;t ship to my address</li>
            <li> Luckily I found this on here.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing more to me than a decent knockoff.  </li>
            <li> Its super long-lasting.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts pretty long</li>
            <li> Shipping is really quick as well.</li>
            <li> ordered 1 more for future use..  :)&lt;</li>
            <li> Came quick and and it&#x27;s legit.</li>
            <li> I like a cologne that lasts a good long while, even if it&#x27;s a bit strong at first.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a generous amount and shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> and I got my refund quickly.</li>
            <li> It was really quick..</li>
            <li> I get quickly after I made my order.</li>
            <li> and it was delivered really quick</li>
            <li> But it disappears quickly after about 2~3 hours.</li>
            <li> But i was lucky to purchase this one.</li>
            <li> The scent is very masculine, clean, and refreshing- increases after dancing or sweating at the gym.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing, unlike most colognes that are over powering, this is just the right hint and lasts long!</li>
            <li> Clean, crisp and fresh!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and smooth transaction.  </li>
            <li> P. Again a must buy no regrets smells amazing</li>
            <li> last time i had a bottle was 2007 &amp; only buying it now since my all time favorite Gucci Envy is discontiued &amp; cost $300 for 3.4oz lol</li>
            <li> Fresh masculine fragrance that’s light and not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Friday and received it on Monday, very fast!</li>
            <li> A light, masculine scent perfect for everyday.  </li>
            <li> In the future I will probably buy this more as a gift this worth my money :)</li>
            <li> If you are wondering to go with Nautica Blue or Nautica Voyage, Let me tell you, Voyage is by far superior!</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like a cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> It has a unique masculine scent that will leave your wife wanting you more.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a light, clean scented cologne, which is strong, but certainly far from overpowering.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and lasts long</li>
            <li> The cool, fresh and manly aroma is not at all overpowering.</li>
            <li> smile sweet</li>
            <li> Has a slightly sweet fresh smell.</li>
            <li> It is a straight-up fresh aquatic fragrance, but it has some cool twists that others do not have.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crisp, clean and sweet without it being nauseating...</li>
            <li> Great product, my second time buying this particular cologne.</li>
            <li> I read in another review that this was light enough to be worn at a multitude of occasions, Which is nice because what you wear on a Saturday night isn&#x27;t always right for work as well and some dudes struggle with that.</li>
            <li> Not so grate for special occasions but overall a nice cologne .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very fresh and clean smelling, and is really genderless.</li>
            <li> My new favorite...</li>
            <li> My new Favorite.</li>
            <li> This is his new favorite scent..</li>
            <li> The new one I just bought sprays better.</li>
            <li> It has in fact become my husband&#x27;s new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> My new favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> The price I paid online for the Nautica Voyage is half of that Kohl&#x27;s, this a great deal</li>
            <li> Lol my wife want let me ware it less</li>
            <li> got it for less than 15 and what can i say always a great deal here</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, I put one spray on my wrist and it does last for awhile.</li>
            <li> Long lasting smell, and in my opinion, one of the best scents on the market!</li>
            <li> Just a nice fresh clean simple scent.</li>
            <li> Recommended for those who are not too much for the strong macho scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since the cologne is quite strong when first sprayed on, you can&#x27;t really spray that much or it would be overwhelming.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very relaxing and easy on the nose.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, masculine, and not to overwhelming</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent and an excellent price!</li>
            <li> Perfect to brighten-up your spirits and lasts long enough.</li>
            <li> Lasts along time and has a mild fresh smell to it.</li>
            <li> it really doesnt its just that its not so strong.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell, it actually last long for a cheaper cologne, I like to mix colognes to amplify the smells, but this one alone is very good,</li>
            <li> Watching the huge number of positive reviews, I ordered this perfume.</li>
            <li> Love it, long lasting and smells great.</li>
            <li> only thing I would add is that buyers should be aware that cologne is made of chemicals and can change it&#x27;s scent when exposed to warm temperatures and light.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s the real thing!!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product to say the least!</li>
            <li> Some of the much more expensive colognes such as ralph polo and especially my favorite Acqua di gio are slightly better but for this price its easily worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> It is delivered on the promise delivery date and just in time for my last spray on the one on hand, I always grab two bottles of this for it is much more convenient and cheaper!</li>
            <li> EXTREMELY FAST shipping!!</li>
            <li> Lasts for 2 hours then kinda fades but it&#x27;s still there for the whole day!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon!!</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle, and have two more stocked up!</li>
            <li> I bet even Obama can attract lots of hot girls with this!</li>
            <li> In this case(fake), only from the top or bottom (for easy repackage of return items or demos).</li>
            <li> fragrance like this should go easily for more in in the mid $40&#x27;s range.</li>
            <li> It is a crisp, clean, linen smell but just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t believe other comments, but this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice long lasting scent, and many take notice of this product.</li>
            <li> The one that I loved had a single piece plastic cap, and the smell was VERY nice and lasted (strongly) all day, and several days following until the shirt was washed.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very popular, Amazaon had it at half the price of retail stores.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and crisp almost like cucumbers and ocean waves!</li>
            <li> will purchase again but with the size of the bottle and how little I need to smell great</li>
            <li> This cologne is cheap, smells amazing and lasts a very long time!</li>
            <li> I usually have high dollar smells, but this one is awesome for the price.  </li>
            <li> I was an avid wearer in my high school years and have been through many fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Smells great a little bit after its used, but definitely lasts the whole day and is a good scent for the money.</li>
            <li> However this is a few steps up from Cool Water and is a much longer lasting fresh clean scent that any guy would appreciate as it goes all day and does attract the compliments that you get from time to time wearing a good cologne and with Amazon you can always guarantee timely delivery and good prices.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is so cheap on here, but it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> But with the amazing longevity, it can even last in the winter.</li>
            <li> It also comes in a heavy duty , attractive glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Not one of those cheap knockoffs, this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Great value and with everyday use this bottle lasts me about a year.</li>
            <li> With such a economical price, the fragrance is truly amazing.</li>
            <li> They do not smell the same, but they both smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Still price was low to my surprise as it was about 50% off almost which is amazing.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing with just one simple spray.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great everyday perfume, especially during the summer, but it&#x27;s amazing all around.</li>
            <li> Feels fresh.</li>
            <li> Drives the ladies wild :-)</li>
            <li> and of course FRESH.</li>
            <li> Good aquatic fragrance, not very expensive...can be worn day &amp; night  all through spring and summer.</li>
            <li> Its fresh and lavenderish.</li>
            <li> My favorite by far.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells fresh.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s totally worth the price in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> definitely worth the buy for any guy</li>
            <li> This one is different but a nice change.</li>
            <li> I had to spray it 3 or four times to get any distinct scent.</li>
            <li> Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Naturally, the hotter it gets the more beastly it&#x27;ll be.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This scent is not overpowering and has a nice &amp;#34;day later scent&amp;#34; too.</li>
            <li> If you like a citrusy cologne, light ,  not heavy, and lasts and smells good the next day on your body or clothes----but never tried it yet, trust me!</li>
            <li> This is a very item to purchase if you come to a party, going on a date, or traveling the smell is good and lasted until the next day.</li>
            <li> So if you want to smell fresh but not</li>
            <li> fresh scent, one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> money is worth.</li>
            <li> inexpensive but smells fresh and beachy</li>
            <li> I figured it was worth a shot and ordered 2 bottles.  </li>
            <li> Voyage gives you a fresh feeling.</li>
            <li> Nice bottle, blue colored liquid, but no fragrance.</li>
            <li> Like it!&lt;br /&gt;Its fragrance is ok.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts longer and worth the amount paid for it.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and woody.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t smell it after 15 minutes but people still seem to notice it hours later.</li>
            <li> worth the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Sophisticated manly classy smell.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fresh.</li>
            <li> Fresh.  </li>
            <li> Was not really crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne so far.</li>
            <li> and I got to say it was worth the 16 buck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> overall a nice cologne.</li>
            <li> It is a cool crisp summer scent</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the fragrance on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This is my most complimented cologne by far.</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this item its smelled good for about 5 second</li>
            <li> It has a fresh summery scent.</li>
            <li> It stinks real good!  :-)  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> but I think for the price, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li> reviews that mostly ships directly from Amazon be a knockoff.  </li>
            <li> The cologne smells extremely fresh and aquatic and lasted all the way through the day without issue.  </li>
            <li> I was actually able to smell it clearly on my shirt at the end of the day.  </li>
            <li> It unfortunately is worth</li>
            <li> I was looking for something citrusy and fresh but this just turned out to be overpowering.</li>
            <li> All I can say is that it smells nice, and lasts for several hours after it&#x27;s applied.  </li>
            <li> I believe but the kind in the stores last a lot longer</li>
            <li> It is a mellow fresh scent.</li>
            <li> so you have to be careful with the amount you use per spray if you want to use more than a spray or two as it is potent.</li>
            <li> I prefer much cheaper GAP perfume since it is much better and lasts much longer than this one.</li>
            <li> ; fragrance, Nautica Voyage is easily worth the 20 dollars</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, stays on for an entire day without problem!</li>
            <li> , it just has that just hoped out of the shower fresh feeling.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a blind-buy.</li>
            <li> Fresh shower smell.</li>
            <li> but I where it to work at FedEx to keep me smelling fresh</li>
            <li> Turns out that I personally dislike it; and all the favorable reviews at Amazon won&#x27;t change what my own sense of smell tells me.  </li>
            <li> The scent is light but noticable, pretty crisp and pleasent.</li>
            <li> So its rare I find one I can tolerate on me.</li>
            <li> Worth the 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> Light, crisp scent may ware off a little too quickly but otherwise it smells good</li>
            <li> Its very fresh and very comforting to women.</li>
            <li> It goes on great and dry down is amazing.</li>
            <li> After months of use, and many positive comments i believe its real, and not fake.</li>
            <li> Is it smooth but not weak.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to a friend, it&#x27;s a very cool fragrance suitable for office and for any other time.</li>
            <li> i was convince right the way that this perfume got something really powerful you can&#x27;t even suspect!!!!guys tha one is for you</li>
            <li> I thought at the price it was worth the risk right?</li>
            <li> A very nice heavy weight bottle too.</li>
            <li> Very clean and soft smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> After buying the first which I had planned on keeping at work, I loved it so much I immediately purchased a second for home.</li>
            <li> i will buy it again before the other bottle finishes smells that good</li>
            <li> This scent is long lasting and smells very good.</li>
            <li> This one - Nautica Voyage, however was one perfume that I felt was just right.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s priced right.  </li>
            <li> Boy was I right.  </li>
            <li> Works well for a right out of the shower scent, gym or activity scent.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m stuck with it which I don&#x27;t believe is right because the product is DEFECTIVE.</li>
            <li> I just did to you right now :</li>
            <li> it right here on amazon.com</li>
            <li> So, I did my research and stumbled upon Nautica Voyager right here on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Well I can say they were right</li>
            <li> just right.</li>
            <li> It is just the right size.</li>
            <li> It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li> I ended up selling it right when I got it because it is nothing like Island Voyage</li>
            <li> Get alot of positive comments on this one!</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent, and decent projection.</li>
            <li> but it does have a clean smell that my wife really likes.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t exactly have the most masculine smell to it but</li>
            <li> It really smells like a Clean shower in a bottle.</li>
            <li> In a nutshell &amp;#34;Nautica Voyage&amp;#34; is a decent scent for going to work, church, or on a  cheap date.  </li>
            <li> I think the scent is good, and it&#x27;s the real deal, a quality product, though the scent does not stick around on me for too long.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very nice (not strong and over bearing).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong scents...</li>
            <li> It is somewhat strong (I have a very sensitive sense of smell)</li>
            <li> not very special as I thought would it be, but, for the money you pay is good perfurm.</li>
            <li> I am ordering one more possibly two simply due to the price and the successful delivery of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> The scent lasts for a very long time and it makes him smell extremely sexy!</li>
            <li> glad I did as it&#x27;s the same cool, crisp, fresh fragrance that can work anywhere, anytime.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant smell that&#x27;s strong enough to be smelled from a few feet away, but not so strong that it kicks you in the nose and demands, \\&quot;SMELL ME!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This cologne is very inexpensive making a good choice for any one that enjoys a refreshing smell that is not to overbearing as some of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> This smell is pure bliss mixed with sexual delights!</li>
            <li> Really fresh, young, cool and clean.</li>
            <li> but, this is surprisingly a great clean and long lasting smell.</li>
            <li> It smells like nothing special, and it&#x27;s honestly very overpowering.</li>
            <li> Brilliant Smell, but does not last very long</li>
            <li> For less than $20, this is possibly the best cologne you can get at the price.</li>
            <li> Although, it won&#x27;t replace Lucky as my favorite daily cologne</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, crisp scent that stands out and does not wear off.</li>
            <li> Great smell but has a tendency to go overboard.</li>
            <li> Great smell for the small price.</li>
            <li> This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product.</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s even more amazing is the longevity, it last for the entire day 12-24 hours</li>
            <li> A goody for cheap its a fresh scent ocean smell with fresh summer notes for any age  not heavy at all</li>
            <li> have used 10 different brands in last 5 years and this is the one I liked the most.</li>
            <li> I would&#x27;t buy this if you are a true fan of the real cologne.</li>
            <li> Smells like a fresh ocean breeze coming over a field of very manly flowers!</li>
            <li> Whether this is your first cologne or you have been wearing it for years this is definitely worth a shot and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> if completely fulfilled my expectations, and I go back to place another order for future purchases with these excellent merchandise</li>
            <li> is really good , but i think this is fake , the smell stay for 1 hour top!</li>
            <li> I recommend this perfume has good aroma, the smell remains until the next day , shipping was fast grateful thanks for everything</li>
            <li> Very light fresh  smell but not not close to Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed it on, I got the strong chemical scent, which is normal at first.</li>
            <li> My husband really wanted this cologne and the POLO Red, and they were both pretty pricey!!!!  </li>
            <li> For me, it has been hard to find something that is mild, pleasant, long-lasting and yet economical.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product, but I have gotten better compliments using other brands.</li>
            <li> Nice Packaging, I unboxed and then put a little on my hands, smell fresh and clean not too strong but sober instead</li>
            <li> great cologne, especially considering it&#x27;s low price.</li>
            <li> I do admit that the third day of wearing it I got the mysterious cat urine smell that some people on basenotes talked about (LOL).</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD... JUST NOT VERY STRONG</li>
            <li> Its a refreshing floral fruit sent, a great casual blend for summer or spring days.</li>
            <li> To sum up everyone elses comments: great lasting scent for a low price.</li>
            <li> This is 100% real, smells amazing, and I sprayed a very tiny bit on my arm just to test it out 5 hours ago..</li>
            <li> if some like not very strong perfume good for them.</li>
            <li> Product as well as the service were both great and will definitely look forward to being a future customer.</li>
            <li> Good for less than $15.</li>
            <li> This perfurm has a wonderful smell, I use it everyday and everyone like it, especially me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clean and fresh and very masculine.  </li>
            <li> Simply the best in fragrance neither strong nor too weak.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, Voyage has lasting power no less excellent than the more expensive ones, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> does not long even more than an Hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has a mixed scent of smelling really good, with a tiny hint of it smelling sweet, but not over powering.</li>
            <li> It has a clean smell, with strong notes of green apple, and reminds me of something similar to clean laundry on a warm spring day.</li>
            <li> It has an amazing fastener (since it&#x27;s a true EDT) and you will smell like this (albeit with less potency) throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re on a tight budget in the fragrance department, but you still want to smell good, this is it.</li>
            <li> Maybe this is my fault for buying it when it was on sale but the smell faded away very fast.</li>
            <li> It is also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> I got very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I like this product very much</li>
            <li> Price is very reasonable too.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it very much.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne very much.</li>
            <li> It is that good - not overpowering, but fresh and clean - subtle.</li>
            <li> S/H charges were reasonable and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> I had never smelled the scent before and was a little scared but bought it anyways because of all the good reviews I read.</li>
            <li> but it turns out to be good but not unique at all.  </li>
            <li> a nice low key fresh smell my new favorite.</li>
            <li> The bottle came in its original package and was brand new.  </li>
            <li> Fresh, clean and still masculine.</li>
            <li> is moderate , neither too mild, nor too strong..</li>
            <li> Far better than the classic.</li>
            <li> a snap.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is calm, not too strong and not too mild, not professional but</li>
            <li> 16 year old sophomore and ALL THE LADIES LOVE IT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> With so many high reviews that this product got, I completely ignored the handful of them that warned of theories that it may be a tampered with product.  </li>
            <li> While its first tone elicits the most compliments, its later tones towards the end of the day gets girls that hug me to linger just a little bit longer and say how good i smell.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell that is a decent value, would compare the smell to other clean/water/shower/fresh scent sprays.</li>
            <li> However, this fragrance does not smell cheap in any regard and holds an integrity that is very clean and sharp.</li>
            <li> My first reaction upon smelling this the first time was...</li>
            <li> Also, make sure you get the 3.4 once because it is actually cheaper then the 1.7!</li>
            <li> At first, I was putting it on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for about 4 years now and still get compliments consistently from people all of the time.</li>
            <li> Scent on this perfume is pretty...</li>
            <li> My first day wearing the Nautica Voyage I received compliments.  </li>
            <li> at first I didn&#x27;t like the scent</li>
            <li> Girls get in close and want to smell it  ;)  </li>
            <li> One to three sprays of this scent, and you&#x27;ll be able to smell it the next day.</li>
            <li> I have this in my car for emergencies ;-)</li>
            <li> It does not last for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> , the notes and actual smell of the fragrance is stunning.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh,mild to strong,cool,and crisp.</li>
            <li> i actually have 3 bottles of this cologne among others but definetly my favorite.</li>
            <li> at first I would catch myself getting a whiff of it when Im doing something else and going</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed having elegant and manly perfume, but I usually dislike the big punch associated with most of them.</li>
            <li> Better than Nautica Blue</li>
            <li> and I really like that stuff too!</li>
            <li> It smells terrific w/o being overwhelming.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great....or at least it did smell great.  </li>
            <li> When I first got it, I used it every day.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not much of a cologne wearer to be honest.  </li>
            <li> i have received today Nautica Voyage , after my first use i ordered another nautica voyage .</li>
            <li> As described, thanks!</li>
            <li> And the best part is finding it for such a small price</li>
            <li> I much prefer Curve Wave by Liz Claiborne for a fresh spring/summer scent.  </li>
            <li> Makes my mouth water when I smell it ; )</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it, this hot girl at work started talking to me</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d say try it out first if you&#x27;re into those kinds of aquatic scents.</li>
            <li> When it first came out, it was 50 dollars at the men&#x27;s cologne counter in department store.</li>
            <li> crisp and succulent, boy i loves me some nautica</li>
            <li> First I would like to say that I swear by this fragrance.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not fake</li>
            <li> I was concerned that this was going to be only ok since it wasn&#x27;t an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this smell being a male, I wish I could bathe in it</li>
            <li> I recommend you buy from amazon only because, I received the Authentic one from them.</li>
            <li> Give your woman one of your shirts to wear, it&#x27;s guaranteed to smell like Voyage weeks later, regardless of how many times you wash it.</li>
            <li> But it misses the most essential quality of a men&#x27;s perfume: duration of fragrance.</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t give a second try.</li>
            <li> I was reading the reviews before buying and say many people that got fakes, so i became worried before buying but decided to get it anyways thinking the chances were low.</li>
            <li> The scent last all day with many complements.</li>
            <li> ;)  </li>
            <li> Seems everyone loves this stuff ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first cologne i&#x27;ve ever bought after searching online for an inexpensive fragrance for men.</li>
            <li> so thats why i would put this on my top ten</li>
            <li> Funny, isn&#x27;t it....</li>
            <li> When women in your vicinity randomly say some one smells delicious</li>
            <li> First time buying online</li>
            <li> My wife, who is much younger than I, love it.</li>
            <li> Great scent long lasting.</li>
            <li> I love this product, as this is my second time ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have always been an avid cologne consumer.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time i&#x27;ve ordered and used it.</li>
            <li> lecture.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal if you want to wear a cologne that makes it seem like you&#x27;re not even wearing a cologne !</li>
            <li> After the first spray I realized--this smells like men&#x27;s cologne.</li>
            <li> On my understand  this type of fragance is for a hot weather &amp;#34;hot days&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have received many compliments and definitely recommend this scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was the first time I have purchased this cologne</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day too, my girlfriend loves it ;)</li>
            <li> This was my first gift for my fiance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really noticed that girls get closer to me, just so that they can smell me!</li>
            <li> ALMOST PURCHASED IN STORE FOR MUCH HIGHER PRICE.</li>
            <li> very affordable!</li>
            <li> If you havent smelled it, it smells exactly like Curve.</li>
            <li> It does not last for more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Though it last through out the day but please do not smell like this, your anti-perspirant and deodorant should smell classier and better.</li>
            <li> Got compliments from people not really associated with these kind of responses.  </li>
            <li> First time purchased from amazon.  </li>
            <li> The bottle size is 3.4 Oz which I believe last for more than a year.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> first i got mine from deals breaker 100% legit so no problem there.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The first time i have the Nautica pefumer.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this - I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Long lasting and great smelling, that&#x27;s all you can ask for.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to take the chance, then go ahead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> smells great and the smell is also long lasting, girls will give you compliments ,and guys will be asking you what product you use</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed having elegant and manly perfume, but I usually dislike the big punch associated with most of them.</li>
            <li> Smells ok but does not last</li>
            <li> and nautica blue is better in my opinion</li>
            <li> is certainly better than Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li> It feels a lot more \\&quot;real\\&quot; than blue did.</li>
            <li> but it is a worthwhile upgrade to Nautica blue.</li>
            <li> I first smelled it on a co-worker at work and after about a month of smelling it as he walked by, I had to ask him what it was.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> I tested several fragrances at Herberger&#x27;s one day, this was the one I fell in love with, won&#x27;t buy anything</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly.</li>
            <li> The first night I tried this cologne</li>
            <li> Some compliments were when I had first spray it</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Fast Delivery!</li>
            <li> this is the exact product that comes out of a store.</li>
            <li> Just got shipment price was great was not sure if it was not the real nautica</li>
            <li> thanks!</li>
            <li> Well not only was I pleased with the aroma but also the staying power of the cologne.</li>
            <li> Women were commenting on it the first night I wore it</li>
            <li> You will be moving around hours later and still catch scents of voyage clinging to you and working its magic.</li>
            <li> only gripe is that there is a sour/green apple smell thrown in, making it sometimes smell more fruity than &amp;#34;clean/fresh&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> and you are ready to go!  </li>
            <li> , I really liked the lotion, what I expected.</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite colognes for a long time I get constant compliments on how great I smell daily!!!</li>
            <li> The package also came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> It is the real deal!</li>
            <li> Not fake.</li>
            <li> It looks exactly like what came in the mail.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I ordered.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be certain that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Nautica or not, but the price is right.</li>
            <li> The panties just fall off the women when i wear this cologne ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this cologne is the duration.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, not over powering and feels fresh.</li>
            <li> so Amazon&#x27;s deal is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> I remember when I first started wearing it, I always got compliments.</li>
            <li> I constantly get commented from the ladies, saying they love the way I smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it smells generic like most</li>
            <li> Everyone that has smelled it has told me its smells really good, and a few of my friends have asked where I got it.</li>
            <li> Lasts a good bit of time and even works under heavy loads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say that for this price, it&#x27;s a damned good everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> Also, when I spray it on my body it takes a few hours to start smelling good.  </li>
            <li> Gives me the confidence that comes from knowing that you are smelling good all day through that comes with a few sprays of Nautica Voyage in the morning or evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cologne is a perfect casual summer cologne.</li>
            <li> but I think that it is best suited for office wear or casual day wear.</li>
            <li> I just got a fake one, to good to be true!!</li>
            <li> It has a very nice smell, particularly, I use it for everyday.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it to be a little more strong charactered.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a unique long lasting odour and is very good for daily use.</li>
            <li> Its a nice masculine scent not too harsh n very mild with scent ov fresh waters.</li>
            <li> High quality cologne at a super price, what&#x27;s not to like.</li>
            <li> This smells really good and is quite a bit less than you can find it  in the stores!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long though is great for college students.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t regret my purchase at all...describing scents is nearly impossible for me, but I will say that this is light and would be best used in summer.  </li>
            <li> Very nice scent on this one and long lasting.</li>
            <li> The scent is very nice and long lasting.</li>
            <li> but it definitely has a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; scent that I&#x27;m almost positive anyone would love.</li>
            <li> Definitely a young, fresh, clean scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering but is very long-lasting.</li>
            <li> The price was discounted, so I can&#x27;t say I would buy it at full price, though, and I&#x27;m sure to move on to other fragrances/brands until I find a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> The scent is mildly strong and you just can&#x27;t bare, but to smell this fragrance over and over again.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s a fake, but it still smells pretty good</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok not so strong and no long lasting.</li>
            <li> Sharp note just kind of stings the nose.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the cologne smelled nice.</li>
            <li> This one from amazon is noticeably lighter smell to it, and though it pretty much smells the same in terms of the scent, to me the bottle from amazon has a slightly more alcohol smell to it.</li>
            <li> It has a warm smell- not too sharp but still pronounced.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and by far one of my new favorites but it sure doesn&#x27;t long as everyone promotes in here.</li>
            <li> Cologne has nice clean smell to it but would not recommend purchase as it is a VERY heavy cologne.</li>
            <li> am very thankful to have found FragranceNet now that is a great company, not only did they send me a new item they sent a lot of free stuff like samples of other fragrances and a pocket mirror.</li>
            <li> Overall, its a very sweet scent, and very masculine for a sweet scent too.</li>
            <li> , too bad was a great value for a nice scent.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;d like a summer scent that reminds you of sailing on bright blue waters then definitely give Nautica a try...</li>
            <li> I spray it in the toilet after I take a dump, because it smells slightly better than feces.  </li>
            <li> As the middle class keep the economic momentum with that zeal, which is quality and progressive economic goals, nautica voyage plays it part by alienating the young self confident with the old and more experienced.</li>
            <li> like it, not aggressive, soft and nice for daily use</li>
            <li> Bought this cause a relative gave me one as a present and loved it, so I bought another</li>
            <li> Both smell good, but there&#x27;s an obvious inconsistency in final product.</li>
            <li> This one definitely hits the mark of \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; but it can also be worn with an elegant suit and not throw it off too much.</li>
            <li> I expected it to be more powerful</li>
            <li> Smells good but only last 1 hour.</li>
            <li> the smell is perfect, fresh unlike other Eau De Toilette that gives headache not only to me but to others as well and furthermore not many eau de toilets that I can wear when I just want to smell great without advertising to others in a very loud, noticeable or not needed way especially when working out in sports clubs.</li>
            <li> Good for everyday use, does not last for long, but for the money you put in, definitively a good purchase.</li>
            <li> This has definitely been satisfying and smooth, and I instantly got a compliment at how I smelled the first time I used this perfume when hanging out with a friend (girl).</li>
            <li> not as long lasting as stated but good a good everyday scent.</li>
            <li> This has definitely been satisfying and smooth, and I instantly got a compliment at how I smelled the first time I used this perfume when hanging out with a friend (girl).</li>
            <li> From there, I can&#x27;t really review any further because you don&#x27;t now me and what you think smells good is pretty much a personal preference issue.</li>
            <li> this is a very light clean everyday fragrance.</li>
            <li> and I can still smell it - not as strong as when he first puts it on, but it&#x27;s definitely there.</li>
            <li> I went to buy it because of its positive review</li>
            <li> If you havent figured that one out as yet, all the positive reviews should tell you so.</li>
            <li> I was using Polo Sport for a long time, if you love Polo sport, you will like this.</li>
            <li> I use about 3-4 sprays in the morning but by midday, it&#x27;s pretty much gone.</li>
            <li> First of all, very well packaged.</li>
            <li> but I really need to smell it first before I buy.</li>
            <li> and I was not expecting it to be as great as it is based on the price, but decided to test due to the low cost.  </li>
            <li> Definately the real deal not a fake.</li>
            <li> The item arrived in a few days and I was very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time on me (most of the day).</li>
            <li> the smell lasts for a long time and it makes me wanna jump on top of my husband .</li>
            <li> This is the real deal not a fake.</li>
            <li> the good ones usually cost a lot.</li>
            <li> By the way, I&#x27;m 22 years old, just in case you&#x27;re wondering if this is old man cologne, it most definitely isn&#x27;t haha.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge cologne aficionado but this is the most accessible and best-smelling</li>
            <li> The pump action on the spray bottle has stopped working.now I am stuck with a full bottle of cologne and no way to use it.</li>
            <li> Very nice subtle scent.</li>
            <li> Last all day and smells clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> Is a great perfume, not so strong and no so weak, sweet and fruitsy, it last on my skin about 4 hours more or less.</li>
            <li> Wanted to write this review because this definitely has too many high reviews for the smell.</li>
            <li> Delivered it on time to my friend in US, yesterday I got if and the smell is very unique out of this world, it does not stay that long</li>
            <li> but most comments were when it was later in the night when most other colognes had worn off.</li>
            <li> Price for a very decent product.</li>
            <li> Light, crisp and last all day.</li>
            <li> Easy to open box.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> And while that still is my favorite cologne, my bottle ran dry about a week ago.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know those hot girls that give out free samples of Red Bulls??</li>
            <li> A perfume does not have to be always strong enough to leave an impression.</li>
            <li> Despite all the marketing, cool water is actually more &#x27;green&#x27; than aquatic to me.</li>
            <li> it smells good last long</li>
            <li> Smells good but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> The product is legit , smell good and long lasting.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as a signature scent but more of an everyday use for work, gym, etc which lasts like the full day.</li>
            <li> It smells so good and last long too.</li>
            <li> I put on 3 sprays and it lasted for hours smelling the same and just as strong.</li>
            <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> but it isnt strong enough.</li>
            <li> Nautica Blue is very good too, but the scent isn&#x27;t long lasting.</li>
            <li> but once again I was proven wrong worth every penny and the fragrance easily competes with top shelf cologne!</li>
            <li> You need to apply this perfume in large quantities for it to stay on.</li>
            <li> or so that you&#x27;d spend to buy a large bottle.</li>
            <li> I will certainly be buying this or another cologne from the seller.</li>
            <li> I will be surprise, I went on and get this cologne just by pure reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try this perfume, I really hope it&#x27;s just the way described in the positive comments I have heard from the&lt;br</li>
            <li> I Highly recommend this cologne if you want to smell amazing and receive endless compliments/</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Sometimes he actually claims to get more miles per gallon because his stress levels go down from the smell and help him cruise through the air better.</li>
            <li> Well you will when you get this cologne and spray it on for the first time and many other times to come</li>
            <li> It is a Pretty nice perfume with nice fragrance, I used it everyday and smell does last for entire day.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite when it first came on the market almost 10 years ago, but haven&#x27;t used it in quite some time while cycling through other scents.</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments about this fragrance on a daily basis… it drives the women wild!</li>
            <li> but I guess with the price like that my expectation should not be very high.</li>
            <li> I really hope amazon doesn&#x27;t stop carrying this clogne anytime soon because I definitely will be back to order more!</li>
            <li> The real cologne is very good - this stuff they sell on Amazon is fake.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s not too strong like other brands and the smell is simple.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and having bought this cologne several times from multiple places, you can&#x27;t beat this price!</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it to any cologne connisuer!</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>

            <li> Seems to smell real</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up really liking the smell.  </li>
            <li> Thanks from Vzla</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves the smell of it.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance&lt;</li>
            <li> I was drawn to Nautica Voyage, but the salesperson said it was cheap and wouldn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> According to others, the scent is long-lasting, but not too intense.  </li>
            <li> its very sexxyyy</li>
            <li> Thanks....</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very ligt effect.</li>
            <li> It shipped really fast too, thanks.</li>
            <li> so this makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> and he really likes it too.  </li>
            <li> And with the price, you really can&#x27;t get any</li>
            <li> It is not of a quality to be really called an eau de toilette or</li>
            <li> Thanks so much 😁</li>
            <li> Defiantly more than what I expected..</li>
            <li> Gave as gift which was appreciated.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I would absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li> it really</li>
            <li> i got mine from SavingsClub and it appears to be real.</li>
            <li> Got it fast w/ Prime...</li>
            <li> got complimented more than i expected</li>
            <li> A genuine Nautica will have a Nautica sticker on it (it will say &#x27;Nautica Voyage&#x27; in big letters).  </li>
            <li> This is a really inexpensive cologne I was not expecting it to smell</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The bottle looks like its real</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I am very choosy when it comes to scents/aromas that I wear.  </li>
            <li> The stuff doesn&#x27;t like the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> Seller sent items really fast.</li>
            <li> The price was extremely reasonable, so I was worried.</li>
            <li> really don&#x27;t know how to review a cologne.</li>
            <li> Cologne is one if those things you really just have to try.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cost much here on amazon</li>
            <li> Men get ready to set sail, with the freshest smelling invigorating cologne by Nautica.</li>
            <li> was more than I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The one that I got said &amp;#34;Coty&amp;#34; on it, plus when I opened the package it smelled very moldy, I even washed the bottle with soap to get rid of it(probably had moisture in the box before it was wrapped at the factory).  </li>
            <li> Reliable, fast, quality products...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Women drools on me(kidding) but really, they keep asking me about my cologne</li>
            <li> Real men stuff</li>
            <li> Sarcasm aside I really like the cologne.</li>
            <li> you could spray a bunch on you if you really wanted to</li>
            <li> thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li> but it dies away too fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping every time.</li>
            <li> When I purchase it at a store it lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li> And I imagine as much as you want, because no one I encountered found it overpowering, no matter if pumped on one spray, or six.</li>
            <li> I did and I got the real one.</li>
            <li> Just buy it from amazon for the real deal</li>
            <li> I got another from Macy&#x27;s it lasts a whole day.</li>
            <li> Where you spray it (side of neck, chest, on clothes, on skin), how much you put on (one spray or 3), when you put it on (after a shower in the morning, after working out, before going out at night).</li>
            <li> real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really I did.</li>
            <li> THANKS.</li>
            <li> Very affordable from seller.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I didn&#x27;t really care how this would smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good cologne is worth spending a few extra bucks on(in my opinion).</li>
            <li> I really like the scent, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> My spouse really appreciated this gift.</li>
            <li> 100% REAL.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne.</li>
            <li> i bought my first bottle at Ross and it has smelled amazing and has lasted long enough.</li>
            <li> And I imagine as much as you want, because no one I encountered found it overpowering, no matter if pumped on one spray, or six.  </li>
            <li> the price, this really a beast.</li>
            <li> Very calming and not too overpowerful.</li>
            <li> so you walk the rest of your life smelling like fast food and</li>
            <li> I suggest this highly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a cologne that doesn&#x27;t fade fast</li>
            <li> I really like it :x</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive but one of my preferred</li>
            <li> Fast shipment too.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Light enough for summer and work.  </li>
            <li> It is really a shame</li>
            <li> Nautica is a pleasant and refreshing after shave that has a very subtle fragrance that  is quietly noticeable.</li>
            <li> Really smells good&lt;</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and bottle was packaged well.</li>
            <li> It is a gentle scent that lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous while buying this perfume online</li>
            <li> Ships really fast.</li>
            <li> Shipped Fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This can&#x27;t be the real one.</li>
            <li> Yeah one of them went out of her way to tell me that I smell really</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about cologne, but I like this product.  </li>
            <li> Masculine, fresh out of the shower smell, durable.</li>
            <li> hours later(at very close</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> 2 SPRAYS LASTS ME MY WHOLE SCHOOLDAY.</li>
            <li> very simple,light,ordinary and does not serve the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> Lasts the whole day.</li>
            <li> I will buy again thanks</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> Nothing groundbreaking, but a very well done summertime scent.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> so I wont complain to much about it.</li>
            <li> Got it much cheaper on Amazon</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the real deal...</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon Support for this Nautica delivery.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very versatile and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> #34;you smell very manly, I like it.&amp;#34; 1 Spray lasted 24 hours, and that compliment I received was in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> Cologne is really subjective</li>
            <li> 3.4 oz of this cologne for $20 is an absolute steal.</li>
            <li> Although, the price is really competetive</li>
            <li> really to put in my every day collection, and trust me when I got it</li>
            <li> Seems to be the real deal.</li>
            <li> Too much</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not offensive, unless you really overdo it.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend of mine and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a very fragrant cologne.</li>
            <li> I have some people saying the smell stays for whole day.</li>
            <li> The prices is reasonable to expect from this product.</li>
            <li> Frangrances are a matter of preference and I did not care much for this fragrance.</li>
            <li> The price was exceptionally reasonable.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> bottle itself looks very well made and looks classy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fake,cheap imposter, not the real deal,Not even close....</li>
            <li> Anyone that has had the real thing will smell the difference.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it at this price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It looks genuine to</li>
            <li> We both really like the smell.</li>
            <li> I am thinking it is an imposter as I have used Nautica in the past and have been very pleased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several complements wearing this scent, and I must say I do enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Despite the price, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all unlike stuff like Axe and such.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> It has a gentle scent, not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> As others have written, this seems to be very comparable to $70 brands.  </li>
            <li> thats with not having put much on too</li>
            <li> Very synthetic.</li>
            <li> much else to say</li>
            <li> Wanted try something different and cheap.</li>
            <li> The real thing&amp;faat delivery</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> unless if it is the real stuff, then this perfume is s</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> What can I say, scents are very subjective and this one just isn&#x27;t for me</li>
            <li> smells better than I expected..</li>
            <li> Not the real deal.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really change much.</li>
            <li> If anything, it just got really soapy.</li>
            <li> It came really fast with my membership.</li>
            <li> She says it&#x27;s very distinctive from the others I have.  </li>
            <li> Goes for whole day.</li>
            <li> I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future.</li>
            <li> Very Good.......Excellent</li>
            <li> Fast delivery</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY cologne I liked out of an entire cologne outlet I went through.</li>
            <li> I have smelled and tested hundreds of colognes, and Voyage is near the top for a lasting fragrance.</li>
            <li> Somewhat akin to Cool Water, but better, and oh so long lasting.</li>
            <li> The bottle itself is nice and heavy and the stuff inside</li>
            <li> Scent is nice but only seems to last an hour or so, then I can&#x27;t detect it any longer.</li>
            <li> its just a pleasant smell that&#x27;s really subtle and welcoming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the exact smell, but it is kind of a sweeter, manly smell.</li>
            <li> Nice everyday Cologne</li>
            <li> and you only need a tiny bit for it to be effective.</li>
            <li> The smell is soft, light which makes it soft to smell to the nostrils.</li>
            <li> It smelled nice and while I noticed the scent only lasted an hour or two, I got a 3.4 ounce bottle when I only paid for a 1.7 ounce bottle</li>
            <li> &quot; seeing that it&#x27;s only around $20 dollars, gladly, I was surprised.</li>
            <li> Smooth,fresh, Nice for everyday</li>
            <li> To be honest, I had never heard of the product until just recently and when my wife and I visited the local mall to get a sniff test, there were no salespeople at the mens cologne section for me to test before ordering.  </li>
            <li> Practically this cologne is likely to help you with your vehicles mileage of you own a dragon or giant bald eagle(depending on country).</li>
            <li> I own: Curve,Chrome, Acqua Di Gio, Jean Paul Gaultier, Issey Mikaye and Dolce and Gabbana to name a few.</li>
            <li> Take into account that where I live it tends to be around warm and somewhat hot all year round, so take that into consideration for the performance I got out of</li>
            <li> Although it lasts a fair amount of hours it smells kinda cheap and similar to so many other common inexpensive retail brands</li>
            <li> smells pretty good only being beat by polo black for me</li>
            <li> Wow!!!</li>
            <li> Not too bold; not too subtle, but a clean, just-showered fresh scent that last for most of the day.</li>
            <li> smells really gd and is not weak at all,great price also.i will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I mean really good</li>
            <li> but I took a chance - wow - great stuff - not too heavy - not too overpowering - nice, subtle.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, fresh, acuatic, long lasting frangrance.</li>
            <li> This is good parfum, the price is low in comparison with other seller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still going strong all day long.  </li>
            <li> The scent lasts amazingly long, but also isn&#x27;t so spicy and strong that everyone is avoiding you.</li>
            <li> It seems to last longer than other colognes, but it does not smell good.</li>
            <li> The smell was still good, but seemed not as potent and dissipated drastically about 15 minutes after application, at least compared to how it was the first few times.  </li>
            <li> Very strong, only need about 4 squirts to last ALL DAY.</li>
            <li> I have compared it to an original one and varies with the package, also the fragance feels different.</li>
            <li> Much more so than other</li>
            <li> Smells just like the original, but doesn&#x27;t last even an hour.  </li>
            <li> It smell great, but it does not last long, only stay for like 2-3 hours and after that the smells gone</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and oceany and my girlfriends love it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, maybe an hour tops and starts fading after 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> You can really tell a difference between wearing this from the first few hours to the end - makes it enjoyable to wear.</li>
            <li> I tried the original at Macy&#x27;s and a vast difference in scent and in durability.</li>
            <li> All I can tell you, from my experience, is that I get more compliments about how I smell than any other cologne I&#x27;ve worn.  </li>
            <li> Smells great and really long lasting, sometimes i still smell it on my clothes a day or 2 later</li>
            <li> Stronger scent than the very cheap version from Nautica, seems to last a little longer throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;- Price is right, I used to spend 40-60 dollar on cologne, but in recent years find this type of value makes much more sense</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage is a realistic option for somebody who wants to spend under twenty dollars on cologne.</li>
            <li> SUCH a CLEAN smell</li>
            <li> It has a range of probably 5-10 feet when fresh (less than two hours old), and can be smelled from just over an arm&#x27;s length away for most of the day.  </li>
            <li> First off, bought this directly from Amazon and it is the real thing.</li>
            <li> Girls are constantly asking what the smell is and how clean it smells.</li>
            <li> The smell is lovely not only does it last long, it&#x27;s pretty cheap compare to a retail store.</li>
            <li> Definitely a salty, clean, soapy aquatic sent.</li>
            <li> nice smeel and long lasting fragrance..</li>
            <li> Smells nice, last relatively long as well.</li>
            <li> If only there was some way of getting the scent through to my potential tinder matches, I know they&#x27;d swipe right so much more frequently!</li>
            <li> I honestly purchased this due to the great price a few weeks ago, and had never smelled it previously.</li>
            <li> THE FRAGANCE OF NAUTICA SMELLS SOFT AND VERY GENTLE.</li>
            <li> Highly suggest!The shipping was fast and it is way cheaper then anything you could buy in a store.</li>
            <li> Ive always loved colognes that are clean, and not so heavy and dark</li>
            <li> A little on the strong side but still smells good and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Smells great, i am new to this cologne game</li>
            <li> Long lasting, very fresh, clean, citrus.</li>
            <li> Fresh, Clean smelling &amp; long lasting... recommended to me by a lady I admire very much.</li>
            <li> am not a professional, but I think that this is genuine because the smell remains for days.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> For the price I got this cologne I am pretty surprised at its result.</li>
            <li> Not quite the same as Cool Water as others have suggested.  </li>
            <li> My husband used cool water by David for years and he also loves nautica blue.</li>
            <li> I love it because it lasts for more than a few hours like so much of the other watered-</li>
            <li> The description says nautica voyage, which I&#x27;ve used in the past and really liked.</li>
            <li> This wasn&#x27;t a problem for me since i could just swap it out with the one from the old bottle, but it something to be concerned with if this is your first purchase.</li>
            <li> Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz has a good essence, but it has not a good fixation.</li>
            <li> Generally I like fragrances that are fresh and/or citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t do reviews, well this product sucked so much</li>
            <li> Nice, but no more than that.</li>
            <li> Similar to cool water, but somehow not as refined.  </li>
            <li> By far, this colonge wears off FAST!</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, but occasionally it smells...</li>
            <li> I like it very much and it should last a long time....waiting for compliments!...:)</li>
            <li> down junk that is so readily available!</li>
            <li> As much as I love the smell, The Eau De Toilette is code for watered down cologne.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant enough, not strong and overpowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s citrusy, with just enough sweetness to take the edge off, and the right kind of florals to round it out.</li>
            <li> I guess I got what I paid for this time, if that means a nice bottle of clear liquid that very slightly smells like the real thing for about five minutes.</li>
            <li> Found a new one to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> Voyage and Burberry for Men are now the two scents I cannot live without!</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling man&#x27;s cologne that doesn&#x27;t smell girly like Allure Homme Sport for instance and doesn&#x27;t have a very heavy fragrance like Hugo Boss.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, clean, slight musk and spice aroma.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve received more compliments on it when on me than my Acqua Di Gio, Issey Miyake and Polo Black put together.</li>
            <li> I love this product, Price was about half comparing to store.</li>
            <li> This bottle was twice the size,and more than half the price than a bottle I received from a retail store.</li>
            <li> however the main problem is not the scent but the fact that the the bottle leaks.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and would expect no less....</li>
            <li> and I get 8 hours with decent projection *5 feet* and sillage.</li>
            <li> The smell is decent.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different and if you&#x27;ve tried many different colognes by now, you should already know this.</li>
            <li> eerrrr, its good, not too heavy but not lasting</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I decided to try this particularly for its reported longevity.</li>
            <li> It is even a lighter color than a older one that I keep in my office.</li>
            <li> The scent is neutral enough that it doesn&#x27;t clash with my deoderant or beard oil, but still prominent enough to dominate their scents.</li>
            <li> If any one can help me find the older version made by Lancaster please email me at wallstreetcpa14@aol.com</li>
            <li> i kinda didn&#x27;t like nautical until i smelled this particular version...</li>
            <li> , the smell is so fresh and everyone smell like it, i have allergies and it didn&#x27;t annoying to my nose, perfect choice.</li>
            <li> 24 hours later, put on the same uniform and head to work without putting on another spray and one of my cute co-workers</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell the same and doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Kinda like addidas moves with a lil bit longer lasting scent that actually smells better with time.  </li>
            <li> Only thing is that the smell of it fades away quickly</li>
            <li> For some reason this looks original but this one smells funky alcoholic than the original one.</li>
            <li> first of all, i dint know what it would smell like, so it was a blind buy for me, but when i first smelled it, i fell in love with the smell, and for $20 it beats most colognes in the same price... will buy this again...</li>
            <li> I asked for a refund and actually got it extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite, and I have some much more expensive than this one.  </li>
            <li> The scent is strong &amp; not very flattering.</li>
            <li> Needed some new cologne and took a chance on ordering this from Amazon since it was highly rated and reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> Poor excuse for what a very good cologne when you buy the real thing.</li>
            <li> The only problem is there are much better smelling colognes out there for only a little more.</li>
            <li> It may be a fairly inexpensive bottle of cologne, but it&#x27;s got a long lasting scent that I&#x27;ve been complimented on regularly.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, fair price, the reason for the two stars is the scent was very weak like the cologne was old.</li>
            <li> it starts off with a fresh \\&quot;I-just-took-a-shower\\&quot; scent but then has a slight sweet scent to it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but I saw how highly rated it was.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> highly recomended for night hangouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this to any man.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s incredibly high ratings and reviews.</li>
            <li> This is for my high school son.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying this</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it on a high level date.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells fresh, somewhat reminiscent of the ocean, but with a tiny hint of sweetness that&#x27;s just enough for a guy to still be able to wear it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend you try this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> used to be a regular user of Lacoste White (as it has a great scent that seems to last forever), but the prices don&#x27;t even compare (Lacoste White&#x27;s $55 for 3.4oz on Amazon)!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can see why it is rated as high by others.</li>
            <li> Way better than other sprays I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Definitely one of my favorite colognes, smells alot like \\&quot;Adidas Moves for Men\\&quot; but slightly less distinct.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most complimented fragrance and no matter what other fragrance</li>
            <li> From reading the reviews, there is this one and a little bit cheaper one that Nautica sells and it sound like both were good but spending a few more dollars would get you this one that has a good smell that lasts throughout the day and so far, it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Ladies, this is the sort of cologne that will make you follow a complete stranger around the grocery store just to catch a whiff of it!!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something a little more</li>
            <li> and I had bought it without having ever smelled it.&lt;br /&gt;However, in the coming few days - I started liking it for its subtleness and fresh clean smell -</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly, was in new packaging, and is exactly what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> but he use it anyways smell is not that strong other man perfume</li>
            <li> Overall a crisp, clean smelling cologne but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> My young son-inlay also uses it and really likes it as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much to say about Voyage that hasn&#x27;t been said so far, so I&#x27;ll address the seller I purchased this cologne</li>
            <li> Definitely far from the real deal.</li>
            <li> So far I really like this.</li>
            <li> try l&#x27;eau d&#x27;issey  ... weird name but smells great.</li>
            <li> was not home when delivery was attempted during normal working hours</li>
            <li> Waste of money for me, better I even bought it online at the knockoff price instead of the Macy&#x27;s truckload price.</li>
            <li> With most aquatic fragrances, they don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Voyage is a true aquatic, that lasts amazingly long.</li>
            <li> A couple sprays in the morning and a few more around my lunch hour</li>
            <li> it is so energetic and last long too.</li>
            <li> been using it for months just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a placebo effect, but the cologne doesn&#x27;t last long for me.</li>
            <li> Some may have gotten knockoffs but it is well worth the effort to buy and exchange if you receive the low quality knockoff.</li>
            <li> It is super strong and last for half the day with one spray.</li>
            <li> It last on clothes for pretty much 2 days.</li>
            <li> Definitely authentic cologne , 1 spray last all day long .</li>
            <li> A normal fragance, but</li>
            <li> This is a buy worth buying and will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> This has become one of my favorite colognes, and it is now in heavy rotation along with Armani Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I paid like 1/3 normal retail price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> pretty good for blind choice</li>
            <li> Most colognes will where off in a few hours</li>
            <li> Aqua Di Gio by Armani is his favorite, but that&#x27;s too pricey for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor, pony up a few more bucks and buy your cologne from a reliable brick and mortar store, lest you run the risk of getting a tampered with bottle like me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This Eau De Toilette (or perfume as I will simply refer to it) lasts about as long as most deodorant sprays on the market nowadays.</li>
            <li> This is more like an everyday cologne</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy this since I normally pay $65.00 for this cologne.</li>
            <li> Really nice and fresh scent not many perfumes stay with me for long</li>
            <li> Its light and fresh, its lasts long but not too long.</li>
            <li> and I use it for casual events and when I hit the town at night that has lead to being complimented on how great it smells.</li>
            <li> I am glad I spent the 20 bucks for this, it has an amazingly fresh aquatic scent that lasts hours and gets compliments like ive never seen, I have burberry touch, FCUD for him, Obsession, Lacoste essential, and kenneth cole black, this smells right up there with them!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s definitely a let down after loving Armani Code the year before.</li>
            <li> Layman&#x27;s way of describing the smell would be to imagine a nice looking guy wearing white shirt, half buttoned up with sleeves rolled up, sitting at the beach, smiling.</li>
            <li> imagine a nice looking guy wearing white shirt, half buttoned up with sleeves rolled up, sitting at the beach, smiling.&#x27;</li>
            <li> I received my purchase in less time than I expected and the product is good.</li>
            <li> The bottle I got was just about water, you could barley smell it right from the bottle or after 2 to 3 minutes later on your skin.  </li>
            <li> Definitely the right cologne to take on a date.</li>
            <li> The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last forever but it doesn&#x27;t wear off right away either.</li>
            <li> the only concern i have about this cologne is it leaves stains on cloths if sprayed at a closer range but comes right off after washing the clothe.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah, and this one will get you compliments left and right.  </li>
            <li> Product is exactly as expected, including manufacture&#x27;s original packaging (with cellophane wrapping).</li>
            <li> Cause all of protection and came before expected also it was in original package .</li>
            <li> for new conquests.</li>
            <li> I went looking for a new cologne.  </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s new fave.</li>
            <li> Came well packaged, brand new with the plastic still in tact.</li>
            <li> My new fav cologne.</li>
            <li> Well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> It is a new perfume in my selection</li>
            <li> When I purchsae this product it was listed as new.</li>
            <li> In fact everytime I think of new york in summer of 2012 - I think of this smell.</li>
            <li> I am always looking for a new scent.</li>
            <li> Was looking to add something new to my cologne collection and came across &amp;#34;Nautica Voyage&amp;#34; on sale at &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My new fav smell.</li>
            <li> The design is curved back and flat front, easy to hold and spray.</li>
            <li> Product is certainly not the original.</li>
            <li> They need to be masculine without being overly powerful and they must last all day.  </li>
            <li> Overall to get the same effect as my older bottle I may have to spray more, and maybe in in the future I am going to have to try it in the store again to see if it changed before I buy it again on amazon.</li>
            <li> Looks like Nautica spent more on the outer glass than on the inner liquid spray.</li>
            <li> Nice subtle but manly smell.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, is nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> It smells good but very subtle.</li>
            <li> It is not really a suit and tie scent per se, but if you want something relaxing to wear casually, this one is excellent, although you can pull it off at the office well during summertime.  </li>
            <li> its only ok the smell is not long lasting .</li>
            <li> Yet it has very classy smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was the second time I wore it going out, and dare I say the fragrance is very much a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in my opinion there are \\&quot;better\\&quot; colognes out there, but they will cost you upwards of $80-100 for a 3.4oz bottle.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping and its definitely the designer brand.</li>
            <li> It has a very classy smell and i would definately buy it again</li>
            <li> This scent is definitely a winner at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> You have to put you nose very near to feel the scent.</li>
            <li> He tells me everyday how many complements he gets about how he smells, but cause it&#x27;s just right, not too strong and not too weak.</li>
            <li> i was right near my local retail store, and i ran in.</li>
            <li> But for the first few months, it was tremendous</li>
            <li> The smell also does not last for long nor is it strong at all to begin with.</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for, not too strong and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Good deal.for the amount but seems slightly watered down.  </li>
            <li> have the exact same bottle from a departmental store, it seems in the originals, the shrink-wraps can be opened from the sides as well.</li>
            <li> Mine came today and the scent is still the same when my sister first bought it for me.</li>
            <li> Pretty solid.</li>
            <li> Other than that scent alone has me coming back for more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2007, Its fresh aroma lasts long and it&#x27;s noticeable.</li>
            <li> I am getting married at the beach next month</li>
            <li> I tried buying a perfume over the net the first time.</li>
            <li> I give it a 2.5/5 stars, I never bought this cologne before so its my first time actually trying out this cologne.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with this cologne, but I thought at this price why not add it to the arsenal (I try to keep 4 or 5 different fragrances at all times</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE</li>
            <li> Usually this is my favorite cologne</li>
            <li> (at far as I know)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in my mailbox, product unopened still sealed in plastic wrap!</li>
            <li> Nautica voyage passed that personal test and i&#x27;m happy that I found another compliment catcher and at least a temporary distraction from coolwater and curve which are still my personal favorites and always be.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this cologne to others interested.</li>
            <li> It seems it is diluted and not exactly 100% original.</li>
            <li> or it will be LOUD!</li>
            <li> What you ultimately get is an appealing and addictive accord that persists for several hours before settling into a skin scent around the 3 to 5 hour mark.</li>
            <li> Excellent, get it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;The exact same thing sold at the mall (the ones close to me anyway) sells between $25 and $30</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smells last for 6-8 hours but can be smelled up to 10-12 hours up close ;)</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a good everyday colonge that last.</li>
            <li> but I find it a little bit strong at times</li>
            <li> Mine smells fine and lasted long enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent but not great, it has a nice ocean breezy summer day kinda scent.</li>
            <li> , good smell the fragrance is lasting, not strong for daily use</li>
            <li> or I had it so long that the scent had began to not smell right</li>
            <li> Its a great cologne for everyday use and has an out of the ordinary fragrance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get this fantastic long lasting scent from the minuscule amount that the sprayer puts out.</li>
            <li> This smells fine for my 13 year old son, but I would recommend for my husband because the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this same exact size fragrance at a department store for twice the price, so needless to say, I was very happy with the price.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, product just as expected</li>
            <li> The bottle I had received is properly marked by Nautica, it had the sticker on the bottom of the bottle and is exactly the same as the one I bought from Macy&#x27;s</li>
            <li> You use it for the first time, it smell ok not great.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents cool and casual</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s recomended for special ocations or other activities</li>
            <li> Just recieved it today and it was a total fake; the smell was very different from the original (not in a good way), and the bottom didnt have a serial number.</li>
            <li> I recommend if you are just trying to smell a bit better especially for this price.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down</li>
            <li> This is the same cologne that received better marks than more expensive competitors on various websites, but you don&#x27;t need a silly review with subjectively attributed points to know that this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I did get a number of positive comments about it from my female friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have received numerous positive comments about what I am wearing.  </li>
            <li> Very clean, light, fresh smell that lasts at least the day for me, and I don&#x27;t bath in it if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> He received this the Christmas of 2013 and still has more than a half left of it.</li>
            <li> actually prefer Lucky as my daily cologne</li>
            <li> scent is very soft and gentle, last for another 5 hours</li>
            <li> Also, I am very particular about the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; smell from colognes that are similarly priced; this does not have that problem.</li>
            <li> it is strong but not a strong scent.</li>
            <li> ( i bought a large bottle from macys and it had the same plastic cap as Amazons bottle.)</li>
            <li> He&#x27;ll be the one smelling himself afterall.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle: simple, large, durable glass.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:</li>
            <li> but the 3.4 oz actually is quite large (the $40-$50 one at stores).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but still has a little weight to it.  </li>
            <li> The scent lasts about twice as long when sprayed on fabric than when sprayed directly on skin, as with most other colognes/</li>
            <li> I have only bought this for the past two years and at this price, I am ordering two extra bottles because it is a very nice male cologne.</li>
            <li> It should also have some sort of stamp of numbers (my original Nautica from the store had 4 numbers in black dot ink).  </li>
            <li> This is a decent cologne, it is long lasting, cheap, and it&#x27;s a big bottle.</li>
            <li> this is just an average aquatic scent, i mainly wear it to work because the price is right.</li>
            <li> Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> out of them all this is the clear winner.</li>
            <li> I want to be clear</li>
            <li> So masculine...</li>
            <li> For guys that want a bit of a stronger and mature scent I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> I particularly enjoy the scent for a few minutes after application in the morning, but within an hour I no longer notice it, as it has combined with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Starting with a very fruity vibe, with some lavenderish-cleanish-fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This product has far exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> After buying this one from Amazon direct, my doubts are now confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Go to fragrances.net for a complete breakdown of the scent composition.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen warnings about possible fakes, but my bottle has the sticker and serial number on the bottom that I&#x27;ve heard is indicative of the real deal.</li>
            <li> Ordered directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt my 20 months old son&#x27;s nostrils when I take him.</li>
            <li> I also had my wife smell my shirt where I sprayed different spots with the &#x27;real&#x27; bottle and the bottle from Amazon...</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> really the product is such that it describes the seller.</li>
            <li> My old spice deodorant have a stronger smell than this.</li>
            <li> Amazon is BY FAR the cheapest place to buy this cologne.(the 1.0 oz in retail stores are around $30)</li>
            <li> Its not heavy-</li>
            <li> Soft and sensual.</li>
            <li> I was using old spice wolferang before I believe, and this blows it out of the water.</li>
            <li> And was well received by senior citizen as well as a young man.</li>
            <li> I decided to try something different and needed it fast, so I went to amazon.</li>
            <li> WITH HIS NATURAL BODY SCENT</li>
            <li> This actually smells very close to Paris Hilton for Men</li>
            <li> It does not smell the same as the real thing.</li>
            <li> Really recommend it is on of my personal favorites.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, and I started to think wild &amp;#34;am</li>
            <li> Smells just like the old nautica competition I used to wear.</li>
            <li> Uncertain of authenticity or how old product is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy sprayer or a person who &amp;#34;bathes&amp;#34; in their cologne, so that wasn&#x27;t the reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s masculine.</li>
            <li> If I keep using this stuff,i&#x27;m going to an early grave.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to receive the number of compliments that I get while wearing this.</li>
            <li> though I got mine directly from Amazon</li>
            <li> I was never much of a cologne wearer, perhaps some Old Spice back in college decades ago, but I wanted to see what was available.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 yrs old</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again when I run out... highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for the last 4-5 months, and really like the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the same product I tried in the store, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Not only that it really helps my dragon</li>
            <li> it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t recommend to spend (nearly $20) on it.</li>
            <li> but wow, I cant stand how this smells.</li>
            <li> + years old.  </li>
            <li> Bought mine direct from Amazon.</li>
            <li> i bought this expecting something at least ok.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than in the local retail stores.  </li>
            <li> Nautica Blue lasts 3 times as much</li>
            <li> Scent lasts about 15 mins, and not even the same Nautica Voyage smell as the real stuff.</li>
            <li> Can be chloeing if too much applied, 2 sprays were enough for me.</li>
            <li> and i bought it directly from amazon,</li>
            <li> this perfume is a kind of mix, firts spray on my skin feels and smells like island voyage nautica, smells like the sea, but few minutes later smells like blue seduccion by Antonio Banderas.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that as a EDT type cologne it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a full parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Keep in mind it doesn&#x27;t last as long as full parfums.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh enough but doesn&#x27;t last until lunchtime.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have gotten used to its fragrance or not, but it does not last more than a few hours.</li>
            <li> It is a good casual scent that anyone can pull off.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday casual use, and the price is right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The subject line pretty much describes what you get on this bottle.</li>
            <li> and I get the most compliments for this in comparison to my other brand name and more expensive bottles.</li>
            <li> I smelled nearly every other scent available, but this one was definitely the winner!</li>
            <li> which this and the previous purchase (Cool Water).</li>
            <li> it seems to me like water with little drops of colony, you can use it to remove ink or clean your keyboard .</li>
            <li> On clean, remotely moist skin it will last 8-12 hours.  </li>
            <li> Maybe the first was a bad batch but the second bottle was great.</li>
            <li> Stays with you most of the day and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume after looking at the reviews, but for my disappointment or may be I&#x27;m the chosen one I got the same exact bottle with good packing but not a perfume in though.</li>
            <li> There were few people claiming that this is not an original product.</li>
            <li> My original review was dead wrong:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some colognes seem to fade quickly to the person wearing it, (but people nearby can still smell it many hours later) but Nautica Voyage seems to lose it&#x27;s scent not only to the wearer but also anyone else nearby approximately 3-4 hours after application.</li>
            <li> You would like it if you love subtle fragrance smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;ll be able to use it all :(</li>
            <li> A decent smelling, low price cologn.</li>
            <li> Fresh and long lasting, dont know how you can beat the price either.</li>
            <li> As long you get if from amazon directly you will get the real one.</li>
            <li> , I sprayed it on last night so it has decent staying power.  </li>
            <li> This fragrance gives me that, finding others out there who like what I like, and say so to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is ridiculously low, compared to all the value that I receive as a direct result of others valuation of it, how much I personally value it, and how much it is sold here for, compared to how much I have seen department stores sell the same size for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This seems to last decently throughout the day with no problem.</li>
            <li> Read the following review and mine is the exact same. &#x27;</li>
            <li> but I do know it is just not the same as my older bottle from Macy&#x27;s,</li>
            <li> It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!</li>
            <li> I purchased this, Nautica Classic and Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very subtle and nice to wear at day-time or night-time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> However, it certainly lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> my fave cool water smell can&#x27;t go wrong very calm scent will buy again</li>
            <li> I highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It opens its top-notes with a fruity presence that smells likes apples and settles quickly into a fresh/clean/floral green accord and settles its base in a very pleasant and masculine woody/aquatic contrast.  </li>
            <li> not necessarily sour though).</li>
            <li> Fantastic, this stuff costs me usually about $70 bucks.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this was genuine or not</li>
            <li> but there were no more boxes of this available.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the original or not, but smells exactly the same and a fourth of the price.</li>
            <li> What is interesting was that Blue was my everyday scent, and I think I probably won&#x27;t go back to it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> /&gt;\\&quot;The scent is very week and not long lasting ...</li>
            <li> This cologne had a very fresh scent and it last for half the day.</li>
            <li> With a limited experience in wearing men&#x27;s cologne, I was not really sure how or where to apply this stuff with the little spray bottle, but have learned that one puff spray on my chest, under my shirt, works great and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell lingers for quite a long time, and the smell is breezy, slightly musky - light and oceanic, but still masculine.</li>
            <li> Withing a week or two, the smell hardly lasted and it wasn&#x27;t strong.</li>
            <li> Made a complaint, got an email saying they were sorry, and they shipped out a second bottle free of charge, nice!</li>
            <li> also the scent was not lasting more than an hardly an hour.</li>
            <li> Smell is very oceanic and stays for a long time!</li>
            <li> Every year my husband gets a new cologne, last year it was Nautica</li>
            <li> , I only stop using it to try new ones</li>
            <li> only downside was the atomizer on the new bottle</li>
            <li> This is the real deal (sticker on bottom) and the scent lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> Scent different, bottle top was odd, scent last only for a couple hours.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it does last much....</li>
            <li> It last&#x27; pretty long.</li>
            <li> Personally, I feel it is worth the money I spent.</li>
            <li> This is one of the least expensive colognes I&#x27;ve bought, but the best performing.</li>
            <li> honestly I thought I would hate because it&#x27;s so cheap.</li>
            <li> Nice, soft scent... quite casual.</li>
            <li> And the very first few sprays</li>
            <li> The low price made me wonder if it was original, and after comparing it with the other one I bought from a local store a while ago, seems legit.</li>
            <li> The size is major and it is indeed legit - compared at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I think its a pretty casual sent so its good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The other (the one that I received) has a cheaper, plastic cap, and a more harsh, alcoholy scent to it.</li>
            <li> 3.4 oz bottle should last me for a while since this eau de toilette spray is strong enough where it doesn&#x27;t not need to be heavily used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells light and airy (if thats a word), not overpowering but will not last as long as some other stronger scents.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh and also a little musky.  </li>
            <li> Nice smell, but weak and short lasting.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne at less than half the cost at Macy&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Under the sticker there is a serial number that will be hard to spot unless you&#x27;re under the light.</li>
            <li> and I find the smell quite pleasant and nostalgic (of what, I don&#x27;t know!)</li>
            <li> Definitely a fragrance for a younger guy in high school or college.</li>
            <li> if its even fake or real ( genuine) cologne.</li>
            <li> I generally apply it before work, and it&#x27;s still noticeable when I&#x27;m getting home ~10</li>
            <li> Speaking of packaging I generally prefer and recommend finding an online store you trust, and getting your colognes, EDT, and perfumes from there.</li>
            <li> There is a clear difference between these class of Nautica&#x27;s and the class of say Christian Dior perfumes.</li>
            <li> It smells artificial and synthetic at first, but dissipates to an OK smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Me personally, I would much rather use a cologne that smelled just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but lasts long rather than vice-versa.</li>
            <li> The one made by lancaster is much nicer, smoother, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Definitely smells masculine,</li>
            <li> I like a simple, masculine, old-fashioned fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Ordered two bottles directly from Amazon, not 3rd party seller.</li>
            <li> Apparently, you have to buy it from a legit seller.  </li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old male and have never worn perfume/deodorant in my life.</li>
            <li> I was barely using any of it.  </li>
            <li> Amazon offers the same at rock bottom price.</li>
            <li> I use it daily before going to work and so far haven&#x27;t received any complaints about it.</li>
            <li> my gf told me that she can only perceive the scent when her nose is in direct contact with my skin.</li>
            <li> You should definitely give this a try if you are sensitive to scents.  </li>
            <li> I got mine direct from Amazon and not a third party</li>
            <li> While everything looks identical this product had no scent and was barely distinguishable.</li>
            <li> Even after using a lot, barely lasts for couple of hours.</li>
            <li> info: 21 year old, Male in college.</li>
            <li> I am now on my third bottle, and get compliments quite frequently on this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have no regrets to date.</li>
            <li> The smell seemed barely there</li>
            <li> Classy smell that lasts until the next day!</li>
            <li> Normally this cologne is $30-40 in the store for the larger bottle, so it&#x27;s definitely cheaper</li>
            <li> I actually like it as much as I like his more expensive colognes, like Hugo.</li>
            <li> The smell is OK but not great</li>
            <li> I got the fake kind.  </li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d get tired of strange women walking up to me telling me I smell nice.</li>
            <li> It is not too strong and not too subtle.</li>
            <li> I was kinda getting tired of them myself since I have been using them for more than 2 years ( switching between them ).</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I was heart broken to find that this was not the voyage that I know and love.</li>
            <li> Out of the three, I think this may hit the sweet spot by a small margin over island voyage for scent.</li>
            <li> Nice fresh fragrance for men...not to overpowering-for casual use everyday.</li>
            <li> Smells clean, but not as sharp as expected.</li>
            <li> MUCH less money spent on this than at the stores I usually purchase cologne from and smell just as good and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> 2nd you can use this product anytime of the year especially if you live in Florida like I do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in proximity to a lot of people and in very social settings.  </li>
            <li> It smells fresh, clean and airy, not too heavy or thick.</li>
            <li> I still have profound respect and continue to come back with reliance to this one.</li>
            <li> Going to test on something I&#x27;m not wearing to make sure I&#x27;m not just getting so used to the scent that I can&#x27;t detect it, but my other cologne I can still smell the next morning from just one spray (it&#x27;s not strong or overbearing, just long-lasting, seemingly unlike this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To say the least, I was NOT disappointed.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars because the product is exactly as stated and only costed me a mere $15 free shipping.</li>
            <li> I am usually allergic to cologne and it makes me sneeze or gives me a headache, but this has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t make me sick and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> but my girlfriend can pick up a dirty hoodie from last week and it will still smell good.</li>
            <li> It truly does seem that the spray and tube did indeed have the actual cologne in it when I first got it, but the liquid in the bottle has been watered down with some alcohol.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price is a major value, as I&#x27;ve seen Voyage at department stores for nearly double the price....</li>
            <li> Voyage goes on a little scratchy at first, but after 15 minutes</li>
            <li> It blends down with some soapy notes, with the fruit staying in there strong; I can also get a little musk in there.</li>
            <li> it came in at about one half the cost I&#x27;d been paying at a national Department Store whose first initial is \\&quot;M\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> All these colognes are fake, the bottles looks nothing like the real thing, smells absolutely nothing like the real thing</li>
            <li> so I have the hygiene habits of a acne-ridden teenage boy apparently.  </li>
            <li> , I also picked up the well rated Nautica Blue at the same time to compare and all I can say is WOW, stay away from Blue and stick with Voyage, world of difference!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> i would recomend to any teenage to mid adult male.</li>
            <li> This heavy glass cologne bottle accidentally landed head first on my carpet.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t toss your heavy glass bottle head first</li>
            <li> my first bottle had a heavy metal cap.</li>
            <li> Like someone let a bottle of Windex ferment on a hot beach for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> a lower end for everyday use and a higher end for going out to parties or events.</li>
            <li> Smells clean -nothing pretentious, just enough for being noted-</li>
            <li> This stuff is really watered down and</li>
            <li> Considering gucci and other high end cologne is over 100$</li>
            <li> You really had to be looking for it and of course have previous knowledge about</li>
            <li> Far as the longevity you make think it does not last long</li>
            <li> but i was surprised that this will long last than the lacoste that i bought here in amazon ..</li>
            <li> product didnt come on time, however, it didnt come super late either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not too harsh on the nose and the fragrance stays fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li> The smell was pure alcohol, a sort of vodka smell, and then only a slight hint of the actual cologne.  </li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a heavenly smell cologne, but at least it is somewhat cheap, but I don&#x27;t encourage you to buy a big perfume bottle like this one, since you will have to stick to it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Was a little hesitant to buy, but it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> But the major fault i found out is, it doesn&#x27;t be for long time</li>
            <li> Having used Davidoff Cool Water as my standard go-to everyday scent I decided to try Nautica Voyage and equally found myself in agreement with the other reviewers who made the comparison.</li>
            <li> I was needing some new spray since my other was either running low</li>
            <li> I still had a little left in the old bottle and the fragrance is the same as far as I can</li>
            <li> all the bad reviews before purchasing this!&lt;br /&gt;the seller is giving me a refund.&lt;br /&gt;1/5 star for product but good customer service</li>
            <li> This one in particular isn&#x27;t as long lasting as some other brands i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Definitely worth picking up even if you won&#x27;t wear it that much, I mean come on</li>
            <li> the scent is strong enough and it does last at least half day ...&lt;</li>
            <li> I also bought Versace Man Eau Fraiche By Gianni Versace For Men Edt Spray 3.4 Oz directly from AMAZON and THAT product was, in  my opinion, a fake copy of the original fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was not expecting what I received, the bottle it was bigger then I tough and smells amazing, definitely an everyday cologne !</li>
            <li> If I had to guess the small choice is actually the large option at wally world.</li>
            <li> not exactly as I&#x27;d anticipated but not too far from it either.</li>
            <li> Only beef I have is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on which makes me wonder if its an original or a bootleg</li>
            <li> Usually a spray or two on the neck or wrist will make it last much longer than on clothing because the heat from your arteries and the sweat on your skin complement and amplify the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much when I first ordered this item, but looking at the rating and the amount of reviews I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Really like this, I was skeptical at first because I haven&#x27;t smelled it before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Supposedly this scent is fresh cut leaves with some subtle mossy and woody undertones.</li>
            <li> Coz when I had tried them on at the local store, I remember they lasting quite long and</li>
            <li> In addition to not liking the scent, like others have mentioned, the scent does not last long at all, I&#x27;ll mist the heck out of my jacket and shirt collar, only to have it wear off in</li>
            <li> I wanted something different which would be long lasting also</li>
            <li> but I use this all the time same smell last as long as the one I purchased in store</li>
            <li> Ive bought several types of name brand colognes through amazon that turned out to be watered down fakes in the name brand bottles, but this one was completely legitimate.  </li>
            <li> If you are afraid of getting a fake, make sure you buy from amazon.com as the seller and not one of the many 3rd party sellers.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long though, if i spray it before i leave for work, by the time i show up an hour later its basically gone unless you smell my shirt.</li>
            <li> It wears very well, and is hard to make it overpowering in any amount short of simply dumping the bottle on you.  </li>
            <li> Its not overwhelming just dont use much.</li>
            <li> not sure if its real, smells like rubbing alcohol and</li>
            <li> The first week I wore this scent, I had at least three women who told me</li>
            <li> But not sure if it is the real stuff.</li>
            <li> long last..</li>

            <li> However the scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li> however it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> that last very long on your clothes .</li>
            <li> The designers have a solid signature in their smell, this one reminded me of some knockoff smell, the cheap signature is in the background, faintly there</li>
            <li> I become nose blind to the smell very quickly</li>
            <li> Wow even for fake pakaging totally worth</li>
            <li> It is not too strong or not too faint.</li>
            <li> So obviously this was not a new item.</li>
            <li> Based on my limited experience this perfume brought back those memories.  </li>
            <li> I have a brand new hidden for Christmas!</li>
            <li> It smelled very similar, but not quite the same, and only lasts maybe 3-5 hours before becoming very faint.</li>
            <li> the other more expensive ones are \\&quot;for a change.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> Gentelmen, if you&#x27;re looking for a manly perfume that will make wemon accidentally follow you around the house, work area, or other public place, look no further.</li>
            <li> There are other fragrances around this price points and even more expensive one&#x27;s that don&#x27;t accomplish what Nautica Voyage does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten it from multiple vendors and have received 2 different kinds of bottles, slightly varied but the same name.</li>
            <li> i have other cologne, a lot more expensive</li>
            <li> It may last 4-5 hours, and kinda quit or be pretty weak.</li>
            <li> So far, beyond a few random uses, this sits unused as I do not want to smell so strongly.</li>
            <li> Not amazing but decent enough to buy,</li>
            <li> What I mean is that it&#x27;s sort of right down the middle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great describing what Voyage smells like, I&#x27;ll leave that to others, so I&#x27;ll just say it has a high quality masculine scent.</li>
            <li> This is not little boys Axe, this is for men who want a little scent that intriques not overpowers.</li>
            <li> The only problem (pointed out in other reviews) is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> It has an overpoweringly artificial, one-note smell that&#x27;s sure to gag anyone else in the elevator with you.  </li>
            <li> but it turned out to be my very favorite and least expensive in my cologne stash.</li>
            <li> When you spray it, it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> lingers on for a long time...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it in a long time, and just happened to run into it while shopping on amazon.</li>
            <li> the scent does not stay for long time.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts a long time,too.</li>
            <li> Stays on for a long time, that&#x27;s always a plus.</li>
            <li> Scent lingers for a long time.</li>
            <li> It lasts long and has gotten me laid wicked often.</li>
            <li> It lasts for long time.</li>
            <li> but it not keep long time, just 2 or 3 hours.</li>
            <li> Everyone I know likes the smell and it lasts long.</li>
            <li> and it lasts a long time, up to a day I would say.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t test it out how long it lasts</li>
            <li> i just took the chance and purchased it too complete the order to round the purchase to 5p bucks......</li>
            <li> Lasts really long</li>
            <li> Took long time to do that</li>
            <li> I was looking for this for a long time I just to use this lint time ago and now I have it of you</li>
            <li> the smell lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> buying colognes online as opposed to a department store seem to affect how long the smell lasts throughout the day, but don&#x27;t understand why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the Nautica Voyage for a long time now.</li>
            <li> It wont stay for long.</li>
            <li> took off another star because it does not linger that long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, I expected this to last longer since it costs about $20.00 at my time of purchase.</li>
            <li> For a long time this was my go to cologne.</li>
            <li> Also it keep a long time.</li>
            <li> i have using it for long time.</li>
            <li> I got this earlier than I expected</li>
            <li> my man gets compliments all day long</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time,spray it on in the am</li>
            <li> Not great but worth the cost</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as other designer colognes.</li>
            <li> It last a long time not like some of the other cologne I have had.</li>
            <li> But as mentioned in other reviews it does not last really long.</li>
            <li> Similar to a couple other Nautica colognes that I have.</li>
            <li> This cologne simply blows any other cologne I&#x27;ve ever purchased out of the water.  </li>
            <li> The smell definitely lasts, but the longevity is undermined with the fact that it is not as fragrant as other colognes I have used.</li>
            <li> My original review was that i thought it was fake because of the plastic cap...</li>
            <li> I did some research and saw a lot of other people having the same problem with the quality.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used my other cologne and perfumes for my daily use after I got this.</li>
            <li> It is not too imposing unlike other commercial perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> Other then that, this product is very solid .</li>
            <li> It lasts for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> cologne lasts a very long time</li>
            <li> Voyage, however, is an aquatic that lasts VERY long.</li>
            <li> The Sent lasts very long time</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold scent for very long however.</li>
            <li> A bottle of cologne lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using davidoff coolwater and curve since a very long time.</li>
            <li> Will buy again when this one has run dry.</li>
            <li> The second one I ordered has a cap which was heavy metal, which only covered the nozzle.</li>
            <li> but it wears out in a few hours, not enough oils to make it last</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few months and still have over 90% of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> I am a young male, (18-21), and I received comments on how I smell and get asked what I wear at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is correct but it does not last and must be reapplied to keep that scent active.</li>
            <li> Turns heads every single time.</li>
            <li> The single spray also lasted longer than the 2-3</li>
            <li> Single spray under both arms on shits works for days.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few times I buy general brand names instead of a designer name perfume.</li>
            <li> Projection is well above average, also.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my husband early and he has worn it everyday since!</li>
            <li> worst of all the scent doesn&#x27;t even last for a good ten minutes.</li>
            <li> It has gotten as many compliments as some of the very expensive colognes in my experience.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.i read some reviews and people want a $15 cologne to spend like the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> It definitely feels watered down</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it was going to be a watered down low quality cologne</li>
            <li> Lasts all day long!!</li>
            <li> It is a bit boring, too safe, and a little too synthetic smelling for something that is supposed to pass as clean and natural.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li> The smell last less then 15 min</li>
            <li> Lastly, the Amazon bottle smells slightly off after an hour.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the rave is about it, maybe I got the fake version, but its ok.  </li>
            <li> Cologne has slight fruit notes along with the traditional &amp;#34;aqua&amp;#34; type notes.</li>
            <li> They now seem to be only half strengh knock offs, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical to buy a cologne that I had never actually smelled in person.</li>
            <li> It is a cross between curve soul and black by Kenneth Cole.</li>
            <li> But luckily I did not get a fake.</li>
            <li> but If I happen to spray to much its not a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this cologne isn&#x27;t a Perfume base</li>
            <li> the ones I actually purchased from Amazon (direct) for half price hardly makes it through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gosh</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit, over-spraying will give you a headache with this scent.</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m not too fond of the generic men&#x27;s cologne smell, I&#x27;m hoping it changes a little on my boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Just a couple spritzes of this cologne will last all day long without being excessive.</li>
            <li> For the price, you absolutely cannot go wrong, especially for summer.  </li>
            <li> I bought this before at a store and spent 50 dollars for it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> Not what i expected.</li>
            <li> Not as expected.</li>
            <li> not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> I compared the recent purchase of NV that I received from my AMAZON purchase with the same product purchased from a department store and found the AMAZON NV to have a faint fragrance and essentially not be the same product that I had purchased from the department store</li>
            <li> and I think I keep a few extra bottles.</li>
            <li> but lasts only a few hours</li>
            <li> and I just spent about 3 days to get it.</li>
            <li> ended up contacting the Amazon support center and explaining the situation.</li>
            <li> It is almost empty</li>
            <li> Not really something i would buy again.</li>
            <li> people than not really like this scent</li>
            <li> The bottle is heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> Definitely would recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Not really a cologne person, but</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit stronger than I would prefer and not really to my liking.</li>
            <li> came way before i expected.</li>
            <li> i spent 18 dollars on this</li>
            <li> A few squirts are enough for the day, wearing all day on clothes, and probably 6-8 hours on skin.  </li>
            <li> The aroma of the spray doesn&#x27;t even last a few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now a few hours later, and I do smell the cologne on my shirt, but it&#x27;s a fraction of what it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a connoisseur of fragrances.  </li>
            <li> but Amazon&#x27;s pricing is unbeatable so the risk is minimal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really fond of it</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need (want) of an everyday Cologne in order to prevent my new-found love \\&quot;Acqua Di Gio\\&quot; by GA from losing its sex appeal.</li>
            <li> The shipping was a bit annoying, as it was missent and took about two more days than it would have, but got here within 7 days all the same.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t stay for to long, maybe watered down but considering the price</li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s are on sale, it could sometimes mean that they are trying to hurry and get rid of their old colognes.</li>
            <li> Summertime in a bottle, plain and simple.  </li>
            <li> After all, that&#x27;s why we buy expensive cologne, right?</li>
            <li> I am disappointed, i kind of want to try the &#x27;real&#x27; thing not this fake stuff.</li>
            <li> The scent sticks on you all day, which is more than i can say about some of the disappointing fakes ive bought off amazon in the past...</li>
            <li> plz it smells like the cheap colngue I buy from target literally smells like a2 dollar Mexican who mow my lawns :(</li>
            <li> It has a soft subtle smell to it.  </li>
            <li> But, alas- I&#x27;ll be decent.</li>
            <li> Wow at first I was a little sceptical of buying something that is usually twice as expensive in the store.</li>
            <li> As others have said in reviews, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way though.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> bought pants he hated, tennies he hated, boots that were too big, shorts he thought were ugly..trying to give him a nice birthday, He liked the cologne,</li>
            <li> The stuff I ordered previously had a smaller heavy metal cap.</li>
            <li> this isn&#x27;t delivered to the mailbox or front porch like all the other merchandise I order from Amazon?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to describe smell, other than to say it, for some reasons, smells like summer to me</li>
            <li> I will be exploring other Nautica</li>
            <li> I had purchased some other perfumes here</li>
            <li> Either way - something is not consistent.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re browsing for cologne and you&#x27;re thinking of getting this one, but aren&#x27;t so sure, go for it, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It is a lot lighter than the other colognes I wear</li>
            <li> not sure what I&#x27;ll end up doing once these run out, but if I get another bottle like the second one I ordered, I will return it and switch to a difference cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other discount places , who always allow you to order but never have things in stock...but not at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I thought it might be a knockoff product due to the price.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy voyage after trying Nautica&#x27;s other fragrances.</li>
            <li> However, what lead me to buying this is due to</li>
            <li> check out other brands of cologne.</li>
            <li> Women will be clamoring over each other to give their number (and their panties) over to you, and not some clown wearing AXE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought this from a retailer in the past and smelled great/long lasting.</li>
            <li> Ordered it from Amazon LLC (not any other provider).</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t have the smell that sets it apart from other colognes.</li>
            <li> I had read reviews from other buyers that it wasn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I expected!</li>
            <li> In the past the products seemed to be the same as what you would purchase in a store, but no longer!</li>
            <li> Extreme.</li>
            <li> I have smelled these before at Nautica stores and other perfume stores, but they sell for like $60.</li>
            <li> Other colognes I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve over sprayed, I get the &amp;#34;overpowering</li>
            <li> i would not trust any fragrance from any other seller.</li>
            <li> , i bought some other cologne here</li>
            <li> other day while shopping at a department store, I saw this cologne at the fragrance counter.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers point out, the bottle I bought seems to be bogus one.</li>
            <li> I bought it against because I finished the other bottle.</li>
            <li> The other day my daughter got in the car</li>
            <li> Not overpowering compare to the other cologne out there.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll list some other perfumes I use and</li>
            <li> I still prefer Pi over any other men&#x27;s cologne</li>
            <li> I went to a cologne store the other day to check their inventory of nautica cologne and asked to see the bottle.</li>
            <li> On the up side I will say this, the smell lasted longer than any other cologne I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> Bought this in 2012 and after about one spray per day it&#x27;s about half empty.  </li>
            <li> Not really strong and and the fragrance never lasts too long.</li>
            <li> Very subtle which is my particular preference.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that a little goes a long way with this one</li>
            <li> I bought this one blind because of all the positive reviews and it&#x27;s the #1 seller here at Amazon.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very bad product, smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> The cap is loose and does not fit well with the Bottle.</li>
            <li> After using this for the past year and half, the scent only lasts 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> weak fragrance that does not last long.</li>
            <li> I recommend its use for all occasions, and the price (per fluid ounce through Amazon for a 100ml bottle) is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy again, hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The scent is similar to Polo sport, active scent, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I&#x27;ve found it lasts 2-3 hours....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply too common.  </li>
            <li> it would be a 5 star cologne if it last at least 5 hours.....</li>
            <li> Nautica said they&#x27;d trade me a real one for the fake, but they didn&#x27;t have anymore of the Island Voyage, so they sent me this</li>
            <li> , I am a perfume freak and have bought at least 15-20 diff perfumes for me and my wife in the last 2 years from Amazon and its affiliate alone.</li>
            <li> My bowling average went from 121 to 237.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think the version we got was fake or anything like that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cologne that I&#x27;m obsessed with, but my lady friend really likes this scent on me.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> Unfortunately  I have to agree it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the real cologne.</li>
            <li> stars for the real cologne, zero stars for this fake stuff.</li>
            <li> use it for work, and I need it to last at least 6 hours or so.</li>
            <li> but it is not worth wearing this perfume.</li>
            <li> Projection is average.</li>
            <li> Also the bottle are really strange, usually inside the box</li>
            <li> Took a chance and ordered this, ended up getting a fake very upset.</li>
            <li> Some colognes smell downright nasty after being in the heat but as for this one, it still smelled good.</li>
            <li> , I believe the product is watered down.</li>
            <li> , I believe the product is watered down.....</li>
            <li> I have women chasing me down the streets now.</li>
            <li> turn it upside down and look at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> 2 stars for playing a guessing game when it comes to that, super frustrating,</li>
            <li> so i don&#x27;t know if its watered down or not.</li>
            <li> so i guess its not watered down.</li>
            <li> I do not know if this is cause Nautica has changed how they made their cologne, or if this what others on here suggest is watered down</li>
            <li> and it seems to be watered down.</li>
            <li> My Girlfriend bought this as a gift and is now a little jealous when other girls comment on it.</li>
            <li> Extremely affordable but not cheap on the nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smell has slight similarity to laundry detergent.  </li>
            <li> Identical to department store&#x27;s except nearly half the price.</li>
            <li> and its not super cliche&#x27;d like Aqua de Gio.</li>
            <li> My husband has been wearing it for years and it is one of his favorites--up there with Polo Black.</li>
            <li> I typically use it to my work and can smell it from morning to evening.</li>
            <li> The smell lasted less than 15 min</li>
            <li> At this low price, it makes sense, especially since men&#x27;s colognes are so expensive.</li>
            <li> perfume lasts less than 20 minutes on you</li>
            <li> When I got around to using it, I keep feeling a slight burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> For less than $15 I walk into the room and the women swoon.</li>
            <li> It lasts less than 2 hours even when you are indoors</li>
            <li> the box at the bottom, underneath has 4 number black printed beside the barcode.</li>
            <li> Again much less than $20</li>
            <li> The box and bottle seem to be legit but the fragrance nor the endurance of the scent seem to match that of my previous nautica voyage.</li>
            <li> I over sprayed this half the time I wore it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slightly woody and musky.</li>
            <li> Slight cucumber scent.  </li>
            <li> guys, remember: you only need to put a small spray on your neck and a small spray on each wrist.</li>
            <li> This is one of those hidden gems of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also recommend , Drakkar Noir , and Polo Black .</li>
            <li> Of course a scent is different for everyone, but I will only use this cologne for just a casual change of pace.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blind buy as well.</li>
            <li> Smell is very default (like something very mundane, fake, counterfeit) and goes away in 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> This smells decent but a little faint.</li>
            <li> Awkward first smell</li>
            <li> Not sweet or overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I normally buy my hubby expensive colognes from dept stores.</li>
            <li> I gave it 4stars for smelling average but not cheap and for its longevity.</li>
            <li> He wanted something that smelled fresh but wasn&#x27;t very expensive.</li>
            <li> The bubbles disappears, the box case is tightly sealed in heaviness to take out the cologne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about a year and a half and never had a single complaint.</li>
            <li> Im not sure if this is fake or real.</li>
            <li> my cologne was damaged when i received it, half the cologne was missing</li>
            <li> I think it seeps into your skin and when you sweat a little, it brings it out.  </li>
            <li> I was a little nervous buying cologne over the internet, but read the reviews on this one and decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> What ever little smell it had faded in 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> must be dilluted or not original because the smell is weak and does not last like the cologne you buy in stores.</li>
            <li> Not sure what the other reviewers got, but mine seems just like what I sampled in the store.</li>
            <li> Been using nautical voyage for a little over a month</li>
            <li> It has a little smell.</li>
            <li> Add a little and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> So it was a little worry some when the tracking number was not working on the DHL web site.</li>
            <li> A little musky</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you on this.  </li>
            <li> A little</li>
            <li> Sorry about my old review I spoke too soon on it!</li>
            <li> This is not original ....</li>
            <li> You can spray just a little or quite a bit depending on what you are doing that day.  </li>
            <li> yes, it&#x27;s a gamble to buy fragrances this way that you&#x27;re not familiar with</li>
            <li> Clearly a winner, nothing can go wrong with this fragrance.</li>
            <li> I was wary of getting something fake after reading reviews, but mine seems to be genuine.</li>
            <li> For everyday fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Few of my friends have also decided to start using it after I told them about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent goes away after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few perfumes from Amazon and sometimes from its affiliates.</li>
            <li> Maybe a few hours?</li>
            <li> I bought one of these from Amazon and it is not genuine (I compared it to the one from the department store I bought a couple of years ago).  </li>
            <li> The cologne smells of dead bugs with a fruity note.</li>
            <li> Fake... Top is bigger than originsl, smells horrible and does not last...</li>
            <li> Presumably, this is because the fragrance has been out for a few years.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few colognes that I use in the summer time.</li>
            <li> so it does not feel too heavy in the heat.</li>
            <li> - it may seem majority loves this scent, but I happen to be one of the few odds out.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday at work.</li>
            <li> I use this cologne everyday on campus</li>
            <li> Now, with 2 to 4 sprays, BO takes over after a few hours.</li>
            <li> He wears this everyday</li>
            <li> NOTE smell is harsh to some</li>
            <li> I would consider this an everyday cologne.  </li>
            <li> dont waste ur money</li>
            <li> Either its a fake or its so old that its lost its fragrance.</li>
            <li> it just makes a narrow stream.</li>
            <li> simply so others wouldn&#x27;t buy it and my &#x27;secret cologne&#x27;</li>
            <li> MY EVERYDAY FRAGANCE FOR WORK</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten a few complements from the ladies.</li>
            <li> Nasty lemony air freshener kind of smell.</li>
            <li> I can see the appeal for this if you are just going out for a few</li>
            <li> This scent is heavy.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> I received my order within a few days.</li>
            <li> You can still smell it for few minutes.</li>
            <li> I ride to school everyday</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments.</li>
            <li> I wear it almost everyday</li>
            <li> but the cologne inside is very unpleasant and strong.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased Nautica Voyage (in the past 2 years from a department store) and still have some of the product.  </li>
            <li> This was also about half the price that the department store was asking, STEAL!</li>
            <li> I got it for $27 (less than half price)!!</li>
            <li> Fragrance is kinda plain and overused.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the scent is not strong and after about two hours or so the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cologne arrive very quickly, no questions about authenticity.</li>
            <li> disappointment came in that this cologne does not last very long on my skin.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical that this could possibly be a knock off, but after checking out the box, bottle, and scent</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after seeing all these crazy 5 star reviews and when I try the product, it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectation.</li>
            <li> Scent lasts at least half a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update</li>
            <li> This smell became annoying quickly.</li>
            <li> This fragrance resembles watermelon, and it quickly becomes annoying.  </li>
            <li> so if you want a lil sum sum to get noticed and have a little diversity , get this . !</li>
            <li> For single guys, this fragrance will not help your game.  </li>
            <li> Had very little scent.</li>
            <li> everyone likes the smell and they usually ask me what brand it is too</li>
            <li> Look&#x27;s like the product i received is fake, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t even last an hour.</li>
            <li> Arrived sealed in a Nautica box with bar code (which I only mention because some people seem to assume it is fake or ghetto).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s counterfit...</li>
            <li> What an unbelievable price as well.</li>
            <li> Sorry no actual feed back.&lt;br /&gt;DS PA</li>
            <li> Possibly recieved a fake however the sticker was indeed on the bottom.</li>
            <li> Also, my bottle from Amazon was poorly made; the bottom of the inside is not straight and quite noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed and this makes me suspicious of online products and hesitant to make similar future purchases online.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;ll never buy this product no more.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I went to a local nordstrom to &amp;#34;test-smell&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Wasted money!</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> but i always ended up with the small version</li>
            <li> ordered another bottle and it was totally off, either manufacturing issue, distributor was diff or fake.</li>
            <li> Bought quite a few to give away as gifts!</li>
            <li> I went past the scanners without a beep,</li>
            <li> The packaging and everything looks the same, but the smell lasts for a mere 30-45 minutes.</li>
            <li> Took a chance as he had owned Nautica in the past.  </li>
            <li> my signature scent as of the past year has been BVLGARI man</li>
            <li> After 2 minutes you cant even small it on your skin or neck collar.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult for me to pinpoint individual scents.</li>
            <li> I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I received non-original version of this product</li>
            <li> Not much more to say there.</li>
            <li> You can use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will venture again to buy a perfume online.</li>
            <li> Not a genuine product!</li>
            <li> I m not satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy this stuff online as I haven&#x27;t smelled it</li>
            <li> I know that in the past even when I went to launder my shirts - I could still smell the Nautica - now I might be out with my girlfriend</li>
            <li> he usually wears it when we are going out for dinner</li>
            <li> Unbelievable price</li>
            <li> for this price its unbelievable.</li>
            <li> and thats with putting a heavy dosage!</li>
            <li> im not sure why you guys think it fades away</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to cologne for the past couple of years.  </li>
            <li> It is my go-to scent for regular and casual use just because of the price.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very heavy and designed well</li>
            <li> Its very my everyday spray.</li>
            <li> a very few hours.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> However, it did not arrive as it was supposed to due to poor service from Amazon</li>
            <li> Seller emailed and asked if I wanted to return, but considering the package had already been ripped open by the time I had determined it was a fake, it was too late...</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 bottles of this ,and was disappointed the smell didnt last very long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this 5 or 6 times, and half of the time I&#x27;ve received generic, unpleasant look-alikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really believe this is nothing but a knock off and just warn people so they are not as disappointed as I was.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed of this cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> Scent is small and subtle, yet lasts for hours.</li>
            <li> And since I&#x60;m in a wheelchair it&#x60;s hard for me to go to stores</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s hard to complain about this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard for anyone to not like this product.</li>
            <li> For the price and quality this fragrance is hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> It is a little too beachy for wintertime for my tastes, but if you want to smell like the beach all year round, what is wrong with that?  </li>
            <li> you really only can wear it wear its cold</li>
            <li> I least I will blame it on the online sellers.</li>
            <li> You truly cannot beat the price on this, at least when I bought it - it was $20.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t conflict with secondary fragrances but can be overtaken.</li>
            <li> At least, the bottle I received was fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> they&#x27;ll have at least one buyer.</li>
            <li> WHAT NEGATIVE THINGS THEY SAY ABOUT THIS COLOGNE.</li>
            <li> smell can be describe as cutting a ripe apple next to the salty ocean sea.</li>
            <li> You will need 6 sprays of this but who cares, its under 20 dollars for at least 500 sprays.</li>
            <li> So what if I get a knock off at least I took a shot at it.</li>
            <li> Moreover, you would ahve to spray at least 10 times to feel the perfume aroma.</li>
            <li> but wud say you go bit higer price if you in office indoors and the scent lingers for at least 6 -8 hours</li>
            <li> Within the hour of me filing the complaint.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s thick paper to protect the bottle.</li>
            <li> Came in gray time as expected!!!!!</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I was excited... until I sprayed it and entered into state of hysterical regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> I, as usual, could not pass up the price on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> *** if u knw what i mean</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any issues with shipping or returning the product, but they did request that I review their customer care service, which must mean that they do somewhat care about their service to their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &amp; I do mean &amp;#34;NOTHING&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
            <li> I mean, how can something with 100</li>
            <li> And when I say floral, it does that mean that it smells feminine at all</li>
            <li> Not too bad, but the box was wet and the bottle down maybe 5 or 10%.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible fragrance that is way too sweet and cloying.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have now serious doubts about my Bvlgari Aqua and Armani Aqua de Jio as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a subtle smell and my husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Subtle, but smells like heaven.</li>
            <li> Overall, disappointed, not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive to buy it on Amazon than on a cruise ship</li>
            <li> Subtle and not empowering.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has a subtle lightweight smell  with a long-lasting bouquet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this for work, because in it&#x27;s preset form, it&#x27;s extremely subtle and not intrusive.  </li>
            <li> So much less expensive than department store pricing.  </li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the price and some of the weird reviews, but this is legit stuff and smells just like the bottle I got at Dillards, but at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> so I was a little skeptical.</li>
            <li> i was skeptical on this product since some people claimed it was not original.</li>
            <li> I jumped at an even cheaper price on Nautica Blue, and while I&#x27;m not as enamored with the scent, it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> This is definitely fake, smells disappear after a few minutes, within 5 minutes</li>
            <li> I was dead wrong.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to write to Amazon about this, but there is NO place I can write this complaint!</li>
            <li> Definitely try it out, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got fake product.</li>
            <li> No more Blind buys for me.</li>
            <li> the scent is too weak to get noticed</li>
            <li> And to me, that&#x27;s not a very delightful smell.</li>
            <li> and it wouldn&#x27;t be as unpleasant compared to other brands i have tried.</li>
            <li> This fragnence smell was very common among men</li>
            <li> I mean, come on!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> Not a great as I thought it would smell but</li>
            <li> Then it got worse, to the point of like</li>
            <li> The perfumer behind this, Maurice Roucel, and the company, Nautica, gave a gem/gift to the world.</li>
            <li> You have to spray once on chest below adam apple and behind neck is all you need.</li>
            <li> To me, the smell is an irritating, soapy, and over powering.</li>
            <li> Not a great cologne.</li>
            <li> unless you put on your clothes which of course is not a great idea either..</li>
            <li> but the cap was broken &amp; there was a crack on the bottle.</li>
            <li> It was behind the head set.</li>
            <li> It is a rip-off so-called product.</li>
            <li> Finally, i bought an unauthentic cologne from amazon that it wasn&#x27;t a water-down piece of crap of</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its just the bad batch that they sell off for cheap or what, but very annoying when its a guessing game as to what I&#x27;m getting.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid for this though, I can hardly get mad.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed</li>
            <li> But this has a very weak scent, it staym with you for around 10 minutes</li>
            <li> Very weak fragrance.</li>
            <li> It was fake</li>
            <li> I received a FAKE bottle of Nautica Voyage.</li>
            <li> Mine is totally fake.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bought some fake Voyage, and called seller on it.  </li>
            <li> Seems like fake.</li>
            <li> Fake product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry</li>
            <li> This one clearly fails in that category.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> , I knew this was a fake.</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t a fake prime</li>
            <li> This is fake...</li>
            <li> Silly reason to like it?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fake</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe this stuff is fake at all though.</li>
            <li> I will be sticking with Versace&#x27;s &amp;#34;Pour Homme&amp;#34; for now even though it is quite expensive.</li>
            <li> FAKE.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying cologne online, but I saw the rating and read some of the reviews for this one</li>
            <li> Stay away from this unless you want to burn your money needlessly.</li>
            <li> My advice for people buying this is to be wary of buying colognes when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> Fake Product.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nautica Voyage for 2 years now and every time I wear some I always get a compliment from the ladies so you can&#x27;t go wrong with what works.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product.</li>
            <li> Fake fake.</li>
            <li> Short answer: It smells awful.</li>
            <li> Going to give him A*Men cologne this year, I heard you can&#x27;t go wrong when choosing from the House of Mugler</li>
            <li> but I think it is fake.</li>
            <li> bought this cologne last December, and now it STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY FAKE</li>
            <li> I was worried it may be some rip-off, but no way!</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with the smell.</li>
            <li> so, I blind bought it.</li>
            <li> would recommend this, but I would also recommend you to go out and smell it at a store BEFORE you blind buy.</li>
            <li> Was a blind buy for me</li>
            <li> But according to others&#x27; reviews I think i got the fake one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by this perfume at all and the smell is not even lasts for 2 hours.</li>
            <li> It is fake.</li>
            <li> The side effects are scarey tho,Who needs to go blind just when you achieve a four hour erection?</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent.</li>
            <li> - so can&#x27;t tell if mine is a fake or not.</li>
            <li> When I saw the price I thought how can you go wrong</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive for me, but i was suggested this</li>
            <li> And random people like cashiers etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You cannot go wrong with this product.  </li>
            <li> Trust me, you cant go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s illegal in nine countries.</li>
            <li> Purchasing cologne online can be a scary experience, as there isn&#x27;t a sniff test that can be performed.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this from amazon because of all the reviews warning buyers about fakes.</li>
            <li> Bought this without reading the reviews, sad to say the bottle is clearly a fake.</li>
            <li> Fake.</li>
            <li> I had struggled making this purchase after reading reviews of it being a potentially fake product.</li>
            <li> The last one i got is fake and it smellls awful.</li>
            <li> Fake ... Please do not buy...</li>
            <li> Bought this as a blind buy from Ross&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> Totally a fake.</li>
            <li> Faintly smells of rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> It was fake, there was no serial number on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Ordered one bottle, it was fake.</li>
            <li> FAKE</li>
            <li> I never thought  Nautica will be having such a horrible products</li>
            <li> i think i have recieved a fake bottle.</li>
            <li> do you think i got a fake bottle.</li>
            <li> I never review stuff I bought off Amazon before, but this stuff is fake.</li>
            <li> Im weird when it comes to cologne.</li>
            <li> product, get it if you want a cologne for casual wear without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> I wanted to find an inexpensive cologne for casual use.</li>
            <li> I use it for casual weekends.</li>
            <li> doesnt make it bad also if its expensive it doesnt make it good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Maybe its just because of the cold weather.</li>
            <li> I suppose I could carry an atomizer to resupply, but that seems awkward.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Nautica!</li>
            <li> It is Fake !</li>
            <li> Watch out, It is fake!</li>
            <li> and this is a FAKE!</li>
            <li> and I am mad</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this!</li>
            <li> In the originals, the stickers are very difficult to peel</li>
            <li> but it wears like a very expensive one.</li>
            <li> I was using Crave by Calvin Klein, but, since they no longer make it, it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> or else it smells bad</li>
            <li> Bad idea!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say.</li>
            <li> but bc of bad weather it was delayed until today.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t smell bad</li>
            <li> and that could account for some of the bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell bad even after sweating and working out...</li>
            <li> Anyways it smells bad and I wont be using it.</li>
            <li> How bad can it be?</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad at all for the price.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
            <li> You wont be disappointed.</li>

            <li> But this time I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a gamble go to see if you get a real or fake.</li>
            <li> Buy it, you wont be disappointed, even if you never smelled it before.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on smelly crap.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the smell of this I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again you really only can wear it wear its cold or else it smells bad</li>
            <li> 16 year old sophomore and ALL THE LADIES LOVE IT, HIGHLY RECOMMEND. BUY IT NOW</li>
            <li> Read the reviews that&#x27;s why i got it,  i guess you get what you paid for.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. I probably have 15-20 bottles of cologne and this is now my go to. It has a fresh, crisp scent that stands out and does not wear off. Highly recommend it to any cologne connisuer!</li>
            <li> It was fake but I got a refund so&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s all good</li>
            <li> Great buy!  Fantastic scent, and decent projection.</li>
            <li> I received a FAKE bottle of Nautica Voyage. Noticed others have as well. There was no nautica sticker/serial number on the bottom. The cologne lasts like 30 minutes. It&#x27;s pathetic.</li>
            <li> So masculine...I so much love this! Great buy!!</li>
            <li> nice smell my hubby likes it</li>
            <li> Excellent. .. once ..thanks</li>
            <li> Really loved this. I went to buy it because of its positive review and I can&#x27;t be more happy. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This cologne smells good, so I like it.</li>
            <li> Good smell. Feels fresh. Good value for money</li>
            <li> everyone likes the smell and they usually ask me what brand it is too</li>
            <li> The reviews don&#x27;t lie, this is a good smelling spring/summer cologne for the $20 price range. My only complaint is that I&#x27;ve found it lasts 2-3 hours.... I would love for it to go more like 4-5. Overall though not a bad buy and has an excellent fresh smell with a hint of sweetness to it. Good for day to day use or even the gym. I bought this on a blind buy without smelling it and was pleased. If you have the extra twenty dollars, give it a try, it&#x27;s liked for a reason!</li>
            <li> Mine is totally fake. I have compared it to an original one and varies with the package, also the fragance feels different.</li>
            <li> A great fragrance for me at a great price.</li>
            <li> Price was worth the smell! Love smelling like the beach and always getting compliments.</li>
            <li> Perfect !! Price and quality are very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Came fast.  My husbands favorite cologne.</li>
            <li> Longevity:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts.  It lasts for a very long time.  I would come back home from work and it&#x27;d still lingers on me.  And during laundry day on the weekend, the clothes still have the smell.  It&#x27;s an amazing longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has strong smell of rose to it but in a masculine way.  Definitely smells masculine, no hint of feminine smell.  It smells clean.  My first reaction upon smelling this the first time was... clean... masculine... nice... strong... some hint of floral... um.. I think I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for work.  For formal settings.  For everyday fragrance.  It could work for a night out but not the perfect fragrance for that settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final words:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How ever nice this fragrance is, it still didn&#x27;t make as one of my favorite fragrances.  Reasons are:  1. It smells familiar to many people.  It&#x27;s simply too common.  2.  It&#x27;s smell has slight similarity to laundry detergent.  3.  For single guys, this fragrance will not help your game.  This make you smell &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34;, but not &amp;#34;attractive&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> awesome smell, people give nice comments</li>
            <li> I think I purchased a knockoff from Amazon. Looks legitimate, but smells like a household cleaner of some kind. Don&#x27;t buy cologne from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Look&#x27;s like the product i received is fake, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t even last an hour.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my hausband&#x27;s birthday. He liked it. I also like the smell and it lasts for almost 2 days.</li>
            <li> I have been using this Nautica Men&#x27;s Cologne for many years now and it is fantastic. It smells very refreshing and I have received many complements over the years from friends and even strangers. Few of my friends have also decided to start using it after I told them about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lasts the whole day, very refreshing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff...smells so good on my guy! Had to buy more!!</li>
            <li> very nice cologne! Love it!</li>
            <li> Yes, it was cheap and it does linger. BUT, it was not what I wanted it in a men&#x27;s cologne at all. It has a very light and almost floral scent. For guys that want a bit of a stronger and mature scent I would not recommend this at all.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing cologne. It is great for the summer. This is a aquatic scent which makes the girls go GHA-GHA over you! I wouold recommend ages 14-30 to wear this! Also, make sure you get the 3.4 once because it is actually cheaper then the 1.7! Just don&#x27;t buy it from Amazon, buy it from the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; ones.</li>
            <li> This is good parfum, the price is low in comparison with other seller. it&#x27;s recomended for special ocations or other activities</li>
            <li> for new conquests. and also to maintain the current. My wife loves the smell. me too and the Price too.</li>
            <li> Love it, long lasting and smells great.</li>
            <li> This Nautica Voyage cologne has an amazing scent. When you spray it, it lasts for a long time. Usually a spray or two on the neck or wrist will make it last much longer than on clothing because the heat from your arteries and the sweat on your skin complement and amplify the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;The cologne lasts a very long time&lt;br /&gt;The cologne has an aquatic scent mixed with some citrus accents and musk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would add is that buyers should be aware that cologne is made of chemicals and can change it&#x27;s scent when exposed to warm temperatures and light. I bought this in the summer so when I got the cologne, it was quite warm to the touch. Some colognes smell downright nasty after being in the heat but as for this one, it still smelled good.</li>
            <li> This smells really good and is quite a bit less than you can find it  in the stores! Plus you don&#x27;t have to go the mall!</li>
            <li> smells great:D perfect present</li>
            <li> My husband loves he smell! Seems to smell real I don&#x27;t know though lol. If my hubby is happy I am happy!! Makes him smell so sexy</li>
            <li> Good lasting fragrance. Nice perfume at this price.</li>
            <li> I bought this one blind because of all the positive reviews and it&#x27;s the #1 seller here at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up really liking the smell.  It&#x27;s a nice, fresh and clean sort of smell.  At first, I was putting it on and I swear it was wearing off after 4 hours.  I would put it on after my morning shower and by lunch, I couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore.  This was all last week when it was colder outside.  Now that the weather is warming up, for some reason I&#x27;m still going strong all day long.  I think it seeps into your skin and when you sweat a little, it brings it out.  Should make for a really nice summer scent!</li>
            <li> The perfect fragante for me!</li>
            <li> quick service; great product; my son loves it.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRICE and great fragrance!  Shipped quickly, only problem this has to be signed for which was not in the order information.&lt;br /&gt;I was not home when delivery was attempted during normal working hours so merchandise is returned to local shipping terminal (UPS).  I had to drive quite a distance to pick this up which is quite an inconvenience and costly with the price of gas.  I wonder why in the world this isn&#x27;t delivered to the mailbox or front porch like all the other merchandise I order from Amazon?</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. Drives the ladies wild :-) Love the price and fast shipping from this vendor.</li>
            <li> Repeat order.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> last time i had a bottle was 2007 &amp; only buying it now since my all time favorite Gucci Envy is discontiued &amp; cost $300 for 3.4oz lol</li>
            <li> Great fragance, don&#x27;t even think it, just buy it! It&#x27;s affordable and also women will love it ! Thanks from Vzla</li>
            <li> I bought this for my brother for his birthday. He absolutely loves the smell of it.</li>
            <li> This is really the best bang for buck out there right now for cologne. You get a lot of it , it smells great, it lasts, and its cheap. Whats not to love about it. Everyone that has smelled it has told me its smells really good, and a few of my friends have asked where I got it. I recommend this to anyone that doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on smelly crap.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like this one. Sharp note just kind of stings the nose. Longevity and projection are so so. I am not going to buy this one again. I&#x27;m not even sure I&#x27;ll be able to use it all :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for about 4 years now and still get compliments consistently from people all of the time.</li>
            <li> my all time favorite for daily use - price is good so I gift it to my friends and family back home too.</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it, the package was great and the shipping time was excellent&lt;br /&gt;wonderful&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product was just what I expected&lt;br /&gt;I loved&lt;br /&gt;my husband is very happy and best at low prices</li>
            <li> very good product, i didnt have problem, is importar producto for de people. is complement for me in my life</li>
            <li> I am happy with this item. It is very useful and practical. Good quality. I recommend it. Great job. Thank you.</li>
            <li> great product great price whats not to like</li>
            <li> I went looking for a new cologne.  I like a simple, masculine, old-fashioned fragrance.  I was drawn to Nautica Voyage, but the salesperson said it was cheap and wouldn&#x27;t last.  I ended up buying two other colognes, both excellent:  Skulls and Roses and Armani Code.  But, then I still bought the bottle of the Voyage anyway (great price).  To my surprise, Voyage has lasting power no less excellent than the more expensive ones, and I love it.  It&#x27;s become my regular and the other more expensive ones are \\&quot;for a change.\\&quot;  For me, there is something almost addictive about Nautica Voyage.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. Wow at first I was a little sceptical of buying something that is usually twice as expensive in the store. I thought maybe it was a cheap replica or something. But it&#x27;s the real thing!! Nautica Voyage is around $60 in most department stores. I got it for $27 (less than half price)!! It&#x27;s the real deal:) Great product great price!!! A+A+A++</li>
            <li> Nice product good price</li>
            <li> I am on the fence as to whether this is a knock or not.</li>
            <li> I like this fragrance! Not too bold; not too subtle, but a clean, just-showered fresh scent that last for most of the day. I recommend its use for all occasions, and the price (per fluid ounce through Amazon for a 100ml bottle) is hard to beat.</li>
            <li> Cheap and really good</li>
            <li> My husband loves this.  Arrive quickly.</li>
            <li> I did buy it from Macy&#x27;s so we can discard the cheap knockoff dialogue from buying online. But this cologne has a cheap smell, it lasts for sure, hours maybe days, again it was from Macy&#x27;s. The issue is from the cologne itself. This is one of the few times I buy general brand names instead of a designer name perfume. There is a clear difference between these class of Nautica&#x27;s and the class of say Christian Dior perfumes. The designers have a solid signature in their smell, this one reminded me of some knockoff smell, the cheap signature is in the background, faintly there, if you have been using designer names you will notice, else you probably will not and will think its is great cologne. Waste of money for me, better I even bought it online at the knockoff price instead of the Macy&#x27;s truckload price. I least I will blame it on the online sellers.</li>
            <li> Scent on this perfume is pretty...nautical. Smells clean -nothing pretentious, just enough for being noted- Good for everyday use, does not last for long, but for the money you put in, definitively a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Identical to department store&#x27;s except nearly half the price.</li>
            <li> It smells good, but for a reason every time I wear it, it gets me headache .</li>
            <li> Not overpowering, super cologne. Stays with you most of the day and a little goes a long way. My Girlfriend bought this as a gift and is now a little jealous when other girls comment on it. Ha!</li>
            <li> I was recommended Nautica Voyage by a friend of mine who loves collecting fragrances. Turned out to be one of the best I&#x27;ve tried in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a lovely fresh fragrance... quite pleasant, not overbearingly strong, but &#x27;just right&#x27;. lingers on for a long time... For me, it has been hard to find something that is mild, pleasant, long-lasting and yet economical. The mild ones were either too mild or too short-lasting, and the strong ones are too overbearing. I get a headache if I wear such fragrances too long.&lt;br /&gt;Also the good ones usually cost a lot. This one - Nautica Voyage, however was one perfume that I felt was just right.  And great value for money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A cousin of mine to whom I gifted this was also all praise for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Purchased these for the third time, can&#x27;t recommend enough</li>
            <li> I bought this before at a store and spent 50 dollars for it this was a bargen love the smell would by from here again</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and having bought this cologne several times from multiple places, you can&#x27;t beat this price! For those of you wondering, this is NOT a knockoff.</li>
            <li> Had to give this one away. Smells like bug spray on me.  Must be my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Quick and timely delivery of product.  Product is exactly as expected, including manufacture&#x27;s original packaging (with cellophane wrapping). Scent is very pleasant and noticeable.  According to others, the scent is long-lasting, but not too intense.  I particularly enjoy the scent for a few minutes after application in the morning, but within an hour I no longer notice it, as it has combined with my body chemistry. I suppose, the best way to summarize it would be to state that the first note is enticing, the second note works perfectly with my body chemistry and third note is strong/deep as it last throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This perfume is pretty nice. Compared to Cool Water by Davidoff, it blows it away. Voyage smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t overpower you, nor does it completely impregnate you like others. Oh yeah and its not super cliche&#x27;d like Aqua de Gio. Get complements on this one all the time. A+.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t say smell good or smell bad,just nothing.</li>
            <li> Nice scent at a good price will shop again</li>
            <li> Good price... Nice smell.. Good presentation....</li>
            <li> I think I received my package in one day, which was pleasantly surprising. The cologne smells great and I have received many complements already.</li>
            <li> Well... that is one of my fave colognes and it got here real quick.... now the best part was the price...a real bargain!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  I was a little nervous buying cologne over the internet, but read the reviews on this one and decided to try it.  You guys were right!  It smells sooo nice.  My son(for whom it was a gift) loves it and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> The bottle I got was just about water, you could barley smell it right from the bottle or after 2 to 3 minutes later on your skin.  Amazon should look into this</li>
            <li> SMELLS AMAZING! You don&#x27;t need to use a lot and it last throughout the day. My fiancee will spray 1-3 sprays and go to work, when he returns home you can still smell it. He received this the Christmas of 2013 and still has more than a half left of it. I love the smell. its very sexxyyy</li>
            <li> The cologne arrived in good condition and appears to be new.  It&#x27;s for a holiday gift so I have not opened it to give a better analysis of the product.</li>
            <li> Great price for a big size</li>
            <li> Great deal and smells great...</li>
            <li> Smells great..long last..</li>
            <li> Great price and best nautical cologne they have.</li>
            <li> Thanks.... This smells so good</li>
            <li> It is my first perfume by NAUTICA but the only thing i can say is it&#x27;s simply tremendously perfect sent and incredible deep powerful but also not hard!!!i wore it one once when i went to work and a girl who never talked to me told me straight: &#x27;&#x27; you smell good&#x27;&#x27; like that without shyness or whatever .....i was convince right the way that this perfume got something really powerful you can&#x27;t even suspect!!!!guys tha one is for you</li>
            <li> One word to describe the smell of this: Fresh! The smell is very clean and refreshing, I get compliments all the time on it. Ladies should think twice about buying this for their husband/boyfriend as this cologne is threat to your monogamy. i have endured many a epic adventure riding the fumes of this magical scent.</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage is a great product! I recently bought it for my boyfriend because he needed an extra cologne for work. He wanted something that smelled fresh but wasn&#x27;t very expensive. He loves it and so do I. I actually like it as much as I like his more expensive colognes, like Hugo. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great super fast shipping smell great</li>
            <li> I loved this one. Anyone can wear this one. I think this is the best light summer fragrance</li>
            <li> i just can say Excellent</li>
            <li> The price I paid online for the Nautica Voyage is half of that Kohl&#x27;s, this a great deal and  I receive many good compliments on its fragrance and asked what I am wearing :)!!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband who isn&#x27;t a big cologne guy and he likes it... so do I.  Gave it 4 stars because packing was HORRIBLE.  It was in a box with no bubble wrap so it was sliding all around.  Thankfully it was in good shape when it arrived.  But c&#x27;mon.  Overall, this is a great deal for a great scent on my man.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY cologne I liked out of an entire cologne outlet I went through. And years of trying different colognes. (Aside from Aqua Di Gio, which everyone and their grandpa wears. But even that wasn&#x27;t as incredible as this stuff!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a SUPER price, This stuff smells SOOOOOO good, I&#x27;ve gotten a trillion compliments on it. It lasts forever, you don&#x27;t need a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~NAUTICA VOYAGE!</li>
            <li> A refreshing option for men who don&#x27;t want a cloying scent.</li>
            <li> My first day wearing the Nautica Voyage I received compliments.  I love it. It&#x27;s refreshing and mellow.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone shopping around for cologne.</li>
            <li> - Nautica brand name for men&lt;br /&gt;- Stronger scent than the very cheap version from Nautica, seems to last a little longer throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;- Price is right, I used to spend 40-60 dollar on cologne, but in recent years find this type of value makes much more sense&lt;br /&gt;- Amazon delivered quickly!</li>
            <li> Smells good better than Nautica Pure</li>
            <li> at first I didn&#x27;t like the scent but I grew to love it! it last for a very long time as well. I sprayed it on my boyfriend Friday night and when I went to wash his clothes Sunday, I could smell the fragrance.  Its not overwhelming just dont use much. 3 sprays back of neck, chest n wrist</li>
            <li> Very quick delivery....this was a gift and the recipients were very pleased.</li>
            <li> How good is this scent?  While leaving WalMart and walking to our car, with dozens of smells wafting through the air, my wife wife shuddered, snuggled up to me, and commented how great I smelled.  &#x27;Nuf said.</li>
            <li> The smell is great but it doesn&#x27;t last long...it would be a 5 star cologne if it last at least 5 hours.....</li>
            <li> prompt delivery very happy</li>
            <li> What can I say, I love the mellow summer fragrance. It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t cost nearly as much as other designer colognes.</li>
            <li> Nobody has ever noticed this perfume on me, even myself. The scent goes away after a few minutes. Only one time, when my girlfriend was hugging me, she noticed it and said: you smell like soap (or shampoo) !</li>
            <li> Having used Davidoff Cool Water as my standard go-to everyday scent I decided to try Nautica Voyage and equally found myself in agreement with the other reviewers who made the comparison. However this is a few steps up from Cool Water and is a much longer lasting fresh clean scent that any guy would appreciate as it goes all day and does attract the compliments that you get from time to time wearing a good cologne and with Amazon you can always guarantee timely delivery and good prices.</li>
            <li> Purchased it twice! My husband&#x27;s new fave.</li>
            <li> Recently ran out of my staple aftershave Nautica Voyage.  On a lark, I decided to see what it cost shopping for it on Amazon.  Amazing.........it came in at about one half the cost I&#x27;d been paying at a national Department Store whose first initial is \\&quot;M\\&quot;.  So, I know where it will be bought from here on out.  The product arrived in a sealed factory box, so I know I got the same product.  A really great buy.</li>
            <li> Nautica &amp;#34;Island Voyage&amp;#34; is better, but this is pretty nice.  Girls get in close and want to smell it  ;)  Much more so than other colognes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought some fake Voyage, and called seller on it.  They got PO&#x27;d!!!  LOL  Nautica said they&#x27;d trade me a real one for the fake, but they didn&#x27;t have anymore of the Island Voyage, so they sent me this...  I&#x27;m not displeased with this at all!  It&#x27;s money well spent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why this is so cheap on here, but it is the real deal. Arrived sealed in a Nautica box with bar code (which I only mention because some people seem to assume it is fake or ghetto).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the smell, it is good. I don&#x27;t know how to describe smell, other than to say it, for some reasons, smells like summer to me</li>
            <li> Very ligt effect. Intially its good for couple of hours only.</li>
            <li> This cologne is a classic that smells nice and comes at a great price.  My husband has been wearing it for years and it is one of his favorites--up there with Polo Black.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne!  Haven&#x27;t had it in a long time, and just happened to run into it while shopping on amazon. Great price too!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok not so strong and no long lasting. smell good when spray later no smell at all. I never tried before so want to try just.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance. Nice smell.</li>
            <li> For the price I got this cologne I am pretty surprised at its result. It smells really nice and fresh. It is one of those fragrances  that will make you feel good with yourself... and of course FRESH. I use it often and mix it with the more expensive yet cliche scents cos I hate walking around smelling like every Tom out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy again? Heck Yes. It is my go-to scent for regular and casual use just because of the price. I will be exploring other Nautica scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, good smell the fragrance is lasting, not strong for daily use it is ideal,good investment in terms of price</li>
            <li> I really love this fragrance, it&#x27;s not too strong or too soft and I always get complements for this. Another thing is that the price here is the best you will find because I went to a Perfume Outlet store in an outlet mall and their price was almost 10+ dollars more.</li>
            <li> Longevity is something you search for in a designer fragrance, and Nautica Voyage delivers. One to three sprays of this scent, and you&#x27;ll be able to smell it the next day. Seriously. I have smelled and tested hundreds of colognes, and Voyage is near the top for a lasting fragrance. This lasts longer than Chrome or even Obsession. 1 Million might last a bit longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get this fantastic long lasting scent from the minuscule amount that the sprayer puts out. After all, that&#x27;s why we buy expensive cologne, right? See for yourself. Go to a store. Spray a fragrance card. Smell that card in a day or two, and it will still smell like Voyage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spectacular aquatic scent. Fresh and clean. Somewhat akin to Cool Water, but better, and oh so long lasting. Nautica makes many appealing aquatic fragrances. This is my favorite. Find it in retail stores for $30+ an ounce, then come to Amazon for a better price on a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Good cologne but doesn&#x27;t stay for to long, maybe watered down but considering the price it&#x27;s not bad. I have this in my car for emergencies ;-)</li>
            <li> Excellent scents. Great for dates, minigolf, impressing the boss, taking your dog on the walk.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff makes greatgifts</li>
            <li> All expectations were met dealing with this company.  Very fast delivery and a great smelling product.  My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne! It shipped really fast too, thanks.</li>
            <li> For the last 6 yrs I&#x60;ve been receiving my cologne from Amazon.com, I&#x60;ve been using Amazon.com since when I do my surveys they give me gift cards to use. And since I&#x60;m in a wheelchair it&#x60;s hard for me to go to stores so this makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a christmas present. The person I bought it for claims to love the smell and says he gets a lot of compliments on it. For me, it doesn&#x27;t smell that great. It smells cheap.</li>
            <li> I like it and the price was super affordable</li>
            <li> Purchased this cologne for my boyfriend for Christmas.  I think it smells fantastic and he really likes it too.  It was also super cheap!  Great product!</li>
            <li> Similar to a couple other Nautica colognes that I have.Very nice scent on this one and long lasting.</li>
            <li> is excelent... good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much</li>
            <li> the price is great and the smell so smooth the senses</li>
            <li> fragrence does not last long....and did not like it either.</li>
            <li> Light, crisp scent may ware off a little too quickly but otherwise it smells good and it&#x27;s priced right.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Totally awesome, will buy again</li>
            <li> Smells great a little bit after its used, but definitely lasts the whole day and is a good scent for the money.</li>
            <li> Ordered two bottles directly from Amazon, not 3rd party seller. The two bottles were authentic, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> great love the smell.</li>
            <li> Great fresh fragrance.  Husband loves it.  Price and delivery time were great.</li>
            <li> I got it from Amazon. I love this perfume - soothing, and strong, very masculine. I typically use it to my work and can smell it from morning to evening.</li>
            <li> This is a great basic cologne.  What I mean is that it&#x27;s sort of right down the middle.  It&#x27;s the Super Mario of colognes.  It&#x27;s fresh and also a little musky.  It&#x27;s light, but still has a little weight to it.  It&#x27;s a very safe fragrance that can&#x27;t really disappoint.  It also won&#x27;t knock your socks off either.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Nice size for the price.  My son like the smell and so do  I.  The light clean smell does not bother my sinus.</li>
            <li> Very nice subtle scent. I will keep it around.</li>
            <li> Seems like fake. It does not last for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s indeed incredible to find an item that worth such a token amount . I will pay $50 dollars to get this item.  Nautica smells great and last longer than my expectations&lt;br /&gt; Indeed it is a good product and i recommend it to anyone who want a good deal for a  token price.</li>
            <li> Fake product.  Smelled like alcohol and did not last.&lt;br /&gt;Read all the bad reviews before purchasing this!&lt;br /&gt;the seller is giving me a refund.&lt;br /&gt;1/5 star for product but good customer service</li>
            <li> Good aquatic fragrance, not very expensive...can be worn day &amp; night  all through spring and summer. The Purchase was based on all the hype buzzing the internet. I admit that the first smell repulsed me, however it opens up to a great scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap&lt;br /&gt;- Longevity ( lasted me 8hrs @ work)&lt;br /&gt;- cool bottle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;- Awkward first smell&lt;br /&gt;- Takes awhile to open up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry but I think this is an impression.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is somewhat mild. A perfume does not have to be always strong enough to leave an impression. This one clearly fails in that category.&lt;br /&gt;Also the scent does not stay for long time.</li>
            <li> With most aquatic fragrances, they don&#x27;t last long. Voyage, however, is an aquatic that lasts VERY long. Projection is well above average, also. Being a low-class designer too! This exceeded all expectaions. The perfumer is very good, one of the best too, if you care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the notes and actual smell of the fragrance is stunning. This fragrance is pretty linear, but it doesn&#x27;t matter if its great throughout the whole period. Starting with a very fruity vibe, with some lavenderish-cleanish-fresh smell. It blends down with some soapy notes, with the fruit staying in there strong; I can also get a little musk in there. Overall, its a very sweet scent, and very masculine for a sweet scent too. Great for the younger crowd, but also exceptional for the 30+&#x27;s too. Perfect for highschool, college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its mostly versitle; mostly intended for the spring and summer. But with the amazing longevity, it can even last in the winter. Perfect for signature scents, I would say. And with the price, you really can&#x27;t get any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t get the Cool Water similarity. They&#x27;re very different. Cool water isn&#x27;t sweet. Its fresh and lavenderish. Despite all the marketing, cool water is actually more &#x27;green&#x27; than aquatic to me. Voyage is a true aquatic, that lasts amazingly long. Get this instead of Cool Water. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Great product , good customer service</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance and packaging.</li>
            <li> Great smell I use it almost every day</li>
            <li> Very very nice fragrance, quite fresh</li>
            <li> i love it my boy friend is in love with his nautica he want to keep buying it for ever</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I wear it all the time. Guys, girls love it.</li>
            <li> There is not a lot to say.  The product is as advertised, has a fresh, groomed and manly scent and most important doesn&#x27;t smell like my father or grandfather.  On the back side, no comments from the ladies though.  I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> It did not smell good</li>
            <li> A decent smelling, low price cologn. This is something that&#x27;s affordable to wear every day. A couple sprays in the morning and a few more around my lunch hour and I smell delicious all day!</li>
            <li> It is good...I like it</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t opened it yet but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Turns heads every single time. My favorite by far. If you&#x27;re a dude, and don&#x27;t have this cologne, order it now!</li>
            <li> Smells so good. I get compliments all the time. People can&#x27;t believe that it is so inexpensive. The smell lasts a long time,too.</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s counterfit... smell stays just for a while, beware</li>
            <li> Just one word yummy!! Very sweet it smells good last long you will be completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect too much when I first ordered this item, but looking at the rating and the amount of reviews I figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  Boy was I right.  This product has far exceeded my expectations.  I am constantly receiving compliments on my cologne and people are always asking me what the name of it is.  This cologne simply blows any other cologne I&#x27;ve ever purchased out of the water.  I would put this cologne on par with $60+ competitors!  I will definitely be purchasing this cologne again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use as a body mist or so. It is not of a quality to be really called an eau de toilette or so.&lt;br /&gt;I never thought Cotty products would qualify as anything more than cheap. It was not &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; or repugnant but do not get your hope up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t really last long and I would have been even happy with one hour of effect!</li>
            <li> I have bought quite a few perfumes from Amazon and sometimes from its affiliates. And many a times, I doubted the Authenticity of the perfumes. After buying this one from Amazon direct, my doubts are now confirmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the exact same bottle from a departmental store, it seems in the originals, the shrink-wraps can be opened from the sides as well. In this case(fake), only from the top or bottom (for easy repackage of return items or demos). I learned that from an expert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, the sticker on the bottom of the perfume bottle came off very easily and I could not spot any serial number info either. A very good sign. In the originals, the stickers are very difficult to peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And most important test is of course the smell. And the very first few sprays, I knew this was a fake. Smelled nothing but alcohol. What ever little smell it had faded in 1-2 hours. The original one from the dept store lasts for a 8-10 hrs if not more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone in law enforcement needs to do something about this. This is getting out of hand if companies like Amazon knowingly or unknowingly are doing this. I have now serious doubts about my Bvlgari Aqua and Armani Aqua de Jio as well. Coz when I had tried them on at the local store, I remember they lasting quite long and the ones I actually purchased from Amazon (direct) for half price hardly makes it through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gosh, I am a perfume freak and have bought at least 15-20 diff perfumes for me and my wife in the last 2 years from Amazon and its affiliate alone. How many of these are fakes !?</li>
            <li> The smell lasted less than 15 min, I believe the product is watered down.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh,mild to strong,cool,and crisp. I&#x27;ve had ton of compliments about this already and I haven&#x27;t had it more then a week. One spray works wonders, it is strong but very appealing to the senses. What an unbelievable price as well. Payed $28 total using Amazon.com rather then $64 in the store. Awesome idea!</li>
            <li> I love this scent, all the girls either like it or love it. Instead of spending over $50 for a bottle cologne get this for sure i actually have 3 bottles of this cologne among others but definetly my favorite.</li>
            <li> Guys if u live Not strong, but nice great cologne this is great not only does it remind me of my home country it&#x27;s a Great smell for teenagers and adults, try it u Will NOT regret it :)</li>
            <li> My husband and I love it, he was so happy when it arrived</li>
            <li> SAVE YOUR MONEY. SMELLS LIKE ASS.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT IS A VERY GOOD QUALITY</li>
            <li> I was using Polo Sport for a long time, if you love Polo sport, you will like this. The scent is similar to Polo sport, active scent, if you know what I mean. Last for several days, even after I wash my shirt, I can stills smell the scent. Great!</li>
            <li> Hubby smells awesome :)</li>
            <li> Bought two bottles for xmas gifts. Great great price on them. Came well packaged, brand new with the plastic still in tact.</li>
            <li> This item was just as described.  Very fast shipping and smooth transaction.  The bottle came in its original package and was brand new.  I am very pleased</li>
            <li> Fake. Didn&#x27;t even bother returning. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> Item arrived promptly and was excellent. Thanks so much 😁</li>
            <li> Bought This on a whim as I hadn&#x27;t smelled it before but I saw how highly rated it was. Dang this stuff smells fresh. at first I would catch myself getting a whiff of it when Im doing something else and going Wo that smells good! And then thinking oh thats me, Thats the Voyage.&lt;br /&gt;Good Price for a very decent product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great price</li>
            <li> Very pleased with my purchase and it wasn&#x27;t a fake prime is the best way to shop people</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!! It smells good and it&#x27;s a good amount.. Defiantly more than what I expected.. Thank you so much!! My boyfriend is going to like this:-).</li>
            <li> Great Smell, great price, good to wear daily or for special occasions</li>
            <li> Had very little scent. Very disappointed should have read all the one star reviews.</li>
            <li> Great soapy scent with great projection and moderate longevity.  Works well for a right out of the shower scent, gym or activity scent.  Gets compliments, but most women don&#x27;t prefer soapy scents with the exception of Prada amber pour homme.  Still, this and Thierry Mugler&#x27;s Cologne are my two go-to guys for gym scents.  Doesn&#x27;t smell inoffensive and could be mistaken for a strong soap.</li>
            <li> este es un buen producto y ademas la entrega es super rapida del mismo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buen vendedor</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage is a very nice Perfume and stays long. Its cheaper compared to many branded perfume. Worth the money. Love it a lot. I like it better than Nautica Summer.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my hubby.he really love and appreciate it. Is authentic</li>
            <li> For the price and smell</li>
            <li> Not sweet or overpowering.  Smells like cologne, not perfume.  The women that have been close enough to smell it seem to like it.</li>
            <li> I loved it! It was exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> great cologne, especially considering it&#x27;s low price. lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love Nautica Voyage!! I get compliments on it wherever I go. This is a must have fragrance! After using Ralph Lauren Polo No. 1, I will be buying bottles of this by the case!</li>
            <li> Not what i expected. Fragrance is kinda plain and overused. Although it lasts a fair amount of hours it smells kinda cheap and similar to so many other common inexpensive retail brands</li>
            <li> Amazon offered this product for a very good price.  Gave it a try, and have been very happy.  Everyone has been asking me what kind of cologne I&#x27;m wearing.  The fragrance smells great.  Although the fragrance last longer on clothing than on your person, it does the job.  I ordered another bottle.</li>
            <li> Gave as gift which was appreciated. Sorry no actual feed back.&lt;br /&gt;DS PA</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne as a gift for my husband. It smells great, and lasts all day. Fresh masculine fragrance that’s light and not too overwhelming. Product was packaged well, and delivered promptly.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! I love when my husband wears this.</li>
            <li> Amazing price on this great brand. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Happy.  it&#x27;s perfect  to use  in a sunny  day. A good  deal  for  the  price.</li>
            <li> The Sent lasts very long time and it&#x27;s probably best suited for teenagers or early twenties.</li>
            <li> A good smell. My dad is a cologne junkie. Got this for Christmas gift. Who doesn&#x27;t like to smell good?</li>
            <li> Smells great. I become nose blind to the smell very quickly but my girlfriend can pick up a dirty hoodie from last week and it will still smell good.</li>
            <li> not sure if its real, smells like rubbing alcohol and last 2 seconds oh well</li>
            <li> This was released in 2009 and is a great addition to the Nautical line of fragrances for men. I love it and receive compliments. Go to fragrances.net for a complete breakdown of the scent composition. An outstanding value here at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> The smell last less then 15 min, I believe the product is watered down.....</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent, Nice fragrance. Doesn&#x27;t smell cheap. If you are looking for perfume under $20, this one is the best.Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Girlfriend loves it</li>
            <li> Fresh clean scent. My girl loves it, so will by again</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed having elegant and manly perfume, but I usually dislike the big punch associated with most of them. This has definitely been satisfying and smooth, and I instantly got a compliment at how I smelled the first time I used this perfume when hanging out with a friend (girl).</li>
            <li> Compre este perfume aunque no lo habia olido antes solo porque si, y admito que cuando lo oli al principio tuve mis dudas, pero luego quede convencido de que huele muy bien y el olor perdura muuucho.Ademas por el precio no esta mal.</li>
            <li> Great job expediting my purchase.</li>
            <li> I get complements from the ladies nonstop baby.</li>
            <li> Ok so the reviews are all true!! I get compliments from everybody on how good I smell. I was using Cool Water for many years but this by far beats it!!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells really good.  The bottle itself is nice and heavy and the stuff inside it&#x27;s totally worth the price in my opinion.  Better than Nautica Blue and I really like that stuff too!</li>
            <li> This is a great item and would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Scent doesn&#x27;t last that long.</li>
            <li> Very good experience, have received exactly what I ordered and in the expcted time! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Wanna smell fresh, clean &amp; nice ? This cologne is for you. The scent is mildly strong and you just can&#x27;t bare, but to smell this fragrance over and over again. This product doesn&#x27;t smell cheap, although the price makes it look cheap. Mine came today and the scent is still the same when my sister first bought it for me. Don&#x27;t believe in love at first sight? Well you will when you get this cologne and spray it on for the first time and many other times to come</li>
            <li> The best perfume i have every owned. Just love it. it is so energetic and last long too. one of the best products out there.</li>
            <li> Best smelling cologne ever! Only had for 2 days and already had a lot of compliments!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good price, very good smelling scent that lasts forever! (i could still smell it after sleeping in bed for like 10 hours haha)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very fast shipping. My new fav cologne.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend  and well he seems happy so five stars</li>
            <li> Cheap cologne, a clean beachy scent, won&#x27;t turn heads but still gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Scent is nice but only seems to last an hour or so, then I can&#x27;t detect it any longer. Going to test on something I&#x27;m not wearing to make sure I&#x27;m not just getting so used to the scent that I can&#x27;t detect it, but my other cologne I can still smell the next morning from just one spray (it&#x27;s not strong or overbearing, just long-lasting, seemingly unlike this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen warnings about possible fakes, but my bottle has the sticker and serial number on the bottom that I&#x27;ve heard is indicative of the real deal.</li>
            <li> Nice scent but wears off rather quickly</li>
            <li> This is a good cologne for the price. But it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
            <li> Awesome...my husband loved it.</li>
            <li> Good product, good price, but overrated aquatic scent that is too common.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on Friday and received it on Monday, very fast! This is another one of my favorite scents that I had to have again. It&#x27;s fresh and crisp almost like cucumbers and ocean waves!</li>
            <li> It was great what I putchased it for</li>
            <li> Pros: Nice smell, stay fair enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: No matter how you hold the bottle, it will LEAK while you spray!!</li>
            <li> This heavy glass cologne bottle accidentally landed head first on my carpet. I come to know the pump didn&#x27;t work anymore. The funnel tube disconnected from the pump.&lt;br /&gt;Other than that the cologne is OK.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very light sporty scent.&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 3 stars but then I like the amount (3.4 fl) I have bought it for.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for every day use.&lt;br /&gt;Just don&#x27;t toss your heavy glass bottle head first or else you&#x27;ll find yourself taping your bottle into your palm like an after shaver.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell. I have women chasing me down the streets now. :)&lt;br /&gt;Just kidding of course but it does have a clean smell that my wife really likes.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and smelled great</li>
            <li> there was no sticker at the bottom of the bottle. also the scent was not lasting more than an hardly an hour. the customer care has replaced it. need to wait and see what is coming in the replacement,</li>
            <li> Came just as advertised. Read several reviews that said the scent was gone in 15 minutes, etc. I sprayed this one time, and after about the 6th hour it was still so strong it nearly gave me a headache, but the scent is very nice and I&#x27;ve already gotten several comments on it. I would absolutely order this again.</li>
            <li> This is fake... i bought 2 of this item (one for me and one for gift)... when i use it at beginning nice smell... but it just last 2 or 3 hours... i will ask for a refund...</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! !  Smells so great!!</li>
            <li> Smells very, very, very, VERY good. A lot of compliments using this cologne. Very strong, only need about 4 squirts to last ALL DAY. Also, for only about $25, you can&#x27;t beat that. 5 stars</li>
            <li> Lasts for days like no joke it really smells.good</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing 10/10. i got mine from SavingsClub and it appears to be real. I sprayed it on my hand and 10 minutes later i washed my hand with water and it still smells great</li>
            <li> Love this perfume !&lt;br /&gt;Order came in on time.</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing for men.  I ordered it from Amazon due to the incredible savings over getting it at the mall.  It arrived quickly, was in new packaging, and is exactly what I expected.  Not a knock-off immitation brand.</li>
            <li> I have used this cologne for several years.  It is a crisp, clean fragrance that is not overpowering, which is important since I work in a \\&quot;Fragrance Free Zone\\&quot; but I wear it anyway!  Recently purchased through Amazon at a low price and it arrived via ground shipping in only 3 days.</li>
            <li> I routinely get stopped by women at bars and clubs saying how good i smell.  This thing kicks ass- especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34; once it&#x27;s settled. It smells artificial and synthetic at first, but dissipates to an OK smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will work well if you&#x27;re a teenager and want a cheap cologne that&#x27;ll do it&#x27;s job, but get it 15 minutes before you leave the house. I use this at work for when I rush to the office and didn&#x27;t have time to shower.</li>
            <li> Size is Ok but l don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li> The smell definitely lasts, but the longevity is undermined with the fact that it is not as fragrant as other colognes I have used. Overall a good product, but I have gotten better compliments using other brands.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and he loves this....oh and I do too!! Ladies this is a great gift for your husband;)</li>
            <li> It smells terrific w/o being overwhelming. My young son-inlay also uses it and really likes it as well.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle looks beautiful on the sink. Silly reason to like it? No, just another reason.&lt;br /&gt;It is a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite fresh scents for a good price</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it! The smell lasts all day! I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fake</li>
            <li> Fragrance is just OK. I wish I would have gone for CK Eternity just by paying some extra bucks. But for the folks who love this fragrance, its good for the price.</li>
            <li> love it, get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> MY SON AND MY HUSBAND LOVES THE NAUTICAL VOYAGE FOR MEN.  THE FRAGANCE OF NAUTICA SMELLS SOFT AND VERY GENTLE.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells great....or at least it did smell great.  When I first got it, I used it every day.  I could smell it all day and was given many compliments on how nice I smelled.  :)  But for some reason, over several months of daily use...it&#x27;s effect seemed to wear off.  I stopped smelling it (maybe I was just used to it?) and I never heard anyone else mention it.  I asked my wife if she could smell it still and she said &amp;#34;umm...sort of?&amp;#34;  This may just be my body&#x27;s chemistry adapting to it, lessening the effects.  But for the first few months, it was tremendous so I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars.  You might just need to cycle on and off of it like some dietary supplements.  I don&#x27;t believe this stuff is fake at all though.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty good, I put one spray on my wrist and it does last for awhile. But the smell is not so strong as when I first put it on. Let&#x27;s see how many compliments I will get. I will update later.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect $14 cologne will be this great.  I saw a lot of sketchy reviews and i was hesitated to order this.  Apparently, you have to buy it from a legit seller.  I bought it from Beauty Encounters and it&#x27;s legit.  8/10 smell,  10/10 lasting, 8/10 appearance, 10/10 pricing. Would love to buy it again</li>
            <li> Smell ok but like the nautica blue better</li>
            <li> Smells Great! Nice n light</li>
            <li> You truly cannot beat the price on this, at least when I bought it - it was $20. Same cologne in the store, in a smaller amount, was $42. It&#x27;s a subtle smell and my husband loves it. I love that I didn&#x27;t have to pay $42!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a gift and we both love it! Definitely a young, fresh, clean scent that isn&#x27;t too overpowering but is very long-lasting. Makes me think of summer days and the ocean--perfect for an energetic, out-door sort of guy.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, or as great as it can be at this price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not much of a cologne wearer to be honest.  I got used to just buying cheap body spray during my grocery runs so I have the hygiene habits of a acne-ridden teenage boy apparently.  But I will say that once I started using this instead I did get a number of positive comments about it from my female friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it was just more noticeable because I smelled like garbage before....but hey good news nonetheless!</li>
            <li> He loved this smell!!!!!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t my favorite scent.</li>
            <li> Not as expected. Smell doesn&#x27;t last long. Nothing that stands out about this perfume.</li>
            <li> The smell remains for a day or two. I&#x27;ve got a lot of complements for it. It&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li> Ordered directly from Amazon. Smell is very default (like something very mundane, fake, counterfeit) and goes away in 30 seconds.Idk what to do with it.</li>
            <li> Nice, soft scent... quite casual. highly recomended for night hangouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is not world&#x27;s finest Cologne but It shall do the trick.</li>
            <li> Smells good although cheap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nobody has pointed that out yet</li>
            <li> Great scent!!!  Got it fast w/ Prime... Will definitely order this again!!</li>
            <li> My friends and I love it...</li>
            <li> been using it for months just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t just a placebo effect, but the cologne doesn&#x27;t last long for me. Maybe a few hours? not at all what I expected. Possibly recieved a fake however the sticker was indeed on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I am a 23 year old male and have never worn perfume/deodorant in my life. Until my landlord and I were driving to pick up some strudels and he mentioned that I should get my own perfume/spray. I think that he was indirectly telling me that I was smelly without being offensive, which I am grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I look at amazon for the best rated &amp; most affordable cologne for men and this was it. When it arrived, I was excited... until I sprayed it and entered into state of hysterical regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever gone in clubs/dances and brush by many men smelling a mixture of their sweat + strong and repugnant perfume? Based on my limited experience this perfume brought back those memories.  It made me think, &amp;#34;oh so this is what 30% of those guys were wearing?&amp;#34; What a shame because I do not like the smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is my fault.</li>
            <li> like it, not aggressive, soft and nice for daily use</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic! You can&#x27;t go wrong with Nautica! This is the best smelling cologne I have ever had in my collection!!!</li>
            <li> got complimented more than i expected</li>
            <li> The best when it comes to smell without giving me any headache. It smells excellent but do not except to get any compliments unless they are very close too you... the smell is perfect, fresh unlike other Eau De Toilette that gives headache not only to me but to others as well and furthermore not many eau de toilets that I can wear when I just want to smell great without advertising to others in a very loud, noticeable or not needed way especially when working out in sports clubs.</li>
            <li> Bought this in 2012 and after about one spray per day it&#x27;s about half empty.  That makes this bottle last 1800 days, or one penny per day.  Pretty solid.</li>
            <li> Was a perfect present for my dad.</li>
            <li> Smells great and longevity is just about right. I do not smell anything after 12 hours, but who needs it more than that. My wife is fine with it. It does not hurt my 20 months old son&#x27;s nostrils when I take him.</li>
            <li> My husband gifted this to his uncle. He loved it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff and you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> i have received today Nautica Voyage , after my first use i ordered another nautica voyage . it smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Husband&#x27;so favorite! Great price!</li>
            <li> Great price and amazing smell!</li>
            <li> Excellent price and quality packaging.</li>
            <li> My sons are in their 30&#x27;s they love the stuff.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and haven&#x27;t been able to stand any fragrances but this cologne didn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s very refreshing and cool smelling. I bought it as a Christmas gift but i liked it so much i couldn&#x27;t wait. I gave it to my husband early and he has worn it everyday since!</li>
            <li> Smells great and a better price than the store !&lt;br /&gt;Great buy to make any man feel special !&lt;br /&gt;I would buy this again and again great summer scent.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  I bought one of these from Amazon and it is not genuine (I compared it to the one from the department store I bought a couple of years ago).  I looked for the tell-tale signs...turn it upside down and look at the bottom.  A genuine Nautica will have a Nautica sticker on it (it will say &#x27;Nautica Voyage&#x27; in big letters).  It should also have some sort of stamp of numbers (my original Nautica from the store had 4 numbers in black dot ink).  Also, my bottle from Amazon was poorly made; the bottom of the inside is not straight and quite noticeable.  Lastly, the Amazon bottle smells slightly off after an hour.  I also had my wife smell my shirt where I sprayed different spots with the &#x27;real&#x27; bottle and the bottle from Amazon...she quickly identified the imposter.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my son. I know he love&#x27;s it, this is his favorite. It had a great price at the time I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great i love the bottle it came in sprayed it to smell it and it took my breath away i smelt this at a department store and it didnt smell as good as i got from here awesome price i only payed 17.08 for the 3.4 oz bottle great can&#x27;t say that enough about this cologne</li>
            <li> My husband wanted some more Nautica Voyage for Christmas.  I, as usual, could not pass up the price on Amazon!  $20.00 for a 3.4oz bottle!  Very happy with the product to say the least!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best smelling cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use a lot most of the time but If I happen to spray to much its not a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this cologne isn&#x27;t a Perfume base it still will hold a light watery scent sure to not scare anyone away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this a a daily cologne and it smells awesome!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Not to strong&lt;br /&gt;Stays on fairly light&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stain clothes&lt;br /&gt;Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Killer price here on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> This is a really inexpensive cologne I was not expecting it to smell 5/5 but it did and I am happy that I purchased this compliments are great. I would recommend this to any guy I know</li>
            <li> get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> I am sure others might like it but for my liking the smell is too light. will try somethign else next time.</li>
            <li> Gentelmen, if you&#x27;re looking for a manly perfume that will make wemon accidentally follow you around the house, work area, or other public place, look no further. I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and since then he smells sexier than &amp;#34;normal sexy&amp;#34;. In fact, I have found myself in the tool section while shopping with him more than once.</li>
            <li> Smells clean, but not as sharp as expected. Stays on for a long time, that&#x27;s always a plus. You only need a little bit, over-spraying will give you a headache with this scent.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. As described.</li>
            <li> Good value and I like how it smells.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Original at such a great price! Can&#x27;t beat it 😊</li>
            <li> This has blown me away. The clean smell has attracted many females to compliment me on what I was wearing. I wore Versachi prior to this and never received the compliments I do with this product. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great price very happy</li>
            <li> I received a stamped bottle with the sticker on the bottom and it smells great and lasts a long time. Some may have gotten knockoffs but it is well worth the effort to buy and exchange if you receive the low quality knockoff. Make sure your product has a serial number stamped in the glass on the bottom with a sticker over it.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, fair price, the reason for the two stars is the scent was very weak like the cologne was old.</li>
            <li> Amazing cologne,  Girls like it and that&#x27;s what matters, lol!</li>
            <li> I have bought a few as gifts for friends and family smells really good and everyone liked the Nautica</li>
            <li> The bottle looks like its real but once you put it on it does not last.&lt;br /&gt;This must be dilluted or not original because the smell is weak and does not last like the cologne you buy in stores.</li>
            <li> Smells great! One of my favorites!  Doesn&#x27;t hold scent for very long however. Needs a refresh at about 4 hours. Other than that scent alone has me coming back for more.</li>
            <li> Everyone on the popular forums of the internet seem to rave about this cologne its amazing fragrance. I gave it a whirl since it was on sale for $13 thinking I was getting a great deal. I open the box and take the lid off the bottle and spray the blue mist into the air. Immediately I lunge back from getting a whiff of it as it reminds me of the scent of a &amp;#34;stink bug&amp;#34;. The cologne smells of dead bugs with a fruity note. The cologne itslef reminded me more of women&#x27;s perfume than a man&#x27;s. I do not know what everyone is raving about, but I would never put this on my body as it gave me a headache as soon as I sprayed it. I will be sticking with Versace&#x27;s &amp;#34;Pour Homme&amp;#34; for now even though it is quite expensive. I am still on the look out for a cheaper cologne that smells manly. (I don&#x27;t know anything about colognes so keep that in mind.)</li>
            <li> Excellent product, good price and excellent delivery time. thanks</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, smells great!</li>
            <li> Yes, its item selected</li>
            <li> Good deal.for the amount but seems slightly watered down.  I don&#x27;t know, I&#x27;m not an expert.</li>
            <li> This smells decent but a little faint. I like my Guess Seductive better.</li>
            <li> Its a cool earthy smell. Not too sweet.&lt;br /&gt;Shipped on time and I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very very good first time buying it is giving my david Beckham collection a run for its money lol 5 star rating but more like 20 stars for me i highly recommend this cologne</li>
            <li> I love the price and the product! However, it did not arrive as it was supposed to due to poor service from Amazon; NOT the shipping company! The product arrived on time and in perfect condition, however, it was supposed to be gift wrapped, but it was NOT! It was a gift, and I added a note, but the note was NOT included! I have been trying to write to Amazon about this, but there is NO place I can write this complaint!</li>
            <li> It smell ggod.  Not quite the same as Cool Water as others have suggested.  However the scent does not last very long.</li>
            <li> As described, thanks!</li>
            <li> Lacks longevity and scent isn&#x27;t as described</li>
            <li> Girls love it. Many compliments. Not overpowering. Long lasting........ Cheap &amp;#60;-------- (best part).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done. End of story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re on the fence... buy it.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Best cologne for me.</li>
            <li> Get alot of positive comments on this one!</li>
            <li> excelent product 100 % recomend</li>
            <li> Subtle, but smells like heaven. Definitely the right cologne to take on a date. Lasts throughout the day. MUCH cheaper than you would find it a department store, but just as good.</li>
            <li> This cologne is fantastic!  I am very choosy when it comes to scents/aromas that I wear.  They need to be masculine without being overly powerful and they must last all day.  This cologne does all this.  It has a fresh, clean, slight musk and spice aroma.  I would highly recommend this to any man.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed AND you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The low price made me wonder if it was original, and after comparing it with the other one I bought from a local store a while ago, seems legit. I would recommend this to a friend, it&#x27;s a very cool fragrance suitable for office and for any other time. You&#x27;re gonna love it.</li>
            <li> Sells great and expansiveness</li>
            <li> FAKE.  The stuff doesn&#x27;t like the real stuff.  The cap is one piece and plastic.  The stuff I ordered previously had a smaller heavy metal cap.</li>
            <li> I just love this fragrance, it smells manly without being over the top potent. I&#x27;ve had many compliments by the ladies, this is highly recommended as a conservative option with a good manly fragrance.</li>
            <li> Fake... Top is bigger than originsl, smells horrible and does not last... Definitely won&#x27;t buy this crab again.</li>
            <li> Lol my wife want let me ware it less I&#x27;m going 2 bed</li>
            <li> Wow!!! This is a great men&#x27;s perfume at a great price and size! Finally, i hit the jackpot with this one. It smells fresh, clean and airy, not too heavy or thick. It&#x27;s perfect for this 2015 summer weather. My wife liked it right away.  I had this scent before, many years ago, and I&#x27;m glad i got it again. At this low price, it makes sense, especially since men&#x27;s colognes are so expensive. If you&#x27;re on a tight budget in the fragrance department, but you still want to smell good, this is it. I had purchased some other perfumes here and they were terrible; this one though, does not disappoint.</li>
            <li> it Met my expectations thank you love it.it is definitely a five star Cologne. a lot of compliments from women</li>
            <li> BEST FRAGRENCE ON THE MARKET</li>
            <li> Ok it is cheap. But once you used it will only remain for 15 minutes. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> This item seems diluted and does not meet the standard of Nautica Voyage by Nautica for Men.  I previously purchased Nautica Voyage (in the past 2 years from a department store) and still have some of the product.  I compared the recent purchase of NV that I received from my AMAZON purchase with the same product purchased from a department store and found the AMAZON NV to have a faint fragrance and essentially not be the same product that I had purchased from the department store (Although the name is identical).  I am disappointed and this makes me suspicious of online products and hesitant to make similar future purchases online.  Maybe it makes me suspicious of the quality of Nautica Voyage?  Either way - something is not consistent.</li>
            <li> I smell women wearing this sometimes. I like it on men too, I purchased some for my husband but we both prefer this scent on me. It&#x27;s very fresh and clean smelling, and is really genderless. It takes ages to fade. I can still smell it on my clothes days later when I go to toss them in the wash!</li>
            <li> Excellent Product....Will purchase again.  Seller sent items really fast. I highly recommend!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells great! Love it!</li>
            <li> This has an amazing smell and a great price. Will be buying again for my husband. 3.4 oz for 20$ can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED FOR A GIFT.  I LOVE IT FOR THE PRICE.</li>
            <li> Bought for Father&#x27;s Day...wonderful smell! very fresh and clean... Nice for Summer...good warm weather scent! Five more words required. there.</li>
            <li> i bought this nautica last aug 2011, bcoz its big one i still have it, but the scent are gone! the first time i use it, its ok maybe bcoz the perfume on the pipe are orig but deep inside are just water or what. i&#x27;ll never buy this product no more. thats why im wondering why its cheap its about $30, dont buy in this seller.</li>
            <li> I got it for my dad ,and it smelled very nice. I like it ...............wonderful ..my dad will be happy with it</li>
            <li> It is a Pretty nice perfume with nice fragrance, I used it everyday and smell does last for entire day. Satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of my favorite!  At the mall, the price is $55.00 + tax.  I love the price and smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne! I was skeptical about buying cologne online, but I saw the rating and read some of the reviews for this one and I decided, what the hell! I am COMPLETELY satisfied with this purchase, and the price can&#x27;t get any better. If you&#x27;re browsing for cologne and you&#x27;re thinking of getting this one, but aren&#x27;t so sure, go for it, you will NOT be disappointed. By the way, I&#x27;m 22 years old, just in case you&#x27;re wondering if this is old man cologne, it most definitely isn&#x27;t haha.</li>
            <li> I liked. really the product is such that it describes the seller. T I recommend it to all who wish to be updated. I like a lot. fascinating and beautiful</li>
            <li> If you like fresh and clean fragrances this one is for you. I know people may feel indiffrent about Aquatic fragrances and I have to admit some are good and others well... However this one is in a class of it&#x27;s own for the price you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not over powering, and doesn&#x27;t smell cheap like Axe. It goes with any cologn or soap. Anymore than two sprays is too strong, but if your looking for something nice and fresh, this is good pick.</li>
            <li> A light, masculine scent perfect for everyday.  I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice smelling cologne! Doesn&#x27;t exactly have the most masculine smell to it but definitely worth the buy for any guy want to smell nice! Also doesn&#x27;t have any type of overwhelming smell it to, just a nice natural smell! Some of the much more expensive colognes such as ralph polo and especially my favorite Acqua di gio are slightly better but for this price its easily worth the purchase!</li>
            <li> Great product.  So many compliments...</li>
            <li> Great price for a great smell, I love it and love even most people&#x27;s compliments</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic... I get compliments all the time..</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne!</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad for fathers day and it smells amazing, very good scent, and nautica is a good brand always. You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My new favorite... Fresh, Clean smelling &amp; long lasting... recommended to me by a lady I admire very much. She obviously has incredible taste....</li>
            <li> I HAD BOUGHT THIS COLOGNE TWICE..SHIPPING WAS QUICK..CAME IN ONE PIECE..LOVE THE SCENT. IT LASTS ALL DAY..I WILL BUY IT AGAIN..THANK&#x27;S!!</li>
            <li> very clean fresh scent. however it doesn&#x27;t last very long. the cap doesn&#x27;t stay on which makes me wonder if its an original or a bootleg</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift for my husband for xmas.....he is a cologne addict....this is one of the best we have bought so far......it just does not last as long as the others do.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance. The price was extremely reasonable, so I was worried. However, after wearing this, all those worries have been put to rest. The fragrance is very light and airy. For me it seems to last 6-8 hours. This quickly became my favorite cologne for anytime use.</li>
            <li> Just received this cologne. The smell is OK but not great however the main problem is not the scent but the fact that the the bottle leaks. This is a non returnable item so I&#x27;m stuck with it which I don&#x27;t believe is right because the product is DEFECTIVE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since 2007, Its fresh aroma lasts long and it&#x27;s noticeable. And the best part is finding it for such a small price</li>
            <li> I purchased this because of the great price and thought it would be great for everyday use. The smell is pleasant enough, not strong and overpowering. The only problem (pointed out in other reviews) is that it doesn&#x27;t last very long. At the price though, you can&#x27;t lose!</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. Strong, but not too strong to the point of being overbearing.</li>
            <li> Very clean smelling. Have had women come up and ask me what cologne I have on. Women love it!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The Nautica Voyage is an excellent fragrance and keeps the fragrance alive for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The price offered by Amazon is great and it ways higher on stores.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend! He loves it and I love it on him! The scent lasts for a very long time and it makes him smell extremely sexy! I got the item before the actual delivery date so that was a great thing! I recommend this scent........... a great buy indeed</li>
            <li> Read alot of reviews about people not liking theirs. Alot of reviews said they loved this, went and smelled it at Macy&#x27;s and decided it was amazing and ordered it here the same day.&lt;br /&gt;Mine came in wrapped in bubble wrap, sealed up, smells amazing and lasts forever. I can smell myself all day. Not over powering, but it&#x27;s noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t know how to review a cologne. But I love this and it smells as good as the one that was at Macy&#x27;s. I love it</li>
            <li> This is by far the best fragrance made in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;The best choice without a doubt, it comes in a beautiful&lt;br /&gt;mature glass bottle. It gives you the feeling of having treasure,&lt;br /&gt;truly a top notch fragrance!</li>
            <li> We love it! Cologne is one if those things you really just have to try. My husband used cool water by David for years and he also loves nautica blue. This one is different but a nice change. It doesn&#x27;t cost much here on amazon so we went for it and I am happy we did.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap knock-off of Nautica which I have been using for years now. Such low price tag in itself should have been a red flag for me. But, I went with the star rating of other reviewers, hoping that I had stumbled upon a great find on Amazon. Bad idea!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The perfume lasts less than 20 minutes on you and I&#x27;m not even exaggerating. You can as well spray some water on yourself instead of this perfume and you would feel no different. Stay away from this unless you want to burn your money needlessly.</li>
            <li> Men get ready to set sail, with the freshest smelling invigorating cologne by Nautica. Nautica Voyage, has a smooth scent that is not to strong, but just right for anyone to enjoy. Very clean and refreshing for any activity; whiter on a date or at the office Nautica Voyage will last the day and keep you in the good graces of those around you. The price is almost a steal especially for its size. You will enjoy this product and so will the ladies.</li>
            <li> An elegant, fresh, clean, and soothing scent that you are able to put on anytime of day for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I was not disappointed at all! I love the smell of this inexpensive perfume. Has been my daily scent since I bought this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> great for gym, or hot dayz</li>
            <li> The price for this is amazing! The smell is also great! Well worth the buy!</li>
            <li> Amazing great long lasting scent</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay scent.  Nothing special. I much prefer Curve Wave by Liz Claiborne for a fresh spring/summer scent.  Plus, Curve Wave is cheaper, the scent lasts longer and I receive many more compliments.  Of course a scent is different for everyone, but I will only use this cologne for just a casual change of pace.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son for one of his Birthday presents and it is his favorite.  I purchased it at great savings too.  I loved the convenience of ordering this on line from Amazon.</li>
            <li> My staple. Get many complements. Scent is SO FRESH and CLEAN. I LOVE IT! I keep one at home and one in my suitcase at all times..</li>
            <li> Compare with price, I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I really liked this fragrance, it smell good all the day , very nice price, i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Smell: projection smell give you something aquatic and feeling at the beach (last for about 3 hours for projecting)&lt;br /&gt;Skin scent is very soft and gentle, last for another 5 hours</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nautica Voyage on and off for years now.  I remember when my first bottle cost me over $50, so to get it at such a bargain price is wonderful.  I was a little skeptical that this could possibly be a knock off, but after checking out the box, bottle, and scent I&#x27;m pretty sure that this is an original.  I love the smell:  light and not overpowering, but able to last all day.  This is a great bargain.  Give it a shot!</li>
            <li> Smells great. I was a little concerned about the price and some of the weird reviews, but this is legit stuff and smells just like the bottle I got at Dillards, but at a fraction of the price. Presumably, this is because the fragrance has been out for a few years.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will buy it again. When i goes too work ladies ask me &amp;#34; how u smell sweet so&amp;#34; that makes me feel great. Its always better to smell sweet instead of st*** if u knw what i mean</li>
            <li> such a good price i bought 2</li>
            <li> This smell is a great smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a &amp;#34;Great&amp;#34; cologne, but it is a good value.</li>
            <li> Dad loved it - solid choice.</li>
            <li> After one month of usage smells like soap water.</li>
            <li> terrible product u get almost a litre of water for no scent or perfume. Hate this product. dont go for it is cheap.</li>
            <li> As advertised.  A gift not yet given.</li>
            <li> Great scent for great price</li>
            <li> Wonderful cologne, my girlfriend loves it. This is the best Nautica cologne and for the money you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my Dad on Father&#x27;s day and got a chance to smell it and man does it smell amazing! Also a great buy for the price, now I&#x27;ll just have to get my own bottle!</li>
            <li> This stuff smells fabulous! Its like a mixture of all the best parts of Aqua Di Gio, Hugo Boss &amp; Michael Jordan cologne. Makes my mouth water when I smell it ; )</li>
            <li> This is one of the few colognes that I use in the summer time. It is a lot lighter than the other colognes I wear so it does not feel too heavy in the heat. I am getting married at the beach next month and this is the scent that I will wear. Recommended!</li>
            <li> I tried this stuff out at the mall and had to get a bottle.  The price was over $50 at the mall though.  I did the research and amazon had it for the lowest price if you include shipping costs.&lt;br /&gt;It smells light and airy (if thats a word), not overpowering but will not last as long as some other stronger scents.</li>
            <li> For the price, this is fantastic. I love it because it lasts for more than a few hours like so much of the other watered- down junk that is so readily available!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a birthday gift for my son.  I have always liked the light, not overbearing, scent.</li>
            <li> This one did not come with the Nautica serial number on the bottom. The smell also does not last for long nor is it strong at all to begin with. I had to spray it 3 or four times to get any distinct scent. I would not buy this item again.</li>
            <li> At last I can buy my favorite cologne and it arrives just in time.tried it and its amazing</li>
            <li> I have purchased two of these. After buying the first which I had planned on keeping at work, I loved it so much I immediately purchased a second for home. The one that I loved had a single piece plastic cap, and the smell was VERY nice and lasted (strongly) all day, and several days following until the shirt was washed. The second one I ordered has a cap which was heavy metal, which only covered the nozzle. It smelled very similar, but not quite the same, and only lasts maybe 3-5 hours before becoming very faint. Both of these bottles came in identical shrink wrapped boxes, same bottle, both fulfilled by Amazon, and both had stickers on them with 4 digit codes on the bottom- the only difference being the caps, and the obviously different formulas/strengths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure what I&#x27;ll end up doing once these run out, but if I get another bottle like the second one I ordered, I will return it and switch to a difference cologne.</li>
            <li> this is one of the best smelling colognes ive had. all it takes is 3 sprays and you are good for the day. even smells after you wash the clothes.</li>
            <li> the smell does not last for long time. i doubt if it is a duplicate product. i have tried the nautica product before its completely different.</li>
            <li> I recommend this one. Nautica voyage is one of the best fragrances i&#x27;ve owned. Very smooth, fresh, acuatic, long lasting frangrance. Is it smooth but not weak.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered and would expect no less....</li>
            <li> was more than I expected. fragrance is really nice but not over whelming.</li>
            <li> I wore this one night and ladies inquired. Lol. I am happy with this and I think I keep a few extra bottles. Everyone asks about it. Love it!!</li>
            <li> The best perfume so far!</li>
            <li> Not a great as I thought it would smell but still is pretty good</li>
            <li> Maybe this is my fault for buying it when it was on sale but the smell faded away very fast. Withing a week or two, the smell hardly lasted and it wasn&#x27;t strong. It does smell very good though but by the time I go out, the smell is already gone and so there is no point. I wish they could tell us how old the colognes are when we buy them, but then again that probably ain&#x27;t a good marketing strategy for them. My advice for people buying this is to be wary of buying colognes when it&#x27;s on sale. When it&#x27;s are on sale, it could sometimes mean that they are trying to hurry and get rid of their old colognes. My old spice deodorant have a stronger smell than this.</li>
            <li> Love this cologne. The stores stopped selling it. Luckily I was able to purchase it off of Amazon. I have one in the house and I keep another one in my cars glove box in case of an emergency. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> It is VERY GOOD&lt;br /&gt;  IS ARTICLE IS VERY GOOD VENDDO NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM PLEASE ALL MY NEEDS AND I&#x27;M SURE THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEM TO HANDLE I AM SATISFIED WITH THIS PURCHASE THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING</li>
            <li> I like my Cool Water better and wish I saved my money.  Kind of smells like fruit gum.  It works but not that appealing.</li>
            <li> Ladies love it. wink wink</li>
            <li> Smells like sweet pickle juice and ripened hachiya persimmon.  It smells sweet, with a snap of pickling spice(dill, etc. not necessarily sour though). This scent is just not for me, I was disappointed by it.  In addition to not liking the scent, like others have mentioned, the scent does not last long at all, I&#x27;ll mist the heck out of my jacket and shirt collar, only to have it wear off in 2 - 3 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one that I got said &amp;#34;Coty&amp;#34; on it, plus when I opened the package it smelled very moldy, I even washed the bottle with soap to get rid of it(probably had moisture in the box before it was wrapped at the factory).  Overall, disappointed, not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> The first day I wore it, this hot girl at work started talking to me and we are friends now, so it definitely works. Smells great and lasts long. Only issue I had was the bottle broke the day I bought it, but they gave me a refund and shipped another.</li>
            <li> Okay for the price..but lasts only a few hours</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this and I have gotten compliments from others.  The 3.4 oz bottle will last quite a while too.</li>
            <li> Had this cologne a couple months now and finally I could review it. This cologne is light and fresh,reminds me of the ocean. Its not overpowering its very light and settle. It last between 4 to 6 hours .  It perfect for around the house use or average wear . Not so grate for special occasions but overall a nice cologne .</li>
            <li> Great cologne, great price, great quantity - everything is great about this. I have nothing bad to say. Try it.</li>
            <li> First tried the cologne at a friends house and loved the smell and i knew i had to buy my own. Amazon is BY FAR the cheapest place to buy this cologne.(the 1.0 oz in retail stores are around $30) Its everything I was expecting! Will Be Buying for when i run out! Thank You!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other discount places , who always allow you to order but never have things in stock...but not at Amazon. Reliable, fast, quality products...all the time. Thanks, Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> It has a lovely smell and it is a steal for the price.</li>
            <li> Got it for my hubs.. love it!</li>
            <li> amazing smell and value</li>
            <li> I often get question what kind of scent I am wearing..&lt;br /&gt;and I often told that they know I am around because&lt;br /&gt;of my scent, my colleague at work told me that even they don&#x27;t see me?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They know I am around for they smelled me! ha! ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women drools on me(kidding) but really, they keep asking me about my cologne but I only simply said... &amp;#34;it is a secret!&amp;#34;;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been almost 5 yrs since I started using this cologne and I just love it, I used to get this @ the thrift store back when I was in the west before I relocated here NYC.. and then I couldn&#x27;t find it so i look here amazon and viola, I found it and same price as what I was paying for! happy dance! It is delivered on the promise delivery date and just in time for my last spray on the one on hand, I always grab two bottles of this for it is much more convenient and cheaper!</li>
            <li> Took a chance on this cologne.  To say the least, I was NOT disappointed.  Voyage has a fresh and clean smell.  Its not heavy- but don&#x27;t mistake that for a pitfall.  It scent lasts throughout the day.  Amazon&#x27;s price is a major value, as I&#x27;ve seen Voyage at department stores for nearly double the price....</li>
            <li> Great clean scent that remains pleasing, calming and crisp after a long day. For the price it&#x27;s a must have. You can wear it practically anytime.</li>
            <li> If you buy at a retail store the price will be 3X.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle at Macys for twice the price and the size of the container was 1/2 the size.&lt;br /&gt;Good value!!  I thought it might be a knockoff product due to the price.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy voyage after trying Nautica&#x27;s other fragrances. It has a mixed scent of smelling really good, with a tiny hint of it smelling sweet, but not over powering. My girlfriend loves it, and i guess thats all that matters</li>
            <li> 5 stars because the product is exactly as stated and only costed me a mere $15 free shipping. However, what lead me to buying this is due to it&#x27;s incredibly high ratings and reviews. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I went to a local nordstrom to &amp;#34;test-smell&amp;#34; the fragrance and it was solid, so I went ahead and ordered it - however once I started to wear it, it gave me a headache. So I guess count this review as be sure to test smell this fragrance (as well as all fragrances before you buy) - it may seem majority loves this scent, but I happen to be one of the few odds out.</li>
            <li> This is for my high school son.  He loved the smell and wears a lot for his social events.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and I like the bottle it came in.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. I&#x27;m female but loved men&#x27;s cologne. I use this everyday at work. With price, you can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
            <li> Nice perfume.....lovely bottle.....not the best....but good</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last very long</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s a fake, but it still smells pretty good and it&#x27;s a big bottle. I was a little disappointed but I still wear it occasionally.</li>
            <li> Good price and good fragance!</li>
            <li> Light, crisp and last all day. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy.</li>
            <li> Just awesome, got many compliments with this.  Has a fruity/summer scent, making it perfect for daily cologne. Scent lingers for a long time. Considering the price, this is a good buy imo</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage is a nice smell...It got a fresh scent and NOT too strong! It lasts longer than others.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, I would order again.</li>
            <li> I was on a cruise and one of the servers was wearing this, the scent is great.  Much less expensive to buy it on Amazon than on a cruise ship</li>
            <li> Real men stuff, I get women all day</li>
            <li> Good fragrance. Pungent. Worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Low price. Smells gr8.</li>
            <li> I use this cologne everyday on campus and I get compliments about it all the guy. My friends come by my door just to use the cologne cause it smells very fresh.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfurme, I suffer from allergies and the most of the perfume make me sneeze, but this one no.&lt;br /&gt;the fragance is marvelous.</li>
            <li> i bought for my son because he ran out of Nautica.  He loves it!</li>
            <li> Loved it. It shipped in a week. Long lasting fragrance which stays with me throughout the day. I have been using voyage for quite some time now and this is one of my most favorite ones</li>
            <li> This fragrance lasts 24 hours. The aroma is awesome. Soft and sensual. It&#x27;s bigger than I imagined. 100% recommend this perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> POISON...ACID!  I have USED Nautica Voyage for several years, and then decided to buy this at the end of 2014 from Amazon.  Amazon products have always been good and reasonably priced.  When I got around to using it, I keep feeling a slight burning sensation.  Then it got worse, to the point of like 2,nd degree burns on my skin.  I was barely using any of it.  They returned my money, but I&#x27;m thinking of getting this tested..it&#x27;s lethal like acid....DON&#x27;T BUY!</li>
            <li> My hubby loves this! It was officially supposed to get here monday since I ordered it last  week but bc of bad weather it was delayed until today. I got it today and gave it to him and he loves it 😃 and i love the smell on him.</li>
            <li> After using this for the past year and half, the scent only lasts 30 minutes. When I first bought this, the scent lasted more than a day. And that was with 1 spray. Now, with 2 to 4 sprays, BO takes over after a few hours.</li>
            <li> Another great cologne by Nautica! Smells great!</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne for me.  I love it!  The price was great too.</li>
            <li> Sarcasm aside I really like the cologne. It smells great. It lasts long and has gotten me laid wicked often.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. I bought it not knowing how it smelled but based off its popularity and reviews and I do no regret it one bit. My new Favorite.</li>
            <li> I got this for my brother. It smells pretty good. He liked it. It lasts for long time.</li>
            <li> The perfumer behind this, Maurice Roucel, and the company, Nautica, gave a gem/gift to the world. This is a very easy to wear cologne and with the performance to back it up at such a great price. I do wonder if somehow Nautica turns a profit on these. Any way, once I get out of the shower I spray 1 on the chest and 1 on each side of the neck and I get 8 hours with decent projection *5 feet* and sillage. Take into account that where I live it tends to be around warm and somewhat hot all year round, so take that into consideration for the performance I got out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The subject line pretty much describes what you get on this bottle. Wear it especially on warm/days and it&#x27;ll start changing into different sea scents. Naturally, the hotter it gets the more beastly it&#x27;ll be. There are other fragrances around this price points and even more expensive one&#x27;s that don&#x27;t accomplish what Nautica Voyage does. I do admit that the third day of wearing it I got the mysterious cat urine smell that some people on basenotes talked about (LOL). If i did detect it, it was way in the background. You really had to be looking for it and of course have previous knowledge about I just did to you right now :p&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say try it out first if you&#x27;re into those kinds of aquatic scents. Cheapy but a goodie.</li>
            <li> Great smell but has a tendency to go overboard.</li>
            <li> I love it. It is not too strong or not too faint. Yet it has very classy smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;loved it.</li>
            <li> Great smell for the small price. Recommend for a daily type of cologne.  Very clean and soft smell, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is lost within seconds of applying it, I got carried away by the good reviews.</li>
            <li> This arrived much earlier than expected, great size for the price, and always smells great! I&#x27;m very satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with the smell. it starts off with a fresh \\&quot;I-just-took-a-shower\\&quot; scent but then has a slight sweet scent to it. It doesn&#x27;t last very long though, if i spray it before i leave for work, by the time i show up an hour later its basically gone unless you smell my shirt. its just a pleasant smell that&#x27;s really subtle and welcoming. you could spray a bunch on you if you really wanted to and it wouldn&#x27;t be as unpleasant compared to other brands i have tried. Worth every penny. And the bottle is hella big.</li>
            <li> For less than $15 I walk into the room and the women swoon. I smell as if a dozen roses fell from my loins. My car gets better gas mileage.  My boss gave me a raise and 17 weeks of vacation. My bowling average went from 121 to 237. I was signed by the Packers even though I don&#x27;t play football. Ever scratch lottery ticket I buy is a winner. My legend grows with every spray of this sweet nectar.</li>
            <li> Very good price is but this is not an original !!</li>
            <li> Nautica always comes up with great colognes and this was not the exception. Nice affordable price and specially for what you are getting</li>
            <li> Apples,flowers and pee OH MY!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say just because a scent is cheap doesnt make it bad also if its expensive it doesnt make it good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Men shouldnt smell like this (or women)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is great,customer service great this cologne NOT GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money..... You want a nice Aquatic and competitive priced summer cologne???? Tommy Bahama Set Sail Martinique (or St Barts ) though St Barts is strong on Lime and &amp;#34;tequila&amp;#34; but very nice for summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dont tke my word for it buy this and then leave a comment to my review if you think otherwise!!</li>
            <li> Simply the best in fragrance neither strong nor too weak. Stay long enough. Way better than other sprays I have used so far.</li>
            <li> My original review was that i thought it was fake because of the plastic cap... my first bottle had a heavy metal cap. After months of use, and many positive comments i believe its real, and not fake. Will be buying again. ( i bought a large bottle from macys and it had the same plastic cap as Amazons bottle.)</li>
            <li> Every time I get this product it&#x27;s a good deal, Thank You</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good and for the price the bottle is huge! Will definitely buy again, hard to find elsewhere.</li>
            <li> This scent is not overpowering and has a nice &amp;#34;day later scent&amp;#34; too. I have only bought this for the past two years and at this price, I am ordering two extra bottles because it is a very nice male cologne. And the bonus is the great price. When it first came out, it was 50 dollars at the men&#x27;s cologne counter in department store. Amazon offers the same at rock bottom price. If you like a citrusy cologne, light ,  not heavy, and lasts and smells good the next day on your body or clothes----but never tried it yet, trust me! Order one! And you will be ordering more believe me. I cannot believe I was so lucky to find this on Amazon;</li>
            <li> Before considering buying this item I recommend going to your nearby department store and smelling it to make sure you like the smell. I bought this product just off the hope that it smells good because of the reviews and it made a top list of colognes. I absolutely love it! I was using old spice wolferang before I believe, and this blows it out of the water. It also stays on way longer. 5*&#x27;s for me!</li>
            <li> This is not the best cologne I have had the pleasure of putting on but it is definetly up there. Considering gucci and other high end cologne is over 100$ this was only 18$ so I was a little skeptical. but once again I was proven wrong worth every penny and the fragrance easily competes with top shelf cologne!</li>
            <li> It is Fake ! Do not buy. Fragrance wears off in les than 5 minutes. Very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> smell good! but it not keep long time, just 2 or 3 hours. i hope you have a another one better!</li>
            <li> Light, airy, and fresh. This cologne is the highlight of my self-grooming process in the morning. It smells great, and gets better the longer you wear it (up to a cap of course). I&#x27;m not a huge cologne aficionado but this is the most accessible and best-smelling I&#x27;ve had for under $20.</li>
            <li> Very clean wonderful fragrance but doesn&#x27;t seem to last too long. Would still would buy again. If it were more concentrated as in a cologne I think it would be great.</li>
            <li> This product fulfilled with what I expected, I feel very satisfied with the purchase of this product. thousand thanks hope to do business again.</li>
            <li> nice bottle, nice scent, all around great aquatic. I would recommend this for your cologne collection. Perhaps this scent is more of a summer scent, however.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a heavenly smell cologne, but at least it is somewhat cheap, but I don&#x27;t encourage you to buy a big perfume bottle like this one, since you will have to stick to it for a very long time.</li>
            <li> Good product for a great price.</li>
            <li> Great smell, but what&#x27;s even more amazing is the longevity, it last for the entire day 12-24 hours</li>
            <li> Took a risk here buying cologne I&#x27;ve never smelt. However it&#x27;s definitely my go do. Fits the beachy linen wearing flip flops type of lifestyle</li>
            <li> Fake Product. There&#x27;s no scent at all.</li>
            <li> Good fragance but it dies away too fast. It lasts less than 2 hours even when you are indoors</li>
            <li> This is a very item to purchase if you come to a party, going on a date, or traveling the smell is good and lasted until the next day. In the future I will probably buy this more as a gift this worth my money :)</li>
            <li> not as long lasting as stated but good a good everyday scent. crisp and succulent, boy i loves me some nautica</li>
            <li> This fragrance is very popular, Amazaon had it at half the price of retail stores.  And was well received by senior citizen as well as a young man.</li>
            <li> Another one of my all time favorites! If you are wondering to go with Nautica Blue or Nautica Voyage, Let me tell you, Voyage is by far superior! Long lasting smell, and in my opinion, one of the best scents on the market!</li>
            <li> Boyfriend loves Nautica and most scents offered by them. He wears this everyday and I don&#x27;t mind. Great scent and it lasts a while. Fast shipping every time.</li>
            <li> Cologne smells TOTALLY different on each man that wears it because of their body&#x27;s chemical make up. This cologne smells soooooo good on my husband. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe the exact smell, but it is kind of a sweeter, manly smell. Great for men in their 20&#x27;s and maybe 30&#x27;s. Ladies, this is the sort of cologne that will make you follow a complete stranger around the grocery store just to catch a whiff of it!! LOL!!!</li>
            <li> Very clean scent with light citrus and fruit, almost watermelon. Fresh and long lasting, dont know how you can beat the price either. The 3.4oz bottle is lasting a long time and I use more cologne than most I would think. Sometimes I&#x27;ll just spray cologne like its air freshener in my closet where my shirts hang or on my bed ect.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good  product smell good without doubt buy it. I like it buy again</li>
            <li> I have been using Nautica Voyage for 2 years now and every time I wear some I always get a compliment from the ladies so you can&#x27;t go wrong with what works.</li>
            <li> First I would like to say that I swear by this fragrance. I have been using it for a couple years now and I cannot count the amount of compliments I get. It has good longevity that lasts about 10 hours strong, and the sillage is just right. It doesn&#x27;t quite fill a room, but follows you around arms length. People will know its you, and the best part is the scent is so light hearted that it doesn&#x27;t offend when you get closer to it. Although the light scent is best for Spring and Summer, it compliments all seasons adequately. This is a must have for any collection.</li>
            <li> My spouse loved the scent and wears it often. I like it also. Good value for the price was lowest we found.</li>
            <li> This is a fake product. Please don&#x27;t buy this product. I am very much disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wife doesn&#x27;t like the smell. No reflection on seller.</li>
            <li> I got the fake kind.  Smells good but didn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This is one fragrance i will continue to buy when i run out. I cant say enough about its delightful scent. Lasts all day long!!</li>
            <li> My husband really wanted this cologne and the POLO Red, and they were both pretty pricey!!!!  I found this for like 75% off what the department stores wanted, and it is NOT a knock off!  Same size as the $90 bottle in the store, same box and all!</li>
            <li> The product is legit , smell good and long lasting. I would recommended it to my friends. Give it a shot</li>
            <li> This cologne smells wonderful and the price was great too, much better buy than buying it at the mall!!  S/H charges were reasonable and fast delivery!!</li>
            <li> this perfume is a kind of mix, firts spray on my skin feels and smells like island voyage nautica, smells like the sea, but few minutes later smells like blue seduccion by Antonio Banderas. Is a great perfume, not so strong and no so weak, sweet and fruitsy, it last on my skin about 4 hours more or less. By the way i decided to buy it by reading the comments, webpages and blogs about fragances and all reviews on youtube. GREAT DEAL.</li>
            <li> Great scent for price.</li>
            <li> I am usually allergic to cologne and it makes me sneeze or gives me a headache, but this has a nice smell that doesn&#x27;t make me sick and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft but smells good</li>
            <li> My son, in his 20&amp;#34;s, really liked it.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 bottles of this ,and was disappointed the smell didnt last very long.  When I purchase it at a store it lasts so much longer.</li>
            <li> The smell is decent. I use it daily before going to work and so far haven&#x27;t received any complaints about it. It&#x27;s not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> Nautica you have never failed me in buying all your fragrances KEEP IT UP 100% RECOMMENDED !!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> not over taking. Get a lot of compliments</li>
            <li> Smells good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This cologne is cheap, smells amazing and lasts a very long time! I was super impressed! I&#x27;ll be wearing this cologne for a while now!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this fragrance.  The price was very good and it shipped quickly.&lt;br /&gt;So I am very pleased with my purchase</li>
            <li> Simply unmatched great quality. Great product.Perfect. Quick ship. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;AMAZON ROCKS!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent &amp;#34;blue Cologne&amp;#34; very nice and mild, amazing price!</li>
            <li> i get this  perfu the smell is so FRESH! is really good , but i think this is fake , the smell stay for 1 hour top! im gonan vote for this is FAKE!!!</li>
            <li> My hubby smells so good - Fresh and Clean Scent!  Also it is long lasting and quality product. Great value for the size!</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrant! Lasts long and is a great value&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again!</li>
            <li> As others have stated it smells great and lasts a long time.  I am very happy with it especially for the price.</li>
            <li> My order well surpassed my expectations. It arrived on time and was well packaged. It came in the original packaging and it smells great. I would definitely suggest this to anyone who enjoys premium cologne.</li>
            <li> Its perfect ... n stays long. Love it ... will buy more for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS 100% TRUE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has such an airy, pleasant, fresh, clean, aquatic scent to it. It&#x27;s versatile, for it can be worn anywhere and at anytime of the day or night. And I imagine as much as you want, because no one I encountered found it overpowering, no matter if pumped on one spray, or six. I find myself even complimenting multiple times ...my husband  when he wears it.</li>
            <li> was a gift to a friend and he said it was a good smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> Great scent, have gotten a lot of compliments for it.</li>
            <li> Scent is small and subtle, yet lasts for hours. Great price !</li>
            <li> Excellent fragrance, would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> No complements from this one, but that&#x27;s alright for a bargain cologne.  This product is an excellent &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; cologne for spring/summer, and I&#x27;m enjoying it thus far.  There isn&#x27;t much to say about Voyage that hasn&#x27;t been said so far, so I&#x27;ll address the seller I purchased this cologne from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this cologne from OxCom, and the product arrived within the estimated time of arrival.  I didn&#x27;t have any issues with shipping or returning the product, but they did request that I review their customer care service, which must mean that they do somewhat care about their service to their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good product, get it if you want a cologne for casual wear without breaking the bank.</li>
            <li> Love this on my husband!</li>
            <li> Fake fake. 2 minutes the smell is off u don&#x27;t buy my husband was pissed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful. My partner loves the smell on me.</li>
            <li> I recommend this perfume has good aroma, the smell remains until the next day , shipping was fast grateful thanks for everything</li>
            <li> Authentic cologne! Was a little hesitant to buy, but it&#x27;s the real deal.</li>
            <li> I had read many reviews and this came up on the best fragrance for under 25.00. It really smells like a Clean shower in a bottle. I have had many different colognes, though this was a great surprise for the price. It doesn&#x27;t last very long though is great for college students.</li>
            <li> I like this cologne and it&#x27;s not fake but I wish the fragrance would last longer... it only last a couple of hours</li>
            <li> Smells just like the original, but doesn&#x27;t last even an hour.  The sticker on the bottom of the bottle confirmed this - the original references the name Nautica and who produced the product.  Not the case with the bottle purchased here.  Seller emailed and asked if I wanted to return, but considering the package had already been ripped open by the time I had determined it was a fake, it was too late...</li>
            <li> I do not know why people say it is water downed. It is super strong and last for half the day with one spray. As long you get if from amazon directly you will get the real one. I did and I got the real one. Just FYI first time use you will get hit by the strong smell. It is super strong. I just got it from UPS and I just spent about 3 days to get it. It last on clothes for pretty much 2 days. So if you want to smell fresh but not a super smelly guy spray it on your clothes a day before you wear it. Just buy it from amazon for the real deal</li>
            <li> This cologne is one of my favorites of all time and this is my second order of getting it which was great.</li>
            <li> is a great perfume i already bought 3 .........very good i m waiting next week to buy another 2 of this one</li>
            <li> The top lid of the bottle came with a malfunction so right now since the fragrance and the price paid is OK, i&#x27;ll give it a 3 stars OK.</li>
            <li> Great birthday present for my brother.</li>
            <li> A very pleasant and refreshing scent for a man who likes a fragrance that is not overwhelming to his women. Smells very nice.</li>
            <li> I normally buy my hubby expensive colognes from dept stores. I decided to try something different and needed it fast, so I went to amazon. I was concerned that this was going to be only ok since it wasn&#x27;t an &amp;#34;expensive&amp;#34; cologne. Can I tell you, this stuff is so clean and reshreshing and just so yummy! We both love it. It&#x27;s crisp, clean and sweet without it being nauseating...not musky or spicy. He puts it on in the morning, goes to work (in an a/c office) and comes home 9 hours later and I can still smell it - not as strong as when he first puts it on, but it&#x27;s definitely there. This was a winner!</li>
            <li> Really like this, I was skeptical at first because I haven&#x27;t smelled it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Good smelling&lt;br /&gt;-Long Lasting&lt;br /&gt;-Big Bottle&lt;br /&gt;-Cheap</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a nice and beautiful perfume I like it</li>
            <li> Every woman I work with literally always is wondering what smells so great. :) Smell lasts a great time period</li>
            <li> OH MY GOODNESS! THIS MAKES MY HUSBAND SMELL SO SEXY. IT WORKS WELL WITH HIS NATURAL BODY SCENT AND IS MOUTH WATERING.</li>
            <li> great, would buy again,, exactly what I wanted at a great price as explained in the write up great product, great price.</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED SELLER EXCELLENT PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I purchased this cologne. The scent seems to have grown on me. Not too sweet or girly. An excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a wonderful perfume at a wonderful price! The size is major and it is indeed legit - compared at Macy&#x27;s. I wouldn&#x27;t classify it as a signature scent but more of an everyday use for work, gym, etc which lasts like the full day. Be sure to have your signature scent for those special outings! I would recommend and definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> fresh scent, one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Watch out, It is fake! I got another from Macy&#x27;s it lasts a whole day. This lasts about 3 hours! Wasted money!</li>
            <li> Smells nice and Lasts a decent amount of time. It is much better than nautica classic and pretty good for its value.</li>
            <li> smells good, cheap deal, but does not stay long. only good for a couple of hours</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this fragance, too cheap, although it&#x27;s a fresh and modern scent; for  kool guys, I love it !</li>
            <li> Really love this cologne.  I originally purchased it for my son and now my boyfriend. He kept borrowing it so I decided to get it for him too.  It has a clean smell, not musky and lasts all day. Definitely try it out, you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> For the price offered, it&#x27;s pretty good. Though the smell doesn&#x27;t last a lot, it is still good. I love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Short answer: It smells awful. Do not buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long answer: Colognes are personal. They interact with your personal body chemistry and will smell differently for different people and at different times. Where you spray it (side of neck, chest, on clothes, on skin), how much you put on (one spray or 3), when you put it on (after a shower in the morning, after working out, before going out at night). All of these factors will influence how it smells. Not to mention the chance you receive a knock off as opposed to the real product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that being said, Nautica Voyage for men did not smell good on me. It did not smell ok on me. It smelled awful. Like someone let a bottle of Windex ferment on a hot beach for a few weeks. Maybe it was me. Maybe it was one of those scents that do not work well with me. Maybe. All I know is that it was unusable. I tried. Really I did. I used it at different times, on different parts of my body and with varying amounts. Nothing helped. It still smelled like gasoline with chemical &amp;#34;beach smell&amp;#34; added in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up contacting the Amazon support center and explaining the situation. They were awesome. Refunded my order and sent me another one (I explained that it may have been a knockoff). However, it smelled the same, which it to say like garbage. I wish it were somewhat tolerable since the price is so great. I really could use a nice, causal, summer cologne. Well, live and learn.</li>
            <li> ALWAYS THE BEST PRODUCTS. THANKS.</li>
            <li> I ordered this perfume after looking at the reviews, but for my disappointment or may be I&#x27;m the chosen one I got the same exact bottle with good packing but not a perfume in though. (500% affirmative)&lt;br /&gt;I think its just filled with water or something, you cant smell anything.</li>
            <li> Product came as advertised. The fragrance is very nice (not strong and over bearing). Very affordable from seller. Will buy again. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I have received many, many compliments about this cologne.</li>
            <li> Very good perfume in an attractive looking glass bottle. Longer lingering scent. And that also at a great price. Love it!</li>
            <li> Not a knock off. I am very pleased with this purchase. I would recommend this item to others. Enjoy this product!</li>
            <li> I got this for my hubby, he loves it and I do too. For the price, this will definitely be a staple of his.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job for the price, not too potent but good smell.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with this cologne. It&#x27;s an excellent addition to anyone&#x27;s collection. I like this a bit better than Cool Water even.</li>
            <li> Amazing scents with cheap price, Recommended!</li>
            <li> smells great and I got it really quickly</li>
            <li> Its possible this product  is counterfeit. Scent does not last long. Its smells great but you will have to spray every 5 minutes</li>
            <li> It has a very nice smell, particularly, I use it for everyday. THe price is great and the quality is worth it. Ive bought 2 of them already.</li>
            <li> I love this smell being a male, I wish I could bathe in it so I could smell it all day. But one spray does the job just fine.</li>
            <li> Before I receive the order, I was almost sure that this is going to be a fake perfume because it was so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a professional, but I think that this is genuine because the smell remains for days.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the smell is very great. I like it. One of my best experiences with amazon.</li>
            <li> The description says nautica voyage, which I&#x27;ve used in the past and really liked. However, when I received the package, it was nautica blue. . .which does not smell the same.</li>
            <li> I like the smell but it wears out in a few hours, not enough oils to make it last so I use it as an aftershave.</li>
            <li> Overall it was a good deal for a nice sized bottle of some really good smelling cologne. Shipping took a lot longer then promised but, that wasn&#x27;t the venders fault, it was the shippers.</li>
            <li> its very good product. money is worth. i like this... the packing everything is good.....&lt;br /&gt;the flavor is excellent ....</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance.It last a long time not like some of the other cologne I have had.If you have never tried it you should.You will like it.</li>
            <li> Really like the smell. Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I love this smell and so does every woman who has smelled it on me.  The seller I bought it from had a legitimate product, it was not a knock-off in any way shape or form.  It smells just as good as the last bottle I had from Macys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, women love this scent.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my fianc&amp;eacute;e and he absolutely loves the smell!!! This is his new favorite scent..he wears it every day.</li>
            <li> ladies love cool j :) seriously fresh scent my fave cool water smell can&#x27;t go wrong very calm scent will buy again</li>
            <li> I recommend you buy from amazon only because, I received the Authentic one from them. Make sure before buying that it say Ships from and sold by Amazon.com. Far as the longevity you make think it does not last long but it do. You have to spray once on chest below adam apple and behind neck is all you need. Good cologne to wear on a windy spring/summer day or night</li>
            <li> Everyone I know likes the smell and it lasts long. It also comes in a heavy duty , attractive glass bottle. You get a lot too for the money. A very good value.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this scent.</li>
            <li> I got this fory husband. It smells so good and he loves it. I have a brand new hidden for Christmas! Delightful fragrance.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to smell it yet, bought it for someone else as a Christmas gift. They really liked it at a store. Shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> Every year my husband gets a new cologne, last year it was Nautica, well it&#x27;s not horrible but it&#x27;s definitely a let down after loving Armani Code the year before. Going to give him A*Men cologne this year, I heard you can&#x27;t go wrong when choosing from the House of Mugler</li>
            <li> This is a decent cologne, it is long lasting, cheap, and it&#x27;s a big bottle. The only problem is there are much better smelling colognes out there for only a little more. I would look around before buying this, either that or make sure you like the smell before buying</li>
            <li> Love this but it goes away quick!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t smell bad but I think it is fake.</li>
            <li> When ever ,where ever i go have received compliments on this fragrance,  I find myself even complimenting myself when I wear it.But the major fault i found out is, it doesn&#x27;t be for long time</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it smells wonderful. I love mens cologne and this has a nice clean sort of smell to it while still staying masculine. It was an excellent buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Everyone is different and if you&#x27;ve tried many different colognes by now, you should already know this. So when many reviewers mention that this cologne lasts throughout the day, I just had to try it. Me personally, I would much rather use a cologne that smelled just &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; but lasts long rather than vice-versa. Therefore, I didn&#x27;t really care how this would smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell from what I can best describe it as is having a strong and sweet kiwi fruit smell. If fruity colognes are not your thing, you might be put off by this one. This actually smells very close to Paris Hilton for Men but I&#x27;m sure for a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disappointment came in that this cologne does not last very long on my skin. I use about 3-4 sprays in the morning but by midday, it&#x27;s pretty much gone. I can get like a quick sniff of it but it does not hold up to my standards of a cologne. For the price I paid for this though, I can hardly get mad. But again, everyone is different so your experience may differ from mine. You&#x27;ll just have to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: To date, my perfect cologne remains to be Jean Paul Gaultier both in smell and longevity.</li>
            <li> I tried buying a perfume over the net the first time. It smell great, but it does not last long, only stay for like 2-3 hours and after that the smells gone</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne that I have been complimented on numerous times by females &amp; males alike...Can&#x27;t get enough of this cologne.</li>
            <li> Just a couple spritzes of this cologne will last all day long without being excessive. It smells great but doesn&#x27;t have that musky smell. Not one of those cheap knockoffs, this is the real deal. And my wife loves it, so that makes it worth every penny for me 8-)</li>
            <li> Quick delivery meets req... NOTE smell is harsh to some</li>
            <li> excellent product, I am satisfied with it and with the Store esponsibility 100% recommended</li>
            <li> excellent price/fast delivery , thanks</li>
            <li> inexpensive but smells fresh and beachy, I am a fan and always make sure I have this cologne</li>
            <li> This is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne.  I ordered it because it was such a great price.</li>
            <li> I keep this in my car.. im smell good alwayss bruuuuuuu.. Sits in my car and comes out when ever i want heh.</li>
            <li> I love this product it is the best smelling good quality and amout for the price i recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I give it a 2.5/5 stars, I never bought this cologne before so its my first time actually trying out this cologne. I bought this from Amazon.com LLC and im not sure if its even fake or real ( genuine) cologne. the box at the bottom, underneath has 4 number black printed beside the barcode. Im not sure if this is fake or real. The bubbles disappears, the box case is tightly sealed in heaviness to take out the cologne. What are your thoughts people!? I sprayed 3-5 times on my neck and its way to refreshing but its strong.</li>
            <li> check out other brands of cologne. This one in particular isn&#x27;t as long lasting as some other brands i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Though the scent is good it won&#x27;t even last 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> Smells good and lasts long</li>
            <li> Great scent and original packaging from manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Holllyyeeeeee crap! This stuff is INSANE! The cool, fresh and manly aroma is not at all overpowering. Give your woman one of your shirts to wear, it&#x27;s guaranteed to smell like Voyage weeks later, regardless of how many times you wash it. Buy Voyage and wear it and NO woman will ever forget your name. It&#x27;s the perfect mix of aromas. Women will be clamoring over each other to give their number (and their panties) over to you, and not some clown wearing AXE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions:&lt;br /&gt;1. Spray Cologne&lt;br /&gt;2. Attract women and make love to them.&lt;br /&gt;3. Repeat</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage is a realistic option for somebody who wants to spend under twenty dollars on cologne. It&#x27;s not for me. A bottle of cologne lasts a very long time. Good cologne is worth spending a few extra bucks on(in my opinion). I can see wearing Voyage at the beach, but it isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d want to wear to work, or out to dinner on a date.  Overrated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this perfume for a while but i always ended up with the small version, this time i got what i wanted at a excellent price. This is one of the best perfume around &amp; the smell is superb.</li>
            <li> for $13 , this is a bargain!!!!! I really like the scent, not overpowering. Definitely authentic cologne , 1 spray last all day long .</li>
            <li> I found this a couple years ago and keep coming back. Great price on it and I use this as my day to day cologne.</li>
            <li> To anyone who reads this:  I have ordered 6 bottles of Cologne from Amazon and all have been authentic.  Please, please, make sure your cologne choice is &amp;#34;BOUGHT FROM AND SHIPS FROM AMAZON!&amp;#34;  If you are ordering any cologne from a Beauty or specialty shop you will get burned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At $13 I figured it was worth a shot and ordered 2 bottles.  I don&#x27;t regret my purchase at all...describing scents is nearly impossible for me, but I will say that this is light and would be best used in summer.  I&#x27;m wearing it now as I drink my coffee, I sprayed it on last night so it has decent staying power.  Recommended over Nautica Blue.</li>
            <li> Smells ok. Not really strong and and the fragrance never lasts too long. Doesn&#x27;t conflict with secondary fragrances but can be overtaken.</li>
            <li> This product was competitively priced at $ 20. The fragrance is light, breezy just like the sea winds. My spouse really appreciated this gift.</li>
            <li> A normal fragance, but I think for the price, its ok. If you want something better I recommend buying fragrances in the range of 50-100 dollars.</li>
            <li> I have bought this from a retailer in the past and smelled great/long lasting. But this has a very weak scent, it staym with you for around 10 minutes and it wears off!! my gf told me that she can only perceive the scent when her nose is in direct contact with my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells good, people say I smell good, and was cheap compared to most colognes this size. Not overpowering but not nonexistant.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great and is very affordable. I enjoyed it as well as the others around me and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best smelling toilette spray I&#x27;ve ever used. Lasts a good bit of time and even works under heavy loads. Yep</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne at less than half the cost at Macy&#x27;s.  Love it!</li>
            <li> By far the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever used or smelled, and it lasts a long time, up to a day I would say. Although it does fade a bit with time. What more could you ask for.</li>
            <li> Dear Nautica&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cologne last December, and now it STINKS!!!!!!!!!!!!! I&#x27;ve only had it for 8 months and only used about 1/4 of the cologne. I stored it in a cool place so, I don&#x27;t understand why it expired so quickly. It upsets me that I had to throw away a $35 bottle of cologne. Other than that, the cologne smelled nice.</li>
            <li> 100% REAL. A must buy for the price. EXTREMELY FAST shipping!! Got it next day on regular shipping!!! Being in Florida might have something to do with that though :P. Again a must buy no regrets smells amazing</li>
            <li> This is a good scent that lasts a while, I have gotten compliments on it by girls!</li>
            <li> Watching the huge number of positive reviews, I ordered this perfume. It smells good. But it misses the most essential quality of a men&#x27;s perfume: duration of fragrance. Smell wears out in 10-15 minutes. Not sure if I got fake product. But I&#x27;m pretty sure I won&#x27;t give a second try.</li>
            <li> This is an &amp;#34;average&amp;#34;  cologne....nothing special here. The scent does provide a nice fresh clean smell, although the projection is a 0/10...this is a soft skin scent...You get what you pay for is all I can say.  I would NOT purchase again based on personal preferences.  &amp;#34;Neutral&amp;#34; Review here...</li>
            <li> I got this because my sister recommended it to me, and I don&#x27;t regret it at all. It&#x27;s got a good scent, and it&#x27;s not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This has a nice clean, citrusy smell that is great for summer. Only beef I have is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good sent but it wears off real quick. Probably won&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> To be frank I am a value shopper, I try to find stuff worth the buck and let me assure you that this is surely a value deal. This cologne has a unique long lasting odour and is very good for daily use. I like the packaging, the bottle&#x27;s cap is unique and feels very nice.</li>
            <li> Great scent.  Everyone always has a compliment when I wear this cologne.</li>
            <li> I really like this cologne. It goes on great and dry down is amazing. I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells so good! I even told me boyfriend he has a 80% of getting laid more often ;) lol&lt;br /&gt;This product didnt come on time, however, it didnt come super late either. I had to send an email to this guy asking when they were finally going to ship my product since i waited almost 2 weeks and they FINALLY sent it out. that was my only problem. Otherwise, I LOVE IT~&#x3D;!</li>
            <li> its only ok the smell is not long lasting .</li>
            <li> A good perfume for men</li>
            <li> I love this scent but it does not last more than an hour.</li>
            <li> Great scent for an unbeatable value. Received many compliments while using it. Apply once in the morning then once again in the mid-afternoon when it&#x27;s worn off.</li>
            <li> like this Nautica it is a great summer time Cologne for the great price</li>
            <li> Quality cologne, best price.</li>
            <li> Nice everyday Cologne</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for the boy toy, he likes it-- I love it. The smell and size are perfect.</li>
            <li> This product will not work.  The pump action on the spray bottle has stopped working.now I am stuck with a full bottle of cologne and no way to use it.</li>
            <li> Smell like a million dollars</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to fade like others have said.  I do about 3 sprays and I can smell it still at the end of the day.  Not sure what the other reviewers got, but mine seems just like what I sampled in the store.</li>
            <li> Package was good , no leakage ; good scent for warm weather, smells like a fresh sea-breeze, good for summer and beacher or a hot morning</li>
            <li> i bought my first bottle at Ross and it has smelled amazing and has lasted long enough. A couple of days ago I saw the same cologne on amazon for a cheaper price and decided to order another one. I was reading the reviews before buying and say many people that got fakes, so i became worried before buying but decided to get it anyways thinking the chances were low. Just recieved it today and it was a total fake; the smell was very different from the original (not in a good way), and the bottom didnt have a serial number. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and you can&#x27;t beat the price! If only there was some way of getting the scent through to my potential tinder matches, I know they&#x27;d swipe right so much more frequently!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s pretty good. The smell is nice. The only thing is that it does last much....</li>
            <li> Good price and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Love this perfume on my man !!</li>
            <li> As much as I love the smell, The Eau De Toilette is code for watered down cologne. It doesnt last all that long. It smells fresh and oceany and my girlfriends love it, but it doesn&#x27;t last long, maybe an hour tops and starts fading after 20-30 minutes.</li>
            <li> All these colognes are fake, the bottles looks nothing like the real thing, smells absolutely nothing like the real thing &amp; I do mean &amp;#34;NOTHING&amp;#34; &amp; worst of all the scent doesn&#x27;t even last for a good ten minutes. All they do is take your money &amp; rip u off by deceiving customers telling them their stuff is authentic when it&#x27;s all fakes &amp; knock offs. DO NOT BUY cause ur gonna be so pissed off</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this and seemingly wherever I go, whether it be to work at the hospital, to the dentist office, to shopping, I have received compliments on this fragrance. It has such an airy, pleasant, fresh, clean, aquatic scent to it. It&#x27;s versatile, for it can be worn anywhere and at anytime of the day or night. And I imagine as much as you want, because no one I encountered found it overpowering, no matter if pumped on one spray, or six.  I find myself even complimenting myself when I wear it,  &amp;#34;[expletive omitted] do I smell good!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that it is just so nice to hear people being able to value the things that I value, whether it be books or music charming us both, even a fragrance - for mutual value affinity and visibility I seek out in others. This fragrance gives me that, finding others out there who like what I like, and say so to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is ridiculously low, compared to all the value that I receive as a direct result of others valuation of it, how much I personally value it, and how much it is sold here for, compared to how much I have seen department stores sell the same size for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you find this review helpful, please say so by hitting the &amp;#34;Yes&amp;#34; button below, or if you don&#x27;t find it helpful, then please hit the &amp;#34;No&amp;#34; button below.</li>
            <li> Great prices I like the smell I would buy it again .</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this from Macy&#x27;s as a gift for my husband since I heard him mention it before. The 1.7 oz size at Macy&#x27;s was $45 but before I bought it I figured I&#x27;d check on here. Lo and behold, it was about a 1/10 the price of Macy&#x27;s!! So I went ahead and got it for him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must say, it was a good buy! I think it smells wonderful and you only need a tiny bit for it to be effective.I really don&#x27;t think the version we got was fake or anything like that. My husband puts it on at around 8am and when he comes home about 12 hours later, I can still smell it on him.</li>
            <li> A goody for cheap its a fresh scent ocean smell with fresh summer notes for any age  not heavy at all</li>
            <li> Maybe not my favorite cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled, but really great for the value!</li>
            <li> Nice light and airy smell. Great value and with everyday use this bottle lasts me about a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect perfume for men for the essence suit us very well. Plus it&#x27;s long lasting so you don&#x27;t have to use it twice in one day.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne. This smell is pure bliss mixed with sexual delights!</li>
            <li> SUCH a CLEAN smell, my husband gets so many compliments from women (and men...lol) highly recommend this amazing cologne to every age!!! great deal on amazon</li>
            <li> After searching in many stores for this product, but finding disappointingly high prices, I looked on here and found the best pricing ever for this gift my boyfriend wanted for Christmas! AMAZING steal, so very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this smell so muchthat she has forbidden me wear the scent outside, this smell is just for her.</li>
            <li> Great transaction. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Currently this is my summer scent. It&#x27;s not a cologne that I&#x27;m obsessed with, but my lady friend really likes this scent on me.&lt;br /&gt;My personal stats:&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: 6-8 hours&lt;br /&gt;Projection: 2-3 feet</li>
            <li> Bought this cause a relative gave me one as a present and loved it, so I bought another when it finished, will be buying again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different colognes and this is one of my favorites. The scent lasts amazingly long, but also isn&#x27;t so spicy and strong that everyone is avoiding you. This cologne is great for most occasions.</li>
            <li> smells great. i have 2 sets of cologne. a lower end for everyday use and a higher end for going out to parties or events.</li>
            <li> i love it smells great</li>
            <li> he had a sample of this bottle and he loved it. It is almost empty so i bought him this one, it is so inexpensive!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to strong scents... I get a sore throat, headache, etc when I have worn cologne that&#x27;s too strong or if I&#x27;m around someone who has strong cologne on!  THIS is hands down the best cologne I&#x27;ve ever worn!!  It lasts all day, I get compliments constantly on how good I smell, I just love it!!  It never gives me a headache or sore throat either!  You should definitely give this a try if you are sensitive to scents.  Maybe this will work for you,  It&#x27;s an amazing scent!!</li>
            <li> Item received appears to be genuine (not a knockoff as others have pondered.  Great price for this size bottle!  This is my first experience with this cologne, but I thought at this price why not add it to the arsenal (I try to keep 4 or 5 different fragrances at all times so I don&#x27;t get nose-deaf to using the same one every day).  This seems to last decently throughout the day with no problem.</li>
            <li> A sub-par toilette spray, smells too strong and &amp;#34;febreze&amp;#34; like for a man&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lacoste and CK are better stuff than this.</li>
            <li> If you wanna find a hot girls who likes a good cologne, get this stuff.  The Chick&#x27;s dig it!!! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Wife picked this out on our cruise and it was the start of a beautiful trip.  Found it here for the best price EVER!</li>
            <li> Parfum with a very good smell  that last very long on your clothes . I recommend this to all men who loves a long lasting scent.</li>
            <li> it was pretty good, and smells pleasant, I bought for my friend, and he likes it, so did his girlfriend, but a bit too girly to me!</li>
            <li> Top 3 on my 40+ cologne collection.  It is pleasant, soft and soothing, not in a flowery way.  More for sunny days.  Layman&#x27;s way of describing the smell would be to imagine a nice looking guy wearing white shirt, half buttoned up with sleeves rolled up, sitting at the beach, smiling.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  Last all day and smells clean and fresh.  Many good comments.</li>
            <li> Long lasting smell, I am getting tons of compliments on it. This is the best price around that I have found.</li>
            <li> Nice clean smell that is a decent value, would compare the smell to other clean/water/shower/fresh scent sprays. Scent lasts at least half a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update May 2015:&lt;br /&gt;Ordering is hit or miss&lt;br /&gt;Just ordered another bottle and it was totally off, either manufacturing issue, distributor was diff or fake. Scent different, bottle top was odd, scent last only for a couple hours. Amazon took care of it which was great customer service but now don&#x27;t know if i can order again, too bad was a great value for a nice scent. Leaving at 5 stars but just need to beware.</li>
            <li> Good one for this price.</li>
            <li> Really nice and fresh scent not many perfumes stay with me for long but this one lasts a lot sometimes is even good for the day after</li>
            <li> First of all, very well packaged. Blue-green bubble wrapped around the product. Easy to open box.&lt;br /&gt;This cologne looks quite elegant to put in my room (not fancy room). The design is curved back and flat front, easy to hold and spray. The top well fitted with a snap.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is calm, not too strong and not too mild, not professional but sure it&#x27;s nice. I think this is for middle class men.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t test it out how long it lasts but it&#x27;s been 2 hours already and still smell good ^_^&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this really a beast. No wonder it&#x27;s best seller :D</li>
            <li> eerrrr, its good, not too heavy but not lasting</li>
            <li> High quality cologne at a super price, what&#x27;s not to like. Our favorite cologne at an unbeatable price.</li>
            <li> This is My husband&#x27;s favorite spray and he loves it. It was the perfect price and perfect fathers day gift</li>
            <li> By far my favorite cologne, i took a chance since the price was so good and tyre revieus were so good.....not knowing what i would get......i just took the chance and purchased it too complete the order to round the purchase to 5p bucks......surprisingly thus one has jump to Muy top and favorite pick..........i need to order 3to 4bottles next time</li>
            <li> Great product for great price. Bought quite a few to give away as gifts!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice smell.  Subtle and not empowering.</li>
            <li> Horrible, acrid chemical smelling garbage.  Smells like some flavor of Febreeze.  I spray it in the toilet after I take a dump, because it smells slightly better than feces.  True story.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY FAKE PRODUCT!!!I have owned this cologne for years and this is a FAKE! Wanna piss your money away, buy this product!</li>
            <li> smells OK...sprayer works well</li>
            <li> no issue, great perfume will buy again.</li>
            <li> For under $20 there just isn&#x27;t a better quality fragrance for men. This is a 3.4oz bottle and I&#x27;ve received more compliments on it when on me than my Acqua Di Gio, Issey Miyake and Polo Black put together. Again much less than $20 please I give it 4 stars for its good class and I give it 4.5 stars for its fragrance and 5 for it&#x27;s overall value.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband on his birthday. The service was great. It is a good size bottle and smells terrific.</li>
            <li> Good purchase and fast shipped, it work for me</li>
            <li> Well I was bought cheaply</li>
            <li> A fresh and clean smell - kind of what I would expect Hollister Newport Beach to smell like if it were adapted as a cologne. Well priced.</li>
            <li> Very good. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a fragrance that lasted longer than most, with a clean scent. I found that in Nautica Voyage. The scent last all day with many complements. It&#x27;s a fragrance that brings to mind a sandy beach with waves of blue water. Great summertime scent. I would recommend this item over and over.</li>
            <li> Its a great smelling cologne. If you havent figured that one out as yet, all the positive reviews should tell you so. Its very fresh and very comforting to women. I love it.</li>
            <li> this cologne smells very good i love it i will buy it again before the other bottle finishes smells that good</li>
            <li> Very calming and not too overpowerful.</li>
            <li> this is just an average aquatic scent, i mainly wear it to work because the price is right. if you&#x27;re looking to get this to get compliments or wear on a night out i would recommend you keep looking. that being said if you&#x27;re looking for something decent to wear without offending people this is a good bet</li>
            <li> this product is a cheap knock off with a nice bottle. It does not smell the same as the real thing. there is a big difference.</li>
            <li> Great stuff ;)  Did a smell test amongst 3 different colognes, and picked this one and I receive compliments everywhere I go.  Seems everyone loves this stuff ;)</li>
            <li> Voyage gives you a fresh feeling. it gives that &amp;#34;I just stepped out of the shower&amp;#34; feel all day. complements are everywhere. and it never hurts to smell good. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This stuff exceeded my expectations big time. It smells so good and last long too. Add to that this great price and you can&#x27;t lose!</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage has an aquatic essence.  It&#x27;s has a subtle lightweight smell  with a long-lasting bouquet.  I would consider this an everyday cologne.  It is clean and refined. and a nice alternative to those who don&#x27;t like strong smelling cologne combinations.  Keep in mind that as a EDT type cologne it doesn&#x27;t last as long as a full parfum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say make sure you are buying for a reputable seller as there are lots of counterfeits out there and that could account for some of the bad reviews.  I got mine direct from Amazon and not a third party seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a decent smelling spray and for under 20 bucks a worthwhile purchase. Keep in mind it doesn&#x27;t last as long as full parfums.</li>
            <li> This product is good and smells good. Also I bought it in good price. The product stays on the cloth for several hours. I bought it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> What a fantastic cologne, at an even more fantastic price. In fact the price on Amazon is so low that I consider this one of the greatest steals I&#x27;ve come across. This is the same cologne that received better marks than more expensive competitors on various websites, but you don&#x27;t need a silly review with subjectively attributed points to know that this is a great product. The smell lingers for quite a long time, and the smell is breezy, slightly musky - light and oceanic, but still masculine. The first person to tell me how lovely I smelled was a friend&#x27;s girlfriend. She said after I shook her hand (sprayed at the wrists) the smell lingered and she loved it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was the second time I wore it going out, and dare I say the fragrance is very much a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, in my opinion there are \\&quot;better\\&quot; colognes out there, but they will cost you upwards of $80-100 for a 3.4oz bottle. This product should be much more expensive, but it isn&#x27;t. Gentlemen, do yourselves a favor and get it now.</li>
            <li> This is now one of my favorite clognes. The smell is pretty strong and lasts a long time. I really hope amazon doesn&#x27;t stop carrying this clogne anytime soon because I definitely will be back to order more!</li>
            <li> Really nice cologne. Lasts really long and i love the smell of it. Best bang for your buck cologne imo!</li>
            <li> This smell became annoying quickly. It&#x27;s the first cologne i&#x27;ve ever bought after searching online for an inexpensive fragrance for men. To me, the smell is an irritating, soapy, and over powering. It&#x27;s one of those smells that you never forget and you hope dissipates quickly before you start choking on its intruding head.</li>
            <li> I am touchy with my purchases on cologne but this one works wonderful.  I usually have high dollar smells, but this one is awesome for the price.  very nice.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. The price for this was better than we could find in stores. I would buy this item again if i ever need more.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it.  This is sort of a classic cologne and smells really good.</li>
            <li> Use this cologne daily &amp; get compliments regular. Scent does last. Really recommend it is on of my personal favorites.</li>
            <li> You know that guy who walks past you wearing that awesome cologne and you want to adk hik where he purchased it, but you hesitate to turn around just in case someone happens to be looking in your direction and mistakes you for being &amp;#34;Lite in the sneakers&#x27; so you walk the rest of your life smelling like fast food and axe?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is that cologne.</li>
            <li> I was worried it may be some rip-off, but no way! It is the real thing that&#x27;s for sure! I loved the price as well!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what all the rave is about it, maybe I got the fake version, but its ok.  Doesn&#x27;t blow me out of the water, but it does have a good scent that seems to last awhile. (I wouldnt say the whole day that&#x27;s for sure).</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for with this cologne.  It&#x27;s decent but not great, it has a nice ocean breezy summer day kinda scent.</li>
            <li> Love the scent. This will be my choice of cologne for a while. The wife likes it as well! A+</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.i read some reviews and people want a $15 cologne to spend like the expensive ones.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for a great price.</li>
            <li> Great for everyday casual use, and the price is right. However, if you are buying only one cologne, this shouldn&#x27;t be it. It is best suited for a warm sunny day and definitely not anything business oriented.</li>
            <li> its an amazing cool scent, its very refreshing cools the air around you in a sense. My package came in yesturday i havent smelled it before i bought it but the ratings and the reviews where so great i decided to take a leap of fate and trust the fact i was getting a great cologne for a great price. When i opened the box to get a whiff of it for the first time i immediatly was satisfied and it put a huge smile on my face i am extremly happy. I actually wish i could rate this a 10 star!! Some my say thats exagerating but this cologne at this price is a miracle! This cologne to me, is a mood shifter when i put it on it change my mood to a more happier state cause of the sense its just so cleansing. Ive always loved colognes that are clean, and not so heavy and dark so thats why i would put this on my top ten i am definetly buying more in the future :D</li>
            <li> Perfect, shipping good</li>
            <li> Im from another country so I purchased this item  for my husband and he loved the perfume and The price is excellent</li>
            <li> The perfume is &amp;#34;REALLY good for the price&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not too harsh on the nose and the fragrance stays fresh for a long time.</li>
            <li> excellent product at a great price</li>
            <li> It has a light, clean, fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t give me a headache. Very nice!</li>
            <li> I love this cologne and this was the cheapest I could find it.</li>
            <li> The scent is strong &amp; not very flattering. It seems to last longer than other colognes, but it does not smell good.</li>
            <li> Ladies love it! I suggest this highly!</li>
            <li> Great product; Great Price.</li>
            <li> smell like water! dont waste ur money</li>
            <li> Received is about a week ago, has been my go to cologne. Not overbearing like the Kenneth Cole or Hugo Boss I&#x27;ve been using up to this point.  Very subtle which is my particular preference. One should wear cologne, not reek of it across the room.</li>
            <li> Cologne has nice clean smell to it but would not recommend purchase as it is a VERY heavy cologne. My boyfriend gave his bottle away as it was way to strong on him just using even two sprays. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Very light fresh  smell but not not close to Nautica Blue. Good size pack in decent price .</li>
            <li> I was once told I smelled nice while wearing it...</li>
            <li> This is the best men&#x27;s cologne I have ever had. I am buying the same one for the 3rd time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time I was checking in to the airport I went past the scanners without a beep, all of a sudden a TSA officer stopped me. I was surprised, and I started to think wild &amp;#34;am I being profiled&amp;#34; and to my surprise he asked &amp;#34;what perfume is it?&amp;#34;....lol..... Funny, isn&#x27;t it....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used 10 different brands in last 5 years and this is the one I liked the most.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my brother, he loves it and so does his lady. Smells great and has a great price!</li>
            <li> This is a total dud. Nice bottle, blue colored liquid, but no fragrance. Even with 4 sprays, cannot smell it beyond 30mins. Either its a fake or its so old that its lost its fragrance. Ordered it from Amazon LLC (not any other provider). Because its considered a hazardous liquid, it cannot be returned to Amazon. I think that should qualify for a lawsuit where they can ship it to you and you cannot ship it back. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> very fast shipping and its definitely the designer brand. I&#x27;ve purchased numerous bottles and will continue to buy them with this awesome price!!!!</li>
            <li> Like it!&lt;br /&gt;Its fragrance is ok.&lt;br /&gt;Lasts longer and worth the amount paid for it.</li>
            <li> Not bad. I wear it. I can deal with it..</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas and never smelled it. When it came it was nicely packaged. I smelled it when he opened it and it smelled amazing. We both love it. I highly recommend buying this you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I tested the Nautica Voyage in Macy&#x27;s and it smelled good and the little amount that I put on my wrist lasted for a good 6-7 hours. I then bought this from Amazon since it was cheaper, but this is not the same quality. The packaging and everything looks the same, but the smell lasts for a mere 30-45 minutes. I did some research and saw a lot of other people having the same problem with the quality. I would advise against buying it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought is as a present for my husband. Took a chance as he had owned Nautica in the past.  This has a just-showered freshness but is not a wimpy scent. It is not too strong--appropriate for the office. My husband was very pleasantly surprised at choosing a scent by description and having it be very accurately described!</li>
            <li> the best smell for the money..must have in your colections..the lady&#x27;s will thank you and you will turn heads where people trying to see where its coming from.</li>
            <li> Voyage smells fresh! It is a great cologne but it doesn&#x27;t have the smell that sets it apart from other colognes. All I need is just a couple of sprays and that would last forever. I&#x27;ve been looking for a cologne that doesn&#x27;t fade fast and this is my favorite work cologne. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad even after sweating and working out... It&#x27;s great for daytime use but would rather use something else at night. I gave it 4stars for smelling average but not cheap and for its longevity.</li>
            <li> I really like it :x big bottle, cheep, the time quite long ,the smell is so cool with that price, ......................</li>
            <li> I love the smell, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Best Cologne I have ever used. The woman love it. Lol I will deff buy more when I run out</li>
            <li> I like to keep this in the car for a quick fresh clean smelling fragrance! It has gotten as many compliments as some of the very expensive colognes in my experience.</li>
            <li> Wow even for fake pakaging totally worth 17 buck n shipping is free</li>
            <li> Came packaged great and smells awesome. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> After doing some research, I decided to try this particularly for its reported longevity. I like the scent and it lasts all day. Even the day after I can still smell it&#x27;s lingering aroma.</li>
            <li> When women in your vicinity randomly say some one smells delicious and you know they are obviously talking about you, you know that your cologne smells amazing.  Nuff said.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son.  Smells fresh and woody.  Good for warm weather.</li>
            <li> Smells just like the old nautica competition I used to wear. Great price! Also, I am very particular about the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; smell from colognes that are similarly priced; this does not have that problem.</li>
            <li> Been buying this cologne for years. First time buying online and I am mad I didn&#x27;t sooner. Great deal and really fast shipping. Definitely recommend others to buy this.</li>
            <li> First time buying cologne, I think it&#x27;s great. Smells awesome, lasts a long time, my girlfriend likes it. Good stuff :)</li>
            <li> Product came very quickly and the price was the lowest I could find!</li>
            <li> I had read reviews from other buyers that it wasn&#x27;t the &amp;#34;REAL&amp;#34; cologne but I took a chance to see for myself. Unfortunately  I have to agree it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the real cologne. I&#x27;ve worn nautica voyage cologne for 3 years and instantly when I received it and applied it I could tell the scent was not the same. The box and bottle seem to be legit but the fragrance nor the endurance of the scent seem to match that of my previous nautica voyage. I would&#x27;t buy this if you are a true fan of the real cologne.</li>
            <li> Not really something i would buy again. Something u buy at 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> A GEM!!!! Great price must keep in collection</li>
            <li> Not a great cologne. Didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite Cologne, its suddle, fresh, and it always smells good no matter where you&#x27;re headed</li>
            <li> Was not impressed with the smell. it smells like a product designed for women than for a man. May be a unisex product, but coming from a Drakkar Noir, this is not my cup of tea.</li>
            <li> The service was great and price is great</li>
            <li> Best smelling stuff out there!!</li>
            <li> Nice smell but mild. Read the following review and mine is the exact same. &#x27;imagine a nice looking guy wearing white shirt, half buttoned up with sleeves rolled up, sitting at the beach, smiling.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Came as promised, cheap, but good cologne. Honestly, there is fowl play about with the &#x27;Voyage&#x27; series. I&#x27;ve gotten it from multiple vendors and have received 2 different kinds of bottles, slightly varied but the same name. One has a more quality feel, and thus a sweeter, more quality scent. The other (the one that I received) has a cheaper, plastic cap, and a more harsh, alcoholy scent to it. Again, both are boxed the same under the same line. I don&#x27;t know if its just the bad batch that they sell off for cheap or what, but very annoying when its a guessing game as to what I&#x27;m getting. Both smell good, but there&#x27;s an obvious inconsistency in final product. 2 stars for playing a guessing game when it comes to that, super frustrating, especially when you only know after you unbox it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much and it should last a long time....waiting for compliments!...:)</li>
            <li> How can you explain how something smells? I don&#x27;t like girly smelling colognes for men and I don&#x27;t like extremely strong scents either. This is a nice smelling man&#x27;s cologne that doesn&#x27;t smell girly like Allure Homme Sport for instance and doesn&#x27;t have a very heavy fragrance like Hugo Boss. It&#x27;s a nice smelling non-feminine but non-macho fragrance. It&#x27;s good. The fragrance doesn&#x27;t last forever but it doesn&#x27;t wear off right away either. I&#x27;d say that for this price, it&#x27;s a damned good everyday cologne. I would wear this one more in the summer than in the winter. More of a summery fragrance. I have bought this TWICE on Amazon. And both times, it is AUTHENTIC. I purchased this BOTH times from Savings Club. It is AUTHENTIC. I also bought Versace Man Eau Fraiche By Gianni Versace For Men Edt Spray 3.4 Oz directly from AMAZON and THAT product was, in  my opinion, a fake copy of the original fragrance. I&#x27;ll stick with the vendor named Savings Club in the future.</li>
            <li> Smells good but doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive but one of my preferred aquatics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly reminds me of walking on a cool beach with salt spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My preferred summer morning fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it lasted longer I would give 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Top Notch for aftershave!</li>
            <li> Very weak fragrance. Uncertain of authenticity or how old product is. Anyways got it cheap so no problem.</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Smell sticks with you and actually changes over time.</li>
            <li> Bought mine from Amazon using prime, and while it does smell really good, it doesn&#x27;t last 2 minutes. I&#x27;ve heard there are knock offs here but I thought buying from Amazon themself would alleviate me having to worry about that but with how quickly this fades I&#x27;m inclined to believe it&#x27;s a knock off. I give it 2 stars because it does smell good.</li>
            <li> Sweet smelling drydown...almost an unisex perfume!</li>
            <li> smells wonderful, just like the mall!</li>
            <li> Great scent! My boyfriend wears it daily!</li>
            <li> Clean, bright, soap fresh with sensual undertones. This is not little boys Axe, this is for men who want a little scent that intriques not overpowers.</li>
            <li> Very nice product. Excellent price!</li>
            <li> my wife love it and very good price</li>
            <li> Product was delivered ahead of schedule.  Experience re purchase was excellent.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> The real cologne is very good - this stuff they sell on Amazon is fake.  At least, the bottle I received was fake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five stars for the real cologne, zero stars for this fake stuff.</li>
            <li> I got this fragrance as a blind-buy after reading and watching many reviews and I must say, I&#x27;m honestly very impressed! The scent is an appealing aquatic- very light and fresh-perfect for the spring and summertime. And for such a great price, it was definitely worth the buy! I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a remarkably pleasant light, fresh aquatic cologne to wear, without having to break the bank!</li>
            <li> This spray was long lasting. It had an amazing smell. I would recommend it to anyone! Bought it for my boyfriend, he wears it all the time now.</li>
            <li> I put on 3 sprays and it lasted for hours smelling the same and just as strong. Don&#x27;t over spray it, cause it can be overpowering. The smell is great, and the price is unbeatable. Lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> A mi mujer le encanta y por donde paso  o en oficina las mujeres suspiran por este olor y dicen quien huele tan divino</li>
            <li> The Smell is Wonderful! It&#x27;s an everyday cologne and at a very Good price! And shipped even earlier then I expected! I would totally recommend this.</li>
            <li> One of the best colognes ive owned . Good use for any occasion.</li>
            <li> clean smelling, love it.  Fast shipment too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say excellent but okay. Cheap and worthy.</li>
            <li> This is one of the least expensive colognes I&#x27;ve bought, but the best performing. Projection and sillage is 10/10. The fragrance is outstanding as well, 10/10. Smells like a fresh ocean breeze coming over a field of very manly flowers! I&#x27;ve received several compliments on this. It&#x27;s not a fragrance that will offend anyone but any more than 2-3 sprays is too much. Longevity is 6-8 hours, so top marks there as well. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about this fragrance.</li>
            <li> As represented and delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Smells very good. Thanks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Nothing to brag anout. Just a nice fresh clean simple scent. I honestly don&#x27;t smell it after 15 minutes but people still seem to notice it hours later.</li>
            <li> smells great but has no staying power wears off quickly</li>
            <li> Nautica hit the mark with this brand tons of complements people constantly said &amp;#34;that guy always smells good&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Amazing perfume.. Smells awesome. Giving 4 stars because the cap had popped and had to fix it. Took long time to do that</li>
            <li> Excellent value here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good smelling stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well worth the price you pay.</li>
            <li> Got it for my husband. He loves it!</li>
            <li> 2 sprays and I keep smelling good all day.  Light enough for summer and work.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back to Mugler cologne anytime soon.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cologne I wish I could find the aftershave. For some reason Nautica no longer makes this scent. It is really a shame</li>
            <li> Nautica is a pleasant and refreshing after shave that has a very subtle fragrance that  is quietly noticeable. It is also very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> great low cost great smelling mens fragrance</li>
            <li> Heard a lot about this scent on review videos and on this site as well....so, I blind bought it. Hey! It was affordable enough so I took a chance. However.....this is way too strong for my taste. It&#x27;s not a bad scent, but it&#x27;s just too overpowering to my senses. I&#x27;m not a heavy sprayer or a person who &amp;#34;bathes&amp;#34; in their cologne, so that wasn&#x27;t the reason. Just a test spray on my skin and I had to wash it off within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;More people than not really like this scent and I&#x27;m not knocking it, it&#x27;s just too strong for me.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this, but I would also recommend you to go out and smell it at a store BEFORE you blind buy.</li>
            <li> I got this perfume for my brother and he loved it . This is a nice perfume with great price .</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Affordable&lt;br /&gt;2. Really smells good&lt;br /&gt;3. Scent lasts long&lt;br /&gt;4. Got compliments from people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A best buy.</li>
            <li> I used this perfume in the past and got too many compliments, I first got it as a gift from a good friend of mine, but after smelling it and getting many good compliments at work and at the stores I bought me 3 more bottles, I only stop using it to try new ones but I will buy it again for me and as a gift for Christmas for my brother.</li>
            <li> I had previously bought this same exact size fragrance at a department store for twice the price, so needless to say, I was very happy with the price. I still had a little left in the old bottle and the fragrance is the same as far as I can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside was the atomizer on the new bottle didn&#x27;t actually mist the product- it just makes a narrow stream. This wasn&#x27;t a problem for me since i could just swap it out with the one from the old bottle, but it something to be concerned with if this is your first purchase.</li>
            <li> I was looking for this for a long time I just to use this lint time ago and now I have it of you have some deals let me know I like the prices</li>
            <li> not the greatest smelling perfume , but i wear it just for work. and it gets the job done.  no complaints.</li>
            <li> This is a great smelling cologne at a great price compared to department stores. Cologne has slight fruit notes along with the traditional &amp;#34;aqua&amp;#34; type notes. Shipping was fast and bottle was packaged well.</li>
            <li> Very clean, light, fresh smell that lasts at least the day for me, and I don&#x27;t bath in it if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> exelente el producto!</li>
            <li> excellent smell&lt;br /&gt;excellent product to have and good for men&lt;br /&gt;good for gift to your friend or family and etc,,,,,</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d get tired of strange women walking up to me telling me I smell nice.</li>
            <li> My choice for 2014. It has personality, balance and smoothness. My wife, who is much younger than I, love it. what else is there to say.</li>
            <li> The product is good. I just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> People around me tend to love this more than I do, and this is my favorite cologne.  Will purchase again when mine empties</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE YOU WILL BUY IN THE MALL. DIFFERENCE IS NO OVERHEAD, LIKE RENT, STAFF, ELECTRIC ETC. THIS EFFECTS THE PRICE GREATLY.&lt;br /&gt; LOVE THE SMELL FOR ME MUCH BETTER THEN COOLWATER AND LAST LONGER.</li>
            <li> You can order this cologne any time you need it, it is a good cologne and what a wonderful price</li>
            <li> It is more than what you pay for. This is my second time I bought this one. I use it on regular basis. Does not seem cheap as it is.</li>
            <li> For 16 dollars this is an amazing scent.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance for beginners, but easily could see myself keeping this in the collection for life. Really clean, aquatic scent as the name states. You can really tell a difference between wearing this from the first few hours to the end - makes it enjoyable to wear.</li>
            <li> I have had several women comment that I smell good while wearing this product.  However, it seems to dissipate within an hour or so.  If it lasted longer I would give it 5 stars probably.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this had been the best thing from Nautica i have ever bought. I never have worn it without getting compliments. It is a gentle scent that lasts all day. While its first tone elicits the most compliments, its later tones towards the end of the day gets girls that hug me to linger just a little bit longer and say how good i smell. Very personal. very good smelling.</li>
            <li> Product is certainly not the original. Doesn&#x27;t stay on for even 10 minutes. I tried the original at Macy&#x27;s and a vast difference in scent and in durability. Don&#x27;t buy these cheapos... You have been warned.</li>
            <li> I was really nervous while buying this perfume online but i must say that i made a good decision. My husband just loves it and so am I :)</li>
            <li> It. Smells. AMAZING!!!!</li>
            <li> Great scent long lasting. Can smell next day. Amazon has best price on fragrance.Ships really fast. Received in 2 days</li>
            <li> I got this as a last minute Christmas gift for my brother. I had never smelled the scent before and was a little scared but bought it anyways because of all the good reviews I read. I am so glad I bought it!! It was great and my brother loved it!</li>
            <li> Nice Packaging, I unboxed and then put a little on my hands, smell fresh and clean not too strong but sober instead, You can feel marine connotations on the smell flavor, women&#x27;s will loved, my wife like it so much. Did not last 24 hours, (I just spray it once on my neck) but thats fine with me. I really love it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for someone else and they loved it! Great size, smell, quality, and price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great describing what Voyage smells like, I&#x27;ll leave that to others, so I&#x27;ll just say it has a high quality masculine scent. A very nice heavy weight bottle too. Was a blind buy for me and I&#x27;m extremely happy w/ it. Made in USA !</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and I get compliments all the time!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great every day scent. Clean smell and it&#x27;s inexpensive for a good cologne. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, do so.</li>
            <li> Smells great.&lt;br /&gt;RECEIVED VERY FAST!!</li>
            <li> Smell good and stay the whole day...</li>
            <li> Good price for great cologne.  My teenager son&#x27;s favorite!</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it lasts longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I love this product, as this is my second time ordering this product. Smells awesome!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered colognes on Amazon for quite some time, however I was very disappointed which this and the previous purchase (Cool Water). In the past the products seemed to be the same as what you would purchase in a store, but no longer! They now seem to be only half strengh knock offs, buyer beware.</li>
            <li> Brilliant Smell, but does not last very long</li>
            <li> the smell lasts a long time. my husband loved it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if mine is authentic or not, but the fragrance is nice and stays for quite some time (not the whole day). But according to others&#x27; reviews I think i got the fake one. However, it&#x27;s still a good purchase (cheap and smells nice).</li>
            <li> Great price and smell as always from nautica. Sophisticated manly classy smell.</li>
            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never tried this scent it will likely be a pleasant surprise. Supposedly this scent is fresh cut leaves with some subtle mossy and woody undertones. To me it seems like a very fresh aroma with an aquatic bouquet just as you&#x27;d suspect by looking at the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually prefer Lucky as my daily cologne but I was wanting something different for a change and saw that this cologne received excellent ratings so I decided to give it a go. Although, it won&#x27;t replace Lucky as my favorite daily cologne it is definitely a strong contender. If you&#x27;d like a summer scent that reminds you of sailing on bright blue waters then definitely give Nautica a try...</li>
            <li> I did pretty good research before buying this product. I read most of reviews. There were few people claiming that this is not an original product. Since I trust amazon, I ignored those reviews and bought it. Now, I regret it. It does not last long. May be 2-3 hrs, that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was looking for. Shipped Fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed by this perfume at all and the smell is not even lasts for 2 hours. Wastage of money. I DON&#x27;T recommend to buy this.</li>
            <li> Smells great, i am new to this cologne game so i don&#x27;t know if its watered down or not. But seems to last long so i guess its not watered down. I recommend if you are just trying to smell a bit better especially for this price.&lt;br /&gt;Hands down smells great , makes you feel like you can eat an apple in peace like out in the sea of the Caribbean</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.  I don&#x27;t understand why Nautica decided to dilute their brand but they sure did with this.  The is drug store quality fragrance.  It smells fresh enough but doesn&#x27;t last until lunchtime.  It just seems to wear off.  Not the quality I&#x27;m used to getting with Nautica.</li>
            <li> one of my favorites colognes of all time. The smell on your clothes lasts forever!!!</li>
            <li> I have always been an avid cologne consumer. my signature scent as of the past year has been BVLGARI man Extreme. And while that still is my favorite cologne, my bottle ran dry about a week ago. I had a first date planned with this girl, and i kind of forgot until she reminded me, and i thought &amp;#34;oh crap i dont have cologne&amp;#34;. i was right near my local retail store, and i ran in. No BVLGARi. so i asked for some help from the girl working and she recommended this fragrance. when i first tried it on i wasnt too impressed, but impressed enough to get the 1.7oz bottle since i just needed SOMETHING. i put it on after my grooming regimen and ran out the door. by the time i got to the girls apartment to pick her up, the scent had seemingly settled into a much more clean/fresh aquatic scent that i really enjoyed. by the end of the night i had received a very nice compliment about my smell. so i highly recommend it for a nice summer day/night fragrance. and for the price, you just cant beat it.</li>
            <li> Smells good.. Not amazing but decent enough to buy,</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend and he loved it ! Definitely buying this again .</li>
            <li> Fantastic deal and the item is a genuine product.  The scent last for hours and smells great on the husband.</li>
            <li> I have used this almost daily since I purchased it about a year ago and I still love it just as much as the day I received it. It may be a fairly inexpensive bottle of cologne, but it&#x27;s got a long lasting scent that I&#x27;ve been complimented on regularly. This has been applied daily for over a year, and I&#x27;m maybe 1/3 of my way through the bottle. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Great cologne for the price. I am impressed with the smell. I do get compliments from the ladies. What can I say, GREAT COLOGNE!</li>
            <li> Recd quick!!  Good product!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> Very nice scent, fantastic deal.  Would buy again if the bottle wasn&#x27;t so big, it will last forever</li>
            <li> not very special as I thought would it be, but, for the money you pay is good perfurm. I think it only last around 4 hours.</li>
            <li> one of my favorite smelling colognes. buying colognes online as opposed to a department store seem to affect how long the smell lasts throughout the day, but don&#x27;t understand why. either way I&#x27;m happy with the product and I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t the first time i&#x27;ve ordered and used it. I&#x27;m pleased with the product and it&#x27;s shipping</li>
            <li> Perfect and great price</li>
            <li> Smells good, but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne twice at Macys because its my wifes favorite cent on me. Because we moved it was easier to purchase it this time online. While everything looks identical this product had no scent and was barely distinguishable. After 2 minutes you cant even small it on your skin or neck collar. I really believe this is nothing but a knock off and just warn people so they are not as disappointed as I was.</li>
            <li> MY WIFE SAYS I SMELL GREAT!!, THAT&#x27;S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME!! :)&lt;br /&gt;NICE PRICE TOO!!</li>
            <li> smells good but not concentrated</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly (Amazon Prime), in pristine shape, and smells great.  As others have said in reviews, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances &amp; I love being able to get it at such an amazing price through Amazon.  Plus, the suggestions row &amp; 1-click ordering is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renaldo Hunt</li>
            <li> We dednt resive irems</li>
            <li> This  is great. Its smelling makes me comfortable.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t Lasts Longer...</li>
            <li> This was a gift. But I like it also.</li>
            <li> this colone is great with chicks... they love it, also it smells smoothly and doesnt make me go nausiated, is awesome.. works for day and night! Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Smells great. I&#x27;ve worn it for a week and have gotten several compliments on the scent. Lasts most of the day. Five stars</li>
            <li> I love the smell. With such a economical price, the fragrance is truly amazing. I used hanae mori, dolce &amp; cabana, Joop, La Nuit YSL, Gorgio armani equ de gio, Eternity, Obsession, Aspen, Emporio diamond armani, mania, code, and so many but this one price-wise is really good. I also like Gorgio Emporio Diamond, and and YSL La Nuit they are also the best smelling perfumes.</li>
            <li> Smells exactly like a cheap perfume. Won&#x27;t use it and dislike the smell. Smells exactly like a cheap perfume. Won&#x27;t use it and dislike the smell</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this. Does not last at all. Even after using a lot, barely lasts for couple of hours. This can&#x27;t be the real one.</li>
            <li> I have smelled these before at Nautica stores and other perfume stores, but they sell for like $60. This is definitely cheaper and has the same quality of smell from the Nautica stores, not washed out at all.</li>
            <li> I got a compliment from a 10 while I was walking on campus...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know those hot girls that give out free samples of Red Bulls?? The really gorgeous attractive ones ?! Yeah one of them went out of her way to tell me that I smell really good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scene is MY SCENT! (Not because of that) This is the type of cologne you can wear anywhere, anytime. Whether you&#x27;re about to get a hand job, you&#x27;re going to hit the gym, going out to a rave with your buddies, or you&#x27;re simply going to work. This scent can be worn ANYWHERE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not overpowering at all. I have a tendency to over spray myself with cologne because I question its longetivity and tendency to even be noticed. I over sprayed this half the time I wore it and I got no complaints but rather compliments. Other colognes I&#x27;ve used that I&#x27;ve over sprayed, I get the &amp;#34;overpowering lecture.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the real deal if you want to wear a cologne that makes it seem like you&#x27;re not even wearing a cologne ! You just got out of the shower, and your whole body just happens to smell naturally fresh and great. 👍👍. Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about cologne, but I like this product.  It smells good and the price is reasonable.  I get compliments on it occasionally.  You can buy a can of Axe for around $5, or get this for around $15 -- I know which I will choose in the future.  I&#x27;ve been using it daily for a few months and still have over 90% of the bottle left.</li>
            <li> Initial review (will be updated):&lt;br /&gt;I am a female and I bought this for my beau. I just received it today and the shipping was timely. It was packaged fairly well in brown paper in a box. I was looking forward to this scent because I read \\&quot;apple\\&quot; and I love that smell. After the first spray I realized--this smells like men&#x27;s cologne. And to me, that&#x27;s not a very delightful smell. It smells generic. It smells like all the sprays of cologne I&#x27;ve ever used at sephora. It smells like nothing special, and it&#x27;s honestly very overpowering. While I&#x27;m not too fond of the generic men&#x27;s cologne smell, I&#x27;m hoping it changes a little on my boyfriend. I most of all hope he likes it. He&#x27;ll be the one smelling himself afterall.&lt;br /&gt;Bottle: simple, large, durable glass.&lt;br /&gt;Smell: it&#x27;s fresh. It&#x27;s masculine. It&#x27;s slightly woody and musky. It&#x27;s difficult for me to pinpoint individual scents. It smells like men&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: boyfriend is quite pleased and says it&#x27;s \\&quot;exactly what he wanted in a cologne.\\&quot;  what more could I have asked?</li>
            <li> This one definitely hits the mark of \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; but it can also be worn with an elegant suit and not throw it off too much. It also sticks for a while too. It last&#x27; pretty long. The bottle alone looks really nice in a collection. I&#x27;m going to order another one while it&#x27;s under $20. LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> I received my purchase in less time than I expected and the product is good. This fragance is really good, it&#x27;s for a cool gentleman who wants a fresh aroma.</li>
            <li> The perfume is a mixture of Gucci and Dolce. The smell is soft, light which makes it soft to smell to the nostrils. This is a buy worth buying and will last quite a while. This is a good product, recommended, especially as a gift. :D</li>
            <li> The Nautica Voyage By Nautica For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 oz has a good essence, but it has not a good fixation.</li>
            <li> This cologne is in the upper echelon of my run-of-the-mill colognes.  So as soon as its finish, I gotta get another!</li>
            <li> this is great and the lady love it.............</li>
            <li> Masculine, fresh out of the shower smell, durable. For the price, aint nothing better than this. The best work cologne I have had tasted.</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD... JUST NOT VERY STRONG</li>
            <li> My wife loves this cologne she can not keep her hands off me. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this cologne is the best cologne for the price . Perfect for the summer the fragance take over it . I got a lot compliments . I will buy again and again 5 stars!! The fragance last for about 5-6 hours . On my understand  this type of fragance is for a hot weather &amp;#34;hot days&amp;#34; . This cologne doesn&#x27;t have a cheap smell . That what I like more about it.</li>
            <li> Nice colone,  but wears off after like 30 - 40 minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for the Nautica Voyage for a long time now. Glad to see Amazon had it listed as one of their top sellers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the cologne is a bit stronger than I remember, its fragrance is excellent.</li>
            <li> Excellent, but the smell is so familiar there&#x27;s no way to stand out, but I suppose if you&#x27;re buying one of the most highly rated colognes on Amazon you&#x27;re not necessarily looking for a truly unique smell anyway, right? ;)</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Slight cucumber scent.  Fresh.  Good for day wear.  I wear it to the office.  Incredibly low price.</li>
            <li> Good price nice smell it&#x27;s spicy which some girls find it awesome in some men.</li>
            <li> The smell is nice, but it lasts for just one hour or so. Dissapointed!</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> Great Fragrance and quite worth it for its price.</li>
            <li> Great price and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Figured it was the best smelling with so many purchases and popularity but I really need to smell it first before I buy. Was not really crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> Not the best smelling</li>
            <li> I like the crisp fresh scent, it&#x27;s light and very appealing, good for the evenings. I just love it! It arrived on the date shown in the shipping advice and I was really happy to have ordered this product!</li>
            <li> Item received as specified. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I was tempted to give this cologne 1 star simply so others wouldn&#x27;t buy it and my &#x27;secret cologne&#x27; would remain just that. But, alas- I&#x27;ll be decent. This is a timeless cologne. Not too strong, not too light and the perfect scent. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for about a year and a half and never had a single complaint. Just the opposite actually- everyone always compliments me and asks what brand cologne I&#x27;m wearing. I never tell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is easily the best cologne money can buy and as long as Nautica is producing it they&#x27;ll have at least one buyer.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne. Good value for the amount</li>
            <li> Great fragrance at a great deal</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, product just as expected</li>
            <li> I liked the fragrance, its light. But as mentioned in other reviews it does not last really long. The bottle is heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> NICE FOR MY LADY TO SMELL ON ME</li>
            <li> I am pleased with fragrance and the bottle has a very nice heavy feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel the spritzer could be better, it doesn&#x27;t disperse very well.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal, and many people would probably say it&#x27;s among the top 50 colognes or so (especially for the price).  Having said that, I didn&#x27;t particularly enjoy the scent.  It is a crisp, clean, linen smell but just didn&#x27;t do it for me.  It is a bit boring, too safe, and a little too synthetic smelling for something that is supposed to pass as clean and natural.&lt;br /&gt;After seeing all the reviews online, however, I think I am in the minority.  The masses seem to rave over this cologne.</li>
            <li> smells great, holds all day, great price. recommended to all guys that want a good smell for a low price</li>
            <li> This cologne is a perfect casual summer cologne. Its smells great/refreshing however the only thing which i dont really like about this is that the projection/longevity on this thing is not that great at all until unless you put on your clothes which of course is not a great idea either..</li>
            <li> Its a nice masculine scent not too harsh n very mild with scent ov fresh waters. Ll buy again lovely</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last. I think it is an imitation.&lt;br /&gt;Pay a bit more and get a better stuff. Don&#x27;t buy any cologne online</li>
            <li> I honestly purchased this due to the great price a few weeks ago, and had never smelled it previously. I read the reviews and just couldn&#x27;t pass up the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely happy that I didn&#x27;t pass on it. This has become one of my favorite colognes, and it is now in heavy rotation along with Armani Code.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a &#x27;water&#x27; cologne, and some people just don&#x27;t like that style...and that&#x27;s just fine. I love the style, and think this is one of the best smelling colognes in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also quite long lasting. I generally apply it before work, and it&#x27;s still noticeable when I&#x27;m getting home ~10 hours later(at very close distance)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a great scent that I&#x27;m really glad I jumped on. I jumped at an even cheaper price on Nautica Blue, and while I&#x27;m not as enamored with the scent, it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> this is a very light clean everyday fragrance. i am a teacher and its perfect for work. not overbearing or to strong @ all. very nice clean scent. its def something to buy especially for the AMAZING price! like all fragrances from this website, i would ONLY purchase if its sold by amazon! i would not trust any fragrance from any other seller. ive read too many horror stories.</li>
            <li> my husband loves it and so do I.&lt;br /&gt;It smells phenomenal very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Like a splash of water, and it&#x27;s a&lt;br /&gt;great price.</li>
            <li> It is a new perfume in my selection but I&#x27;ve heard very good reviews from the so I&#x27;ll try this perfume, I really hope it&#x27;s just the way described in the positive comments I have heard from the&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfume is as is as described and delivery was stipulated</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing this is what heaven smells like.</li>
            <li> loved it. not too strong, but just good enough to show your identity</li>
            <li> Is a good parfume for the diary use</li>
            <li> It is fake. Do not buy it.</li>
            <li> Nice and fast. thanks</li>
            <li> From what I can tell, I received a genuine bottle of this. I have received many compliments and definitely recommend this scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More info: 21 year old, Male in college.</li>
            <li> If I keep using this stuff,i&#x27;m going to an early grave.At 75 all the women chasing me are going to force me to try Viagra/Cialis.The side effects are scarey tho,Who needs to go blind just when you achieve a four hour erection?</li>
            <li> This cologone smells very good. It is not too strong. Several sprays works great and lasts. People can&#x27;t help but comliment on the smell.</li>
            <li> WOW, SMELLS GREAT &amp; GREAT DEAL WHEN PURCHASED FROM AMAZON.COM LLC&lt;br /&gt;I USE IT AS MY EVERYDAY FRAGANCE FOR WORK ETC!</li>
            <li> Price good. Smells nice. Is is a very good perfume.</li>
            <li> I bought this together with Cool Water. My girlfriend prefers this one.</li>
            <li> Smells very good and I&#x27;ve gotten a few complements from the ladies. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent.</li>
            <li> When I purchsae this product it was listed as new. When I placed my order I could not track my order. Then when I received my product it didn&#x27;t even have a cap it was not in a box, it actually looked used. It has a sticker that says tester. So obviously this was not a new item. This was supposed to be a gift for someone.&lt;br /&gt;I am very thankful to have found FragranceNet now that is a great company, not only did they send me a new item they sent a lot of free stuff like samples of other fragrances and a pocket mirror. I will be going with&lt;br /&gt;FragranceNet for my fragrance purchase.</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments wearing this product!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne so far. Extremely affordable but not cheap on the nose. Its a refreshing floral fruit sent, a great casual blend for summer or spring days. Nautica&#x27;s Voyage is medium strength but lasts all day.  Whether this is your first cologne or you have been wearing it for years this is definitely worth a shot and for the price you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> This not only smells great, but it is also Prime eligible. I will definitely buy this product again and use this seller.</li>
            <li> Very good, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> just ok. Scent is getting vanishing in one hours.. Seems like a duplicate product.</li>
            <li> GREAT DEAL ON AN AUTHENTIC DESIGNER FRAGRANCE! PERFECT TO WEAR EVERYDAY AND ALL DAY.. FOR THE PRICE I DONT MIND WASTING IT TO SMELL GOOD!</li>
            <li> Price and scent are great without overpowering you or those around you.  This was the first time I have purchased this cologne and I was not expecting it to be as great as it is based on the price, but decided to test due to the low cost.  I would definitely purchase again as the scent remains for hours without fade and it may have replaced my go to cologne.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Clean scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
            <li> I just keep on buying it. I love the scent!</li>
            <li> Just buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it. GREAT PRICE</li>
            <li> I wanted to find an inexpensive cologne for casual use. I was surprised to receive the number of compliments that I get while wearing this. The scent lasts all day too, my girlfriend loves it ;)</li>
            <li> I liked it very much! I got it on time and its a great product! good quality and beautiful!I liked it very much! I got it on time and its a great product! good quality and beautiful!I liked it very much! I got it on time and its a great product! good quality and beautiful!</li>
            <li> yes, the pricing is good and surprisingly this juice smells good and it last 12hrs plus, It is amazing people were asking me about it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had anyone tell me that they didn&#x27;t like this cologne. It has a pleasant smell that&#x27;s strong enough to be smelled from a few feet away, but not so strong that it kicks you in the nose and demands, \\&quot;SMELL ME!!!\\&quot; Normally this cologne is $30-40 in the store for the larger bottle, so it&#x27;s definitely cheaper here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also guys, remember: you only need to put a small spray on your neck and a small spray on each wrist. And maybe a spray on the front of your underwear if you&#x27;re feeling lucky.</li>
            <li> This was my first gift for my fiance. The smell is amazing! Personally, I feel it is worth the money I spent. It is not too strong and not too subtle. Would recommend purchasing this.</li>
            <li> Superb Fragrance.... At first not too sure... but then it grows on you... Most everyone likes that it has a crisp, clean scent..  ME TOO!</li>
            <li> Have gotten many compliments! At first I didn&#x27;t believe other comments, but this stuff is great. Even my ex girlfriend admitted that I smelled very good one night. I&#x27;ve really noticed that girls get closer to me, just so that they can smell me! Stick with the 3 spay limit gentleman.</li>
            <li> I buy this eau de toilette on a regular basis and this is by far the best price i ever paid.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T PAY MIND TO WHAT NEGATIVE THINGS THEY SAY ABOUT THIS COLOGNE. ITS AMAZING. 2 SPRAYS LASTS ME MY WHOLE SCHOOLDAY.</li>
            <li> yeah this is a great deal got it for less than 15 and what can i say always a great deal here, i bought some other cologne here and they all great and goood prices lol.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and use it daily for work. Its not too strong where it would offend your coworkers but its light at the end of day. When my wife hugs me after work she can still smell it on my shirt.</li>
            <li> Got in a deal and is pleasant.  I would buy again this time to gift any one. .. .. ..</li>
            <li> This scent is long lasting and smells very good. a little bit goes a long way though. i would buy this again</li>
            <li> you get what you paid for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this fragrance doesn&#x27;t last too long.&lt;br /&gt;it begins to wear off quickly after 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;dont&#x27; expect too much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bought it right here on amazon.com</li>
            <li> The Nautica Voyager has a great scent. This is now my go to cologne. I will be ordering more soon.</li>
            <li> My special lady friend loves the scent and I love the price. Plus it has a long shelf life, a couple sprays last all night.</li>
            <li> Omg, this is a beast. I love it and so do the ladys.</li>
            <li> bought pants he hated, tennies he hated, boots that were too big, shorts he thought were ugly..trying to give him a nice birthday, He liked the cologne,</li>
            <li> This is practically the only scent my son and husband wear.  It&#x27;s light and fresh and lasts all day. I find many scents overbearing and offensive, but I really enjoy smelling Nautica Voyage.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents cool and casual</li>
            <li> Fast service good product</li>
            <li> At first I was pretty happy with this purchase. It smelled nice and while I noticed the scent only lasted an hour or two, I got a 3.4 ounce bottle when I only paid for a 1.7 ounce bottle and I paid like 1/3 normal retail price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day while shopping at a department store, I saw this cologne at the fragrance counter. I gave it a quick spray on my wrist (free cologne!) and noticed it was much stronger and more pleasant than mine. The single spray also lasted longer than the 2-3 I usually use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m seriously starting to believe I received a knock-off. The price is almost too good and the scent isn&#x27;t as good as the stuff from the department store. Amazon should look into this.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t pass up this offer as it was only $13. It&#x27;s a nice sweet smelling cologne for guys. At $13, would definitely buy again. Rating it a 4 because the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to linger or last long.</li>
            <li> Been using nautical voyage for a little over a month and I got to say it was worth the 16 buck.&lt;br /&gt;The smell can be describe as cutting a ripe apple next to the salty ocean sea.</li>
            <li> I love my nautica... I couldn&#x27;t believe the price and quality and quantity. Can&#x27;t beat it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> It has a little smell. The smell carries and is a clean crispy type.</li>
            <li> This is really surprising, I am impressed by the performance of the fragrance, it does last a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;mild and pleasing...  A++++</li>
            <li> Nice fresh fragrance for men...not to overpowering-for casual use everyday. Scent does not last long though... overall a nice cologne.</li>
            <li> This cologne is simply the tears of god.</li>
            <li> fake.allergic reaction</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it came right on time. All of my co-workers were asking me where i got it from! need another soon!</li>
            <li> Great smell for price. You will need 6 sprays of this but who cares, its under 20 dollars for at least 500 sprays.</li>
            <li> A+ very cheap compared to stores!</li>
            <li> GREAT VALUE FOR THE PRICE. ALMOST PURCHASED IN STORE FOR MUCH HIGHER PRICE.</li>
            <li> i love cologne it got a nice scent to it i love it  and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Quick Delivery &amp; good Product , Good discount</li>
            <li> This cologne had a very fresh scent and it last for half the day. Very inviting smell and isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
            <li> One that I love for my Husband</li>
            <li> Is an amazing product. Lovely scent.</li>
            <li> great summer scent and even better value</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Husband and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> pretty good for blind choice</li>
            <li> It has a unique masculine scent that will leave your wife wanting you more. very affordable!</li>
            <li> Smells alright but the cap was broken &amp; there was a crack on the bottle.</li>
            <li> Wanted to write this review because this definitely has too many high reviews for the smell. It does not smell manly, it smells like my grandmother.</li>
            <li> This is definitely fake, smells disappear after a few minutes, within 5 minutes you can&#x27;t smell anything.</li>
            <li> For the price, I didn&#x27;t expect it to smell that good. I&#x27;m glad I purchased that version of Nautica. People compliment me whenever I&#x27;m around. Definitely would recommend it for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Usually this is my favorite cologne but this last bottle smells like nothing. It is even a lighter color than a older one that I keep in my office.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells so dam good I mean really good now im not one to fully describe how it smells but listen to the comments and me when i say it smells really good!!!</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I received non-original version of this product but it just isn;t effective at all.&lt;br /&gt;It does not long even more than an Hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I did not return it (for the sake of avoiding hassle) but I will not recommend it to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;Its very simple,light,ordinary and does not serve the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to avoid it.... Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My fiance was very happy, especially with the size.</li>
            <li> Well it was on sale for $12.45 at Amazon. Thought I would try it. Smelled terrible. Looks like some people are getting fakes. So maybe I got one too - though I got mine directly from Amazon :-(. Can&#x27;t say for sure because I&#x27;ve never tried the original one - so can&#x27;t tell if mine is a fake or not. Anyways it smells bad and I wont be using it.</li>
            <li> This item was priced great, the packaging was great as well and the shipping was quick.  Everyone loves the scent.  I would recommend this.  It is a cool crisp summer scent</li>
            <li> I bought this bottle of Nautica Voyage to replace the bottle that I am almost out of that I purchased from Macy&#x27;s. When I saw the price I thought how can you go wrong but after getting the bottle I have experienced what many others have experienced here on amazon where the scent is not exactly the same. The bottle I had received is properly marked by Nautica, it had the sticker on the bottom of the bottle and is exactly the same as the one I bought from Macy&#x27;s and it came in the correct box. However after spraying the cologne from amazon you can tell the scent is not the same as the one I have from Macy&#x27;s. This one from amazon is noticeably lighter smell to it, and though it pretty much smells the same in terms of the scent, to me the bottle from amazon has a slightly more alcohol smell to it. I do not know if this is cause Nautica has changed how they made their cologne, or if this what others on here suggest is watered down but I do know it is just not the same as my older bottle from Macy&#x27;s, draw your own conclusions. Overall to get the same effect as my older bottle I may have to spray more, and maybe in in the future I am going to have to try it in the store again to see if it changed before I buy it again on amazon.</li>
            <li> Worth the price ! And it smells so good !</li>
            <li> I was close to giving this a five star but I reserve that because I don&#x27;t give many! first of the smell is incredible and the price is right! 2nd you can use this product anytime of the year especially if you live in Florida like I do.</li>
            <li> This product smells very good at a great price.</li>
            <li> for 20 bucks and cheaper this is a steal, i love this smell! my gf says its amazing! i used to use davidcool off and i liked that one but it was too expensive for me, but i was suggested this and i love it. for the price, its a great deal so i say get it boys!</li>
            <li> Smells great but not overpowering. Very clean and refreshing fragrance. Awesome price...highly recommended. Just buy it...you won&#x27;t regret it. :)</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic. It&#x27;s a nice clean aquatic. Great for the office. Projection isn&#x27;t all that. Definitely worth the money. It&#x27;s a really safe blind-buy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in proximity to a lot of people and in very social settings.  All I can tell you, from my experience, is that I get more compliments about how I smell than any other cologne I&#x27;ve worn.  It really does smell good and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> my cologne was damaged when i received it, half the cologne was missing</li>
            <li> If you havent smelled it, it smells exactly like Curve. Wish i would have known that before purchasing Voyage, I was hoping for something different. No more Blind buys for me. I&#x27;ve been Burned Twice!!</li>
            <li> I bought a 3.4 oz spray bottle sold by Amazon (not third party vendors) just last week. I had used it before and the fragrance used to last for days after a generous spraying. As other reviewers point out, the bottle I bought seems to be bogus one. The aroma fades very quickly both on skin and on clothes. It does not last for more than an hour. May be some spurious product entered the supply chain. I do not believe that any reputed seller, let alone Amazon, would intentionally sell such a product.</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne for my bf for easter strictly from buyer reviews. I had never smelled it before and I must say I absolutely love it! And so does my bf. Lol. It arrived on time and is a great price for an awesome scent! LOVE!</li>
            <li> Needed some new cologne and took a chance on ordering this from Amazon since it was highly rated and reasonably priced.  Big mistake.  The best way to describe the smell is \\&quot;cheap cologne\\&quot;.  It has an overpoweringly artificial, one-note smell that&#x27;s sure to gag anyone else in the elevator with you.  Steer clear of this one.</li>
            <li> Smells great, lasts for quite a while, and this is with just 2 sprays. Not really a cologne person, but this is good to start with in my opinion.</li>
            <li> After receiving this cologne I automatically thought it would just be \\&quot;eh\\&quot; seeing that it&#x27;s only around $20 dollars, gladly, I was surprised. This cologne is strong, it lasts all day and smells great after only 1 spritz of it. Just to make sure if it really lasted I checked how a shirt smelled a day after I wore it (and that&#x27;s after I went to a very strong smelling Indian restaurant) and can honestly say it still smells like voyage. So as someone who rarely buys any cologne, I can say this one is definitely worth it for this cheap, and its genuine!</li>
            <li> Very nice! It last for a long period of time... this scent is good for anyone that wants to leave a trail</li>
            <li> Nasty lemony air freshener kind of smell. Though it last through out the day but please do not smell like this, your anti-perspirant and deodorant should smell classier and better. The bottle is very heavy and designed well but the cologne inside is very unpleasant and strong. This product should be of acquired preference.</li>
            <li> Perfect for daily use at a very good price. Doesn&#x27;t leave any stains on white shirts etc. And random people like cashiers etc. keep telling me how nice it smells!</li>
            <li> My search for cologne has been finalized this is the best one I&#x27;ve gotten by far! Lasts for 2 hours then kinda fades but it&#x27;s still there for the whole day!! Besides not too overpowering; excellent!</li>
            <li> I have not found another cologne I like better than this one. I have tried a lot and this one gets the most compliments and I personally think it&#x27;s smells the best.</li>
            <li> Smells very good without being too powerful or overly &amp;#34;alcoholic&amp;#34; in fragrance. Lasts the whole day. The scent is neutral enough that it doesn&#x27;t clash with my deoderant or beard oil, but still prominent enough to dominate their scents.</li>
            <li> Love this colon and great price.</li>
            <li> is good I like  I will buy again thanks</li>
            <li> Great smell and pretty cheap as far the colognes go</li>
            <li> excellent attention thanks</li>
            <li> not exactly as I&#x27;d anticipated but not too far from it either. Recommended for those who are not too much for the strong macho scent</li>
            <li> Encouraged by all the reviews about this product, I bought it from Amazon. The smell was horrible. My Axe is better and cheaper than this</li>
            <li> Got compliments from people not really associated with these kind of responses.  For me it was a Plus Plus Scent Award!</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragrance!  I will purchase this cologne again.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit stronger than I would prefer and not really to my liking. So far, beyond a few random uses, this sits unused as I do not want to smell so strongly.</li>
            <li> Very nice and suttle oceanic scent, makes you want to go and sail a boat or maybe just row a boat. row row row a boat....</li>
            <li> This scent is one of my favorites; it&#x27;s clean and inviting, but not overbearing. That&#x27;s why I got it for my dad for Christmas and he liked the scent a lot. Perfect gift for that special guy or a loved one.</li>
            <li> I picked this up being it was rated well, I also picked up the well rated Nautica Blue at the same time to compare and all I can say is WOW, stay away from Blue and stick with Voyage, world of difference!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells great, but is not in your face and lasts all day easily.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good packaging n smell  good too...it&#x27;s  good price</li>
            <li> Smells good I dont know how to better describe it</li>
            <li> I will tell you that this is the best summer cologne out there that doesn&#x27;t put a hole in your pocket. Its so fresh, clean, and smooth. This is my 2nd bottle I have purchased and will always have this in my collection</li>
            <li> good. came way before i expected.</li>
            <li> Turn away and don&#x27;t buy this blue tinted water. 7 mins after I put it on, no hint that I ever put it on. BOTTOM LINE IS : IF IT LOOKS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE, IT PROBABLY IS!!!  #GETWHATYOUPAYFOR</li>
            <li> Remembering that everybody is different, this product starts smelling great after I spray it on my clothes and leave it for a couple of hours.  Also, when I spray it on my body it takes a few hours to start smelling good.  I like it, but I had better to be honest.  But, it is truly ok for me.  I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Same great scent.  First time purchased from amazon.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells good great price can&#x27;t beat it</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and he was happy with it. I love it with the price that I paid.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like true love.</li>
            <li> Smooth,fresh, Nice for everyday</li>
            <li> recvd in good condition as advertised</li>
            <li> Smells great and my girl friend told me to get it so there you have it, yes dear.</li>
            <li> item as described - no complaints</li>
            <li> Very clean smell. I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> First bottle of this was amazing. Second one seemed weaker and I moved on to Thallium. See my review of that.</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t last long at all. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was behind the head set. I thought they would have arrived together because I ordered them together but he did not have any complaints about it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is the original or not, but smells exactly the same and a fourth of the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent, exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the fragrance on a daily basis. Gives me the confidence that comes from knowing that you are smelling good all day through that comes with a few sprays of Nautica Voyage in the morning or evening.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is still there after an all day out.</li>
            <li> This is a well design perfume for the middle class. As the middle class keep the economic momentum with that zeal, which is quality and progressive economic goals, nautica voyage plays it part by alienating the young self confident with the old and more experienced.</li>
            <li> It is an awesome fresh smell. My boys and husband loved it.</li>
            <li> This is my most complimented cologne by far. That&#x27;s right, more so than the Ives Saint Laurent&#x27;s, the Gucci&#x27;s, the Bvlgari&#x27;s and even the Creeds! Its longevity leaves something to be desired (I&#x27;d say it lasts 4 hours) but I haven&#x27;t had a problem with projection. I&#x27;ve owned this cologne before and this is the Nautica Voyage I remember. Buy this one and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Excellent, I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Really Nice cool scent. Great product</li>
            <li> This Cologne has changed it&#x27;s formula! It used to be made and distributed by Lancaster group! Now it is made by Colty. The one made by lancaster is much nicer, smoother, and long lasting. If any one can help me find the older version made by Lancaster please email me at wallstreetcpa14@aol.com</li>
            <li> This is a horrible fragrance that is way too sweet and cloying.</li>
            <li> Great scent. Long lasting. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> If you love Eternity, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> love it.....smell deliciuos!! :-)</li>
            <li> I was never much of a cologne wearer, perhaps some Old Spice back in college decades ago, but I wanted to see what was available.  After sampling opinions from some women friends, I decided to order Nautica Voyage from Amazon.  To be honest, I had never heard of the product until just recently and when my wife and I visited the local mall to get a sniff test, there were no salespeople at the mens cologne section for me to test before ordering.  As a result, I purchased this product on a hope that it would not be bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell you that I am so very pleased with this product.  It smells great, the ladies at work all enjoy it, and the smell last all day.  With a limited experience in wearing men&#x27;s cologne, I was not really sure how or where to apply this stuff with the little spray bottle, but have learned that one puff spray on my chest, under my shirt, works great and is not overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot go wrong with this product.  It is a romantic scent while still smelling manly if you will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will purchase again but with the size of the bottle and how little I need to smell great, it will be some time before I need to order again.</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne and the best price I have found. This is the real deal (sticker on bottom) and the scent lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful and clean aquatic scent.  Great sillage and longevity.  If you are looking for a great aquatic scent with a hint of citrus it&#x27;s hard to go wrong with this one.  Nothing groundbreaking, but a very well done summertime scent.</li>
            <li> I went and demo&#x27;d this cologne in a department store before I bought it here. I&#x27;d say it is a pretty average cologne, with a nice scent and a good durability. What really got me about it was the amazing price! Nautica Voyage in a department store goes for around $50 for the 3.7 oz bottle, but is only $19 online! Anyone who wants a good smelling cologne that is not too strong and also affordable should definitely check this one out.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s hard to complain about this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the scent is not strong and after about two hours or so the smell is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably just have to spend more money and get something that lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I can see the appeal for this if you are just going out for a few hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for work, and I need it to last at least 6 hours or so.</li>
            <li> Pro: last a long while and was on sale&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: kinda smelled a bit like axe without the strong fragrance</li>
            <li> Add a little and lasts all day. I add this in the morning before going to work and when I get home I still smell good.</li>
            <li> I wanted to purchase cologne for my husband, so I went to Macy&#x27;s and eventually picked this out. I found it on here for a fraction of the price, so I returned it and bought it here. Smells great and lasts forever!</li>
            <li> My husband loves his cologne and i love the smel!</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews without even smelling it. I read in another review that this was light enough to be worn at a multitude of occasions, Which is nice because what you wear on a Saturday night isn&#x27;t always right for work as well and some dudes struggle with that. But this can do it all! I get a lot of compliments. What a great dude buy. And who can beat the price? I have paid hundreds on an 8oz bottle and seems like I&#x27;m the only one who enjoys it, this is the best $18 I&#x27;ve ever spent. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Light, and smells oh so good!</li>
            <li> My husband really loved this fragrance and I love to smell it on him! Very SEXY!!! We would buy it again because it&#x27;s a head turner!!!</li>
            <li> The bottle leaks when not upright</li>
            <li> Great smell, and great price for its sizes</li>
            <li> For the price i didn&#x27;t expect this cologne to be so strong, two sprays and it lasts for the entire day. Its a great cologne for everyday use and has an out of the ordinary fragrance.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Used 75% the bottle and now I can&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great price!</li>
            <li> I always loved nautica voyage. Bought it for my dad. Authentic Nautica product.</li>
            <li> Love the scent and by far one of my new favorites but it sure doesn&#x27;t long as everyone promotes in here. I paid almost nothing for it so I wont complain to much about it. Am planing to buy it for my pops and bro. You just can&#x27;t beat the price... the smell might last as long as it supposed to but hey just drown your self with sprays it should last as long as you need it to. lol</li>
            <li> I had a good experience why 100% recommended</li>
            <li> I was very dissapointed with this item its smelled good for about 5 second then the good smell vanished and a funky smell was next.</li>
            <li> The smell is not that much strong.</li>
            <li> At first, I thought the smell would be very unique but it turns out to be good but not unique at all.  This fragnence smell was very common among men but I guess with the price like that my expectation should not be very high.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gonna buy it again</li>
            <li> smile sweet and it last 4 long.... from a distances, everybody smiles it</li>
            <li> I thought at the price it was worth the risk right? So what if I get a knock off at least I took a shot at it. So it was a little worry some when the tracking number was not working on the DHL web site. That was explained by the fact that it arrived in my mailbox. DHL does not track standard mail items, only packages sent UPS style. (at far as I know)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in my mailbox, product unopened still sealed in plastic wrap! Fantastic, this stuff costs me usually about $70 bucks. I am ordering one more possibly two simply due to the price and the successful delivery of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Job guys!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ctompkins</li>
            <li> Smells horrific.. Stay away from this thing.. Does not have any undertones just awful does not smell like water or anything like that..</li>
            <li> Its light and fresh, its lasts long but not too long. 3.4 oz bottle should last me for a while since this eau de toilette spray is strong enough where it doesn&#x27;t not need to be heavily used. It has a fresh summery scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 26 yrs old and I believe this feels like a $50 cologne. It is amazing, and the chicks dig this!</li>
            <li> Ive bought several types of name brand colognes through amazon that turned out to be watered down fakes in the name brand bottles, but this one was completely legitimate.  Its a really nice aquatic summery fragrance with hints of cucumber, melon, and seaweed to start, then the scent changes to a more fresh smelling musk after a couple hours.  The scent sticks on you all day, which is more than i can say about some of the disappointing fakes ive bought off amazon in the past... Trust me, you cant go wrong with this one.  People will make excuses to stand near you just so they can smell it, very nice smell.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for the price of $14. The fragrance lasts and has a great smell.  I would recommend this for every perfume buyer.</li>
            <li> I got very fast delivery. The bottle size is 3.4 Oz which I believe last for more than a year. Smell is sweet and mild. Single spray under both arms on shits works for days. I need not to spray on same dress again. Smell last until next wash. I love this product, Price was about half comparing to store.I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I buy this every year for my boyfriend because it smells so good and the fragrance really lasts. Definitely really love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who wants to smell amazing! This is one of the best buys I&#x27;ve made yet! Will buy more when I run out. It&#x27;s such an amazing scent! Sprayed it on my wrist once when I got it and Ive been smelling it all day. Its overpowering the cologne I have on now by a lot! VOYAGE IS THE WAY TO GO.</li>
            <li> Its my favorite and Amazon has the best price. It&#x27;s probably the 3rd or 4th time I&#x27;ve ordered it from here over the years. I purchased the same for my son so he would stop stealing mine.</li>
            <li> I have a very extensive collection of Colognes, and I get a lot of compliments when I wear this one. The ladies love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cologne because of the review and the affordable price. It&#x27;s apart of my collection and I could see myself replacing it once I run out.</li>
            <li> You need to apply this perfume in large quantities for it to stay on. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good scent, true to the franchise, if you are a Nautica enthusiast, i recommend it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good for it&#x27;s price .. iv&#x27;e got compliments for this perfume .: i order this and the lacoste too .. but i was surprised that this will long last than the lacoste that i bought here in amazon ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been my favorite for years and I love avoiding department store prices.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son and he loves it, and it really smells nice on him</li>
            <li> Smells great what else can I say?</li>
            <li> This is a good purchase, I have not had any issues with the scent being diluted or short-lived. It is of the same quality as the cologne I purchased from a department store, only much cheaper!</li>
            <li> if completely fulfilled my expectations, and I go back to place another order for future purchases with these excellent merchandise</li>
            <li> This cologne I gave to a present for my father for Christmas. He loves it and so do I because he lets me use it sometimes. The smell is amazing, unlike most colognes that are over powering, this is just the right hint and lasts long! Most colognes will where off in a few hours but this one stays for the entire day, and it smells awesome. It&#x27;s awesome, and I am usually all over the Giorgio Armani, this is definitely a good tie with Acqua di Gio. They do not smell the same, but they both smell amazing.</li>
            <li> All of my nieces husbands always want cologne for Christmas.This is the second year to buy all of those on line.The savings are incredible.</li>
            <li> It stinks real good!  :-)  Hey, cologne.  How bad can it be? word word word word word word word word word</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance without knowing exactly how well I would like it and am very pleased. I have received numerous positive comments about what I am wearing.  Great value too!</li>
            <li> This is actually the second bottle I got and I love it. Maybe the first was a bad batch but the second bottle was great. I would recommend. This cologne is in my top 5 and I get complements on it daily.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, de alta calidad, original, entregado a tiempo, lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos los lectores y espero que mi opini&amp;oacute;n les sea &amp;uacute;til.</li>
            <li> very good quality. Thank you</li>
            <li> nice fresh scent. my son loves it also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good to mix it up with but I wouldn&#x27;t wear it on a high level date.</li>
            <li> weak fragrance that does not last long. I do not have anything else to say.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne!  I&#x27;ve bought it for my fiance multiple times.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cologne for the last 5 years. I love it because it&#x27;s not too strong like other brands and the smell is simple.</li>
            <li> Long lasting, very fresh, clean, citrus.</li>
            <li> Rotational alternate cologne with girlfriend approval.  Lasts about 8 hours on me and has the Girlfriend Approval rating.  Not much more to say there.</li>
            <li> Great cologne, I really like the smell and excellent price! You can use it everyday!</li>
            <li> Great Price! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This is a solid cologne at this price point. It&#x27;s nothing amazing, but it smells clean, fresh, and ocean-y. I didn&#x27;t see many people mention this, but there is a cucumber-like scent in this cologne.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne.... Its a very good value for the money..... It has a very classy smell and i would definately buy it again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I have gotten used to its fragrance or not, but it does not last more than a few hours. Maybe its just because of the cold weather. Will try it in summer and edit the review if needed.</li>
            <li> My husband has always had expensive cologne that to me smelled horrible..we had smelled this in the store together and loved the smell.Got it much cheaper on Amazon and it&#x27;s the real deal...he smells wonderful now!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell. Not overpowering and all my lady friends love it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon Support for this Nautica delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this spray and it helps when I don&#x27;t have access to a shower but once a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Amazon Support.</li>
            <li> This scent is light and fresh.  Very nice scent.  This scent is definitely a winner at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I found this bottle while taking a chance. My friend gets most everything from amazon,so I gave it a shot. This bottle was twice the size,and more than half the price than a bottle I received from a retail store. Thanks amazon!!</li>
            <li> I like this product very much and I got it on time as advertised. I would recommend it.Price is very reasonable too.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite. I got this for my boyfriend and i love the way it smells on him when he runs out will be ordering another bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s illegal in nine countries. Yep. It&#x27;s made with bits of real panther, so you know it&#x27;s good.  They&#x27;ve done studies, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time.</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing... i kinda didn&#x27;t like nautical until i smelled this particular version...goes great for the summer.. cant wait</li>
            <li> I expected it to be more powerful but i feel like its been diluted somehow an thats doesnt realy make it authentic at all. please fix it for others</li>
            <li> I just got a fake one, to good to be true!! Not sure if I will venture again to buy a perfume online.</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume. I love it</li>
            <li> Smells great, large bottle. Great product</li>
            <li> very happy with service fast and easy</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell from the past.</li>
            <li> I love the scent. Would definitely buy again. Very versatile and long-lasting.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. It really is a great smelling cologne.</li>
            <li> To sum up everyone elses comments: great lasting scent for a low price. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Love it smells great always receive compliments on how I smell</li>
            <li> Good price, arrived in a sealed box, smells great.</li>
            <li> I just wonder how many people did all these 5 star reviews deceive. Com&#x27;on I purchased this product after seeing all these crazy 5 star reviews and when I try the product, it didn&#x27;t live up to my expectation. It literally lasts for about  5 minutes...BOD Man is a better and way cheaper fragrance than this or Tommy Hilfiger for $25.</li>
            <li> Delivered it on time to my friend in US, yesterday I got if and the smell is very unique out of this world, it does not stay that long but its too awesome...</li>
            <li> A product that does not appear to be original because the fragrance does not smell and always use that perfume</li>
            <li> Love the smell need more lol</li>
            <li> first i got mine from deals breaker 100% legit so no problem there. i have like thirty bottles of designer colognes like Polo. Tommy you guys get it a big fan of colognes always looking. this cologne stayed on my clothes for days. it is strong but not a strong scent. has lasting power. a nice low key fresh smell my new favorite. puts my others on the bench. i spent 18 dollars on this but it wears like a very expensive one. out of them all this is the clear winner. almost thirty and i choose this go figure.</li>
            <li> smells pretty good only being beat by polo black for me</li>
            <li> Exactly the original smell and quality, thank you!!! Will order again.</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;m planning to buy more !!</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick, received in 4 days even on Super Saver shipping! Definitely one of my favorite colognes, smells alot like \\&quot;Adidas Moves for Men\\&quot; but slightly less distinct. $20 for 3.4oz can&#x27;t really beat that anywhere for most colognes like this one. Lasts hours with two or three sprays. Will definitely buy again when I run out... highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The best cologne out there!</li>
            <li> Fragrant, very inexpensive, nicely designed bottle.  Love this cologne!  A little goes a long way.  This is definitely one of my favorites now!  Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> Amazing product and excellent scent! For the price you will find nothing like this</li>
            <li> This is the terrible, I got a fake one. The scent is not the same as what I was expecting and it only lasts for about five minutes. I will never buy from here again.</li>
            <li> This cologne is very inexpensive making a good choice for any one that enjoys a refreshing smell that is not to overbearing as some of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> If you dislike or you are allergic to strong smelling cologne, then this is the one for you. From a Price point, Packaging and presentation and bottle design; it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
            <li> I like the scent and shipping and everything else was great!  Will buy again when this one has run dry.</li>
            <li> The cologne doesn&#x27;t have a serial number sticker on the bottom and the scent wears off in like 15 minutes. Definitely far from the real deal.</li>
            <li> I like a lot this perfume, the smell is so fresh and everyone smell like it, i have allergies and it didn&#x27;t annoying to my nose, perfect choice.</li>
            <li> I bought this blind after reading most the reviews and seeing that the price was only 20 bucks, why not. I am glad I spent the 20 bucks for this, it has an amazingly fresh aquatic scent that lasts hours and gets compliments like ive never seen, I have burberry touch, FCUD for him, Obsession, Lacoste essential, and kenneth cole black, this smells right up there with them! great cologne for a college kid who doesnt want to break his bank, but wants to get the girls.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered very satisfied!!! great deal for the size of the bottle will be buying more of this!</li>
            <li> I loved this product and was very pleased with It and will other things when I need something else .I love the frangrance.&lt;br /&gt;  sam in jacksonvillle</li>
            <li> I gave a spray before work on a Friday, worked 3 hours went to bed. 24 hours later, put on the same uniform and head to work without putting on another spray and one of my cute co-workers says &amp;#34;you smell very manly, I like it.&amp;#34; 1 Spray lasted 24 hours, and that compliment I received was in the kitchen. #winning</li>
            <li> Purchasing cologne online can be a scary experience, as there isn&#x27;t a sniff test that can be performed. I decided to go out on a limb over a year ago and purchase this cologne, along with a couple others, based solely on their reviews.  The Nautica Voyage is a winner for sure! I am now on my third bottle, and get compliments quite frequently on this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a light, clean scented cologne, which is strong, but certainly far from overpowering.  It wears very well, and is hard to make it overpowering in any amount short of simply dumping the bottle on you.  I am a fan of having cologne be discovered, not announced, and this fits that role perfectly.  A few squirts are enough for the day, wearing all day on clothes, and probably 6-8 hours on skin.  It has a clean smell, with strong notes of green apple, and reminds me of something similar to clean laundry on a warm spring day. It has a range of probably 5-10 feet when fresh (less than two hours old), and can be smelled from just over an arm&#x27;s length away for most of the day.  It is a hit with many women.  I am a young male, (18-21), and I received comments on how I smell and get asked what I wear at least once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s served me well for over a year, and cannot be beat at the price. I am on my third bottle, and have two more stocked up! A bottle lasts me 4-6 month of daily wear, with two applications (morning, and again before going out at night).</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas and he hasn&#x27;t really used it yet, but it came in great condition and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> The first week I wore this scent, I had at least three women who told me I smelled fantastic which is sort of the point is it not? Anyways, this smells great and others will be impressed!</li>
            <li> Very happy smell I guess lol Smells like a relaxing vacation. When I put this one I always get nice complaints regarding my smell, and from girls&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; So i Guess this did its job.</li>
            <li> I have been using davidoff coolwater and curve since a very long time. These are the kinds which literally get you compliments every time you wear them. I was kinda getting tired of them myself since I have been using them for more than 2 years ( switching between them ). I wanted something different which would be long lasting also and I love smelling clean,fresh and good. So I decided to give &#x27;Nautica voyage&#x27; a try and was super-impressed. It has got a clean fresh smell which when sits on the skin for sometime gives wonderful after notes. I rate a perfume by my personal test. If you wear it in the morning ( specific pressure points on your body will give you the maximum effect ) and you can smell the light notes of it next morning on the clothes you wore yesterday, thats the mark of an awesome perfume. Nautica voyage passed that personal test and i&#x27;m happy that I found another compliment catcher and at least a temporary distraction from coolwater and curve which are still my personal favorites and always be. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Really good smell, I&#x27;ve had a customers ask what I was wearing. I&#x27;m a plumber so I go to a lot of houses a day and love this fragrance</li>
            <li> Every body in my house like smell of this spray. On cloth it smell for 2 days. Its very my everyday spray.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most complimented fragrance and no matter what other fragrance I try,.I always come back to this baby. That&#x27;s why I was heart broken to find that this was not the voyage that I know and love. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same and doesn&#x27;t last more than an hour. Very disappointed of this cheap knock off.</li>
            <li> I was in desperate need (want) of an everyday Cologne in order to prevent my new-found love \\&quot;Acqua Di Gio\\&quot; by GA from losing its sex appeal. So, I did my research and stumbled upon Nautica Voyager right here on Amazon. I read most of the reviews and decided to go for it and I have no regrets to date. I used prime and I got it in 1.5 days after ordering. My girlfriend prefers its smell over the Acqua (she&#x27;s wack I know) but I really think it&#x27;s smell good also. Cologne is really subjective but I think for the price, it&#x27;s worth it. It also stays on your clothes, though a bit mild, for about 18-24 hours making it a perfect choice for an everyday cologne.</li>
            <li> I have used the NAUTICA VOYAGE For Men By NAUTICA Eau de Toilette Spray. I bought it against because I finished the other bottle. Thanks!</li>
            <li> love this cologne and for the price ever better I usally use it for work to go out I use Million by Paco Raban</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and just love the way it smells so much!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband. He absolutely loves the scent and said he wont wear anything else now!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of those hidden gems of Amazon. 3.4 oz of this cologne for $20 is an absolute steal. It smells great, and I regularly get compliments from people telling me I smell nice.</li>
            <li> Cheap price, great value. The first time i have the Nautica pefumer. I am happy with this one. I will buy more.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the reviews. Although, the price is really competetive but it is not worth wearing this perfume. The aroma of the spray doesn&#x27;t even last a few hours. Moreover, you would ahve to spray at least 10 times to feel the perfume aroma. Not sure if this was genuine or not but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Therefore I love it. Really didn&#x27;t wear any cologne or fragrance before I bought this and after sampling a few at a local big box store I came here for the savings. Great product, fresh scent that is intriguing but not over powering.</li>
            <li> stuff smells great for the price.  Longevity and projection arent the best but for the price it cant be beat.....i get a good 4-5 hours out of it.  When im out i will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift to my husband for his Christmas gift and oh my, i could just eat him up wearing this cologne.</li>
            <li> Great scent I get a lot of attention and compliments wearing it</li>
            <li> I like writing reviews that give great detail that others find useful.&lt;br /&gt;With this purchase..POINT PLAN AND SIMPLE...UNBELIEVABLE!&lt;br /&gt;SCENT for PRICE is a SUPER BANG FOR YA BUCK!!!</li>
            <li> This is a quality fragrance that smells fresh and light.  It takes two sprays for it to last four to six hours since the sprays are relatively a low dose.</li>
            <li> I saw a review on youtube with fragrance,fanatic1, and voyage was in his top 10 best smelling list, and I was like how because this guy only reviews the best in men cologne, and for the price I did not believe it could be that good as he says,, well I tried it.. really to put in my every day collection, and trust me when I got it I had to put it in my premium collection in steed.. yeah its that good ..</li>
            <li> after 1 hour no smell</li>
            <li> I ordered this from fragrancenet because the one with super saver shipping wouldn&#x27;t ship to my address and I was not disappointed. This is 100% real, smells amazing, and I sprayed a very tiny bit on my arm just to test it out 5 hours ago.. the smell is still there and almost as strong as it was when I first applied it. Will definitely be ordering again!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I ordered this from amazon because of all the reviews warning buyers about fakes. But luckily I did not get a fake. I have been using it for the last 4-5 months, and really like the smell. The fragrance is present even after 8-9 hours, and does not fade away. My wife loves it when I wear this perfume, and she tells me that she enjoys smelling this fragrance on me. And at work I have got compliments from women too. I will buy this perfume again.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried this - I didn&#x27;t like it. The smell seemed barely there and I had bought it without having ever smelled it.&lt;br /&gt;However, in the coming few days - I started liking it for its subtleness and fresh clean smell - and then it quickly became my favorite smell of summer of 2012. In fact everytime I think of new york in summer of 2012 - I think of this smell. It is that good - not overpowering, but fresh and clean - subtle.</li>
            <li> This scent is heavy. A little musky but that is okay, I want to stand out and not be like a pot of flowers.</li>
            <li> Great Product, just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Seems to be the real deal. Great price and happy.</li>
            <li> Smell great for the price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like buying cologne without know what it smells like, but after reading a bunch of good reviews I tried it and I must say I&#x27;m very satisfied and my wife likes it on me too. plan on getting more cologne by Nautica</li>
            <li> This is one the cheapest and best fragrances I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s best during summer because it has a citrusy smell to it. I love this product!</li>
            <li> nice clean fragrance, no cloying scent...</li>
            <li> Package is good for Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Great and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Omg the cologne smelled so good</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy with this product. The scent is very nice and long lasting. And my girlfriend says it smells great too! :)</li>
            <li> Kinda like addidas moves with a lil bit longer lasting scent that actually smells better with time.  Definately the real deal not a fake.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, best of the cheap colognes. A little on the strong side but still smells good and long lasting.</li>
            <li> A little dab will do you on this.  Too much and it is an overpowering scent.  A little and it&#x27;s crisp and nice.</li>
            <li> Not very lasting but smells great</li>
            <li> Not a genuine product! Fragrance goes away right away! Smells more like alcohol than anything else</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Cologne smells great.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Omg read my review plz it smells like the cheap colngue I buy from target literally smells like a2 dollar Mexican who mow my lawns :( worst buy</li>
            <li> Awesome smells. I don&#x27;t have a trained nose, so I can&#x27;t tell you what aromas you get from here. They are somewhat sweet and floral. Not oak-y or woody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get compliments on this fragrance. It&#x27;s not offensive, unless you really overdo it. It has an amazing fastener (since it&#x27;s a true EDT) and you will smell like this (albeit with less potency) throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fragrance like this should go easily for more in in the mid $40&#x27;s range.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for  Xmas it smell so good 👌👌👌😘 he loved it . Have to buy more !!!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for a friend of mine and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it as a gift. It isn&#x27;t a very fragrant cologne.</li>
            <li> good stuff nice price</li>
            <li> Great Price for a nice men&#x27;s spray.</li>
            <li> Middle-aged boyfriend wears this regularly. Very refreshing scent. Aqua Di Gio by Armani is his favorite, but that&#x27;s too pricey for everyday wear.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Nice vender.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell. Good for price.</li>
            <li> The other day my daughter got in the car and I asked her what the beautiful fragrance was she was wearing. I am always looking for a new scent. She laughed and mentioned the cologne she got for her s/o on Christmas...Nautica. He smelled wonderful too! I couldn&#x27;t believe she was wearing a mans scent and it smelled so nice on her. Why I was caught up in gender specifics, I don&#x27;t know. Never thought about trying mens fragrances. It didn&#x27;t smell pretty on her S/O, not feminine at all...just a nice fragrance. It smelled great on her too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice and clean scent. Not too heavy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice smelling cologne.  It has a soft subtle smell to it.  I would recommend this product if you are looking for a good smelling and inexpensive cologne.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fragments arrived as promised</li>
            <li> em arrived in perfect condition, is what is described in the purchase, thanks</li>
            <li> it has the most pleasant smell I&#x27;ve ever smelled! it shows me what paradise is like! literally!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and smells amazing :)</li>
            <li> Great smell for the summer.  Lasts all day.  Great value as well!</li>
            <li> I chose this fragrance only because it was the highest rated on amazon. It does smell nice but it isnt strong enough. The moment I leave my room the scent is gone and my girlfriend only notices it when hugging or cuddling. I find myself respraying throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The product description is accurate, good quality and image. Fulfilled with my expectations. You can trust and purchase it without any inconvenience.</li>
            <li> My uncle loves it!! Perfect gift for a guy.</li>
            <li> My son and his girlfriend love it!</li>
            <li> Nice perfume and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The smell is not my favorite but it is great for the price</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite. Absolutely masculine and sexy.</li>
            <li> Only thing is that the smell of it fades away quickly</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend as a gift. Smells great!</li>
            <li> It wont stay for long. I have some people saying the smell stays for whole day. I have been using it from a couple of days. I m not satisfied with the product. The prices is reasonable to expect from this product.</li>
            <li> great price for a great perfume</li>
            <li> Update: Watch out for knock-offs. I&#x27;ve ordered this 5 or 6 times, and half of the time I&#x27;ve received generic, unpleasant look-alikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review: Very good scent. I was using Crave by Calvin Klein, but, since they no longer make it, it is very expensive. I prefer lighter colognes that aren&#x27;t musky. This cologne smells fresh, somewhat reminiscent of the ocean, but with a tiny hint of sweetness that&#x27;s just enough for a guy to still be able to wear it. Very good. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who was looking for something that smelled good, but wasn&#x27;t over powering and he loves it! He tells me everyday how many complements he gets about how he smells, but cause it&#x27;s just right, not too strong and not too weak. Overall I would totally recommend this product to anyone. I know I will definitely be buying it again.</li>
            <li> Long lasting and great smelling, that&#x27;s all you can ask for. I would definitely recommend this cologne to others interested.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overpowering and somewhat sublime.  It doesn&#x27;t break the bank either.  I&#x27;m just knocking off a star because I like it but I don&#x27;t absolutely love it.  Still, an excellent cologne to use every day.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and service</li>
            <li> I had gotten this spray for a gift one year and I liked the smell a whole lot.  It was a sad day when the bottle ran out because I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in any stores around me.  Luckily I found this on here.  Great Product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a summery scent, aquatic, not too  overpowering, and balanced, in good packaging. Speaking of packaging I generally prefer and recommend finding an online store you trust, and getting your colognes, EDT, and perfumes from there. The cologne&#x27;s been in a warehouse, barely handled, and never seeing the light-of-day, which for products like these, is a good thing, I think.</li>
            <li> At first I was skeptical to buy a cologne that I had never actually smelled in person. However, the reviews were good, the product had a good price, and I had a gift card :-). The item arrived in a few days and I was very satisfied with the purchase. The smell is very good and stays on for hours without it being to overpowering. It is a good casual scent that anyone can pull off.</li>
            <li> It is nice light scent, stays on my body for atleast 1 day , on clothes it will stay 2-4 hours if you spray 3-4 pumps.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and got for a great price. I like several of the nautica colognes and this one as well. Smells really good, already had compliments on it.</li>
            <li> With so many high reviews that this product got, I completely ignored the handful of them that warned of theories that it may be a tampered with product.  I mean, how can something with 100+ reviews that mostly ships directly from Amazon be a knockoff.  Well, a week in to owning this, and I&#x27;m 90% sure this is not a legit bottle of Nautica Voyage cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day or two was amazing. The cologne smells extremely fresh and aquatic and lasted all the way through the day without issue.  I was actually able to smell it clearly on my shirt at the end of the day.  That all changed by the 3rd use.  The smell was still good, but seemed not as potent and dissipated drastically about 15 minutes after application, at least compared to how it was the first few times.  This morning came as shock.  Out of curiosity, I sprayed it on at took a deep whiff.  The smell was pure alcohol, a sort of vodka smell, and then only a slight hint of the actual cologne.  It&#x27;s now a few hours later, and I do smell the cologne on my shirt, but it&#x27;s a fraction of what it should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Essentially, I think I got what I paid for: a $15 bottle of cologne.  It truly does seem that the spray and tube did indeed have the actual cologne in it when I first got it, but the liquid in the bottle has been watered down with some alcohol.  I&#x27;ll continue to use this for work, because in it&#x27;s preset form, it&#x27;s extremely subtle and not intrusive.  However, I can&#x27;t wear it for special occasions or nights out.  It&#x27;s nothing more to me than a decent knockoff.  It unfortunately is worth it&#x27;s discounted price and not a penny more.  Do yourself a favor, pony up a few more bucks and buy your cologne from a reliable brick and mortar store, lest you run the risk of getting a tampered with bottle like me.</li>
            <li> Was looking to add something new to my cologne collection and came across &amp;#34;Nautica Voyage&amp;#34; on sale at &amp;#34;Amazon&amp;#34;.  In a nutshell &amp;#34;Nautica Voyage&amp;#34; is a decent scent for going to work, church, or on a  cheap date.  Smells okay but won&#x27;t turn any heads......no &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, smells great, lasts a while and you can&#x27;t complain about the price.  Bought two, one for me and one for my b-in-law.  I use it for casual weekends.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells great.  Its super long-lasting.  Fresh, light, smooth.  Not overpowering compare to the other cologne out there. Awesome buy.</li>
            <li> Frangrances are a matter of preference and I did not care much for this fragrance. It&#x27;s too strong and smells cheap (to me). I was looking for something citrusy and fresh but this just turned out to be overpowering. This fragrance is manufactured/marketed by COTY and the quality is on par with the generic fragrances (also made by COTY) you find in a grocery store. It&#x27;s cheap so I suppose you get what you pay for but I won&#x27;t be using this one at all.</li>
            <li> I liked and recommend.</li>
            <li> Everyone I know loves this cologne when I wear it. I am always getting compliments at work from customers and my coworkers.</li>
            <li> I bought this based off all the great reviews and great price. And they were right, it does smell absolutely amazing!! One of my husband and I&#x27;s favorite colognes. Sweet and sexy is how I would describe it haha. Very large bottle too! Last so long!</li>
            <li> First off, bought this directly from Amazon and it is the real thing. In my experience, if Amazon is the seller there is almost never an issue with perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the price, this is an absolutely fantastic deal for a 3.4oz (100ml) bottle of fragrance. The best description I can give of the smell is that it is fresh. However, It is not like some of the summer fragrances which have citrus notes in them (e.g. CK one summer). The closest it is to the perfumes I have used would be Echo by Davidoff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buying fragrances online is always a challenge so I&#x27;ll list some other perfumes I use and like so that you may get an idea of my taste. Generally I like fragrances that are fresh and/or citrusy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some I like - L&#x27;eau D&#x27;issey by Issey Miyake, Chrome by Azzaro, Acqua Di Gio by Giorgio Armani, Cool Water by Davidoff, CK One , CK One Summer, CK Eternity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like - Dunhill Red, CK obsession</li>
            <li> It is light and never overpowering... a go to for a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> Bought this without reading the reviews, sad to say the bottle is clearly a fake. It smelled off the moment I opened the seal on the box.&lt;br /&gt;Worse, it doesnt have the oval nautica sticker on bottom or serial number, or even a Batch number for that matter!</li>
            <li> smelled great...scent lasted awhile.</li>
            <li> Just what I have been looking for, not too strong and long lasting. Beside I don&#x27;t have allergy to it.</li>
            <li> Note that Amazon will not accept returns on colognes. If you are willing to take the chance, then go ahead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells good, but somewhat of a generic smell...definitely more of a fragrance kind of smell than a &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; smell. It&#x27;s not girly at all but at the same time doesn&#x27;t scream MAN either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off 1 star because of the generic smell. I was expecting something a little more unique.&lt;br /&gt;I took off another star because it does not linger that long. Sure, if I put my nose up to where I sprayed it then I can still smell it...but it&#x27;s essentially gone after about 2 hours to be honest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Eau De Toilette (or perfume as I will simply refer to it) lasts about as long as most deodorant sprays on the market nowadays. You will get about 2 hours of use out of it. After that time-frame, people will literally have to put their noise up to you in order to smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the cologne is quite strong when first sprayed on, you can&#x27;t really spray that much or it would be overwhelming. However, it fades after about 30 minutes and is just perfect for about another hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are aware of the fabric that you&#x27;re wearing and know for sure that it is safe to spray cologne directly on it, then I would strongly suggest you do that. The scent lasts about twice as long when sprayed on fabric than when sprayed directly on skin, as with most other colognes/deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I expected this to last longer since it costs about $20.00 at my time of purchase.</li>
            <li> smells great and the smell is also long lasting, girls will give you compliments ,and guys will be asking you what product you use</li>
            <li> For a long time this was my go to cologne. I wore this for more than a year straight every day. When I was running low, I knew I had to refill. The new one I just bought sprays better. It has a denser mistier spray and the range is wider. The scent can be described as a light ocean scent with no alcohol effects.</li>
            <li> I purchased this before, I&#x27;ve tried others. This is a very nice long lasting scent, and many take notice of this product. And to be very honest it&#x27;s priced much higher at places like Walgreen.&lt;br /&gt;And Prime rocks!</li>
            <li> Smell real good get plenty of compliments have it 4 stars cause scent didn&#x27;t last as long as I wanted. You can smell it but it&#x27;s not as strong when you first sprayed it.</li>
            <li> I have always enjoyed having elegant and manly perfume, but I usually dislike the big punch associated with most of them. This has definitely been satisfying and smooth, and I instantly got a compliment at how I smelled the first time I used this perfume when hanging out with a friend (girl).</li>
            <li> i believe this product deserve all the stars. i use it every day before work. i bought it only for that purpose. i have other cologne, a lot more expensive but this product deserve the place between them. the price is amazing and so is the smell. everybody has their one criteria in choosing beauty products. but i can tell you that for me this one works.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t do reviews, well this product sucked so much, I had to make an exception. I don&#x27;t even know what mine smells like. It definitely feels watered down and I think it last for about 5 minutes! Waste of my money and time.</li>
            <li> I received my order within a few days. I think it is a Great day time fragrance...not too &amp;#34;overpowering&amp;#34;. The price was exceptionally reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was hoping it to be a little more strong charactered. This is very light and non invasive perfume. You would like it if you love subtle fragrance smell.</li>
            <li> It seems it is diluted and not exactly 100% original. Still price was low to my surprise as it was about 50% off almost which is amazing. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great cologne for a man in his 20&#x27;s or 50&#x27;s like my husband!  Guaranteed to be a great gift. Great price!</li>
            <li> Smells ok but does not last</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent, lasts a long time. Best cologne in this price range. If you need a clean, fresh, breezey cologne to wear all day, this is the one for you. For less than $20, this is possibly the best cologne you can get at the price. Definitely worth picking up even if you won&#x27;t wear it that much, I mean come on it&#x27;s dirt cheap.</li>
            <li> great deal, smells great and a great quantity.</li>
            <li> Smells good and last for hours&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again</li>
            <li> I was looking for more woodsy. I like the manly smells. This, to me, smells more like an abercrimbie model.</li>
            <li> This is a  great item , keeps you smelling fresh all day . With a refreshing smell will not bother others around you only with a good smell</li>
            <li> This is another clean smells for my boyfriend and I also bought for my grandson.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much of a connoisseur of fragrances.  All I can say is that it smells nice, and lasts for several hours after it&#x27;s applied.  I find it to be a nice, non-offensive fragrance to wear at work.  The price was discounted, so I can&#x27;t say I would buy it at full price, though, and I&#x27;m sure to move on to other fragrances/brands until I find a &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; one.</li>
            <li> I liked it! scent lasts for 2 - 3 hours.</li>
            <li> excellent and nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i recommend to buy this product, because it is very nice and usefull. it arrived on time, and as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> Great Great value for the price tag!</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty good. Although NAUTICA is not focusing on perfume,  I do like this one. By the way, the color of the bottle is cool.</li>
            <li> Smells great and lasts pretty long I believe but the kind in the stores last a lot longer and nautica blue is better in my opinion</li>
            <li> i was skeptical on this product since some people claimed it was not original. but after getting the product and using it i have no issues. fragrance last for long</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t buy this stuff online as I haven&#x27;t smelled it but I took a chance - wow - great stuff - not too heavy - not too overpowering - nice, subtle. I&#x27;m glad I took a chance and purchased this.</li>
            <li> Sorry about my old review I spoke too soon on it! It smells great &amp; u only need 2 sprays please don&#x27;t spray it 4 or 5 or it will be LOUD! This is more like an everyday cologne but it still would catch women attention!</li>
            <li> I saw this in a local department store for over $70!  Though I love the Nautica men&#x27;s fragrances, I couldn&#x27;t believe the price they were asking.  This is the same product I tried in the store, and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Really good product for the money. Not as amazing as I reviews hyped it up to be, but It&#x27;s a good, strong, and clean scent. The shipping was a bit annoying, as it was missent and took about two more days than it would have, but got here within 7 days all the same.</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3.4 oz. size of Nautica Voyage for my husband, and it was perfect!  So much less expensive than department store pricing.  We also received it very quickly.  We are 100% satsified!</li>
            <li> My son loved the cologne. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Clean, fresh, smells like summer &amp; great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Nautica blue, island voyage, and voyage.&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly better than Nautica Blue. It&#x27;s very similar to island voyage. However, it certainly lasts a long time. It is a mellow fresh scent. It feels a lot more \\&quot;real\\&quot; than blue did. It&#x27;s not the manliest thing around but it is a worthwhile upgrade to Nautica blue. The big bottle choice is actually massive compared to the one you find at wally world and so it is certainly a good deal. If I had to guess the small choice is actually the large option at wally world. I like it. Out of the three, I think this may hit the sweet spot by a small margin over island voyage for scent. What is interesting was that Blue was my everyday scent, and I think I probably won&#x27;t go back to it.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle itself looks very well made and looks classy.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that a little goes a long way with this one so you have to be careful with the amount you use per spray if you want to use more than a spray or two as it is potent.</li>
            <li> Fake,cheap imposter, not the real deal,Not even close.... I am upset with Amazon for allowing this product to be sold under what I had viewed to be a reputable website to buy from until now. Poor excuse for what a very good cologne when you buy the real thing.I was reluctant to buy this since I normally pay $65.00 for this cologne. I guess I got what I paid for this time, if that means a nice bottle of clear liquid that very slightly smells like the real thing for about five minutes. Anyone that has had the real thing will smell the difference. The one star that I gave was only for the nice glass bottle that was able to fool me into buying it.</li>
            <li> Goes to the TRASH can, that&#x27;s where it&#x27;s belong to. Don&#x27;t even think it will benefit you in anyway. It is a rip-off so-called product. Shame on you Amazon, it cannot be returned!!!</li>
            <li> Im 26, and this is by far the best fragance from Nautica. Really fresh, young, cool and clean. If you into surf, skate, soccer or crossfit you&#x27;ll love this one.</li>
            <li> It comes in a very nice blue packing. You use it for the first time, it smell ok not great. You can still smell it for few minutes. But after sometime it disappears. I have used Nautica perfume before, it was great. But this time I am highly disappointed.</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t like it but he use it anyways smell is not that strong other man perfume but i liked it.. if some like not very strong perfume good for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cologne for a few years and really like it; it works well with my chemistry.  I get lots of compliments on this fragrance and people wanting to know what I&#x27;m wearing.  It lasts a long time on me (most of the day).</li>
            <li> my family enjoyed this gifts</li>
            <li> I think the scent is good, and it&#x27;s the real deal, a quality product, though the scent does not stick around on me for too long. Would like to get another couple hours out of it. It may last 4-5 hours, and kinda quit or be pretty weak. I suppose I could carry an atomizer to resupply, but that seems awkward.</li>
            <li> I think best buy for your dollar</li>
            <li> i love this product . the smell lasts for a long time and it makes me wanna jump on top of my husband . thank you nautica for making my midnight dreams come true.</li>
            <li> Reviews are what brought me to buy this. Well I can say they were right and I&#x27;m glad I bought it. This smells amazing with just one simple spray. Everytime I meet someone they tell me I smell nice. My lady friend always likes it and has sprayed her self lol. For the money it&#x27;s more than worth it. Would recommend, and I have; after the fact of my two friends asking where I got and the price. Not only that it really helps my dragon I ride to school everyday feel better about being under me. He enjoys the brisk smell on the way thru the air as we cut off the fellow dragons. Sometimes he actually claims to get more miles per gallon because his stress levels go down from the smell and help him cruise through the air better. Practically this cologne is likely to help you with your vehicles mileage of you own a dragon or giant bald eagle(depending on country). 10/10 would buy for my master again.</li>
            <li> Great product fast shipping thank you</li>
            <li> Bought this at a really solid discount through Amazon, and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  It smells really nice, and the scent lasts all day without being overbearing. Definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my son for Christmas.  Loved it. Nice clean scent</li>
            <li> Muy buena fragancia, la recomiendo, el aroma dura bastante tiempo, es un aroma fresco. ideal para cualquier ocasi&amp;oacute;n. Y el precio es muy bueno.</li>
            <li> The only cologne that my wife likes.  People are always making comments on how wonderful I smell so I guess this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my husband after reading the reviews. I must say that we are very pleased with this. It is wonderful. It is a cross between curve soul and black by Kenneth Cole.</li>
            <li> Not as advertized. I prefer much cheaper GAP perfume since it is much better and lasts much longer than this one. Looks like Nautica spent more on the outer glass than on the inner liquid spray.</li>
            <li> I like it it works pretty good for me</li>
            <li> Great deal. I got more compliments wearing this at work than some of my Creed fragrances, and they cost $200 or more. Has a fresh smell that leaves a pleasant scent trail.</li>
            <li> Great price, very good aroma, many compliments ..</li>
            <li> My SO and I love this scent, it&#x27;s lasted very long and it smells great. It says it&#x27;s for Men but honestly it works on females too. It smells of water in a way so it&#x27;s very relaxing and easy on the nose. Highly recommend it at this price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband.  it is his favorite cologne.  it smells so good and this was a great price for this size bottle.  love it</li>
            <li> I love the scent its got. It&#x27;s very subtle and nice to wear at day-time or night-time.&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with the time it lasts too.</li>
            <li> Been using this for quite some time now. It is clean and refreshing and a pleasure to wear. I can&#x27;t count the times I have been asked what cologne I&#x27;m wearing by women I run in to in public.  My wife loves it and I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Clean, crisp and fresh!</li>
            <li> I was not expecting what I received, the bottle it was bigger then I tough and smells amazing, definitely an everyday cologne !</li>
            <li> got many compliments for this, not so bold but neither dull, perfect mix</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne for a good price. It has a warm smell- not too sharp but still pronounced. I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Voyage and I get the most compliments for this in comparison to my other brand name and more expensive bottles. Makes for a good gift too. Shipping is really quick as well.</li>
            <li> Packaging was great.  I love the fragrance and it was a great price</li>
            <li> Clearly a winner, nothing can go wrong with this fragrance. Totally worth the money!</li>
            <li> Great cologne! Very clean and good smell. Highly suggest!The shipping was fast and it is way cheaper then anything you could buy in a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on this. Cant beat great smell of this for what it cost! About 3-5 sprays will be enough.</li>
            <li> Would not recommend as the fragrance only last for a very short time. It is cheap for a reason, i Guess.</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and stays on all day :). I love that is was cheaper than if I got it at a store! I recomend this to any person its great for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells great, price is great, but doesnt last a long time.</li>
            <li> love it and for less than $20 i get more compliments than with most $100 brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It looks genuine to me.&lt;br /&gt;summer colognes don&#x27;t last that long anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments.</li>
            <li> This was my favorite when it first came on the market almost 10 years ago, but haven&#x27;t used it in quite some time while cycling through other scents. Saw this while shopping for another item on Amazon and couldn&#x27;t pass it up for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very glad I did as it&#x27;s the same cool, crisp, fresh fragrance that can work anywhere, anytime.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and he did enjoy it. Scent is not over powering so it was perfect to use around the baby.</li>
            <li> but would love it  to stay longer...the smell is nice...girls like it...i like ht e bottle and packing and stuff but wud say you go bit higer price if you in office indoors and the scent lingers for at least 6 -8 hours</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a man and love the smell of this. My wife loves it too. People ask me all the time what cologne I have on. I will be buying more of this. Amazon has the best price around. 5 Stars</li>
            <li> I compare the smell of this product with Aqua from Bvlgary.&lt;br /&gt;However this Nautica was cheaper. Also, this Nautica smell last for hours</li>
            <li> Fake. I have taken this product before. I know how good the fragrance is.</li>
            <li> Smells good. Can used for daily and parties. The cap is loose and does not fit well with the Bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought Nautica Voyage without smelling it before hand and it was a great choice, the price was more than reasonable and it smells light and clean. Girls are constantly asking what the smell is and how clean it smells. I myself find it to smell alot like fresh cucumber, which is really great.</li>
            <li> It worked out great just as I expected it to.  This is my favorite smell in the world! I would continue to purchase this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This cologne did not smell like the tester I received from the mall. Will not buy this again. Buyer beware</li>
            <li> This cologne is amazing. I first smelled it on a co-worker at work and after about a month of smelling it as he walked by, I had to ask him what it was. I immediately got on the internet and found it here on Amazon and bought. Now my husband&#x27;s scent is the one arousing me instead of my co-worker. You could say that I &amp;#34;had&amp;#34; to get it before I did anything I would regret in the office. ;-)</li>
            <li> Perfect clean scent for anytime!</li>
            <li> Smells great for 16 bucks that I paid. Its good to have a cheapie in the lineup. I read alot about fakes so here is some advice. On this bottle there should be a oval sticker on bottom. Under the sticker there is a serial number that will be hard to spot unless you&#x27;re under the light. No sticker or serial number I would do a return or exchange. Mine smells fine and lasted long enough.</li>
            <li> Smells great! doesn&#x27;t last all day but still lasts for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Will return to this product again---most effective and soothing after shave product spray I&#x27;ve ever used !!!</li>
            <li> Great cologne. My husband loves it and i love it when he wears it.</li>
            <li> Really strong smell, a bit too chemically for my taste.</li>
            <li> Very good stuff came on time</li>
            <li> I have always purchased Pi for my husband because I LOVE the way it smells on him and he loves wearing it, but he goes through cologne so quickly and Pi isn&#x27;t cheap. I started looking for a good smelling cologne that was closer to $20 rather than $70. This one fit the bill. We both really like the smell. Clean, fresh, masculine, and not to overwhelming but I can smell it on him in the evening after he&#x27;s worked all day. I still prefer Pi over any other men&#x27;s cologne I&#x27;ve ever smelled but between special occasions this is the one we&#x27;ll be purchasing.</li>
            <li> I choose it because it was cheap. Anyway I like Nautica&#x27;s smell. I liked it and I have used it constantly.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells FANTASTIC!  Currently my favorite cologne I own.  I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I tested several fragrances at Herberger&#x27;s one day, this was the one I fell in love with, won&#x27;t buy anything but it for my love</li>
            <li> went fully by reviews and ratings, never smelled or heard of it, love the smell and last all day easily! new favorite!!</li>
            <li> This is probably the best fragrance of all the nautica fragrances. (i tried all of them)&lt;br /&gt;This is moderate , neither too mild, nor too strong.. just perfect...!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered 1 more for future use..  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon...</li>
            <li> Not a bad smell, but occasionally it smells...off.. I don&#x27;t know exactly. Wife likes it which is the most important thing.</li>
            <li> The first night I tried this cologne I had multiple compliments about my smell. Some compliments were when I had first spray it but most comments were when it was later in the night when most other colognes had worn off. Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a great gift or a great smell. Longevity is a 5 star</li>
            <li> I have oredered this before, but for some reason this bottle is different. The scent is correct but it does not last and must be reapplied to keep that scent active. I am thinking it is an imposter as I have used Nautica in the past and have been very pleased. I know that in the past even when I went to launder my shirts - I could still smell the Nautica - now I might be out with my girlfriend and she might mention - &amp;#34;You forgot to put on cologne&amp;#34; when in actuality I did. The bottle I got still has that great scent - it just doesnt seem to last.</li>
            <li> You know how a smell is good?  As a guy, when another person male/female comes up to you and says, &amp;#34;wow what are you wearing that smells nice&amp;#34;  or  &amp;#34;what is that I want to get that smell for myself, or for my boyfriend, or husband&amp;#34;.  When you hear that often when you wear this, then you know you have a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten several complements wearing this scent, and I must say I do enjoy it. It has been by second time buying the product and I love it.  I would highly recommend you try this product. Despite the price, it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap at all unlike stuff like Axe and such. I think its a pretty casual sent so its good for everyday use. I wear it almost everyday (I switch between 2 or 3 colonges depending one what I&#x27;m doing) and it last almost all day. I&#x27;ve bought $75 dollar stuff that isn&#x27;t as good as this.</li>
            <li> Great product as expected</li>
            <li> Was exactly as advertised. Fast Delivery! Thanks.</li>
            <li> El tiempo de entrega fue oportuno y de calidad. En env&amp;iacute;o lleg&amp;oacute; a tiempo y en buenas condiciones de presenaci&amp;oacute;n.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes him smell.  He loves the smell of it as well.  Now we&#x27;re both happy.</li>
            <li> Great with the old school smell!! RJ</li>
            <li> For some reason this looks original but this one smells funky alcoholic than the original one. Might have got defective one. Gave me a bit headachy smell. It doesn&#x27;t smell clean and fresh at all. No way.....Not buying again.</li>
            <li> I had struggled making this purchase after reading reviews of it being a potentially fake product. I want to be clear this is the exact product that comes out of a store. Long lasting scent and an excellent price! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> this is one of my husbands favorite scents i love when he wears it .  he usually wears it when we are going out for dinner</li>
            <li> A &amp;#34;best bang for your buck&amp;#34; fragrance, Nautica Voyage is easily worth the 20 dollars or so that you&#x27;d spend to buy a large bottle. The apple, lotus, and mimosa notes blend very nicely to create a perfect casual summer cologne. Voyage goes on a little scratchy at first, but after 15 minutes or so it settles in and creates a beautiful scent trail. It&#x27;s citrusy, with just enough sweetness to take the edge off, and the right kind of florals to round it out. What I like most about Voyage is that there&#x27;s this root-beer like fizz in the mix of it all as well. What you ultimately get is an appealing and addictive accord that persists for several hours before settling into a skin scent around the 3 to 5 hour mark. Projection is average. Voyage is appropriate for any age and best suited for Spring and Summer.</li>
            <li> MUCH less money spent on this than at the stores I usually purchase cologne from and smell just as good and lasts all day. Cannot understand how the price is so low.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and it smells so good on him.  It&#x27;s clean and fresh and very masculine.  It has turned into one of our favorites for sure.</li>
            <li> Great product, my second time buying this particular cologne. I received it when it was supposed to arrive.</li>
            <li> I receive many compliments about this fragrance on a daily basis… it drives the women wild!</li>
            <li> smells great and last all day</li>
            <li> Fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and Quality product at a great price! Gave this to my husband for Valentine&#x27;s Day and we both love the clean, fresh and light smell. Yummy! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy!</li>
            <li> Just got shipment price was great was not sure if it was not the real nautica but I use this all the time same smell last as long as the one I purchased in store</li>

            <li> Tell you the truth, this cologne should have been listed as women&#x27;s cologne!. It is too sweet smelling for being a man&#x27;s cologne!. I gave it to my sister !</li>
            <li> Great price, it is the real thing and a large amount of it.</li>
            <li> Good for the daily use. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> thanks! super parfume with super price!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit fruity, but in a good way and has a very pleasant and relaxing feel to it. It&#x27;s a great everyday perfume, especially during the summer, but it&#x27;s amazing all around. I bought it when it was on sale for around $15, which was a bargain price for a perfume this good. I would highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> This was a gift.  It was received timely. He loves it.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was not upto the markbas advertised</li>
            <li> I really liked thanks for Sale</li>
            <li> Nice, clean smell!!!  My husband smells wonderful...I love it!</li>
            <li> Not great but worth the cost</li>
            <li> This cologne lasts all day. Even after I shower I can smell it. It has a gentle scent, not too overpowering. Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know a lot about colognes. But this product has gotten me so many compliments I&#x27;ve lost count</li>
            <li> Happily impressed.  As others have written, this seems to be very comparable to $70 brands.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I was wondering when I ordered this with the price so cheap and all. Well not only was I pleased with the aroma but also the staying power of the cologne. This stuff goes the distance. Women were commenting on it the first night I wore it and that was in a smoky casino!!! You will be moving around hours later and still catch scents of voyage clinging to you and working its magic. This one is a steal so get it before they realize and change the price.</li>
            <li> The scent is great, it is fresh and has the &amp;#34;just got out of the shower&amp;#34; smell. It lasts me all day (but I work in an office).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is that there is a sour/green apple smell thrown in, making it sometimes smell more fruity than &amp;#34;clean/fresh&amp;#34;. I&#x27;m not a cologne expert, and for the price this is a steal. I will be buying again, probably soon before they jack the price up.</li>
            <li> I love this fragance!!  love it!!  very good!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Finally, i bought an unauthentic cologne from amazon that it wasn&#x27;t a water-down piece of crap of it&#x27;s original. The smell is lovely not only does it last long, it&#x27;s pretty cheap compare to a retail store. the only concern i have about this cologne is it leaves stains on cloths if sprayed at a closer range but comes right off after washing the clothe.</li>
            <li> The smell is not as great as I thought for the price it would be.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t recommend to spend (nearly $20) on it.</li>
            <li> Came in gray time as expected!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great price super fast shipping</li>
            <li> This stuff is priced right, and smells absolutely amazing, the smell lasts all day too. even the next morning you still can smell it a bit (and thats with not having put much on too begin with). Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this before about 6 years ago and love this scent. I used to get compliments all the time on it so I figured I would buy it again. A great cologne for the price. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this! I use it for work and on the weekends during the daytime. Fresh, clean scent reminds me of breezy spring/ summer sunny days. Very light and refreshing. A must have in an cologne collection!</li>
            <li> This bottle has a spray head, and 2 or 3 spritzes and you are ready to go!  I like the smell of it very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great, but it would be better If it lasts long</li>
            <li> One of my favorite colognes... elegant and masculine</li>
            <li> Great smelling cologne that my girlfriend actually loves. I will certainly be buying this or another cologne from the seller. Excellent all around</li>
            <li> smells amazing.. this cologne has gotten me laid a few times haha</li>
            <li> I love this cologne. It&#x27;s very clean and crisp, it kind of reminds me of walking on the beach. Scent lasts a good 6-10 hours. You couldn&#x27;t really ask for more in a quality fragrance for a great price.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this product has received so many good reviews. This is a headache-inducing, cheap smelling fragrance. I would not recommend!</li>
            <li> courteous service, I really liked the lotion, what I expected. gladly recommend it. 100% satisfied. the seller was always responsive to my questions. This lotion is sold at a good price with very good quality in the material production.</li>
            <li> Nice fragrance, stays on for an entire day without problem!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how some reviewers are complaining that it is awful, just water, goes to trash etc. This has a wonderful fresh smell, lasts long, and is priced so reasonably. For the price at amazon, this is a steal. Ladies just love it whenever I wear it and I have received so many compliments for this, what more would one want?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I don&#x27;t think there is another perfume at this price that smells any better.</li>
            <li> I got a good deal on this at amazon and the reviews seemed pretty good but wow, I cant stand how this smells. Very synthetic. I&#x27;ve never worn it again.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell, my boyfriend loved it, and I love it on him. It is somewhat strong (I have a very sensitive sense of smell), so 1-2 sprays are enough / just right. It is a nice smell and is long-lasting.</li>
            <li> I recommend to you this water; it is as advertised and the price is very attractive! do not hesitate! like me</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this cologne.</li>
            <li> Came quick and and it&#x27;s legit. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> It was ok.. But it was a gift</li>
            <li> Smell isn&#x27;t bad at all for the price. I went out and bought one of those Ralph Lauren polo shirts, you know, the one with the big ass logo on the front...some moccasins without socks and went out searching for a yacht while watching my death grip on my starbucks Venti. As a matter of fact I smell amazing.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my husband.. It smells wonderful and he loved it..</li>
            <li> This has got to be the most perfect scent for summer!  Its a very nice fruity, soapy floral scent and since there is no citrus in it like typical aquatics, it is not harsh at all and very very pleasant to the nose.  And when I say floral, it does that mean that it smells feminine at all, it just has that just hoped out of the shower fresh feeling.  The best way for to describe it is think of like a nice fresh body wash and makes you feel fresh and clean, this is pretty much that smell.&lt;br /&gt;This cologne gets raved on by basenotes and fragantica as being one of the \\&quot;best cheapie\\&quot; fragrances you can get.  Longevity and sillage are also pretty impressive as well for an aquatic (6-7 hours on my skin).  Definitely a fragrance for a younger guy in high school or college.</li>
            <li> It is an excellent product I recommend it 100%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Far better than the classic.</li>
            <li> I purchase this every year for my husband&lt;br /&gt;I even find myself using it&lt;br /&gt;Very fresh&lt;br /&gt;Not much else to say</li>
            <li> This has been one of my favorite colognes for a long time I get constant compliments on how great I smell daily!!!</li>
            <li> Great smell great price doesn&#x27;t over power but is very clean and distinctive. A must have for any fragance collection.</li>
            <li> I have been a Coolwater fan for many years. Wanted try something different and cheap. So far I really like this. The smell is nice and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> It smelled Awesome!!! :) what a great buy !!!!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this same perfume for years and it has always been good. The last one i got is fake and it smellls awful. Amazon needs to change its suppliers.</li>
            <li> Awesome scent, get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> Buy it. Gets compliments and the best bang for your buck. Aquatic as your moms downstairs when I wear it around her. Luke I&#x27;m your father.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband based off the reviews and honestly I thought I would hate because it&#x27;s so cheap. I also ordered chrome which is my all time favorite. I still love Chrome but, this is surprisingly a great clean and long lasting smell. It has in fact become my husband&#x27;s new favorite cologne. He wears it daily.</li>
            <li> This cologne smells co clean.  Not too strong.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this frangrance for my boyfriend. He as well, loves this scent. I have been buying it for him for about 3 years. great price for the size/oz.</li>
            <li> nice smeel and long lasting fragrance..my son was very happy</li>
            <li> great and cheap for work</li>
            <li> i love it. one of the best fragrance a ever tried. and good price</li>
            <li> I bought it after reading the reviews here and a recommendation from one of my cousins, and I must again pass on the message. Worth every penny. I haven&#x27;t used my other cologne and perfumes for my daily use after I got this. Perfect to brighten-up your spirits and lasts long enough.</li>
            <li> Light Breezy Smell. Not overpowering and lasts through the night</li>
            <li> Excellent, get it you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Smells OK. I think Nautica should do a better job.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my brother. He loved it. It smells great and is fairly big for the price. The package also came on time and was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li> I love it, my family loves it, my lover loves it. What else can I ask for? I&#x27;ve gotten many complements on my smell (positive ones lol). I&#x27;ve bought like 6 of these since they&#x27;re great and cheap!</li>
            <li> fast shipping, awesome price</li>
            <li> My original review was dead wrong:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The scent is very week and not long lasting ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the future I would avoid to buy fragrances online.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (11/11/2014):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several days of use, I came to conclusion&lt;br /&gt;that the scent is strong enough and it does last at least half day ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price was right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it. My wife likes it, too.</li>
            <li> Fake ... Please do not buy... This is not original ....</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, he loves it and I love it! It&#x27;s very clean and fresh. Very attractive scent.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described, great price, not a knock-off/imposter cologne.  It is the real deal!</li>
            <li> great smell lasts long</li>
            <li> Great scent for such a cheap price. It&#x27;s worth a blind-buy.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a blind buy from Ross&#x27;.  My wife loves it.  Fresh, clean and still masculine.</li>
            <li> Excellent scent. Not fake. I went to a cologne store the other day to check their inventory of nautica cologne and asked to see the bottle. It looks exactly like what came in the mail. Bottle and cap are both of very good qualitt, and the box it came in looked authentic enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is pretty great, very manly and what I would imagine VIP would smell like.</li>
            <li> The real thing&amp;faat delivery</li>
            <li> I love it smells good :)</li>
            <li> It has a really good smell but the biggest problem is that the smell does not even last more than an hour unless i spray myself 4+ times in the same spot.</li>
            <li> No issues, wrapped properly and I bought it for only $18.  This cologne retails for almost 3x times that amount.  It&#x27;s a must buy for any teenager - 30 + years old.  It has a soft, &amp;#34;fruity&amp;#34; ( in a good way ) smell to it.  Hard for anyone to not like this product.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious!  Found a new one to add to my collection!</li>
            <li> Totally a fake. Smells nothing like the real thing and lasts for 1-2 hours at best. Faintly smells of rubbing alcohol. DO NOT BUY. Bought mine direct from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Unanimous consensus of feedback it that it smells awesome, from ALL my female counterparts. It has a soft, light smell, nothing &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; or over-bearing, which is nice for my tastes.</li>
            <li> I love the smell. It&#x27;s not extreme smell, but it good. Also it keep a long time. Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Great product. Delivered promptly. Price was good.</li>
            <li> I would most strongly recommend this product for high school/college individuals who are beginning to understand the importance of good fragrances but are restricted in terms of money.  I was there once too!  However, this fragrance does not smell cheap in any regard and holds an integrity that is very clean and sharp. What I love so much about this fragrance is its longevity.  On clean, remotely moist skin it will last 8-12 hours.  It is also fairly potent for an aquatic fragrance, so easy on the trigger, two-three sprays on chest/neck will do it.  It opens its top-notes with a fruity presence that smells likes apples and settles quickly into a fresh/clean/floral green accord and settles its base in a very pleasant and masculine woody/aquatic contrast.  I find, like most aquatic fragrances it is best appreciated during the late spring/summer seasons.  For the price and quality this fragrance is hard to beat.  I was an avid wearer in my high school years and have been through many fragrances.  I still have profound respect and continue to come back with reliance to this one. Pick it up now, and remember to purchase through Amazon LLC. instead of a third party selling on Amazon to ensure authenticity.</li>
            <li> I own: Curve,Chrome, Acqua Di Gio, Jean Paul Gaultier, Issey Mikaye and Dolce and Gabbana to name a few. My girlfriend and I like this one the most and it is cheaper in price the all the ones I listed!</li>
            <li> Truly great... All my girlfriends love this scent!</li>
            <li> This is a great cologne for any young man! Smell is very oceanic and stays for a long time! i would recomend to any teenage to mid adult male. Plus arguably cheep!</li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s a sure winner! For the price ($12 if you buy on Amazon), it&#x27;s worth every cent! I purchased this, Nautica Classic and Nautica Blue. Of the three, I&#x27;d rate this THE BEST. Nautica Blue is very good too, but the scent isn&#x27;t long lasting. This one will keep you smelling great throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a regular user of Lacoste White (as it has a great scent that seems to last forever), but the prices don&#x27;t even compare (Lacoste White&#x27;s $55 for 3.4oz on Amazon)! This one&#x27;s a steal for 12 bucks!</li>
            <li> It smells good but very subtle. You have to put you nose very near to feel the scent. Also the bottle are really strange, usually inside the box there&#x27;s thick paper to protect the bottle. For this one, there isn&#x27;t. Besides, the code number was printed on the nylon cover which supposed to be on the box and the bottle.  I have tested it. It does not last long. About 1h30m to 2 hours. Then I went to Kohl&#x27;s and tried the tester bottle there. The result is the tester bottle lasts for 6 hours. Hell. Did any one buy this perfume with Amazon? Do you have the same problem? It was sold by Amazon, not a third party.</li>
            <li> Bought as a christmas stocking stuffer for my husband, and it smells amazing. He loves it as well.</li>
            <li> Estoy muy satisfecha con la orden, lo recibi rapido y en excelentes condiciones. Tenia un excelente precio, definitivamente volvere a comprarles.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves it! He said he walked in the store, and someone asked...........did you just get out the shower? You smell fresh! I like it on him also. Fresh shower smell.</li>
            <li> My new favorite cologne. I always receive compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Smells good! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage Excellence!!!! and the service was excellence... super fast and sure, the product is good, inexpensive ............&lt;br /&gt;Great .</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband.  He likes it and I find the smell quite pleasant and nostalgic (of what, I don&#x27;t know!)</li>
            <li> muy buena colonia, la entrega fue r&amp;aacute;pida, el precio est&amp;aacute; muy bien, es de buena calidad, huele muy bien, recomendada</li>
            <li> Good fragrance, the price is similar to what you would find in your neighborhood department store / fragrance store (despite the comps posted on the listing). Was shipped in time and is ideal for daily office usage.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, i get a lot of complements on the smell</li>
            <li> I like a cologne that lasts a good long while, even if it&#x27;s a bit strong at first.  This one is nice and clean, mild, on the sweeter side.  The scent itself is great.  The price is affordable.  The bottle is nice, very attractive on our perfume/cologne tray.  But it fades kind of quickly, so I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars, even though I like the scent.</li>
            <li> I was needing some new spray since my other was either running low or I had it so long that the scent had began to not smell right anymore so I came across the Nautica ones on Amazon.  From reading the reviews, there is this one and a little bit cheaper one that Nautica sells and it sound like both were good but spending a few more dollars would get you this one that has a good smell that lasts throughout the day and so far, it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my boyfriend for Valentine&#x27;s Day. He loves it. Smells fresh! Love it! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> first of all, i dint know what it would smell like, so it was a blind buy for me, but when i first smelled it, i fell in love with the smell, and for $20 it beats most colognes in the same price... will buy this again...</li>
            <li> Overall a crisp, clean smelling cologne but doesn&#x27;t last more than a few hours. Some colognes seem to fade quickly to the person wearing it, (but people nearby can still smell it many hours later) but Nautica Voyage seems to lose it&#x27;s scent not only to the wearer but also anyone else nearby approximately 3-4 hours after application. This may be a plus for some people however..</li>
            <li> PAID $45.00 FOR THIS AT PHARMACY. THIS IS A GREAT VALUE AND IS EXACTLY THE SAME PRODUCT. THANKS</li>
            <li> My wife loves the smell of this. She said it smells very fresh. Like a constant smell of shower freshness. I highly recommend, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> Smells ok.  Only problem is that scent doesn&#x27;t last.  I cant find a date or lot stamp on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> i bought this expecting something at least ok. It was delivered on time; i open the box and sprayed some on my shirt and the smell lasted for about 3 seconds and then i could not smell it again. I smelled my shirt and it kind of smells like the perfume but it has like a mild smell, more like a smell of alcohol and not like it was described. I am disappointed, i kind of want to try the &#x27;real&#x27; thing not this fake stuff. unless if it is the real stuff, then this perfume is s***.</li>
            <li> Nice light scent not over powering. Lasts all day. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> A nice bottle of cologne for a good price; good summertime accents and a sure way to avoid being stinky!</li>
            <li> Product as well as the service were both great and will definitely look forward to being a future customer.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty nice, it was very clean and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it! I&#x27;m still not even 1/7th of the way through the bottle..</li>
            <li> So much cheaper than in the local retail stores.  I bought this for my son as it&#x27;s his favorite fragrance.</li>
            <li> Exactly as I ordered. Unbelievable price</li>
            <li> It was fake, there was no serial number on the bottom of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Very bad product, smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than 15 minutes. DO NOT ORDER.</li>
            <li> This smells so so good. I am buying another bottle for my husband when this one is gone.</li>
            <li> Lovely fragrance.  Lot&#x27;s of compliments.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t be certain that it&#x27;s &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Nautica or not, but the price is right. I thought for under $15 I was getting the smaller size (the $25 one at stores) but the 3.4 oz actually is quite large (the $40-$50 one at stores). Extremely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Cologne arrive very quickly, no questions about authenticity. Box still had cellophane plastic on it. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> bought it for my boyfriend on V-day. He loves it and I like the smell.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much , pleased with everything</li>
            <li> This product did not meet my expectations. The smell does not last at all and it seems to be watered down.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, Brought it for my husband, Smells GREAT. Nice subtle but manly smell. Wont burn your throat.</li>
            <li> Great product will by again</li>
            <li> Bought this for my father 2 Christmases ago.  He had no complaints.</li>
            <li> its a very unique smell. for this price its unbelievable. i have using it for long time. i recommend to everybody.</li>
            <li> Smells great. The ladies love it. A good add to any collection, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent service. My favorite fragrance!</li>
            <li> This is a great buy! It smells absolutely wonderful. It is just the right size. It was just the right price too.</li>
            <li> Nice refreshing scent</li>
            <li> great product and value</li>
            <li> Smells amazing like everyone said it would, very cheap and it&#x27;s a generous amount and shipped quickly. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Smells great, got good compliments from women at the bar, and work, so that means that it&#x27;s doing its job.</li>
            <li> Smells great and I get a lot of compliments.  You can spray just a little or quite a bit depending on what you are doing that day.  Even when spaying quite a bit, it is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, era lo que en realidad estaba esperando, me llego a tiempo, excelente compra, .) :) :) :) :)</li>
            <li> Took a chance and ordered this, ended up getting a fake very upset. The smell last for about 15 mins before it fades away and thats with putting a heavy dosage!</li>
            <li> Some people I know say &amp;#34;He always smells like he just got out of the shower.&amp;#34; I guess that&#x27;s a good smell?</li>
            <li> Real deal, great price!!</li>
            <li> very good for the price</li>
            <li> The product smells of only alcohol after 5-6 sprays from the bottle. I asked for a refund and actually got it extremely quickly. Within the hour of me filing the complaint. This product was too good to be true; and the only reason I am giving this 2 stars is because the customer service was great and I got my refund quickly. Spend your money on genuine products, not this garbage. It&#x27;s a gamble go to see if you get a real or fake. Don&#x27;t expect too much from it.</li>
            <li> one of my favorites scents at a great price</li>
            <li> Not overpowering- good for the workplace. The scent is very masculine, clean, and refreshing- increases after dancing or sweating at the gym.</li>
            <li> I love the cologne and every time i wear it someone either gives me a compliment or asks me what i am wearing. Buy this for you or your man and you will not be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell, it actually last long for a cheaper cologne, I like to mix colognes to amplify the smells, but this one alone is very good, its got that business suit vibe but I where it to work at FedEx to keep me smelling fresh</li>
            <li> Very good price, very good long lasting smell. It is one of my favourite perfume. If you want a relative cheap, fresh and very good perfume this is the one.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful! Authentic.  I can&#x27;t keep my hands of my hubby when he wears this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal. It is an awesome fragrance that does not disappear after a few minutes, Great Price for 3.4 oz</li>
            <li> It was really quick..</li>
            <li> The panties just fall off the women when i wear this cologne ;-)&lt;br /&gt;Its the best.&lt;br /&gt;Ever.&lt;br /&gt;It smells so good.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, is nice and subtle. The problem is that only lasts for a very few hours.&lt;br /&gt;The Nautica Blue lasts 3 times as much</li>
            <li> smells really gd and is not weak at all,great price also.i will buy this again.</li>
            <li> What can I say, scents are very subjective and this one just isn&#x27;t for me, I thought it smelled kind of flowery, my wife didn&#x27;t like it either.  On the up side I will say this, the smell lasted longer than any other cologne I&#x27;ve ever used.  I&#x27;ve already given it away and will try something else from Amazon...yes, it&#x27;s a gamble to buy fragrances this way that you&#x27;re not familiar with but Amazon&#x27;s pricing is unbeatable so the risk is minimal.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a lot of compliments with this perfume. It is not too imposing unlike other commercial perfumes out there. I will definitely buy again when this one runs out.</li>
            <li> Cause all of protection and came before expected also it was in original package . Also DEEZ NUTS</li>
            <li> Good for less than $15. Best out of all Nautica I tried.</li>
            <li> it seems to me like water with little drops of colony, you can use it to remove ink or clean your keyboard .</li>
            <li> Ordered one bottle, it was fake. NO oval nautica sticker on bottom with serial number. Made a complaint, got an email saying they were sorry, and they shipped out a second bottle free of charge, nice! Just opened it up. FAKE AGAIN. I mean, come on! Scent lasts about 15 mins, and not even the same Nautica Voyage smell as the real stuff. I&#x27;m so angry!!!</li>
            <li> ok.....for price I thought it would smell better.  try l&#x27;eau d&#x27;issey  ... weird name but smells great.</li>
            <li> I love this cologne on my boyfriend. He wore this before I met him and when he ran out, I was quick to buy him more. The scent is irresistible.</li>
            <li> Awesome :) perfect smell very long lasting</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son because he likes all of the scents from Nautica for Men. The price I paid for it was the lowest I found.</li>
            <li> Like it and recommend it.</li>
            <li> Me llego en excelentes condiciones y ademas hasta sellado, no tengo quejas pues fue lo que compre y asi mismo lo recibi. Gracias</li>
            <li> This scent is great, especially for the price point (under $20?). I had purchased this for my brother, and Calvin Klein Eternity Aqua for myself. I think I do like this smell better. Gives that nice warm, summer aquatic vibe. Just smells so good. I would highly recommend it. If you can get your hands on a genuine item, do it!</li>
            <li> One of my fav colognes of all time. wonderful day scent, refreshing and pleasant. Also, it was legit. If you are afraid of getting a fake, make sure you buy from amazon.com as the seller and not one of the many 3rd party sellers.</li>
            <li> the scent is too weak to get noticed</li>
            <li> It a really cool cologne for the price..something u can wear to work that&#x27;s not too strong.</li>
            <li> smells better than I expected..I use about 3-4 sprays right after the shower, and I can&#x27;t tell if I just get used to the smell or if it wears off after a few hours but best way to tell is if your shirt lingers the scent when you take it off</li>
            <li> thak you... I like...</li>
            <li> Price is great. Smells nice, last relatively long as well. Big bottle, so good value. I&#x27;d recommend for the price.</li>
            <li> It smells so bad. I never thought  Nautica will be having such a horrible products sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please dont buy it unless you lost senses to smell.</li>
            <li> The parfume is no to strong but is cool. The smell is not much durable but for the price is very good.</li>
            <li> I will be surprise, I went on and get this cologne just by pure reviews and I am happy with it. It smells great and totally awesome for summer time or spring! Very fresh scent!</li>
            <li> Smells great and really long lasting, sometimes i still smell it on my clothes a day or 2 later</li>
            <li> Gave to a friend who absolutely loved it.</li>
            <li> Bought this thinking it was going to be a watered down low quality cologne but it turned out to be my very favorite and least expensive in my cologne stash. Has a slightly sweet fresh smell. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Not the real deal. lasts about an hour if that.</li>
            <li> Nice smell, but weak and short lasting.</li>
            <li> Smells great and like a guy, not to say I smell guys but if I had to smell one I would like to smell like this</li>
            <li> It is very good, we love so much !!!!!!!!!!11</li>
            <li> I dislike the fragrance. That means I will discard it, rather than wear it, because this purchase is not eligible for a refund. My mistake was that I presumed that I would like this fragrance just because of its favorable Amazon reviews.  So I took a chance.  I bought it without ever trying it.  Turns out that I personally dislike it; and all the favorable reviews at Amazon won&#x27;t change what my own sense of smell tells me.  This fragrance resembles watermelon, and it quickly becomes annoying.  It is not something that I can tolerate for any duration of time.</li>
            <li> For me was awesome, useful and easy to use.... I get quickly after I made my order. Just buy it if u need it</li>
            <li> Very clean and fragrant smell.  For reference, it&#x27;s almost identical to the fragrance Hollister/Abercrombie use in their stores.  Very good quality and scent for the price.</li>
            <li> Very nice fragrance, and affordable.</li>
            <li> Wow! Those are the only words that I have to say as for the price it smells great. This is a great cologne and I use it for casual events and when I hit the town at night that has lead to being complimented on how great it smells. Trust me when I say you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Wish they had the good smelling Nautica Island Voyage still.  This is nowhere near as good of a product.  I ended up selling it right when I got it because it is nothing like Island Voyage was</li>
            <li> Smells good but only last 1 hour. Probably that is why it is so cheap.</li>
            <li> Great fragance but I find it a little bit strong at times</li>
            <li> Smells great! Love this cologne been using it for years!</li>
            <li> very good product thank you very much</li>
            <li> i get compliments all the time</li>
            <li> For the price, this is great. I was wary of getting something fake after reading reviews, but mine seems to be genuine. My girlfriend loves it. Check out some reviews on youtube if you want a sense of the smell, I describe it as sort of just &amp;#34;oceany&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Smell is amazing and new in retail packaging.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked the fragrance. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for a teen age. He loves it.</li>
            <li> This smells fine for my 13 year old son, but I would recommend for my husband because the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Well let me start off by saying this s*** smells good ! , I&#x27;m in highschool and its spring of 2013 , so I was looking for a good spring scent ! My friend , had this and all the girls loved it . so i picked it up to and get nothing but compliments so if you want a lil sum sum to get noticed and have a little diversity , get this . ! I&#x27;d also recommend , Drakkar Noir , and Polo Black .</li>
            <li> I like this cologne very much. Lasts along time and has a mild fresh smell to it. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this cologne is the duration. 2 sprays and I&#x27;m good for the entire day. I Highly recommend this cologne if you want to smell amazing and receive endless compliments/</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great item.</li>
            <li> Smells great, it does last for about 10 hours, it has a nice clean smell to it. im not sure why you guys think it fades away it really doesnt its just that its not so strong. i personally like the smell.</li>
            <li> I really like the smell, not over powering and feels fresh. I can see why it is rated as high by others.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this..</li>
            <li> great buy super fast shipping a+++</li>
            <li> Nice, but no more than that.</li>
            <li> No complaints here I was completely satisfied</li>
            <li> Summertime in a bottle, plain and simple.  It is a straight-up fresh aquatic fragrance, but it has some cool twists that others do not have.  It has this nice melon/apple note that is a good change-up from the citrus that most summertime aquatic fragrances are centered around.  There is a nice salty air scent as well.  The longevity is SUPERB for a fresh fragrance that is this cheap; it easily lasts eight+ hours on me.  It is not really a suit and tie scent per se, but if you want something relaxing to wear casually, this one is excellent, although you can pull it off at the office well during summertime.  It is a little too beachy for wintertime for my tastes, but if you want to smell like the beach all year round, what is wrong with that?  Oh yeah, and this one will get you compliments left and right.  I have some fragrances that cost six times as much as Nautica Voyage that have not gotten me nearly as many compliments.  For the price, you absolutely cannot go wrong, especially for summer.  My favorite Nautica fragrance.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s father-n-law</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband and he really liked the smell and so did I. Fresh, clean smell and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> My new fav smell. Very fresh like grass/ocean kinda thing. Bottle arrived leaking a bit. Not too bad, but the box was wet and the bottle down maybe 5 or 10%. The seal on the bottle is obviously the problem. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s 4 stars instead of five.</li>
            <li> Been using Nautica for two years, love it and get a ton of positive feedback on it.</li>
            <li> Good buy! But not sure if it is the real stuff. Seems fade quickly but smells great.</li>
            <li> Girls like me now?!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OKAY!</li>
            <li> Great Value and wonderful fragrance.</li>
            <li> authentic and it was delivered really quick</li>
            <li> Love this cologne and I&#x27;ve received many complements on it.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is the best from Nautica. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and can&#x27;t complain. The price is even better from amazon.</li>
            <li> Thought I should give this cologne a try since it is a name brand for a cheap price. Never again will I buy this cologne. When I first sprayed it on, I got the strong chemical scent, which is normal at first. But after a while I assumed the smell would morph into something wonderful....I was dead wrong. It didn&#x27;t really change much. If anything, it just got really soapy. Its a terrible, headache-inducing cologne. What a shame.</li>
            <li> I bough this for my fried and he liked it a lot. It is mild but with awesome fragrance . I would say it is the best deal for the price paid.</li>
            <li> It came really fast with my membership. The bottle is really nice and the smell is just so awesome. I bet even Obama can attract lots of hot girls with this!</li>
            <li> The best gift I ever received, giving it 5 star. My wife gifted it to me, thank you very much Shaminder !!</li>
            <li> Finally, I found a good everyday colonge that last. The scent is light but noticable, pretty crisp and pleasent. Of couse the smell fades a bit by the end of the day, but it has lasted much longer than others I paid more for and I don&#x27;t need to put a lot of it on.&lt;br /&gt;The exact same thing sold at the mall (the ones close to me anyway) sells between $25 and $30+ dollars so Amazon&#x27;s deal is pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;For me it&#x27;s the perfect everyday colonge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really fond of it but it&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite, and I have some much more expensive than this one.  It&#x27;s very clean and soapy.  She says it&#x27;s very distinctive from the others I have.  Similar to cool water, but somehow not as refined.  Good staying power with 4-5 sprays, can still smell it the next day.</li>
            <li> I liked the perfume everything is perfect. I would recommend others to buy.&lt;br /&gt;It has long lasting fragrance. Goes for whole day.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome. It&#x27;s a clean, Almost soapy scent. Isn&#x27;t overpowering but get complimented all the time when I hug  females.</li>
            <li> Husband writing this review- Great cologne, WONDERFUL longevity. Can be chloeing if too much applied, 2 sprays were enough for me. Definitely a salty, clean, soapy aquatic sent. Can easily get 24 hours out of this. Nonoffesive - can be used for any occasion but I think that it is best suited for office wear or casual day wear.</li>
            <li> Nautica Voyage is a great smelling fragrance. I remember when I first started wearing it, I always got compliments. It had gotten to the point where my coworkers would all joke and \\&quot;He&#x27;s here\\&quot; the second they smelled it.</li>
            <li> smells great, great price. unfortunanlty im allergic to it.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> This has been my go-to cologne for the past couple of years.  It smells great and I get a lot of compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Good scent. Very fresh. Probably more of a summer fragrance.</li>
            <li> Amazing Eau De Toilette!!! I will recommend this to everyone. Smell amazing, everyone always  ask me what cologne I use.</li>
            <li> I was walking around Macy&#x27;s and came across a sample of this cologne, and couldn&#x27;t believe how great it smelled. At $66 it was a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea Amazon offered this same product at 1/3 the price. Boy, was I glad I didn&#x27;t shell out the $66 Macy&#x27;s asked for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have gotten so many compliments from co-workers, and friends who think I paid a fortune for this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nautica Voyage and Burberry for Men are now the two scents I cannot live without!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas! He had used Nautica Voyage before and loved it. He ran out about a month before Christmas. I thought it would be the perfect gift. After looking in the stores at the cologne I found out that it was between $30 and $40 elsewhere! Amazon&#x27;s price is so much lower than store pricing and is awesome! Would recommend to anyone! He loved it!</li>
            <li> This article to have bought has very good quality, excellent price and exceptional construction, I recommend it without fear to be wrong, it is a very good product,its&#x27; an agradable smelling</li>
            <li> i think i have recieved a fake bottle. i aways hear good reviews about this cologne and i bought it directly from amazon, when i recieved it it didnt have this sticker that everyone say it should have on the bottom of the bottle. and the cologne it self smelt similar to hand sanitizer. do you think i got a fake bottle.</li>
            <li> I bought two bottles for my sons for Christmas.  They both liked the fragrance, as did the ladies in their lives.  Priced right!!</li>
            <li> Classy smell that lasts until the next day! The price you can&#x27;t beat. The bottle also has a very stylish and sleek design.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling spray I use. I love it so much. It last for a long time, if you use like 3 sprays. But this is my favorite one. Buy it, you wont be disappointed, even if you never smelled it before. I constantly get commented from the ladies, saying they love the way I smell. Best stuff out!</li>
            <li> I gave this to my husband for his birthday!&lt;br /&gt;He enjoyed it &amp; so did  I.&lt;br /&gt;Good gift to give.</li>
            <li> This smells great, i have gotten many compliments for the sent. Very good Cologne</li>
            <li> You can even smell it on ya clothes the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying attention to deals abt this fragrance for a long time and this is the best I&#x27;ve got. Voyage is the best in Nautica, n it smells really cool.</li>
            <li> First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail. If all those are a yes for me then I will give it 5 stars. I am not just rating it 5 stars cause its the best product of its class, that is for each person to decide. I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells last for 6-8 hours but can be smelled up to 10-12 hours up close ;) and I love the smell of it, I am glad I took the chance on it with out smelling it first. This is the real deal not a fake.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this fragrance and have been using ever since I tried a sample. From there, I can&#x27;t really review any further because you don&#x27;t now me and what you think smells good is pretty much a personal preference issue.</li>
            <li> My wife loves the scent.</li>
            <li> Very Good.......Excellent</li>
            <li> Something as economic and so rich .. excellent fragrance, nautica 20 points . . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> I got this earlier than I expected and I got it and it smells amazing my girl loves it nd I got plenty compliments.</li>
            <li> I bought a bottle  and I love scent.. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the potency of the bottle I bought at the store.. The scent goes away faster...</li>
            <li> Smells pretty nice. But it disappears quickly after about 2~3 hours. Other then that, this product is very solid .</li>
            <li> This is an awesome price for the same stuff I used to pay $65 for @ Dillard&#x27;s...my man gets compliments all day long and I don&#x27;t think I like that sometimes! But, that&#x27;s how great this scent is...not over-powering, long-lasting, crisp and clean and reeking of sexuality</li>
            <li> I love how this smell . I wear it for work and very satisfied  with it</li>
            <li> This perfurm has a wonderful smell, I use it everyday and everyone like it, especially me. It has suitable prize!</li>
            <li> Smells so good.Comes in a nice made bottle.Lasts a long time,spray it on in the am and i can still smell it hours later.</li>
            <li> Good smell but fades away quickly.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Can spray on a hoodie and it&#x27;ll smell great for days and days</li>
            <li> I smelled the tester of this scent at our local PX but there were no more boxes of this available. I smelled nearly every other scent available, but this one was definitely the winner! It was a gift for my husband and he loves it, and I love how it makes him smell. I don&#x27;t think it smells generic like most but it definitely has a &amp;#34;classic&amp;#34; scent that I&#x27;m almost positive anyone would love. This was also about half the price that the department store was asking, STEAL!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome summery cologne, I ordered this for my fiance and he absolutely loves it, and so do I. I am most impresses about shipping it was shipped a day after I purchased and arrived in the Caribbean 1 day after</li>
            <li> Not bad product but I don&#x27;t like</li>
            <li> Fast delivery yay, its odor is really nice</li>
            <li> I never review stuff I bought off Amazon before, but this stuff is fake. The smell is really good, but it merely last like an hour or so. This stuff is really watered down and it&#x27;s NOT returnable</li>
            <li> Im weird when it comes to cologne. I like how a lot of them smell, but I dont like them when they are sprayed on me. So its rare I find one I can tolerate on me. This is definitely one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells great! The only problem is as others have mentioned. By far, this colonge wears off FAST! The fastest colonge I ever encountered. It almost seems like its gone after an hour or 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Im guessing thats why the price is fairly low on this. Because you have to keep spraying it on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish they made a stronger version and charged more (aka, parfume). I would be willing to pay more to not have to keep re-upping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps</li>
            <li> exelent Really enjoy this fragrance, get compliments on it all the time its has a great scent and I would recommend everybody to buy this product. wash my clothes the smell still stays on the clothes</li>
            <li> Best smell good ever very fresh and clean sent this definitely a woman stop and complement you on it.and is the best price on amazon</li>
            <li> I was kind of weary buying cologne online. But i was lucky to purchase this one. It smells great and fresh. Worth the 20 bucks. The smell stays with you the entire day so the bottle should last a good while.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the price</li>
            <li> Outstanding clean/summer day scent. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blind buy as well.</li>
