    <ol>
            <li>Very happy with this palette!</li>
            <li>Price is wonderful...</li>
            <li>what a great buy!</li>
            <li>very happy with this eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>great color selection with both matte and shimmery shades.</li>
            <li>and she was so happy.</li>
            <li>just makes me sooo happy.</li>
            <li>you will love this product!!</li>
            <li>If you are a make-up queen and love colors and variety then this is for you!!</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s awesome how many colors there are.</li>
            <li>Great diversity, and the case is good quality.</li>
            <li>I think the pigmentation is fine for me as I&#x27;m no makeup expert, the stronger ones are awesome and the lighter ones will do with a damp applicator.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday, and she loved it.</li>
            <li>As mua I&#x27;m truly happy that I ordered this :)</li>
            <li>The colors are bright and nice and it arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li>Also, some colors are richer in color than others that i have to keep dipping my brush into to even get any kind of color payoff on my eye.  </li>
            <li>some of the colors are great, and there are so many :)</li>
            <li>I love the brand and love the choices!</li>
            <li>I was honestly expecting more from this product.</li>
            <li>Wouldve been nice if they were more pigmented.</li>
            <li>The Color choices are nice and have a great mix of natural, brights, shimmers, and mattes!</li>
            <li>and you get more product.</li>
            <li>so I would keep in a safe storage like a train case.</li>
            <li>Love the variety of color...</li>
            <li>when I opened it I was pleased with the Color choices.</li>
            <li>Most of the shades appear to be dupes...</li>
            <li>As for the set...I just love it..</li>
            <li>I love these shadows.  </li>
            <li>She has spent quite an amount of time playing with it to see what colors look the best.  </li>
            <li>Received in excellent condition as non of the shadows were crushed in transit.  </li>
            <li>Mostly the light browns and those sort of colors.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use primer, and even then it isn&#x27;t the best.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>so I was happy when I found so many colors for such an inexpensive price.  </li>
            <li>I use a primer, so they lasted all day and were easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>Other than that I cant complain I love this product and price!!!</li>
            <li>The amount of eye shadow colors is staggering, and it quickly became her favorite makeup.  </li>
            <li>Recommend if you want nice makeup for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Love the large variety of colors but the second tray of bright colors you do have to apply more than once.</li>
            <li>I was excited to order NYX 112 Eyeshadows after reading the reviews.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of NYX products and was excited to order this palette...</li>
            <li>THE PALETTE OFFERS A GREAT VARIETY OF HIGH QUALITY COLORS</li>
            <li>First off, I&#x27;m just amazed that I got my palette without even one eyeshadow damaged!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT PALETTE FOR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL USE.  </li>
            <li>Thank you sooo sooo much MissPinkCat for the fast and safe delivery.</li>
            <li>If Amazon wants to sell used makeup, FINE (although - is that even legal?!</li>
            <li>I rarely use it because although the colors are beautiful, they are hard to blend and are a bit to powdery for my liking.  </li>
            <li>how the second bottom tier slides out very easily and isn&#x27;t secured which can cause the shadows to crumble if hit or knocked over</li>
            <li>The product came fast and I was very pleased with the wide variety of colors.</li>
            <li>but it just needs to be marked that way so that those of us who DON&#x27;T want to purchase used products aren&#x27;t fooled into paying retail price for something we could get for free in exchange for a Mac brush on MakeupAlley.</li>
            <li>I am returning this and using the funds to contribute to the purchase of a higher quality palette.</li>
            <li>The box came in 8 days-a week ahead of the promised date and that too with NO BROKEN EYESHADOWS!</li>
            <li>All eye shadows are very pigmented and very comparable to the higher end shadows that I use at a fraction of the cost</li>
            <li>I really like NYX individual shadows as they are super soft, easy to blend, and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>As a make up artist this is must have palette, I have every shade on had all in one palette to create any look my client wants.</li>
            <li>I guess you really get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>the product was deliver in one peace, no broken eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I really like how there are a lot of colors to chose from in just one pallet.  </li>
            <li>colors are pretty and last the whole day.</li>
            <li>At first I was very excited to use all of the colors, but now i find myself hardly picking it up.  </li>
            <li>I am a dark-skinned WOC and to really get the shadows to pop, you have to really build up the color, but with a good base, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>I would much rather buy fewer colors from urban decay or mac instead of having this.</li>
            <li>she said \\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>Also, if I do not prime my eye first, the color hardly even shows up and comes off quickly.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;ve always been very well pigmented and long lasting without costing too much.</li>
            <li>Some colors are highly pigmented, but definitely not all.</li>
            <li>I would buy this again, but I doubt I&#x27;ll live that long.</li>
            <li>She wore it the other day and as we were getting ready to go to bed</li>
    </ol>

            <li> And yet, when it arrived, I opened it and the box was dinged, missing plastic wrap and bent and wobbly.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this eye palette for anyone who is obsessed with makeup but on a budget.</li>
            <li> The latch to it came in broke where it slips out by itself, and the pigmentation of the colors are mediocre.  </li>
            <li> You can not go wrong here!</li>
            <li> Disappointed to see dups of colors in it, shadows fade by noon and irritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> However some of the colors have terrible pigmentation.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have heard that nyx shadows are comparable to mac eyeshadows so I was happy when I found so many colors for such an inexpensive price.  After receiving the box I realized that mac and nyx are not similar at all.  At first I was very excited to use all of the colors, but now i find myself hardly picking it up.  I rarely use it because although the colors are beautiful, they are hard to blend and are a bit to powdery for my liking.  They are also not as pigmented as I had hoped they would be.  Also, some colors are richer in color than others that i have to keep dipping my brush into to even get any kind of color payoff on my eye.  I would only recommend this to someone who is not looking to spend a lot of money for a lot of colors.  I would much rather buy fewer colors from urban decay or mac instead of having this. Also, if I do not prime my eye first, the color hardly even shows up and comes off quickly. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I added this palette to my wish list directly from the NYX web site, and Amazon popped up telling me it had it for a very slightly lower price. \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; I thought to myself. \\&quot;It&#x27;s the same brand, both sold by NYX, but for some reason Amazon&#x27;s was cheaper. Yay saving money!\\&quot;  The palette was NOT listed as used. And yet, when it arrived, I opened it and the box was dinged, missing plastic wrap and bent and wobbly. About 25 percent of the pans had OBVIOUSLY been used and there were grease marks and fingerprints all over the place. If Amazon wants to sell used makeup, FINE (although - is that even legal?! Seems unsanitary) - but it just needs to be marked that way so that those of us who DON&#x27;T want to purchase used products aren&#x27;t fooled into paying retail price for something we could get for free in exchange for a Mac brush on MakeupAlley.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this eye palette for anyone who is obsessed with makeup but on a budget. great color selection with both matte and shimmery shades.</li>
            <li> I really like NYX individual shadows as they are super soft, easy to blend, and highly pigmented. I was hoping that this palette would be just as pigmented, but it isn&#x27;t. Some colors are highly pigmented, but definitely not all. I am a dark-skinned WOC and to really get the shadows to pop, you have to really build up the color, but with a good base, you should be fine. I definitely prefer the individual shadows to this set, but I don&#x27;t regret buying it. You get lots of shadows for the price and some can even be used as a blush.</li>
            <li> As a make up artist this is must have palette, I have every shade on had all in one palette to create any look my client wants. All eye shadows are very pigmented and very comparable to the higher end shadows that I use at a fraction of the cost and you get more product.The only complaint I have about this product is the packaging and how the second bottom tier slides out very easily and isn&#x27;t secured which can cause the shadows to crumble if hit or knocked over so I would keep in a safe storage like a train case. Other than that I cant complain I love this product and price!!!</li>
            <li> You can make ANY color with this set. I use a primer, so they lasted all day and were easy to remove at the end of the day. I would buy this again, but I doubt I&#x27;ll live that long. Very happy with this palette!</li>
            <li> I bought my wife this for Christmas and she was so happy. The amount of eye shadow colors is staggering, and it quickly became her favorite makeup.  She has spent quite an amount of time playing with it to see what colors look the best.  She wore it the other day and as we were getting ready to go to bed she said \\&quot;Wow my eye shadow is still on there and its not smeared all over the place.  I have never had eye shadow do that before\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I was honestly expecting more from this product. Most of the eye-shadows are very poorly pigmented. I guess you really get what you pay for. I am returning this and using the funds to contribute to the purchase of a higher quality palette.</li>
            <li> This is the motherload of colors! You can not go wrong here! I love the brand and love the choices! Price is wonderful... you will love this product!! If you are a make-up queen and love colors and variety then this is for you!!</li>
            <li> Received in excellent condition as non of the shadows were crushed in transit.  Love the variety of color...what a great buy!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS A GREAT PALETTE FOR PROFESSIONAL AND PERSONAL USE.  THE PALETTE OFFERS A GREAT VARIETY OF HIGH QUALITY COLORS</li>
            <li> I was excited to order NYX 112 Eyeshadows after reading the reviews. Disappointed to see dups of colors in it, shadows fade by noon and irritate my eyes. I think I&#x27;ll remain a MAC girl!</li>
            <li> The latch to it came in broke where it slips out by itself, and the pigmentation of the colors are mediocre.  Not surprised.  This is NYX make-up and not MAC.</li>
            <li> very happy with this eyeshadow. colors are pretty and last the whole day. the product was deliver in one peace, no broken eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> The product came fast and I was very pleased with the wide variety of colors. Recommend if you want nice makeup for a reasonable price.</li>

Mostly the light browns and those sort of colors.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely use primer, and even then it isn&#x27;t the best.&lt;br /&gt;But some of the colors are great, and there are so many :)</li>
            <li> I am a fan of NYX products and was excited to order this palette...when I opened it I was pleased with the Color choices., but wouldn&#x27;t say it was indeed 112 different shades.  Most of the shades appear to be dupes...my only other bone to pick is the case...the bottom half constantly slides out.  I use primer and cream shadows as a base for these shadows and pleased with the wear.  The Color choices are nice and have a great mix of natural, brights, shimmers, and mattes! I recommend this brand to anyone who enjoys make up artistry.</li>
            <li> Multi shades of colours! and a lot cheaper with 112 colours!Totally fab! As mua I&#x27;m truly happy that I ordered this :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks amazon!&lt;br /&gt;Xoxo</li>
            <li> First off, I&#x27;m just amazed that I got my palette without even one eyeshadow damaged! I live in India and i was pretty sure that when I receive it, there&#x27;s gonna be AT LEAST 4 to 5 pieces broken and spilled all over the box as some people had complained and shared images about. I was mentally prepared and consoling myself silently. The box came in 8 days-a week ahead of the promised date and that too with NO BROKEN EYESHADOWS! Thank you sooo sooo much MissPinkCat for the fast and safe delivery. As for the set...I just love it..I am an eyeshadow lover and this just makes me sooo happy. Even my cousins were in awe. I think the pigmentation is fine for me as I&#x27;m no makeup expert, the stronger ones are awesome and the lighter ones will do with a damp applicator. The case though seems just a lil flimsy when you pull it out. But apart from that, for me, it has all the colours and all textures for different occasions and looks and its gonna last me a long time too. So no complaints at all! ^____^</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sister&#x27;s birthday, and she loved it. The colors are bright and nice and it arrived undamaged. The only thing about this I didn&#x27;t like is that the bottom tray of colors are not secured, no latch or anything to prevent the tray from sliding out, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for traveling.</li>
            <li> Love the large variety of colors but the second tray of bright colors you do have to apply more than once. Wouldve been nice if they were more pigmented.</li>
            <li> I love these shadows.  They are quality shadows and cover every color I need.  There are generous supply of each color.  Additionally, there are some colors that are sparkling.  I use them every day.</li>
            <li> I really like how there are a lot of colors to chose from in just one pallet.  I have several Nyx eye shadows and they&#x27;ve always been very well pigmented and long lasting without costing too much.</li>
