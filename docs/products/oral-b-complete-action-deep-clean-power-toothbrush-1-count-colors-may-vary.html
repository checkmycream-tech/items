            <li>I got one and loved it</li>
            <li>It oscillates and that can be proven by putting on some good glasses and watching the frayed bristles stay to one side during operation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you for a really good product.  </li>
            <li>I bough this toothbrush and loved it.  </li>

            <li>I am very happy to have this one because it&#x27;s so convenient and replacement heads are readily available.</li>
            <li>Have the deluxe model at home, but this is great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Good battery life.</li>
            <li>It did what it said it would when it said it would for a good price and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>I ORDERED THESE 2 ITEMS BECAUSE I FEEL GOOD WITH THEIR &amp;#34;JOB&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and good</li>
            <li>I was very impressed with the power and how clean my teeth felt after using the brush.</li>
            <li>Strong vibration i like it !!</li>
            <li>how, this is a great toothbrush, the price is good, and its performance is outstanding.</li>
            <li>the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush, I have been using it for years and have no complain !</li>
            <li>It works great, and its easy to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It fits nicely in your hand, does a great&lt;br /&gt;Job</li>
            <li>and I liked this.</li>
            <li>I bought 1 to try it out and have bought 3 more for the rest of the family because I loved it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it is getting close to time to replace the brush head but not until I cannot effectively get the job done .</li>
            <li>To be honest I have a love/hate relationship with the cover for this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>The motor is very strong and it doesn&#x27;t feel any weaker than the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li>Pretty good!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice that feature when I bought it, but it works fine, which still makes it a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Very grateful ~ Very good</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is very good and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It would be a great and useful gift.</li>
            <li>I love this Oral b toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;To brush more often because of it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Handy feel and vigorous brushing capabilities.</li>
            <li>I am using this toothbrush for more than 6 months now.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothbrush for almost 6 months now and love it.  </li>
            <li>I am better off using my manual brush.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love it</li>
            <li>I was going to get better results.</li>
            <li>Oral-B version is another outstanding product.</li>
            <li>For the price, there simply isn&#x27;t a better power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok brush for start up.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>This was something I just bought for the heck of it but am really glad that I did.  </li>
            <li>SATISFIED :)  </li>
            <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>I do not understand the need to spend $30 or $50 or more when you can have this one under $10 in most stores.</li>
            <li>Just love it.</li>
            <li>Great toothbrush that really works well for cleaning your teeth and gum line.</li>
            <li>What more can a mom ask for?  </li>
            <li>cant expect more for a $7 brush consuming one AA per 2-week for one like me who sometimes brush once a day but sometimes more than 4-5times.</li>
            <li>Was able to purchase way below retail even bought the replacement heads</li>
            <li>still,, worth every penny and made well,, sturdy and does a pretty good dental experience !</li>
            <li>So far so good, price was good and was available with free shipping.</li>
            <li>I expected the best quality.</li>
            <li>LIGHT WEIGHT- WOULD BE OKAY FOR KIDS TO USE IT TOO.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not the magic bullet to keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li>Replacing the brush&#x27;s head is also really easy.  </li>
            <li>OR HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO REPLACE THEM.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The AA battery lasts easily a month.</li>
            <li>You can clean most of the mechanism (some of it is inaccessible under the handle), but the bacteria returs very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Strong cleaning machine.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this item to anyone who is looking for an electric tooth brush, but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li>This one is far superior as it moves in more than one direction.</li>
            <li>However it is better then the old fashioned kind that most people used to use and probably still do.</li>
            <li>Consider me a huge fan.</li>
            <li>It takes just one AA battery which is available just about anywhere and the brush heads can be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But beware, you can&#x27;t use cheap batteries in this brush.  </li>
            <li>I got this for 3 bucks from local publix and its working great...</li>
            <li>love this brand you get your moneys worth</li>
            <li>That being said, this is a cheap product, so for the price I can&#x27;t complain at all.</li>
            <li>If that is an important feature for you, this toothbrush will disappoint.</li>
            <li>This thing works great only if you use a eneloop/imedion  2400mah battery..</li>
            <li>the toothbrush package is missing this tool, even of you don&#x27;t plan to routinely switch brush heads since it&#x27;s best to remove the brush head after each use since this would facilitate drying.  </li>
            <li>So not only am I saving money and getting a great toothbrush for my family, but I&#x27;m also saving at the dentist too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and</li>
            <li>Simple and does a great job.</li>
            <li>Replacement heads are available.</li>
            <li>Enjoy the feel of the toothbrush in mouth, seems to target each area.  </li>
            <li>The heads are cheap to replace, too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several of these now from the local supermarket, and while the brushes do a great of job of cleaning and are a great value, I&#x27;ve had to throw them all away within a year.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially, the brush works well and remains easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The price was fantastic</li>
            <li>His suggestion was to get a cheap one first to see if I like using a power toothbrush better than brushing, and if so I should consider upgrading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s full of thoughtful and fantastic features.</li>
            <li>if this can do that well with something so totally unnatural and aggressively insistent on sticking like concrete, imagine what it can do with a diet of real honest to god food!  ;</li>
            <li>I originally bought the \\&quot;Oral-B CrossAction Toothbrush\\&quot; on a recommendation from a friend who works in a dentist office.  </li>
            <li>and so far I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Better than the simple non-powered ones..that is for sure!</li>
            <li>The first time I bought a battery operated toothbrush many years ago it was an Oral-B.</li>
            <li>Best I can say is its better by far than the Arm &amp; Hammer and other cheapies including</li>
            <li>This toothbrush works very well; I&#x27;m extremely happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>I have decided against having a hygienist clean my teeth now.  </li>
            <li>Do I notice that I do not have to brush in order to get clean?</li>
            <li>brush has plenty of power and leaves your teeth feeling silky clean.</li>
            <li>Requires cleaning/sterilization to keep parts clean.</li>
            <li>I specially like the 2 way cleaning&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I just might go back to a good manual brush and be done with it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Below are some reasons why I think this specific brush is a good buy:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li>It uses a smaller battery and is very light and fits my hand better.</li>
            <li>While writing this review now from my main hall i could hear the noise from bathroom which is like 15-20 feet away from me :)</li>
            <li>It also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Granted it has lost some effectiveness in removing the plaque from my teeth so effectively so quickly since then</li>
            <li>this toothbrush arrived quickly but did not work.</li>
            <li>The first time she used it, I had no idea what to think, because all I heard was a buzzing sound from the bathroom.</li>
            <li>Used it and it is ok,, but not as effective as the battery powered other Oral B style......</li>
            <li>(I have large hands) and is maneuvered easily.</li>
            <li>Yea I could buy the more expensive toothbrushes for over 100 dollars, but this one works just great for me and keeps my teeth and gums very clean.</li>
            <li>Takes less room but still does a great job.</li>
            <li>It is pretty noisy so if you are trying to be quiet or something then this would not be good, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>But I can say that this brush does a pretty fair job when I do what I should and even when I don&#x27;t and after using the brush to loosen the stuff and then using the dental tool to loosen what&#x27;s left and then brushing again..</li>
            <li>It is a good device for lazy me :-)</li>
            <li>good, thanks, i will bus new one in future, hope it more cheaper than this time.</li>
            <li>This electric tooth brush is affordable yet powerful.</li>
            <li>It uses AA batteries and will run for over 1 month with a fresh power source</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it,buy it now.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li>Best kept secret in the &#x27;battery powered&#x27; brush family.</li>
            <li>This toothbrush is much better than my old colgate battery one.  </li>
            <li>I was so impressed never owning anything other than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Since standing up is important in an electric toothbrush for me,  I would not buy this particular one again.</li>
            <li>I really like how clean my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a slightly less pleasant experience when you replace the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the single battery is powerful enough to make the brush vibrate at a strong pace.</li>
            <li>Bought it for a friend , since I have just the same and strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The brush worked perfectly with no issues until I misplaced it during a recent move.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bugged me a bit was when I first used it, that anti-microbial part has a taste to it, particularly if you rinse the head with warm or hot water.</li>
            <li>It works better than a traditional toothbrush</li>
            <li>My wife asked if I was using an electric razor the first time I used this thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll probably pay more next time for a higher level product.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoy the massaging action on my gums</li>
            <li>This is the first electric toothbrush that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s only better with the antimicrobial protection.  </li>
            <li>An electric toothbrush is a product that&#x27;s so much better than your basic manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>At first use, my teeth felt noticeably cleaner (and that&#x27;s an understatement).</li>
            <li>This was my first powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>fill the pores in exposed roots to reduce their sensitivity to hot and cold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>fill the pores in exposed roots to reduce their sensitivity to hot and cold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just used this brush last night and it&#x27;s everythign and more that we hoped for.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I would spend more on a toothbrush is if it had a water pick or something like that.</li>
            <li>This model was our first powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li>When it came time to replace the brush head, Oral-B happened to be running a $3 off special, causing this new toothbrush to be cheaper than the Spinbrush replacement head, so I figured, why not, and bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to upgrade to a more professional toothbrush or not, simply because this CrossAction has been doing a wonderful job for me so far.  </li>
            <li>fault that I am not the most consistent in doing what I should and that I&#x27;m on a diet that uses a powdered supplement in place of actual food that I swear has started using concrete in the formula the way it&#x27;s started sticking to my teeth!  </li>
            <li>I have used it since I received it, the brush head is bigger than the product I got while ago, more like the regular brush, made it a lot easy to use.</li>
            <li>This is just as good as the more expensive Sonic Care brand.  </li>
            <li>After that, keeping it clean by soaking/agitating in hydrogen peroxide is simple and quick.</li>
            <li>Very much and very noisy, as drill.</li>
            <li>For this, all I can say is 3 months in my Oral-B Complete Action is still going strong.</li>
            <li>My dentist wants me to use a power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>I find it to be the modern day toothbrush that everyone should have.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel so much cleaner with this toothbrush than they have ever felt before.  </li>
            <li>I have to wonder if these things existed when I was a kid if I would have so much metal in my mouth.</li>
            <li>: It makes so much of noise.</li>
            <li>Just a couple minutes with gentle to no pressure.  </li>
            <li>but I do not bother going to brick and mortar places anymore unless absolutely needed.</li>
            <li>I just finished using mine and my teeth feel so smooth when I push my tongue against them back and</li>
            <li>IT CLEANS VERY WELL.</li>
            <li>AT HOW MUCH</li>
            <li>Very</li>
            <li>IT HELPS KEEPING THE DENTIST AWAY , AND IS VERY USEFULL FOR GUMS YN</li>
            <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>so I stopped using it much until I needed sensodyne..</li>
            <li>so I stopped using it much until I needed sensodyne..</li>
            <li>It cleans very well</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>However I am still very disappoint to not have a cover, not just in terms of protection for traveling.</li>
            <li>I really like it though.  </li>
            <li>really clutter things up.</li>
            <li>Quality brush, dentist loves it, shipped fast.</li>
            <li>this thing is fast...</li>
            <li>This is going to be as good as a more expensive professional powered toothbrush kit</li>
            <li>And no the tip does not rotate but it is very effective to get behind the lower bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li>Using this product gives my mouth an overall clean feel.</li>
            <li>The toothbrush does not fit into your normal toothbrush stand and it does not stand on its own.</li>
            <li>has become more thorough than with a conventional brush.</li>
            <li>I had an older Oral B</li>
            <li>Has a decent weight to it</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>i had high hopes for this toothbrush; it got rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>i especially like being able to get a good massage behind my last molars.</li>
            <li>I would encourage everyone to embrace using the modern day motorized oral b toothbrushes and recycle your old toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li>Simple, practical, useful.</li>
            <li>: Its not hard on gums...</li>
            <li>I immediately started using my new toothbrush which i purchased because of the reviews i read.</li>
            <li>It does the job but would be better if it did not sound so loud.</li>
            <li>it is just very loud.</li>
            <li>fantastic value for a long lasting (changeable batteries), high performance teeth cleaning and gum health tool- buy with confidence.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S LAST LONGER THAN MOST OTHER BATTERY OPERATED TOOTHBRUSHES.  </li>
            <li>This was waaaay too loud!</li>
            <li>I was using the Spinbrush for about a year and a half, and it was working fine.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to get filled with gross things as long as it is rinsed.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this is a Grumpy Old Man moment, but do we really need electronics to accomplish basic oral hygiene?</li>
            <li>Well, I will never waste my money on another battery operated toothbrush unless it is made by Oral-</li>
            <li>Plus this thing is loud.</li>
            <li>Cleaning action is so so</li>
            <li>Throw in a rechargeable battery and replace the heads frequently.  </li>
            <li>I was expecting stronger brush action.</li>
            <li>My mouth feels so much cleaner using this than a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>Because this toothbrush uses only 1 battery, it is also much lighter than the Spinbrush</li>
            <li>It took me a while to stop my manual \\&quot;brushing movement\\&quot; since it comes so naturally.</li>
            <li>This purchase replaced three year old units.  </li>
            <li>It is really big and very noisy.</li>
            <li>This brush is just as good as the expensive electric toothbrush we had.  </li>
            <li>OKAY, THE QUALITY OF THE PLASTIC IS NOT VERY GREAT, BUT</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think something that is LIQUID wouldn&#x27;t stick particularly since I vigorously rinse my mouth and teeth with water several times after drinking the stuff, but Noooo</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line your teeth will be brushed clean but without the cap the brush picks up other germs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, especially to replace manual brushing.</li>
            <li>I have been using this toothbrush for a long time and it really holds its charge.</li>
            <li>This is my first electric toothbrush, purchased roughly 5 months ago.</li>
            <li>had some concerns with power, since Spinbrush uses 2 AA batteries, and Oral-B Complete Action uses only 1.</li>
            <li>Overall good as long as the power failure is not due to an internal fault.</li>
            <li>The head size is decent but not too large for little mouths.</li>
            <li>If they jab you in your gums or clean excessively</li>
            <li>I also purchased the 15.00 stainless steel dental tools here on Amazon and used the scaler tool to clean behind my bottom front teeth.  </li>
            <li>I did not want to pay too much for something i had hardly any knowledge on &amp; after my first use</li>
            <li>Do I notice my teeth any cleaner than when I brushed &amp;#34;the old fashioned way&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li>Regular brushing, flossing and mouthwash cannot replace the power brushing action.</li>
            <li>every getting off my teeth short of a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Buy the extra heads and swap out after every visit to your dentist for professional cleaning.</li>
            <li>However, normally my Spinbrush battery lasts about 6 months before dying, so it remains to be seen whether Oral-B&#x27;s battery life is as long as Spinbrush&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li>I came back to Amazon and purchased a replacement only to realize upon delivery that this new version did not come with a cover.</li>
            <li>It seems a little noisy at first...</li>
            <li>The first time, I did use a toothpick to remove some dried toothpaste, but that&#x27;s my fault since I was clueless about toothbrush hygiene.</li>
            <li>It is too bad because I loved this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I got one and loved it</li>
            <li> It oscillates and that can be proven by putting on some good glasses and watching the frayed bristles stay to one side during operation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you for a really good product.  </li>
            <li> I bough this toothbrush and loved it.  </li>

            <li> Good battery life.</li>
            <li> It did what it said it would when it said it would for a good price and in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THESE 2 ITEMS BECAUSE I FEEL GOOD WITH THEIR &amp;#34;JOB&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and good</li>
            <li> I was very impressed with the power and how clean my teeth felt after using the brush.</li>
            <li> Strong vibration i like it !!</li>
            <li> how, this is a great toothbrush, the price is good, and its performance is outstanding.</li>
            <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, I have been using it for years and have no complain !</li>
            <li> It works great, and its easy to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It fits nicely in your hand, does a great&lt;br /&gt;Job</li>
            <li> and I liked this.</li>
            <li> I bought 1 to try it out and have bought 3 more for the rest of the family because I loved it so much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it is getting close to time to replace the brush head but not until I cannot effectively get the job done .</li>
            <li> To be honest I have a love/hate relationship with the cover for this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> The motor is very strong and it doesn&#x27;t feel any weaker than the Spinbrush.</li>
            <li> Pretty good!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice that feature when I bought it, but it works fine, which still makes it a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Very grateful ~ Very good</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very good and very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It would be a great and useful gift.</li>
            <li> I love this Oral b toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;To brush more often because of it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Handy feel and vigorous brushing capabilities.</li>
            <li> I am using this toothbrush for more than 6 months now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for almost 6 months now and love it.  </li>
            <li> I am better off using my manual brush.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love it</li>
            <li> I was going to get better results.</li>
            <li> Oral-B version is another outstanding product.</li>
            <li> For the price, there simply isn&#x27;t a better power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok brush for start up.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> This was something I just bought for the heck of it but am really glad that I did.  </li>
            <li> SATISFIED :)  </li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I do not understand the need to spend $30 or $50 or more when you can have this one under $10 in most stores.</li>
            <li> Just love it.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush that really works well for cleaning your teeth and gum line.</li>
            <li> What more can a mom ask for?  </li>
            <li> cant expect more for a $7 brush consuming one AA per 2-week for one like me who sometimes brush once a day but sometimes more than 4-5times.</li>
            <li> Was able to purchase way below retail even bought the replacement heads</li>
            <li> still,, worth every penny and made well,, sturdy and does a pretty good dental experience !</li>
            <li> So far so good, price was good and was available with free shipping.</li>
            <li> I expected the best quality.</li>
            <li> LIGHT WEIGHT- WOULD BE OKAY FOR KIDS TO USE IT TOO.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not the magic bullet to keeping your teeth clean.</li>
            <li> Replacing the brush&#x27;s head is also really easy.  </li>
            <li> OR HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO REPLACE THEM.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The AA battery lasts easily a month.</li>
            <li> You can clean most of the mechanism (some of it is inaccessible under the handle), but the bacteria returs very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Strong cleaning machine.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this item to anyone who is looking for an electric tooth brush, but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> This one is far superior as it moves in more than one direction.</li>
            <li> However it is better then the old fashioned kind that most people used to use and probably still do.</li>
            <li> Consider me a huge fan.</li>
            <li> It takes just one AA battery which is available just about anywhere and the brush heads can be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But beware, you can&#x27;t use cheap batteries in this brush.  </li>
            <li> I got this for 3 bucks from local publix and its working great...</li>
            <li> love this brand you get your moneys worth</li>
            <li> That being said, this is a cheap product, so for the price I can&#x27;t complain at all.</li>
            <li> If that is an important feature for you, this toothbrush will disappoint.</li>
            <li> This thing works great only if you use a eneloop/imedion  2400mah battery..</li>
            <li> the toothbrush package is missing this tool, even of you don&#x27;t plan to routinely switch brush heads since it&#x27;s best to remove the brush head after each use since this would facilitate drying.  </li>
            <li> So not only am I saving money and getting a great toothbrush for my family, but I&#x27;m also saving at the dentist too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and</li>
            <li> Simple and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Replacement heads are available.</li>
            <li> Enjoy the feel of the toothbrush in mouth, seems to target each area.  </li>
            <li> The heads are cheap to replace, too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several of these now from the local supermarket, and while the brushes do a great of job of cleaning and are a great value, I&#x27;ve had to throw them all away within a year.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially, the brush works well and remains easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The price was fantastic</li>
            <li> His suggestion was to get a cheap one first to see if I like using a power toothbrush better than brushing, and if so I should consider upgrading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s full of thoughtful and fantastic features.</li>
            <li> if this can do that well with something so totally unnatural and aggressively insistent on sticking like concrete, imagine what it can do with a diet of real honest to god food!  ;</li>
            <li> I originally bought the \\&quot;Oral-B CrossAction Toothbrush\\&quot; on a recommendation from a friend who works in a dentist office.  </li>
            <li> and so far I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Better than the simple non-powered ones..that is for sure!</li>
            <li> The first time I bought a battery operated toothbrush many years ago it was an Oral-B.</li>
            <li> Best I can say is its better by far than the Arm &amp; Hammer and other cheapies including</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well; I&#x27;m extremely happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I have decided against having a hygienist clean my teeth now.  </li>
            <li> Do I notice that I do not have to brush in order to get clean?</li>
            <li> brush has plenty of power and leaves your teeth feeling silky clean.</li>
            <li> Requires cleaning/sterilization to keep parts clean.</li>
            <li> I specially like the 2 way cleaning&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I just might go back to a good manual brush and be done with it.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Below are some reasons why I think this specific brush is a good buy:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> It uses a smaller battery and is very light and fits my hand better.</li>
            <li> While writing this review now from my main hall i could hear the noise from bathroom which is like 15-20 feet away from me :)</li>
            <li> It also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Granted it has lost some effectiveness in removing the plaque from my teeth so effectively so quickly since then</li>
            <li> this toothbrush arrived quickly but did not work.</li>
            <li> The first time she used it, I had no idea what to think, because all I heard was a buzzing sound from the bathroom.</li>
            <li> Used it and it is ok,, but not as effective as the battery powered other Oral B style......</li>
            <li> (I have large hands) and is maneuvered easily.</li>
            <li> Yea I could buy the more expensive toothbrushes for over 100 dollars, but this one works just great for me and keeps my teeth and gums very clean.</li>
            <li> Takes less room but still does a great job.</li>
            <li> It is pretty noisy so if you are trying to be quiet or something then this would not be good, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> But I can say that this brush does a pretty fair job when I do what I should and even when I don&#x27;t and after using the brush to loosen the stuff and then using the dental tool to loosen what&#x27;s left and then brushing again..</li>
            <li> It is a good device for lazy me :-)</li>
            <li> good, thanks, i will bus new one in future, hope it more cheaper than this time.</li>
            <li> This electric tooth brush is affordable yet powerful.</li>
            <li> It uses AA batteries and will run for over 1 month with a fresh power source</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it,buy it now.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Is it worth it?  </li>
            <li> Best kept secret in the &#x27;battery powered&#x27; brush family.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much better than my old colgate battery one.  </li>
            <li> I was so impressed never owning anything other than a regular toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Since standing up is important in an electric toothbrush for me,  I would not buy this particular one again.</li>
            <li> I really like how clean my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a slightly less pleasant experience when you replace the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the single battery is powerful enough to make the brush vibrate at a strong pace.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend , since I have just the same and strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> The brush worked perfectly with no issues until I misplaced it during a recent move.</li>
            <li> The only thing that bugged me a bit was when I first used it, that anti-microbial part has a taste to it, particularly if you rinse the head with warm or hot water.</li>
            <li> It works better than a traditional toothbrush</li>
            <li> My wife asked if I was using an electric razor the first time I used this thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably pay more next time for a higher level product.</li>
            <li> and I really enjoy the massaging action on my gums</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush that I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s only better with the antimicrobial protection.  </li>
            <li> An electric toothbrush is a product that&#x27;s so much better than your basic manual toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> At first use, my teeth felt noticeably cleaner (and that&#x27;s an understatement).</li>
            <li> This was my first powered toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> fill the pores in exposed roots to reduce their sensitivity to hot and cold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> fill the pores in exposed roots to reduce their sensitivity to hot and cold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just used this brush last night and it&#x27;s everythign and more that we hoped for.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I would spend more on a toothbrush is if it had a water pick or something like that.</li>
            <li> This model was our first powered toothbrush.</li>
            <li> When it came time to replace the brush head, Oral-B happened to be running a $3 off special, causing this new toothbrush to be cheaper than the Spinbrush replacement head, so I figured, why not, and bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to upgrade to a more professional toothbrush or not, simply because this CrossAction has been doing a wonderful job for me so far.  </li>
            <li> fault that I am not the most consistent in doing what I should and that I&#x27;m on a diet that uses a powdered supplement in place of actual food that I swear has started using concrete in the formula the way it&#x27;s started sticking to my teeth!  </li>
            <li> I have used it since I received it, the brush head is bigger than the product I got while ago, more like the regular brush, made it a lot easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the more expensive Sonic Care brand.  </li>
            <li> After that, keeping it clean by soaking/agitating in hydrogen peroxide is simple and quick.</li>
            <li> Very much and very noisy, as drill.</li>
            <li> For this, all I can say is 3 months in my Oral-B Complete Action is still going strong.</li>
            <li> My dentist wants me to use a power toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> I find it to be the modern day toothbrush that everyone should have.</li>
            <li> My teeth feel so much cleaner with this toothbrush than they have ever felt before.  </li>
            <li> I have to wonder if these things existed when I was a kid if I would have so much metal in my mouth.</li>
            <li> : It makes so much of noise.</li>
            <li> Just a couple minutes with gentle to no pressure.  </li>
            <li> but I do not bother going to brick and mortar places anymore unless absolutely needed.</li>
            <li> I just finished using mine and my teeth feel so smooth when I push my tongue against them back and</li>
            <li> IT CLEANS VERY WELL.</li>
            <li> AT HOW MUCH</li>
            <li> Very</li>
            <li> IT HELPS KEEPING THE DENTIST AWAY , AND IS VERY USEFULL FOR GUMS YN</li>
            <li> Reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it much until I needed sensodyne..</li>
            <li> so I stopped using it much until I needed sensodyne..</li>
            <li> It cleans very well</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> However I am still very disappoint to not have a cover, not just in terms of protection for traveling.</li>
            <li> I really like it though.  </li>
            <li> really clutter things up.</li>
            <li> Quality brush, dentist loves it, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> this thing is fast...</li>
            <li> This is going to be as good as a more expensive professional powered toothbrush kit</li>
            <li> And no the tip does not rotate but it is very effective to get behind the lower bottom teeth.  </li>
            <li> Using this product gives my mouth an overall clean feel.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush does not fit into your normal toothbrush stand and it does not stand on its own.</li>
            <li> has become more thorough than with a conventional brush.</li>
            <li> I had an older Oral B</li>
            <li> Has a decent weight to it</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> i had high hopes for this toothbrush; it got rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> i especially like being able to get a good massage behind my last molars.</li>
            <li> I would encourage everyone to embrace using the modern day motorized oral b toothbrushes and recycle your old toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> Simple, practical, useful.</li>
            <li> : Its not hard on gums...</li>
            <li> I immediately started using my new toothbrush which i purchased because of the reviews i read.</li>
            <li> It does the job but would be better if it did not sound so loud.</li>
            <li> it is just very loud.</li>
            <li> fantastic value for a long lasting (changeable batteries), high performance teeth cleaning and gum health tool- buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S LAST LONGER THAN MOST OTHER BATTERY OPERATED TOOTHBRUSHES.  </li>
            <li> This was waaaay too loud!</li>
            <li> I was using the Spinbrush for about a year and a half, and it was working fine.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to get filled with gross things as long as it is rinsed.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this is a Grumpy Old Man moment, but do we really need electronics to accomplish basic oral hygiene?</li>
            <li> Well, I will never waste my money on another battery operated toothbrush unless it is made by Oral-</li>
            <li> Plus this thing is loud.</li>
            <li> Cleaning action is so so</li>
            <li> Throw in a rechargeable battery and replace the heads frequently.  </li>
            <li> I was expecting stronger brush action.</li>
            <li> My mouth feels so much cleaner using this than a regular toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> Because this toothbrush uses only 1 battery, it is also much lighter than the Spinbrush</li>
            <li> It took me a while to stop my manual \\&quot;brushing movement\\&quot; since it comes so naturally.</li>
            <li> This purchase replaced three year old units.  </li>
            <li> It is really big and very noisy.</li>
            <li> This brush is just as good as the expensive electric toothbrush we had.  </li>
            <li> OKAY, THE QUALITY OF THE PLASTIC IS NOT VERY GREAT, BUT</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think something that is LIQUID wouldn&#x27;t stick particularly since I vigorously rinse my mouth and teeth with water several times after drinking the stuff, but Noooo</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line your teeth will be brushed clean but without the cap the brush picks up other germs.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, especially to replace manual brushing.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for a long time and it really holds its charge.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, purchased roughly 5 months ago.</li>
            <li> had some concerns with power, since Spinbrush uses 2 AA batteries, and Oral-B Complete Action uses only 1.</li>
            <li> Overall good as long as the power failure is not due to an internal fault.</li>
            <li> The head size is decent but not too large for little mouths.</li>
            <li> If they jab you in your gums or clean excessively</li>
            <li> I also purchased the 15.00 stainless steel dental tools here on Amazon and used the scaler tool to clean behind my bottom front teeth.  </li>
            <li> I did not want to pay too much for something i had hardly any knowledge on &amp; after my first use</li>
            <li> Do I notice my teeth any cleaner than when I brushed &amp;#34;the old fashioned way&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> Regular brushing, flossing and mouthwash cannot replace the power brushing action.</li>
            <li> every getting off my teeth short of a professional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Buy the extra heads and swap out after every visit to your dentist for professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> However, normally my Spinbrush battery lasts about 6 months before dying, so it remains to be seen whether Oral-B&#x27;s battery life is as long as Spinbrush&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over</li>
            <li> I came back to Amazon and purchased a replacement only to realize upon delivery that this new version did not come with a cover.</li>
            <li> It seems a little noisy at first...</li>
            <li> The first time, I did use a toothpick to remove some dried toothpaste, but that&#x27;s my fault since I was clueless about toothbrush hygiene.</li>
            <li> It is too bad because I loved this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did what it said it would when it said it would for a good price and in a timely manner.er on it, and it isn&#x27;t noticeable and if you use toothpaste (I hate the stuff and use it rarely and only in small amounts as it foams and gags me, and dentist said it wasn&#x27;t something that was necessary, water worked just as well..</li>
            <li> The only minor issue is that it definitely doesn&#x27;t have the strongest motor in the toothbrush head.</li>
            <li> Why buy far more expensive sets when this brush does it all - and for much less cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m reviewing this now (after so long) is my three children, all of whom have been using these brushes nearly as long as I, just got back from a cleaning/check-up with no cavities...again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned that there is no timer, but that is a minor annoyance.</li>
            <li> One in a long line of Oral-B toothbrushes.  </li>
            <li> , it lasted for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> and it was getting long in the tooth (pardon the pun).</li>
            <li> I am amazed on how long the battery lasts on this brush.  </li>
            <li> I chose the former since I didn&#x27;t want to have to drive back to UPS a second time if the replacement unit was also missing the tool.  </li>
            <li> With these you get the vigorous round action combined with the criss-cross brushes and the results</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for a long time now.</li>
            <li> Single battery lasts quite a long time-months.  </li>
            <li> they want only 110 volts, for use in the UK or India, or any other country that uses 220V</li>
            <li> The brush uses only one AA battery, which makes the handle slimmer than other battery powered brush that uses 2 * AA.</li>
            <li> For everyday brushing though, I would go with a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> So don&#x27;t use hot water on it, and it isn&#x27;t noticeable and if you use toothpaste (I hate the stuff and use it rarely and only in small amounts as it foams and gags me, and dentist said it wasn&#x27;t something that was necessary, water worked just as well..</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this toothbrush back in 2013.</li>
            <li> if i could mount this bad boy to my 98 gmc truck, i could sure get to work a lot quicker.</li>
            <li> but you have to be careful doing that because you can bend a bristol.  </li>
            <li> The problem is that because of the size it will not fit in the traditional toothbrush holder.</li>
            <li> the rack is empty.</li>
            <li> I will buy other model.</li>
            <li> I use one of this for 2 years, until the motor fail and I was very satisfice with it!  </li>
            <li> Then I noticed that customers who bought this toothbrush also bought the Guy Fieri Gourmet 14-Piece Triple Riveted Cutlery Set, so I bought that also, and I must say, these two purchases indeed complement each other.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t have replacement heads though, and I feel guilty that I&#x27;ll have to throw the whole thing out in a couple months.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that I wish they came in assorted colors.  </li>
            <li> He overheard me talking about buying one of the more expensive brands they sell at the dentist office, but I was being skeptical about dropping a lot of money one on.  </li>
            <li> so it is less tiring to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed mine in 5 months, but can tell it is slightly less</li>
            <li> The bristles aren&#x27;t too hard, it&#x27;s not excessively loud</li>
            <li> and I like the little plastic cap that it comes with for protecting the bristles from germs.</li>
            <li> but I can use a little shaking up.  </li>
            <li> All of them were missing the brush removal tool in their packaging.  </li>
            <li> BTW, as of this date the replacement brushes are not available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> (picture showed a green battery cap</li>
            <li> I am using for few years now.  </li>
            <li> We bought them initially just to try since other models were sooo expensive.</li>
            <li> I hope it lasts a really long time; but if it doesn&#x27;t last, at least it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;  Very less price</li>
            <li> Going slowly across my teeth was an odd sensation.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> It has also helps manage my gum and teeth sensitivities (I&#x27;m not exactly sure why, but it does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much more one could say about it.  </li>
            <li> Not much more one could say about it.  </li>
            <li> I have a small bathroom and cables</li>
            <li> Right now it&#x27;s sitting stupidly in a coffee mug.</li>
            <li> For being under $10 its hard to justify not staying with it.  </li>
            <li> It gets in hard to reach places</li>
            <li> /&gt;One complaint.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> Never had a chance to try the toothbrush since the tool to remove the head was missing making it a useless travel toothbrush if we wanted to interchange heads.  </li>
            <li> Worst case scenario, it&#x27;s a loss of only a few dollars.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I had even tried scraping it off with that, and no joy.  </li>
            <li> After a while, there is visible bacteria growth behind the replaceable bristles in the mechanism that moves the brush head.  </li>
            <li> Although, after few days of use the power has gone bad, I wonder why, maybe because of the batteries.</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try one, but was skeptical about the advertised benefits of costly electric toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> so well we stopped looking at the expensive versions.</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush....not expensive and gets into allthe &amp;#34;nooks and crannies&amp;#34;  It also does not take up alot of room on&lt;br /&gt;my sink counter;</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe Oral-B&#x27;s tv ads because their portrayed use is impossible.</li>
            <li> , sometimes it is crowded, then you have to wait in line to pay, the weather may be bad etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate having to find a parking space</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent for my sons.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist recommended this, I never even knew they existed until she told me about them.  It works great, and its easy to use.</li>
            <li> Family loves these.  Strong cleaning machine.</li>
            <li> I like this toothbrush it is just very loud. It does the job but would be better if it did not sound so loud.</li>
            <li> My dentist wants me to use a power toothbrush.  I have the Oral-B electric ones, but the chargers are a pain to take with you.  Also if going overseas they want only 110 volts, for use in the UK or India, or any other country that uses 220V you have to carry a transformer.  These battery operated toothbrushes are great. It takes just one AA battery which is available just about anywhere and the brush heads can be changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned that there is no timer, but that is a minor annoyance.</li>
            <li> This brush works great and I like the little plastic cap that it comes with for protecting the bristles from germs. It is pretty noisy so if you are trying to be quiet or something then this would not be good, but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. I change the batteries (using rechargeables)every time I replace the bristle head and have never had a problem with loss of power.</li>
            <li> This electric tooth brush is affordable yet powerful. It uses AA batteries and will run for over 1 month with a fresh power source</li>
            <li> I love this Oral b toothbrush.  I find it to be the modern day toothbrush that everyone should have. It is not the magic bullet to keeping your teeth clean. However it is better then the old fashioned kind that most people used to use and probably still do. I would encourage everyone to embrace using the modern day motorized oral b toothbrushes and recycle your old toothbrushes.  Please do</li>
            <li> One in a long line of Oral-B toothbrushes.  We just replace periodically.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; good product</li>
            <li> I originally bought the \\&quot;Oral-B CrossAction Toothbrush\\&quot; on a recommendation from a friend who works in a dentist office.  He overheard me talking about buying one of the more expensive brands they sell at the dentist office, but I was being skeptical about dropping a lot of money one on.  His suggestion was to get a cheap one first to see if I like using a power toothbrush better than brushing, and if so I should consider upgrading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this advice, I went out and bought the CrossAction and so far I am very satisfied.  My teeth feel so much cleaner with this toothbrush than they have ever felt before.  Replacing the brush&#x27;s head is also really easy.  But beware, you can&#x27;t use cheap batteries in this brush.  If you use a generic brand battery they seem to die in about a week.  A good \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; battery has lasted me almost 3 weeks and is still going strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m going to upgrade to a more professional toothbrush or not, simply because this CrossAction has been doing a wonderful job for me so far.  For being under $10 its hard to justify not staying with it.  I strongly recommend this item to anyone who is looking for an electric tooth brush, but doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money.</li>
            <li> I immediately started using my new toothbrush which i purchased because of the reviews i read. I did not want to pay too much for something i had hardly any knowledge on &amp; after my first use I noticed the difference in the way my teeth felt after using it. I&#x27;d recommend this toothbrush to someone who wanted quality but did not want to pay the price.</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried an electric toothbrush, you should.  This toothbrush brand was recommended by my dentist.  I got one and loved it so I got my wife one.  We have both noticed a definite improvement in the appearance of our teeth.  They feel cleaner too.  I have to wonder if these things existed when I was a kid if I would have so much metal in my mouth.</li>
            <li> Thus toothbrush us absolutely great !&lt;br /&gt;It fits nicely in your hand, does a great&lt;br /&gt;Job of brushing teeth, makes you want&lt;br /&gt;To brush more often because of it&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;Handy feel and vigorous brushing capabilities.</li>
            <li> I am using this toothbrush for more than 6 months now. I got this for 3 bucks from local publix and its working great...so i suggested it to my wife and ordered this and the 3$ coupon clipped with this made it one of the best deals on power toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros : Its not hard on gums...&lt;br /&gt;  I specially like the 2 way cleaning&lt;br /&gt;  Very less price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons : It makes so much of noise. While writing this review now from my main hall i could hear the noise from bathroom which is like 15-20 feet away from me :)</li>
            <li> love this brand you get your moneys worth</li>
            <li> This is going to be as good as a more expensive professional powered toothbrush kit but at this price it does the job. Better than the simple non-powered ones..that is for sure!</li>
            <li> The quality of disposable battery toothbrushes has improved greatly and this model reflects it. It was only $3.50 for me and it was a great deal considering that it works well.</li>
            <li> I wanted an electric toothbrush since sometime and I liked this. Although, after few days of use the power has gone bad, I wonder why, maybe because of the batteries. Overall good as long as the power failure is not due to an internal fault.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush works very well; I&#x27;m extremely happy with it so far. The only minor issue is that it definitely doesn&#x27;t have the strongest motor in the toothbrush head. That being said, this is a cheap product, so for the price I can&#x27;t complain at all. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have used it since I received it, the brush head is bigger than the product I got while ago, more like the regular brush, made it a lot easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for almost 6 months now and love it.  It works better than a traditional toothbrush and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it at all.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to get filled with gross things as long as it is rinsed.  It also shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Look at the bottom of the picture. This toothbrush has a rounded bottom, so it won&#x27;t stand up. If that is an important feature for you, this toothbrush will disappoint. I didn&#x27;t notice that feature when I bought it, but it works fine, which still makes it a good value for the money. But I wanted a toothbrush that stood up, so I ended up buying another one for at home, but used this one in my travel bag. Since standing up is important in an electric toothbrush for me,  I would not buy this particular one again.</li>
            <li> The brush uses only one AA battery, which makes the handle slimmer than other battery powered brush that uses 2 * AA. Surprisingly, the single battery is powerful enough to make the brush vibrate at a strong pace. However, the bristle is short and it cannot reach the inner portion of my tooth. I am better off using my manual brush.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it,buy it now.&lt;br /&gt;the price you pay for it, you can say its like a steal deal&lt;br /&gt;i love it, it lasted for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> I choose this toothbrush as a spare and for that price it does the job. For everyday brushing though, I would go with a more expensive one.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a friend , since I have just the same and strongly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This thing works great only if you use a eneloop/imedion  2400mah battery..the regular alk batteries lose its mojo within 1 week brushing twice a day.With 2400mah you can go upto a month</li>
            <li> This is just as good as the more expensive Sonic Care brand.  Plus it has a replaceable AA battery...the brush heads can be replaced also.  It seems a little noisy at first...so If you have someone who needs to sleep in later you can use this in the evening.  Just a couple minutes with gentle to no pressure.  You don&#x27;t want to strip your enamel off.  And no the tip does not rotate but it is very effective to get behind the lower bottom teeth.  I also purchased the 15.00 stainless steel dental tools here on Amazon and used the scaler tool to clean behind my bottom front teeth.  Pull it away from your gums.  My teeth have never felt cleaner.  I have decided against having a hygienist clean my teeth now.  If they jab you in your gums or clean excessively it&#x27;s not good.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, I recommend</li>
            <li> Very much and very noisy, as drill. I will buy other model. It isn&#x27;t happy with purchase. I expected the best quality.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought a battery operated toothbrush many years ago it was an Oral-B. I was so impressed never owning anything other than a regular toothbrush. My teeth felt like I had just came from the dentist after having my teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried numerous brands to save money, and have bought others that were more expensive thinking I was going to get better results. Well, I will never waste my money on another battery operated toothbrush unless it is made by Oral-B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Oral-B version is another outstanding product. I bought 1 to try it out and have bought 3 more for the rest of the family because I loved it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish they offered it on amazon in different colors. They may in a brick and mortar but I do not bother going to brick and mortar places anymore unless absolutely needed. I hate having to find a parking space, sometimes it is crowded, then you have to wait in line to pay, the weather may be bad etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any how, this is a great toothbrush, the price is good, and its performance is outstanding. I just finished using mine and my teeth feel so smooth when I push my tongue against them back and forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oral-B never lets me down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for reading my review</li>
            <li> Why do people make such a fuss over electric toothbrushes? I don&#x27;t get it. So, it definitely vibrates while I brush my teeth. Do I notice that I do not have to brush in order to get clean? NO! You still need to rub your teeth with the brush. Do I notice my teeth any cleaner than when I brushed &amp;#34;the old fashioned way&amp;#34;? No! Maybe this is a Grumpy Old Man moment, but do we really need electronics to accomplish basic oral hygiene? I&#x27;m thinking no. Plus this thing is loud. My wife asked if I was using an electric razor the first time I used this thing. The first time she used it, I had no idea what to think, because all I heard was a buzzing sound from the bathroom. Yes, it&#x27;s noisy.</li>
            <li> I use one of this for 2 years, until the motor fail and I was very satisfice with it!  I&#x27;m thinking on buying another one just for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Mines quiet.  Single battery lasts quite a long time-months.  Cleaning action is so so and I end up using it like a regular brush.  Is it worth it?  Dunno and I just might go back to a good manual brush and be done with it.  Best I can say is its better by far than the Arm &amp; Hammer and other cheapies including Wally Worlds Equate (junk).  Some claim the head spins-it does not.  It oscillates and that can be proven by putting on some good glasses and watching the frayed bristles stay to one side during operation.&lt;br /&gt;It is what it is.</li>
            <li> For the price, there simply isn&#x27;t a better power toothbrush.  Throw in a rechargeable battery and replace the heads frequently.  No need to spend the money on those more expensive power brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush has plenty of power and leaves your teeth feeling silky clean.</li>
            <li> I was expecting stronger brush action. I&#x27;ll probably pay more next time for a higher level product. Not bad for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is just as good as the expensive electric toothbrush we had.  We both have one now and our dental check ups are excellent.  Thank you for a really good product.  I hope it lasts a really long time; but if it doesn&#x27;t last, at least it&#x27;s not too expensive.</li>
            <li> Purchased two and we both like them.  Battery still going after over 60 uses.  We store them with the head cover in place but you have to be careful doing that because you can bend a bristol.  Don&#x27;t believe Oral-B&#x27;s tv ads because their portrayed use is impossible.</li>
            <li> Using this product gives my mouth an overall clean feel. It gets in hard to reach places and I really enjoy the massaging action on my gums</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS TOOTHBRUSH. IT&#x27;S LAST LONGER THAN MOST OTHER BATTERY OPERATED TOOTHBRUSHES.  IT CLEANS VERY WELL. I WILL BUY IT AGAIN</li>
            <li> For what it is (a sub $10 toothbrush), it does well.  It&#x27;s not quite a sonicare, but for just a fraction of the price, it adds a bit of movement to circulate around the back teeth.  It&#x27;s a shame it doesn&#x27;t have replacement heads though, and I feel guilty that I&#x27;ll have to throw the whole thing out in a couple months.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok brush for start up.</li>
            <li> I had an older Oral B and it was getting long in the tooth (pardon the pun). This one is far superior as it moves in more than one direction. My mouth feels cleaner somehow. The power of the motor was great also. Has a decent weight to it (I have large hands) and is maneuvered easily.</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush, I have been using it for years and have no complain ! It reaches even the hardest places and cleans theme perfectly!</li>
            <li> I bough this toothbrush and loved it.  Then I noticed that customers who bought this toothbrush also bought the Guy Fieri Gourmet 14-Piece Triple Riveted Cutlery Set, so I bought that also, and I must say, these two purchases indeed complement each other.  Thank you world of Amazon for making this connection.&lt;br /&gt;#ddf</li>
            <li> I am amazed on how long the battery lasts on this brush.  With the anti-microbial bristles, it makes a great travel companion for your toiletry bag.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the price</li>
            <li> I have been using this toothbrush for a long time and it really holds its charge. I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric toothbrush that I have ever used.  I have been using it for probably about a year.  My mouth feels so much cleaner using this than a regular toothbrush.  It doesnt drain the batteries at all.  I haven&#x27;t even gone through a 4-pack of AA&#x27;s yet.  :)  This was something I just bought for the heck of it but am really glad that I did.  I think I will buy one for each of my parents for Christmas.  It would be a great and useful gift.</li>
            <li> I really like how clean my teeth feel after using this toothbrush.  The bristles aren&#x27;t too hard, it&#x27;s not excessively loud and I like that it comes with a cover.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish they came in assorted colors.  I ordered two and they are identical so we had to mark them so we&#x27;d know them apart.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this toothbrush which I purchased for myself. So far so good, price was good and was available with free shipping.</li>
            <li> Very grateful ~ Very good</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY BASIC TOOTHBRUSH FROM ORAL-B, FEATURING CRISS-CROSS ACTION.&lt;br /&gt;THE TOOTHBRUSH COMES WITH A DURACELL PRE-INSTALLED AND THE BATTERY ITSELF LAST SEVERAL MONTHS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEELS OKAY, THE QUALITY OF THE PLASTIC IS NOT VERY GREAT, BUT HEY!  LOOK AT HOW MUCH IT COSTS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE NOT CHANGED THE HEAD TILL NOW, SO HAVE NO IDEA REGARDING THE COST OR HOW EASY IT WOULD BE TO REPLACE THEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KEEPS WATER AWAY FROM THE BATTERY COMPARTMENT AS ITS BUSHED BY AN &amp;#34;O&amp;#34; RING.&lt;br /&gt;FAIRLY LIGHT WEIGHT- WOULD BE OKAY FOR KIDS TO USE IT TOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL A VERY GOOD PRODUCT CONSIDERING THE PRICE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY SATISFIED :)  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> Used it and it is ok,, but not as effective as the battery powered other Oral B style...... still,, worth every penny and made well,, sturdy and does a pretty good dental experience !</li>
            <li> Best battery operated toothbrush.  Though I would prefer that it was anit-microbial.</li>
            <li> Never had a chance to try the toothbrush since the tool to remove the head was missing making it a useless travel toothbrush if we wanted to interchange heads.  A problem with Amazon is that I expained in the note area that we only wanted to get a tool but our only option was to return for a refund or exchange.  I chose the former since I didn&#x27;t want to have to drive back to UPS a second time if the replacement unit was also missing the tool.  Very annoying.&lt;br /&gt;12/27/12 Update:  found this same toothbrush in a local drug store.  All of them were missing the brush removal tool in their packaging.  But, the store sold packs of 2 separate replacement brushes and these came with the brush removal tool.  Still a shame the toothbrush package is missing this tool, even of you don&#x27;t plan to routinely switch brush heads since it&#x27;s best to remove the brush head after each use since this would facilitate drying.  BTW, as of this date the replacement brushes are not available at Amazon.</li>
            <li> fantastic value for a long lasting (changeable batteries), high performance teeth cleaning and gum health tool- buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush (the non-antimicrobial version) for about five years now, replacing the heads and batteries as needed, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Now it&#x27;s only better with the antimicrobial protection.  With these you get the vigorous round action combined with the criss-cross brushes and the results are great. Why buy far more expensive sets when this brush does it all - and for much less cost?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I&#x27;m reviewing this now (after so long) is my three children, all of whom have been using these brushes nearly as long as I, just got back from a cleaning/check-up with no cavities...again. So not only am I saving money and getting a great toothbrush for my family, but I&#x27;m also saving at the dentist too. Consider me a huge fan. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Strong vibration i like it !!</li>
            <li> Great brush. Good battery life. An electric toothbrush is a product that&#x27;s so much better than your basic manual toothbrush.  I am very happy to have this one because it&#x27;s so convenient and replacement heads are readily available.</li>
            <li> This was waaaay too loud! And I didn&#x27;t feel like it actually cleaned my teeth.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S A VERY GOOD PRODUCT  IT HELPS KEEPING THE DENTIST AWAY , AND IS VERY USEFULL FOR GUMS YN THE ELDEST PEOPLE...</li>
            <li> I love this toothbrush. I was using the Spinbrush for about a year and a half, and it was working fine. When it came time to replace the brush head, Oral-B happened to be running a $3 off special, causing this new toothbrush to be cheaper than the Spinbrush replacement head, so I figured, why not, and bought one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some concerns with power, since Spinbrush uses 2 AA batteries, and Oral-B Complete Action uses only 1. However, the toothbrush&#x27;s performance totally exceeded my expectation. The motor is very strong and it doesn&#x27;t feel any weaker than the Spinbrush. Because this toothbrush uses only 1 battery, it is also much lighter than the Spinbrush so it is less tiring to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was also concerned with battery life. For this, all I can say is 3 months in my Oral-B Complete Action is still going strong. However, normally my Spinbrush battery lasts about 6 months before dying, so it remains to be seen whether Oral-B&#x27;s battery life is as long as Spinbrush&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, no complaints. It&#x27;s light weight, it&#x27;s inexpensive, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint. I lied. The toothbrush does not fit into your normal toothbrush stand and it does not stand on its own. I have yet to come up to a fix for this. Right now it&#x27;s sitting stupidly in a coffee mug.</li>
            <li> Best kept secret in the &#x27;battery powered&#x27; brush family. Simple and does a great job. Very low maintenance. I burshed almost 5 months before replacing the battery - 1 AA. Value for money!!</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is very good and very inexpensive. I do not understand the need to spend $30 or $50 or more when you can have this one under $10 in most stores. But I didn&#x27;t get the color that was on the picture when I bought it (picture showed a green battery cap but I got a white one), with no option to select a color. Hence a star off.</li>
            <li> This is excellent product. It is vibrating at a good speed and cleans my teeth very good. I recomend this product.</li>
            <li> The toothbrush working on one AA battery and you can take with you for any trip. I am using for few years now.  Just love it.</li>
            <li> Have the deluxe model at home, but this is great for traveling. Takes less room but still does a great job.</li>
            <li> Great brush. Good battery life. An electric toothbrush is a product that&#x27;s critical for your dental health and overall well-being. This device ticks all the boxes. In my opinion, it&#x27;s full of thoughtful and fantastic features.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush, purchased roughly 5 months ago. I always wanted to try one, but was skeptical about the advertised benefits of costly electric toothbrushes. What a fool I&#x27;ve been! At first use, my teeth felt noticeably cleaner (and that&#x27;s an understatement). Regular brushing, flossing and mouthwash cannot replace the power brushing action. It has also helps manage my gum and teeth sensitivities (I&#x27;m not exactly sure why, but it does).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below are some reasons why I think this specific brush is a good buy:&lt;br /&gt;1. Reasonably priced. Worst case scenario, it&#x27;s a loss of only a few dollars.&lt;br /&gt;2. Battery is replaceable and seems to last a while. I haven&#x27;t changed mine in 5 months, but can tell it is slightly less powerful.&lt;br /&gt;3. Portable, since it is battery operated. Also, no need to wait for the brush to charge.&lt;br /&gt;4. Replacement heads are available. A tool is provided to help with this (in the replacement kit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notes:&lt;br /&gt;1. It took me a while to stop my manual \\&quot;brushing movement\\&quot; since it comes so naturally. Going slowly across my teeth was an odd sensation.&lt;br /&gt;2. Requires cleaning/sterilization to keep parts clean. My method was to remove the head and soak the necessary parts in hydrogen peroxide. Turning the brush on both with and without the head provides extra agitation for cleaning. The first time, I did use a toothpick to remove some dried toothpaste, but that&#x27;s my fault since I was clueless about toothbrush hygiene. After that, keeping it clean by soaking/agitating in hydrogen peroxide is simple and quick. Removing the head for cleaning is recommended. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a slightly less pleasant experience when you replace the head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great toothbrush. Simple, practical, useful. Highly recommended, especially to replace manual brushing.</li>
            <li> This was my first powered toothbrush.  I was amazed!  This thing removed some plaque that I thought there was NO HOPE for me every getting off my teeth short of a professional cleaning.  The stuff seemed to have become part of my tooth and did not even register as being raised above the level of the back of my front teeth.  I have some dental tools from the dentist here and I had even tried scraping it off with that, and no joy.  Well after I brushed my teeth with this powered toothbrush.. that stuff disappeared!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted it has lost some effectiveness in removing the plaque from my teeth so effectively so quickly since then so it is getting close to time to replace the brush head but not until I cannot effectively get the job done . .it&#x27;s not the brushes fault that I am not the most consistent in doing what I should and that I&#x27;m on a diet that uses a powdered supplement in place of actual food that I swear has started using concrete in the formula the way it&#x27;s started sticking to my teeth!  You&#x27;d think something that is LIQUID wouldn&#x27;t stick particularly since I vigorously rinse my mouth and teeth with water several times after drinking the stuff, but Noooo this stuff manages to stick!  But if I did what I should do brush every time I drink the stuff I wouldn&#x27;t have the issue.  But I can say that this brush does a pretty fair job when I do what I should and even when I don&#x27;t and after using the brush to loosen the stuff and then using the dental tool to loosen what&#x27;s left and then brushing again.. it works like a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if this can do that well with something so totally unnatural and aggressively insistent on sticking like concrete, imagine what it can do with a diet of real honest to god food!  ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product.  The only thing that bugged me a bit was when I first used it, that anti-microbial part has a taste to it, particularly if you rinse the head with warm or hot water. So don&#x27;t use hot water on it, and it isn&#x27;t noticeable and if you use toothpaste (I hate the stuff and use it rarely and only in small amounts as it foams and gags me, and dentist said it wasn&#x27;t something that was necessary, water worked just as well.. so I stopped using it much until I needed sensodyne.. that I need to use for what it does. fill the pores in exposed roots to reduce their sensitivity to hot and cold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in a timely manner, it arrived as advertised, in manufacturer packaging, and the price was VERY good.  Not much more one could say about it.  It did what it said it would when it said it would for a good price and in a timely manner.er on it, and it isn&#x27;t noticeable and if you use toothpaste (I hate the stuff and use it rarely and only in small amounts as it foams and gags me, and dentist said it wasn&#x27;t something that was necessary, water worked just as well.. so I stopped using it much until I needed sensodyne.. that I need to use for what it does. fill the pores in exposed roots to reduce their sensitivity to hot and cold).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product arrived in a timely manner, it arrived as advertised, in manufacturer packaging, and the price was VERY good.

            <li> This is a wonderful toothbrush. It cleans very well and I will recommend this product to anyone looking for a great quality toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I like it. It is a good device for lazy me :-)</li>
            <li> this toothbrush arrived quickly but did not work. i tried replacing the batteries.  it came with off-brand batteries and I upgraded to name brand and that did not help either.  i had high hopes for this toothbrush; it got rave reviews.  I hope Amazon refunds my money.</li>
            <li> Please note the color of the toothbrush in the picture doesn&#x27;t match the color mailed to you.  I ordered two of these and another brand hoping for different colors so my family doesn&#x27;t mix up their toothbrushes.  I received two identical blue toothbrushes.</li>
            <li> Just used this brush last night and it&#x27;s everythign and more that we hoped for.  We shall see in the coming weeks if it improves on my analog brushing skills for a cleaner feeling mouth.  Great price for this Oral-B product.</li>
            <li> item as described. fast shipping. no drama</li>
            <li> Enjoy the feel of the toothbrush in mouth, seems to target each area.  Complement this toothbrush with another one, but I use this one in the morning. With the assistance of my toothpaste, it gives my mouth a tingling feeling.  Interchangeable and types of brush heads adds a plus to my rating.</li>
            <li> good, thanks, i will bus new one in future, hope it more cheaper than this time. it will be very happy for us</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is much better than my old colgate battery one.  It uses a smaller battery and is very light and fits my hand better.</li>
            <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I like it.  It does vibrate my head but I can use a little shaking up.  i especially like being able to get a good massage behind my last molars.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased this toothbrush back in 2013. I was very impressed with the power and how clean my teeth felt after using the brush. The brush worked perfectly with no issues until I misplaced it during a recent move. I came back to Amazon and purchased a replacement only to realize upon delivery that this new version did not come with a cover. To be honest I have a love/hate relationship with the cover for this toothbrush. I worried about all the moisture in the cap wondering if that could lead to bacteria growth of some sort. However I am still very disappoint to not have a cover, not just in terms of protection for traveling. Not having a cover is problematic if/when the brush touches the counter and with flying hair and different product usage in the bathroom.The problem is that because of the size it will not fit in the traditional toothbrush holder. I have also tried using a regular cap to cover it and this did not work.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line your teeth will be brushed clean but without the cap the brush picks up other germs.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrush that really works well for cleaning your teeth and gum line. Buy the extra heads and swap out after every visit to your dentist for professional cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, but thats my mistake.  I really like it though.  Just need to figure out how to get replacements now!</li>
            <li> The only reason I would spend more on a toothbrush is if it had a water pick or something like that. The heads are cheap to replace, too. Like how it doesn&#x27;t need wall charging bc I have a small bathroom and cables really clutter things up.</li>
            <li> My kids each have one of these and their teeth brushing has become more thorough than with a conventional brush. The head size is decent but not too large for little mouths. I use renewable AA batteries and have only had to change them once in the last ~3 months. Pretty good!</li>
            <li> My kids now ask to brush their teeth.  What more can a mom ask for?  Quality brush, dentist loves it, shipped fast.</li>
            <li> This model was our first powered toothbrush. This purchase replaced three year old units.  We bought them initially just to try since other models were sooo expensive. These worked so well we stopped looking at the expensive versions. The AA battery lasts easily a month. We use NiMh rechargeables.</li>
            <li> Have not used this yet but for the price and the size to but in a carry on bag this will be great.</li>
            <li> I like this tooth brush....not expensive and gets into allthe &amp;#34;nooks and crannies&amp;#34;  It also does not take up alot of room on&lt;br /&gt;my sink counter;</li>
            <li> man this thing is fast... if i could mount this bad boy to my 98 gmc truck, i could sure get to work a lot quicker.</li>
            <li> cant expect more for a $7 brush consuming one AA per 2-week for one like me who sometimes brush once a day but sometimes more than 4-5times.</li>
            <li> the funtion is good, the design is nice, and the quality excelent</li>
            <li> This is the best toothbrush I have ever owned and I got a rave at the dentist&#x27;s office because of it. So inexpensive but truly marvelous.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several of these now from the local supermarket, and while the brushes do a great of job of cleaning and are a great value, I&#x27;ve had to throw them all away within a year.  It is too bad because I loved this brush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, the brush works well and remains easy to clean.  After a while, there is visible bacteria growth behind the replaceable bristles in the mechanism that moves the brush head.  You can clean most of the mechanism (some of it is inaccessible under the handle), but the bacteria returs very quickly.  The replacement brush heads are not sealed, and the non-replaceable mechanism is visible through the brushes.  After a while you end up sticking a bacteria stick in your mouth every time you use this. It is extremely gross.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this toothbrush,  It is really big and very noisy. I will not buy this again.  I don&#x27;t recommend this toothbrush.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brush for a long time now. Yea I could buy the more expensive toothbrushes for over 100 dollars, but this one works just great for me and keeps my teeth and gums very clean.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THESE 2 ITEMS BECAUSE I FEEL GOOD WITH THEIR &amp;#34;JOB&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The price was fantastic so I bought one for each of us. The product is great and the brand is a trusted product. Was able to purchase way below retail even bought the replacement heads as well what happens in retail is all well and good you buy the brush but every time you go back for the heads the rack is empty. This way I have the best of both worlds and never had to leave my desk.</li>
