            <li>LOL</li>

            <li>And the clips did a great job of holding on to the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, they&#x27;re great for smoothing your hair out...</li>
            <li>It always turns out great.  </li>
            <li>these are not issues for you, then this set works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using rollers [by Conair] for about 15 years and like always these are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil that is included with this purchase is also very nice.  </li>
            <li>Very nice curler.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with how I was able to return the item though and hope to find something else.</li>
            <li>I have tried many curling sets, and this one seems to be the best.  </li>
            <li>It does look nice and stays styled for the day!</li>
            <li>/&gt;All-in-all, a rather pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>comes the amazing part, my hair looked great.  </li>
            <li>The Infiniti Pro does a good job for me.  </li>
            <li>They seem to be good rollers and I am keeping them</li>
            <li>Great, effective rollers -</li>
            <li>Hairspray works good too.  </li>
            <li>The clip idea is  superior, 3.</li>
            <li>good understanding of one needs</li>
            <li>This is a good method and a good set..</li>
            <li>This is a good method and a good set.</li>
            <li>so they fit the size of the roller perfectly.</li>
            <li>Putting heat on your hair isn&#x27;t good for it, period.</li>
            <li>These are some of the best hot curlers I have ever used!!  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, the clips work great.</li>
            <li>They work great to securely hold all 4 sizes of the rollers!</li>
            <li>I have been very satisfied with the end result.</li>
            <li>I have returned this product at a great cost to myself, the postage to return this item was more</li>
            <li>/&gt;Needless to say, I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>I can proudly say that I love the Infiniti Pro by Conair Xtreme</li>
            <li>I have been very pleased with these rollers.  </li>
            <li>Does a good job and very easy to do.</li>
            <li>I love it !</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>Malfunction for sure!  </li>
            <li>Love!</li>
            <li>Better curl!  </li>
            <li>Clips bend out of shape and break somewhat easily (though they are GREAT at holding the rollers in place).&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT does the job, making beautiful curls and for that I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li>My hair turned out great -- smooth with a hint of curl.</li>
            <li>I do warm these up longer than directions state</li>
            <li>/&gt;The added bonus of the Argan oil is nice since I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>These rollers are not on a post to warm them.  </li>
            <li>this is nice, but nothing to rave about....</li>
            <li>The curlers warm</li>
            <li>I really liked using the product.</li>
            <li>A bag or box would have been nice for storage.</li>
            <li>My wife was thrilled and used the rollers that Christmas afternoon.  </li>
            <li>My results have been good and even in the heat and humidity of Florida my hair stays styled for many hours after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My set came with some sample products of hair conditioner etc, which is always nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I found these rollers provided me with nice bouncy, shiny curls that lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked the variety of sizes</li>
            <li>It would be nice if there were wire clips included, not just the plastic clips.</li>
            <li>Flocked rollers are &#x27;kind&#x27; to hair -- and tends to make it easier to get the job done without burning your fingers or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It heats up to a nice temperature in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Aside from that, if you don&#x27;t mind keeping the clips in a plastic bag, this is a nice set that does what it says it would do</li>
            <li>They do heat up nicely though.</li>
            <li>The curlers claim to warm up in 85 seconds.</li>
            <li>Like this but would be nice if there was somewhere to store the clips.</li>
            <li>Beautiful great looking hair with smooth curls that look professional are accompanished with this great equipment in minutes.  </li>
            <li>Bought these rollers to keep my hair styled for a special occasion -- family wedding -- and they did their job and worked great.  </li>
            <li>Looks great, has all the right features and will try it out soon!</li>
            <li>The rest work great but a good amount of them are the large size</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m super happy with this product.</li>
            <li>it was very easy to put in my hair .</li>
            <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I own an older version of this product that was very good.  </li>
            <li>I have used everything from the old wire clips to the plastic claw-style clips, and then ones that come with this set are the best at both holding the roller in place AND not \\&quot;denting\\&quot; your hair.  </li>
            <li>With that said, this is probably the best choice among today&#x27;s available hot roller sets.</li>
            <li>but when I do, I find the set heats up quickly, rolls nicely without frizzing my hair, and give me good results that hold.  </li>
            <li>These rollers were great for the first year.  </li>
            <li>It might be great for shorter hair, but unfortunately not mine.</li>
            <li>Though they do a great job, they don&#x27;t give me the defined curl I&#x27;m used to getting hot rollers.</li>
            <li>Also, these clips are very light gauge plastic.</li>
            <li>Also, these clips are very light gauge plastic.</li>
            <li>The clips that hold the rollers on are very secure</li>
            <li>They are very light weight and don&#x27;t grasp or hold the hair.  </li>
            <li>The rollers on this hairsetter heat up quite well &amp; stay hot;  and would create very nice curl</li>
            <li>but I am able to use them.  </li>
            <li>Now the era of Tourmaline and Ceramic is upon us - which of course has been proven to be better for your hair.  </li>
            <li>Both technologies give better heat distribution and will not strip hair of moisture or oils, which prevents the cuticle from damaging or splitting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was shiny, bouncy and had a ton of body and fat sexy waves.  </li>
            <li>I also hoped it would get warmer with more use</li>
            <li>there IS something better</li>
            <li>there IS something better</li>
            <li>I like that there are more rollers in this set than my compact version of my old-style Revlon rollers.  </li>
            <li>And you need a bit more space to store this set, because of the four cardboard strips which hold the clips.  </li>
            <li>The longer your hair the better in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I want my hair to look like it has more body I use these curlers.  </li>
            <li>i love it</li>
            <li>The results were at best inconsistent, certainly not enough to compensate for the damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I was so pleased to receive the Conair Xtreme Infiniti Pro Heat Rollers.</li>
            <li>I love my Infiniti Pro.  </li>
            <li>I love the clips but the heating time takes longer than advertised.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Ceramic is said to hold heat better.</li>
            <li>and I love this.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great as a gift, except for yourself, but it really does do the job.</li>
            <li>Lovely set.</li>
            <li>But like I said, I&#x27;m used to getting a more defined curl.</li>
            <li>but she is totally pleased.</li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d be using rollers again, but love the curl and bounce created by these rollers.  </li>
            <li>I would have love if this set came with a lot more rollers.</li>
            <li>It was just okay.</li>
            <li>This seems to be more of a \\&quot;sample set\\&quot; of rollers.</li>
            <li>I love how i can just put the rollers on and do my&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the pins better.</li>
            <li>The Infiniti Pro Ceramic Curlers seem to do a decent job of curling hair, though I did not always get great results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say more like 5 minutes to get them good and hot...</li>
            <li>They heat up fast, give great curl and go in and out easily.</li>
            <li>But the positives are they do get hot and the clips work good.</li>
            <li>have very fine, lightly layered hair.  </li>
            <li>My best solution was to remove the curlers and then secure the curls with clips until it was absolutely necessary to remove them.  </li>
            <li>I find these rollers pretty easy to put in and the clips work good.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the reviews, the clips are very good at holding the different size rollers.</li>
            <li>As far as the curlers I would give a 4.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did a great job of shipping.</li>
            <li>I think my mistake was trying first the \\&quot;Hot Tools HairSetter 20 Rollers Wax Core &amp; Ionic Technology HTS1401\\&quot;, which leaves beautiful bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li>Heat up fast good curls.</li>
            <li>my wife loved this product and she said it is fast and efficient and will make her life easy</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again, a good set of curlers just not the right set for someone looking for super jumbo size curlers without the slit for smoothing and adding body.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t use any other brand as I find that Conair produces the best products over the competition,  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and stores well.</li>
            <li>She raved about how easy they are to use and how it did &amp;#34;exactly</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li>When it was time to curl my hair, the rollers were easy to use.  </li>
            <li>easy to operate and keeping all day without any hair styling products</li>
            <li>The product shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li>In most of the sets the clips are stored right inside the cover, but this one has no place for that many.</li>
            <li>NIce, hot, and they stay in.</li>
            <li>The clips are now cheap and flimsy and tangle together easily.  </li>
            <li>I have shoulder length fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine (but a lot of it) hair that falls about mid-back.  </li>
            <li>I will probably look for a set with more smaller rollers to get that curl :) For people with shorter/thinner hair, they might give a better curl than me with this set!</li>
            <li>The Conair is perfect as the rollers are easy to put in, and the clips hold tight!  </li>
            <li>Once I set my hair, I have huge flippy clips waving all over my head.  </li>
            <li>Another huge problem is that the curlers do NOT stay stable in the air.  </li>
            <li>I prefer them to the clips as the clips make dents in my hair and the pins fit tighter and leave no dents.</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
            <li>Bizarre.</li>
            <li>And the set is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It will retain a smooth shape, but no curl.</li>
            <li>I know some people have said they think the clips are cheap -</li>
            <li>but the clips are bulky though light weight.</li>
            <li>If you want smooth, shiny, non-frizzy hair try these out.</li>
            <li>Unit seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you have really obedient hair, this might be enough, but for most people, it&#x27;s better to let them warm up for 5 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never used them before and want to learn how, this might be a great set because you get all different sizes of rollers.</li>
            <li>If you want rollers of different sizes, though, this is a great bet.</li>
            <li>for me to do my hair and have a fantastic look.</li>
            <li>Have to put roller clips in another container as these won&#x27;t fit inside the unit.</li>
            <li>From the good old days of the plastic ones to the ones you had to use the U-shaped clips that burned your finger tips.  </li>
            <li>And... if this is the first hot roller unit you&#x27;ve ever bought and cannot compare, it might be good to you as well.  </li>
            <li>original Conair set has 12 jumbo size rollers; I hoped there would be more large rollers, but I&#x27;ve been able to use all but the smallest rollers.</li>
            <li>The rollers fit back very nicely also into the tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, very pleased with my new Infiniti Pro Ceramic Rollers and can recommend them to anyone wanting this type of product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a wonderful hot roller set that will be used often for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a limited 3-year warranty.</li>
            <li>There could be more medium rollers but other than that these are great</li>
            <li>Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I guess I am just use to the older kind of  curlers.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li>She was extremely enthusiastic about the product, saying she&#x27;d highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hot roller.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these ceramic rollers and plugged them in to do my hair for a party I was attending.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this considering</li>
            <li>Perhaps users with medium-length hair will get more consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In closing, I&#x27;d recommend this product more for people with thinner, medium-length hair because the curlers add volume and my experience suggests that they don&#x27;t create a consistent curl with longer hair.xperimentation will improve my results.)</li>
            <li>Perhaps users with medium-length hair will get more consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;In closing, I&#x27;d recommend this product more for people with thinner, medium-length hair because the curlers add volume and my experience suggests that they don&#x27;t create a consistent curl with longer hair.</li>
            <li>Normally, my hair kind of fades in 6 hrs or so, but with these, in an hour its lost its curl.</li>
            <li>Was so excited to get this.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I have been so excited about this product, that for the first time ever, I am excited about styling my hair each morning to create a lovely curled style.  </li>
            <li>(straight was better), so greatly appreciate the ease of instant curl.</li>
            <li>These do get nice and hot but not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She raved to me about the variety of curlers available, the ease of use and how quickly they warmed up for use.  </li>
            <li>For me, I use the large rollers around the top of my head, and then switch to the 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>First, it looks really good in my black &amp; white bathroom and it does an excellent job on my hair!</li>
            <li>Love them TY fast shipping</li>
            <li>Though in order to set a curl you need to heat the hair and then allow it to cool while curled for the style to set.</li>
            <li>: my curlers still are in good shape after two years of daily usage.</li>
            <li>The only good thing I can say is they mastered the plastic clips.</li>
            <li>cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>My neice uses them and her hair comes out bouncy and full of body.</li>
            <li>I love the fast start up heat.</li>
            <li>THE rollers work best when in your hair at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>If you want to travel with this set plan on more room in the suitcase for all these spring clips, they take up too much room</li>
            <li>The smaller curlers do a good job of curling shorter</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t seem to get as warm as my old set and our hair does not keep a set.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy and fast!</li>
            <li>Do like the Conair Xtreme roller are easy to use and never get to hot...</li>
            <li>They heat up quickly (about 2 minutes)</li>
            <li>The curlers heated up fairly quickly but did NOTHING for my hair.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s the first time in many years, I&#x27;ve had one set of hot rollers that met my hair needs.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that heated quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure they&#x27;ll last for many years...</li>
            <li>A quick read of the directions, cleanse of the roller holders, and</li>
            <li>This set has 4 sized rollers and promised a quick heat up.  </li>

            <li>Heats up quickly and I like the claw clips instead of</li>
            <li>They do become very WARM but not hot.</li>
            <li>The clips hold the hot roller securely in place.  </li>
            <li>I found this model to not heat up very hot at all.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get very hot or curl my hair like I wanted.</li>
            <li>Very pleased overall</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think they get very hot.</li>
            <li>I use hot rollers to smooth my hair and add body.  </li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s still not overly long, and they get good and</li>
            <li>The roller holders firmly held each roller in place, and after 15 minutes, I was able to quickly and easily remove each roller and was left with beautiful, springy curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have dry  medium length hair and these rollers work good on it.  </li>
            <li>These seem not to have so many \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; that burn me, very comfy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for those who wish to have beautiful curls, but have limited time on their hands.  </li>
            <li>Fast heating and light to hold and carried anywhere.</li>
            <li>The curlers honestly don&#x27;t seem to heat up enough.  </li>
            <li>This is we worth the money.</li>
            <li>The directions say that users should experiment, trying different heats, times, and sizes for their hair type, and it may be that I just haven&#x27;t found the optimal setting for my own hair yet.</li>
            <li>I picked this set up for my wife after her old curler set had seen better days</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length, straight, fine hair that gets kind of ridges in it if I don&#x27;t use a flat iron on it after it dries.  </li>
            <li>like it very much  The amount of rollers is quite adequate.</li>
            <li>Much better than spending 30 minutes to smooth it with a flat</li>
            <li>The unit heats up quickly and the rollers don&#x27;t feel too hot to handle.</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>Right now I just go the beauty parlor.</li>
            <li>I used every one of the 20 rollers included with the set and came out with a head full of soft, beautiful curls in less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted hot rollers that got hot but would not burn the ends of my fingers or my ears off!  </li>
            <li>Plus ceramic maintains heat much better than most other materials, so once the curlers get hot, they stay hot.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The rollers heat up fast, they curl quick, and are totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the big clips, but these rollers do not get very hot.  </li>
            <li>The rollers are great, the only problem I have is there is  no place to put the clips and the clips are some what big.</li>
            <li>Since they heat up quickly they are ready to reuse in a flash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Heats very fast.  </li>
            <li>The other good thing about the clips is they hold much better than pins and don&#x27;t leave a dent in the hair in the way a long bobby pin does.</li>
            <li>But, that would hardly be a drawback if my hair came out great, which it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>The old rollers had a hole in the center and each one fit on its own post.  </li>
            <li>This set of hot rollers works well.  </li>
            <li>The giant rollers don&#x27;t curl your hair, they just give you more body.</li>
            <li>My curls looked and held a lot better with the red one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes</li>
            <li>I bought this product almost two years ago as my first hot roller set.</li>
            <li>and they do get hot</li>
            <li>I have used hot rollers for years.  </li>
            <li>I like to get the rollers as hot as possible because that allows a better set in your hair.  </li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift for a frend it worked well for her but not for me those rollers were too hot for me to hold</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>but I would really like to talk to them!  </li>
            <li>I need more heat, metal clips back and the tray to hold them inside the unit.  </li>
            <li>So, if the rollers are hot, I know how to handle them.  </li>
            <li>These were too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used them before going to work.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t know much about &amp;#34;rollers.&amp;#34;  I can comment on the construction and overall quality of the product: which are both very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it was my first  time using this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;--The set comes with 20 rollers (in four different sizes) and 20 hair clips (and you can order more if you need to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The curlers are hot to the touch but won&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li>Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t seem to get hot</li>
            <li>I bought these because they weren&#x27;t the cheapest, but I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper products would have worked better.</li>
            <li>I like the variety of sizes and my curls last a day or 2 :)</li>
            <li>At first glance, I thought the uncovered heating elements might be a problem.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Putting the rollers back in their slots is something of a puzzle, although the positioning is a bit more forgiving than anticipated.</li>
            <li>I ordered this set based on the versatility of  4 size rollers with the velvet flocking which I require in hot rollers.  </li>
            <li>Product is okay overall but dislike curler holders.</li>
            <li>The rollers get hot, but not SO hot that you take the skin off your fingers or have scalp burns.  </li>
            <li>Also the curl lasts pretty well and the set is versatile with many different sizes.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this set first.</li>
            <li>(FAST!)</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for about 35 years.  </li>
            <li>The curls are just nice big bouncy curls and it doesn&#x27;t look that unusual on me considering that I always wear my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>I have used hot rollers for well over 20 years.  </li>
            <li>The wife says it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as ceramic curlers and therefore doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li>I have been using hot rollers for years and</li>
            <li>Infiniti Pro by Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers were very easy to set up and pretty much ready to go straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li>The set has 8 large rollers, 4 jumbo, 4 medium(which are the one I use the most) and 4 tiny</li>
            <li>The jumbo size rollers are simply TOO large, I think, for most people -- they do not produce a curl at all.  </li>
            <li>you want a quick solution to fast curls, AND your hair isn&#x27;t superheavy or very long, you absolutely cannot do better than this set.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the curlers just don&#x27;t get hot enough, if they cool too quickly or what.</li>
            <li>These plastic tooth style clips hold very well, but from experience I can tell you that you should make sure you put them back in a bag when you are done.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this for someone who just wants to do something quick with their hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I learned how to use hot rollers when I was a teenager, so for me, rolling my whole head took about five minutes.  </li>
            <li>I have always preferred the wire clip as they hold the roller in my long hair much more efficiently.  </li>
            <li>I pretty much use all of the rollers except the smallest ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is long, however, so it may be that the top of the hair was not being treated as much.</li>

            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to set as strongly as the set I currently use.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to set as strongly as the set I currently use.</li>
            <li>Putting hot rollers in my hair is very easy and using the Infiniti Pro by Conair and I was ready to go out the door in less than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Mine were loose on the top of the strand and curly at the bottom.</li>
            <li>The rollers do not create nice tight pin curl style rolls.</li>
            <li>If you weren&#x27;t selling enough you should be changing your marketing team NOT a product that was just fine before.  </li>
            <li>older set also tends to get too hot.</li>
            <li>There is a color indicator on one of the rolls when they are warm and ready to roll, but I heat them up a little longer, for about 10 min.</li>
            <li>This neat little set provides a nice variety of sizes, allk covered with a felt-like \\&quot;flocking\\&quot; which is gentle.  </li>
            <li>The clips work fine for the smaller rollers and since those are always on the bottom, I don&#x27;t really mind it too much.</li>
            <li>The clips are very convenient and secure enough.</li>
            <li>Big huge clips.</li>
            <li>The rollers smooth it out very well in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li>The clips don&#x27;t hold the curlers except very loosely.therefore</li>
            <li>It is like a puzzle to fit them back on the rack.</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast and does the job</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and is gentle on hair.  </li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s very frizzy/coarse.</li>
            <li>and I think that&#x27;s FAST.  </li>
            <li>My hair is straight and slippery.  </li>
            <li>I had one of these years ago, had gone to the straight iron and the curling iron</li>
            <li>, I like the fact I can roll my hair and then get ready for work</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s done when I&#x27;m ready</li>
            <li>I really like the clips.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall out, and grip really well,</li>
            <li>The clips are very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair really doesn&#x27;t wrap around much to hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In fact, they work so fast</li>
            <li>very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re very compact and don&#x27;t take up alot of room on your countertop</li>
            <li>The clips hold very well without leaving marks on your hair&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really cannot keep a curl with these.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think its my hair, as I can keep a curl with an iron as well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>and I find it efficient--heat up the curlers as I get ready for work, heat for 2 minutes</li>
            <li>fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I generally end up using two hot rollers sets in order to get more of the smaller rollers.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>my rollers were ready for use.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been really neat about putting the rollers in at all and just grab sections and start rolling.</li>
            <li>and once I have my hair set, I just keep going with my routine of getting ready.  </li>
            <li>Much easier.  </li>
            <li>Much faster.  </li>
            <li>These work very well</li>
            <li>It would make smooth curls that would last all day.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Infiniti.</li>
            <li>But I would really like this style but with steam.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise the set is OK, just not what I expected for the money.</li>
            <li>Expected a better quality product from Conair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;anyone can really do it.</li>
            <li>The amazing thing about this product is that it takes less than 2 minutes to heat up for use on the hair!  </li>
            <li>Heats up pretty quick and provides lasting curls.</li>
            <li>curls were very pretty too -- for the first ten minutes, until humidity took over and made</li>
            <li>heats quickly, better than other options in this price range, I would recommend.</li>
            <li>In other words, users (unless they oversleep) should be able to curl their hair before work or school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>in all, very pleased with my new Infiniti Pro Ceramic Rollers and can recommend them to anyone wanting this type of product.eme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink]]</li>
            <li>My older set from Conair get much hotter.</li>
            <li>I got full bouncy curls, and this heats up so fast you don&#x27;t need alot of time in the morning for a different look.</li>
            <li>I love hot rollers and use them nearly everyday.  </li>
            <li>I use hot rollers nearly every day of my life, and I am quite familiar with the different types available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Conair used to be an EXTREMELY reliable brand, especially back in the 70s and 80s with their incredibly long-lasting blow-dryers, but those days are LONG gone.  </li>
            <li>They are amazing at holding the largest (and heaviest) rollers in place, even when there&#x27;s very little hair in them.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part about these is that they come with black clips---I much prefer them to pins.</li>
            <li>I have too long hair to go around the curlers to smooth and add body.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li>This product is light-years from the early days of hot rollers.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for my old Clairol hot rollers which were getting so brittle that the plastic ends of the rollers were cracking off.  </li>
            <li>This set does heat up faster, but does not seem to get as hot as my old set.  </li>
            <li>I only use the largest ones and there are more than enough rollers to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li>my tried and true Conair set finally gave out on me.</li>
            <li>No matter how long I leave them plugged in or leave them in my hair, the rollers won&#x27;t get hot enough and will not hold the curl for more than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and need to use the wire clips from my old set for the upper layers of hair or there&#x27;s a tendency to get dents in my hair.</li>
            <li>My old Conair model had a heat dial from 1-12 in which I always had it high like on 10, and in replacing it with this model found that it didn&#x27;t heat hot at all.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;ve had the other set - which is essentially the same as this one but for the variations in roller size and the clips - I can say this is a GREAT set.</li>
            <li>These are nothing like the older model Conair rollers.  </li>
            <li>These heat up fast, stays warm for at least 20-25 minutes</li>
            <li>Now, you can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t know how to use hot rollers because I have been using Conair Hot Rollers (Big Curls) for almost 30 years.  </li>
            <li>main advantages to these rollers are 1.</li>
            <li>The price is decent, and I have tried Connair, Baby Bliss, and Remington.</li>
            <li>mainly use the rollers for smoothing my hair and adding bounce.</li>
            <li>The only styling tool I use on a regular basis is the Chi iron because most heated styling tools do nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>set does not work for me for two main reasons ...&lt;</li>
            <li>highly recommend them for your consideration as a purchase or gift.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this set, but I figured what the heck</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this set of rollers.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The rollers were comfortable -- even though I had to use every single one!</li>
            <li>They are easy to use, not hot on your fingers</li>
            <li>I figured out how to avoid the dreaded clip crimp - quick flat iron after removing the rollers.  </li>
            <li>Surprised how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li>The rollers cooled as I walked around the house, drinking coffee, checking my email, you know normal morning routine</li>
            <li>A round brush and hair dryer would even work better than these did.</li>
            <li>Than on the third time, they stopped working, completely, I let them cool off and tried turning them on again, and nothing.</li>
            <li>I just have not been able to master curling my long hair with those slits up the middle.  </li>
            <li>I also think the set could eliminate the largest size which is too large even for long hair to hold a curl for very long and in addition, extend the set to 24-30 rollers with more of them in the medium sizes.  </li>
            <li>But for long-lasting curls, use a hot curling iron and clip your hair into curls to cool down.</li>
            <li>I just used the wire pins from the other set, and like that set, they stayed just fine in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My guess is if you have shoulder length hair that has a fine or thin texture, this unit will probably be fine.  </li>
            <li>The Infiniti Pro (ceramic) electric rollers heat up very quickly and are ready to use in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a little wave, these are fine, but they don&#x27;t really make or hold a curl.</li>
            <li>Do not heat properly and rollers are not the right size.</li>
            <li>I only use about 12 of the 20 rollers but the sizes seemed just right for what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t curl my hair and there was no way to put the curlers back into the right slots.</li>
            <li>Not enough of the right size curlers.</li>
            <li>The large and medium rollers left my hair straight, not even a wave.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers since high school and wasn&#x27;t a big fan then.</li>
            <li>nothing really new here, except for the clips.  </li>
            <li>nothing really new here, except for the clips.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;--The directions are easy to follow (though, oddly, the pictures included make it seem as if you&#x27;re going to come out of the process with an 80&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li>My hair was much shorter back then, but my shoulder length hair was just as straight as before I used them.  </li>
            <li>One complete and the second half there u are only as good as all departments.</li>
            <li>My daily routine after getting up is turn on the hot roller, make coffee, put curlers on while coffee is brewing, then hair and makeup.</li>
            <li>The rollers do no seem to get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>I let it heat for awhile to make sure I was not letting it heat all the way, but it still was not hot enough.</li>
            <li>I used another brand of hot rollers, and it finally stopped working after years of service.  </li>
            <li>I have to take the first ones out as the last ones go in, or else I&#x27;d be giving Orphan Annie a run for the money in the curly</li>
            <li>I used to use hot rollers religiously.  </li>
            <li>but rollers did not get hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li>, doesn&#x27;t get the rollers hot enough I think</li>
            <li>It just simply does not get hot enough...and the contact is so soft that it does not leave any defined curl at all!</li>
            <li>last hot curler set was a Clairol that I bought in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>it does not get hot enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li>I put the larger rollers on top and work my way down.</li>
            <li>This Extreme set by Conair does heat up quickly, but it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair with all day curl.  </li>
            <li>Whether you have long, short, fine or thick hair, this product is sure to do wonders.</li>
            <li>have basically straight hair, but it&#x27;s not naturally pin straight and has some natural wave to it.  </li>
            <li>The rollers heated up quickly (just watch the one curler in the front turn from red to white)</li>
            <li>set is better than my current set for two reasons; the very small rollers work for the short layers, and I can vary my result (soft waves, use the larger roller, more curly, use the smallest.)</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and these rollers fall right out, never get caught in my hair and make my hair look silky, shiny and with a bouncy curl that lasts.</li>
            <li>I use the medium and large rollers only, and can curl all my hair with it.</li>
            <li>The rollers come in 4 sizes -- 4 jumbo, 6 large, 6 medium-small, and 4 tiny.  </li>
            <li>However, if you like a certain size of rollers for your hair, whether large or small, you can be pretty certain that this won&#x27;t have enough of what you want.</li>
            <li>so I end up with a little wave instead of the smooth look I seek.</li>
            <li>My  main goal was to smooth out my hair and to give a small amount of curl.</li>
            <li>My current set of rollers only has medium and large and it doesn&#x27;t produce a very long-lasting curl.</li>
            <li>I since have ordered new replacement rollers from Conair which they only had left certain sizes since my old model is discontinued, but will suffice until I find a model that has a heat dial that may confirm it can heat up hot enough.</li>
            <li>The unit didn&#x27;t heat fast enough and rollers did not retain heat to hold style</li>
            <li>I also allow them to sit in my hair until they are COMPLETELY cooled.  </li>
            <li>So, rollers from my old set are not interchangeable.  </li>
            <li>My old ones were early 2000.  </li>
            <li>So naturally it shortened the unit.  </li>
            <li>Naturally, I checked out customer reviews to find a reliable replacement.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my old one of 10 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I changed out the clips because I prefer a different style than the type that came with the set and the rollers still hold very well.  </li>
            <li>The old wire ones always slipped through my hair and never held the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li>I upgraded to these when the fuzzy coating on my old rollers was wearing off, and I was burning my fingers.</li>
            <li>Plus, I can do my whole head of hair at one time rather than in two segments since there are enough rollers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>At times, with my old set, it felt like my hair was going to burst into flames; that&#x27;s not a problem with this set.</li>
            <li>Time will tell, though, whether the felt covering the metal seam on the rollers will start to wear as it did on my old set.</li>
            <li>I kept my old set with the metal clips.  </li>
            <li>(my fingers always sizzled on my old set).</li>
            <li>Within a short amount of time the curl relaxed leaving my hair almost straight.</li>
            <li>This set has just the right size rollers that I needed (small and mediums were smaller than the other set, which is a positive) and they really do heat up fast and HOT.  </li>
            <li>set the flimsy gray roller binder thingys (they  hold the rollers in place, they look a little like a rounded hair clamp, but uglier) on the clean counter and then set to rolling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The rollers are very light weight and plastic and have a slit down the center...</li>
            <li>I have an old Conair Big Curls flocked set from about 15 years ago that I love because the curlers are 1.75\\&quot; and they sit on small posts (not bars, like these).  </li>
            <li>Then I use hot rollers to create loose curls on my chin-length hair.</li>
            <li>The temperature gets hot enough in a short time.</li>
            <li>I can easily make it last longer if I just make it hotter before I put them on and leave it on my hair longer, or with a little bit of hair product.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for several reasons though I already have a set of flocked heated rollers: First, my other set, though I really do like it, does not have enough of the right sized rollers (small and medium) for me to be able to set all my hair at once and second, it takes a bit long to heat up.  </li>
            <li>I paid attention to the reviews which said essentially 1) experiment to learn the right roller size for your hair type and style and, 2) also to discover how long you needed to keep the rollers in your hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is thin and fine textured, and about shoulder length, has its own natural curl and tends to frizz a little with all the hot and humid weather we&#x27;ve been having in the midwest the past month.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;ready in 85 seconds\\&quot; is not long enough for me.  </li>
            <li>I wasted about 45 minutes getting ready between heating them up, putting in the rollers and then making sure I left them in long enough.  </li>
            <li>hair is VERY very thick, I had enough rollers to go all around with nice curls.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a new set of rollers, there are some things to know about Conair&#x27;s Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bring back the old unit PLEASE!  </li>
            <li>It is rather poorly made and looks very cheap.</li>
            <li>This set of heated rollers heats up fast and has four sizes of rollers, small, med, large and extra-large.</li>
            <li>The dent in the middle of my hair that the last set of Conair left was mostly missing and with the new clamp style roller trapper thingys, rolling my hair was quicker and it was also a lot more solid, as only one roller began to unravel before the 12 minute timer sounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Wire clips generally don&#x27;t hold the hair as well, but they don&#x27;t leave dents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because even after a long day and the shape is all gone, my hair still looks much shinier and smoother than my regular hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I leave the rollers in for 15 minutes before gently and carefully removing them, and let my hair &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; for a minute before brushing.  </li>
            <li>Where the edge touches the skin, however, I slip in a was of TP to protect bare skin from the heat.</li>
            <li>It comes with various sizes rollers, but my only issue is that for the woman on the go it takes way too long to get hot.</li>
            <li>It is difficult to fit the rollers back into the tray once you have used them as there is no clear indicator for where each size will fit.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re not careful your hair might get tangled in the slits of the rollers.</li>
            <li>Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink]]</li>
            <li>but because the velvet was wearing thin and I thought an upgrade would be better.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this set though to those who are new to hot rollers since they are very simple to use and do not burn your fingers and for those are are looking for that slightly curled, Victoria Secret-ish model look!</li>
            <li>Because I have always been skeptical of their worth, at almost 30 years old, I have never owned a set of hot rollers, until now.  </li>
            <li>I have another set of their rollers (not as nice as these), and I actually ended up buying these clips because those were so useless.</li>
            <li>The clips have super long claws (albeit weak and flimsey claws) to really hold the curlers in place.  </li>
            <li>the style of clamps that hold the hair in place are not good either they do not hold the hair and roller secure.</li>
            <li>in past years I&#x27;ve rarely used.  </li>
            <li>And since I want curls, not a smooth bob, I&#x27;m prefer these to using a curling iron (which I find too hot for the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I usually leave the curlers on my hair for 15mins or a little more.</li>
            <li>Dry your hair completely</li>
            <li>I have board straight, thin hair and remember years ago I use hot rollers that worked.  </li>
            <li>If you were to step on one, you&#x27;d easily break it and the tines of the grippers are extremely thin.  </li>
            <li>If you were to step on one, you&#x27;d easily break it and the tines of the grippers are extremely thin.  </li>
            <li>The result usually stays in really good shape (big loose curls) for at least 4-6 hours WITHOUT any hair products.</li>
            <li>rollers heat up rather quickly but they are hard to figure out where to put them back once you take them out...</li>
            <li>do heat up in a short amount of time but to have them really hot enough, it takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li>They were not too hot to hold and it only took a few seconds to roll each individual section.  </li>
            <li>My previous Conair product&#x27;s heating elements are covered by plastic, with holes only large enough for the rollers.</li>
            <li>The velvet coating (and I do mean COATING) wears off quickly and these things burn your hands BIG TIME.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;The oil that is included with this purchase is also very nice.  </li>
            <li> Very nice curler.</li>
            <li> I was very happy with how I was able to return the item though and hope to find something else.</li>

            <li> Great, effective rollers -</li>
            <li> Hairspray works good too.  </li>
            <li> The clip idea is  superior, 3.</li>
            <li> good understanding of one needs</li>
            <li> This is a good method and a good set..</li>
            <li> This is a good method and a good set.</li>
            <li> so they fit the size of the roller perfectly.</li>
            <li> Putting heat on your hair isn&#x27;t good for it, period.</li>
            <li> These are some of the best hot curlers I have ever used!!  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, the clips work great.</li>
            <li> They work great to securely hold all 4 sizes of the rollers!</li>
            <li> I have been very satisfied with the end result.</li>
            <li> I have returned this product at a great cost to myself, the postage to return this item was more</li>
            <li> /&gt;Needless to say, I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I can proudly say that I love the Infiniti Pro by Conair Xtreme</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with these rollers.  </li>
            <li> Does a good job and very easy to do.</li>
            <li> I love it !</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Malfunction for sure!  </li>
            <li> Love!</li>
            <li> Better curl!  </li>
            <li> Clips bend out of shape and break somewhat easily (though they are GREAT at holding the rollers in place).&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT does the job, making beautiful curls and for that I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  </li>
            <li> My hair turned out great -- smooth with a hint of curl.</li>
            <li> I do warm these up longer than directions state</li>
            <li> /&gt;The added bonus of the Argan oil is nice since I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> These rollers are not on a post to warm them.  </li>
            <li> this is nice, but nothing to rave about....</li>
            <li> The curlers warm</li>
            <li> I really liked using the product.</li>
            <li> A bag or box would have been nice for storage.</li>
            <li> My wife was thrilled and used the rollers that Christmas afternoon.  </li>
            <li> My results have been good and even in the heat and humidity of Florida my hair stays styled for many hours after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My set came with some sample products of hair conditioner etc, which is always nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I found these rollers provided me with nice bouncy, shiny curls that lasted.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked the variety of sizes</li>
            <li> It would be nice if there were wire clips included, not just the plastic clips.</li>
            <li> Flocked rollers are &#x27;kind&#x27; to hair -- and tends to make it easier to get the job done without burning your fingers or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It heats up to a nice temperature in under 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Aside from that, if you don&#x27;t mind keeping the clips in a plastic bag, this is a nice set that does what it says it would do</li>
            <li> They do heat up nicely though.</li>
            <li> The curlers claim to warm up in 85 seconds.</li>
            <li> Like this but would be nice if there was somewhere to store the clips.</li>
            <li> Beautiful great looking hair with smooth curls that look professional are accompanished with this great equipment in minutes.  </li>
            <li> Bought these rollers to keep my hair styled for a special occasion -- family wedding -- and they did their job and worked great.  </li>
            <li> Looks great, has all the right features and will try it out soon!</li>
            <li> The rest work great but a good amount of them are the large size</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> it was very easy to put in my hair .</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I own an older version of this product that was very good.  </li>
            <li> I have used everything from the old wire clips to the plastic claw-style clips, and then ones that come with this set are the best at both holding the roller in place AND not \\&quot;denting\\&quot; your hair.  </li>
            <li> With that said, this is probably the best choice among today&#x27;s available hot roller sets.</li>
            <li> but when I do, I find the set heats up quickly, rolls nicely without frizzing my hair, and give me good results that hold.  </li>
            <li> These rollers were great for the first year.  </li>
            <li> It might be great for shorter hair, but unfortunately not mine.</li>
            <li> Though they do a great job, they don&#x27;t give me the defined curl I&#x27;m used to getting hot rollers.</li>
            <li> Also, these clips are very light gauge plastic.</li>
            <li> Also, these clips are very light gauge plastic.</li>
            <li> The clips that hold the rollers on are very secure</li>
            <li> They are very light weight and don&#x27;t grasp or hold the hair.  </li>
            <li> The rollers on this hairsetter heat up quite well &amp; stay hot;  and would create very nice curl</li>
            <li> but I am able to use them.  </li>
            <li> Now the era of Tourmaline and Ceramic is upon us - which of course has been proven to be better for your hair.  </li>
            <li> Both technologies give better heat distribution and will not strip hair of moisture or oils, which prevents the cuticle from damaging or splitting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was shiny, bouncy and had a ton of body and fat sexy waves.  </li>
            <li> I also hoped it would get warmer with more use</li>
            <li> there IS something better</li>
            <li> there IS something better</li>
            <li> I like that there are more rollers in this set than my compact version of my old-style Revlon rollers.  </li>
            <li> And you need a bit more space to store this set, because of the four cardboard strips which hold the clips.  </li>
            <li> The longer your hair the better in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I want my hair to look like it has more body I use these curlers.  </li>
            <li> i love it</li>
            <li> The results were at best inconsistent, certainly not enough to compensate for the damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I was so pleased to receive the Conair Xtreme Infiniti Pro Heat Rollers.</li>
            <li> I love my Infiniti Pro.  </li>
            <li> I love the clips but the heating time takes longer than advertised.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ceramic is said to hold heat better.</li>
            <li> and I love this.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great as a gift, except for yourself, but it really does do the job.</li>
            <li> Lovely set.</li>
            <li> But like I said, I&#x27;m used to getting a more defined curl.</li>
            <li> but she is totally pleased.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d be using rollers again, but love the curl and bounce created by these rollers.  </li>
            <li> I would have love if this set came with a lot more rollers.</li>
            <li> It was just okay.</li>
            <li> This seems to be more of a \\&quot;sample set\\&quot; of rollers.</li>
            <li> I love how i can just put the rollers on and do my&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the pins better.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro Ceramic Curlers seem to do a decent job of curling hair, though I did not always get great results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say more like 5 minutes to get them good and hot...</li>
            <li> They heat up fast, give great curl and go in and out easily.</li>
            <li> But the positives are they do get hot and the clips work good.</li>
            <li> have very fine, lightly layered hair.  </li>
            <li> My best solution was to remove the curlers and then secure the curls with clips until it was absolutely necessary to remove them.  </li>
            <li> I find these rollers pretty easy to put in and the clips work good.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the reviews, the clips are very good at holding the different size rollers.</li>
            <li> As far as the curlers I would give a 4.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did a great job of shipping.</li>
            <li> I think my mistake was trying first the \\&quot;Hot Tools HairSetter 20 Rollers Wax Core &amp; Ionic Technology HTS1401\\&quot;, which leaves beautiful bouncy curls.  </li>
            <li> Heat up fast good curls.</li>
            <li> my wife loved this product and she said it is fast and efficient and will make her life easy</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, a good set of curlers just not the right set for someone looking for super jumbo size curlers without the slit for smoothing and adding body.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other brand as I find that Conair produces the best products over the competition,  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and stores well.</li>
            <li> She raved about how easy they are to use and how it did &amp;#34;exactly</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.  </li>
            <li> When it was time to curl my hair, the rollers were easy to use.  </li>
            <li> easy to operate and keeping all day without any hair styling products</li>
            <li> The product shipped very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use&lt;br</li>
            <li> In most of the sets the clips are stored right inside the cover, but this one has no place for that many.</li>
            <li> NIce, hot, and they stay in.</li>
            <li> The clips are now cheap and flimsy and tangle together easily.  </li>
            <li> I have shoulder length fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine (but a lot of it) hair that falls about mid-back.  </li>
            <li> I will probably look for a set with more smaller rollers to get that curl :) For people with shorter/thinner hair, they might give a better curl than me with this set!</li>
            <li> The Conair is perfect as the rollers are easy to put in, and the clips hold tight!  </li>
            <li> Once I set my hair, I have huge flippy clips waving all over my head.  </li>
            <li> Another huge problem is that the curlers do NOT stay stable in the air.  </li>
            <li> I prefer them to the clips as the clips make dents in my hair and the pins fit tighter and leave no dents.</li>
            <li> Enjoy</li>
            <li> Bizarre.</li>
            <li> And the set is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It will retain a smooth shape, but no curl.</li>
            <li> I know some people have said they think the clips are cheap -</li>
            <li> but the clips are bulky though light weight.</li>
            <li> If you want smooth, shiny, non-frizzy hair try these out.</li>
            <li> Unit seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you have really obedient hair, this might be enough, but for most people, it&#x27;s better to let them warm up for 5 minutes or so.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never used them before and want to learn how, this might be a great set because you get all different sizes of rollers.</li>
            <li> If you want rollers of different sizes, though, this is a great bet.</li>
            <li> for me to do my hair and have a fantastic look.</li>
            <li> Have to put roller clips in another container as these won&#x27;t fit inside the unit.</li>
            <li> From the good old days of the plastic ones to the ones you had to use the U-shaped clips that burned your finger tips.  </li>
            <li> And... if this is the first hot roller unit you&#x27;ve ever bought and cannot compare, it might be good to you as well.  </li>
            <li> original Conair set has 12 jumbo size rollers; I hoped there would be more large rollers, but I&#x27;ve been able to use all but the smallest rollers.</li>
            <li> The rollers fit back very nicely also into the tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, very pleased with my new Infiniti Pro Ceramic Rollers and can recommend them to anyone wanting this type of product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a wonderful hot roller set that will be used often for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a limited 3-year warranty.</li>
            <li> There could be more medium rollers but other than that these are great</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I guess I am just use to the older kind of  curlers.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> She was extremely enthusiastic about the product, saying she&#x27;d highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hot roller.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these ceramic rollers and plugged them in to do my hair for a party I was attending.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this considering</li>
            <li> Perhaps users with medium-length hair will get more consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In closing, I&#x27;d recommend this product more for people with thinner, medium-length hair because the curlers add volume and my experience suggests that they don&#x27;t create a consistent curl with longer hair.xperimentation will improve my results.)</li>
            <li> Perhaps users with medium-length hair will get more consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;In closing, I&#x27;d recommend this product more for people with thinner, medium-length hair because the curlers add volume and my experience suggests that they don&#x27;t create a consistent curl with longer hair.</li>
            <li> Normally, my hair kind of fades in 6 hrs or so, but with these, in an hour its lost its curl.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I have been so excited about this product, that for the first time ever, I am excited about styling my hair each morning to create a lovely curled style.  </li>
            <li> (straight was better), so greatly appreciate the ease of instant curl.</li>
            <li> These do get nice and hot but not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She raved to me about the variety of curlers available, the ease of use and how quickly they warmed up for use.  </li>
            <li> For me, I use the large rollers around the top of my head, and then switch to the 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> First, it looks really good in my black &amp; white bathroom and it does an excellent job on my hair!</li>
            <li> Love them TY fast shipping</li>
            <li> Though in order to set a curl you need to heat the hair and then allow it to cool while curled for the style to set.</li>
            <li> : my curlers still are in good shape after two years of daily usage.</li>
            <li> The only good thing I can say is they mastered the plastic clips.</li>
            <li> cool to the touch.</li>
            <li> My neice uses them and her hair comes out bouncy and full of body.</li>
            <li> I love the fast start up heat.</li>
            <li> THE rollers work best when in your hair at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you want to travel with this set plan on more room in the suitcase for all these spring clips, they take up too much room</li>
            <li> The smaller curlers do a good job of curling shorter</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t seem to get as warm as my old set and our hair does not keep a set.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy and fast!</li>
            <li> Do like the Conair Xtreme roller are easy to use and never get to hot...</li>
            <li> They heat up quickly (about 2 minutes)</li>
            <li> The curlers heated up fairly quickly but did NOTHING for my hair.  </li>
            <li> Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]].</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time in many years, I&#x27;ve had one set of hot rollers that met my hair needs.</li>
            <li> I wanted something that heated quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure they&#x27;ll last for many years...</li>
            <li> A quick read of the directions, cleanse of the roller holders, and</li>
            <li> This set has 4 sized rollers and promised a quick heat up.  </li>
            <li> QUICK WARM-UP:</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and I like the claw clips instead of</li>
            <li> They do become very WARM but not hot.</li>
            <li> The clips hold the hot roller securely in place.  </li>
            <li> I found this model to not heat up very hot at all.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot or curl my hair like I wanted.</li>
            <li> Very pleased overall</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think they get very hot.</li>
            <li> I use hot rollers to smooth my hair and add body.  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s still not overly long, and they get good and</li>
            <li> The roller holders firmly held each roller in place, and after 15 minutes, I was able to quickly and easily remove each roller and was left with beautiful, springy curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dry  medium length hair and these rollers work good on it.  </li>
            <li> These seem not to have so many \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; that burn me, very comfy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for those who wish to have beautiful curls, but have limited time on their hands.  </li>
            <li> Fast heating and light to hold and carried anywhere.</li>
            <li> The curlers honestly don&#x27;t seem to heat up enough.  </li>
            <li> This is we worth the money.</li>
            <li> The directions say that users should experiment, trying different heats, times, and sizes for their hair type, and it may be that I just haven&#x27;t found the optimal setting for my own hair yet.</li>
            <li> I picked this set up for my wife after her old curler set had seen better days</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, straight, fine hair that gets kind of ridges in it if I don&#x27;t use a flat iron on it after it dries.  </li>
            <li> like it very much  The amount of rollers is quite adequate.</li>
            <li> Much better than spending 30 minutes to smooth it with a flat</li>
            <li> The unit heats up quickly and the rollers don&#x27;t feel too hot to handle.</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> Right now I just go the beauty parlor.</li>
            <li> I used every one of the 20 rollers included with the set and came out with a head full of soft, beautiful curls in less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wanted hot rollers that got hot but would not burn the ends of my fingers or my ears off!  </li>
            <li> Plus ceramic maintains heat much better than most other materials, so once the curlers get hot, they stay hot.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> The rollers heat up fast, they curl quick, and are totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the big clips, but these rollers do not get very hot.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are great, the only problem I have is there is  no place to put the clips and the clips are some what big.</li>
            <li> Since they heat up quickly they are ready to reuse in a flash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Heats very fast.  </li>
            <li> The other good thing about the clips is they hold much better than pins and don&#x27;t leave a dent in the hair in the way a long bobby pin does.</li>
            <li> But, that would hardly be a drawback if my hair came out great, which it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> The old rollers had a hole in the center and each one fit on its own post.  </li>
            <li> This set of hot rollers works well.  </li>
            <li> The giant rollers don&#x27;t curl your hair, they just give you more body.</li>
            <li> My curls looked and held a lot better with the red one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes</li>
            <li> I bought this product almost two years ago as my first hot roller set.</li>
            <li> and they do get hot</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for years.  </li>
            <li> I like to get the rollers as hot as possible because that allows a better set in your hair.  </li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for a frend it worked well for her but not for me those rollers were too hot for me to hold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> but I would really like to talk to them!  </li>
            <li> I need more heat, metal clips back and the tray to hold them inside the unit.  </li>
            <li> So, if the rollers are hot, I know how to handle them.  </li>
            <li> These were too hot to handle.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used them before going to work.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t know much about &amp;#34;rollers.&amp;#34;  I can comment on the construction and overall quality of the product: which are both very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was my first  time using this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--The set comes with 20 rollers (in four different sizes) and 20 hair clips (and you can order more if you need to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The curlers are hot to the touch but won&#x27;t burn</li>
            <li> Thanks Conair!</li>
            <li> They just don&#x27;t seem to get hot</li>
            <li> I bought these because they weren&#x27;t the cheapest, but I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper products would have worked better.</li>
            <li> I like the variety of sizes and my curls last a day or 2 :)</li>
            <li> At first glance, I thought the uncovered heating elements might be a problem.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Putting the rollers back in their slots is something of a puzzle, although the positioning is a bit more forgiving than anticipated.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set based on the versatility of  4 size rollers with the velvet flocking which I require in hot rollers.  </li>
            <li> Product is okay overall but dislike curler holders.</li>
            <li> The rollers get hot, but not SO hot that you take the skin off your fingers or have scalp burns.  </li>
            <li> Also the curl lasts pretty well and the set is versatile with many different sizes.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this set first.</li>
            <li> (FAST!)</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for about 35 years.  </li>
            <li> The curls are just nice big bouncy curls and it doesn&#x27;t look that unusual on me considering that I always wear my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for well over 20 years.  </li>
            <li> The wife says it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as ceramic curlers and therefore doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot rollers for years and</li>
            <li> Infiniti Pro by Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers were very easy to set up and pretty much ready to go straight out of the box.  </li>
            <li> The set has 8 large rollers, 4 jumbo, 4 medium(which are the one I use the most) and 4 tiny</li>
            <li> The jumbo size rollers are simply TOO large, I think, for most people -- they do not produce a curl at all.  </li>
            <li> you want a quick solution to fast curls, AND your hair isn&#x27;t superheavy or very long, you absolutely cannot do better than this set.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the curlers just don&#x27;t get hot enough, if they cool too quickly or what.</li>
            <li> These plastic tooth style clips hold very well, but from experience I can tell you that you should make sure you put them back in a bag when you are done.</li>
            <li> These plastic tooth style clips hold very well, but from experience I can tell you that you should make sure you put them back in a bag when you are done.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for someone who just wants to do something quick with their hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I learned how to use hot rollers when I was a teenager, so for me, rolling my whole head took about five minutes.  </li>
            <li> I have always preferred the wire clip as they hold the roller in my long hair much more efficiently.  </li>
            <li> I pretty much use all of the rollers except the smallest ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is long, however, so it may be that the top of the hair was not being treated as much.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, however, so it may be that the top of the hair was not being treated as much.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to set as strongly as the set I currently use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to set as strongly as the set I currently use.</li>
            <li> Putting hot rollers in my hair is very easy and using the Infiniti Pro by Conair and I was ready to go out the door in less than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Mine were loose on the top of the strand and curly at the bottom.</li>
            <li> The rollers do not create nice tight pin curl style rolls.</li>
            <li> If you weren&#x27;t selling enough you should be changing your marketing team NOT a product that was just fine before.  </li>
            <li> older set also tends to get too hot.</li>
            <li> There is a color indicator on one of the rolls when they are warm and ready to roll, but I heat them up a little longer, for about 10 min.</li>
            <li> This neat little set provides a nice variety of sizes, allk covered with a felt-like \\&quot;flocking\\&quot; which is gentle.  </li>
            <li> The clips work fine for the smaller rollers and since those are always on the bottom, I don&#x27;t really mind it too much.</li>
            <li> The clips are very convenient and secure enough.</li>
            <li> Big huge clips.</li>
            <li> The rollers smooth it out very well in a short amount of time.  </li>
            <li> The clips don&#x27;t hold the curlers except very loosely.therefore</li>
            <li> It is like a puzzle to fit them back on the rack.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast and does the job</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and is gentle on hair.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s very frizzy/coarse.</li>
            <li> and I think that&#x27;s FAST.  </li>
            <li> My hair is straight and slippery.  </li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago, had gone to the straight iron and the curling iron</li>
            <li> , I like the fact I can roll my hair and then get ready for work</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s done when I&#x27;m ready</li>
            <li> I really like the clips.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fall out, and grip really well,</li>
            <li> The clips are very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair really doesn&#x27;t wrap around much to hold the hair in place.</li>
            <li> /&gt;In fact, they work so fast</li>
            <li> very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very compact and don&#x27;t take up alot of room on your countertop</li>
            <li> The clips hold very well without leaving marks on your hair&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really cannot keep a curl with these.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think its my hair, as I can keep a curl with an iron as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> and I find it efficient--heat up the curlers as I get ready for work, heat for 2 minutes</li>
            <li> fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I generally end up using two hot rollers sets in order to get more of the smaller rollers.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> my rollers were ready for use.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been really neat about putting the rollers in at all and just grab sections and start rolling.</li>
            <li> and once I have my hair set, I just keep going with my routine of getting ready.  </li>
            <li> Much easier.  </li>
            <li> Much faster.  </li>
            <li> These work very well</li>
            <li> It would make smooth curls that would last all day.  </li>
            <li> I really like the Infiniti.</li>
            <li> But I would really like this style but with steam.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise the set is OK, just not what I expected for the money.</li>
            <li> Expected a better quality product from Conair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;anyone can really do it.</li>
            <li> The amazing thing about this product is that it takes less than 2 minutes to heat up for use on the hair!  </li>
            <li> Heats up pretty quick and provides lasting curls.</li>
            <li> curls were very pretty too -- for the first ten minutes, until humidity took over and made</li>
            <li> heats quickly, better than other options in this price range, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> In other words, users (unless they oversleep) should be able to curl their hair before work or school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> in all, very pleased with my new Infiniti Pro Ceramic Rollers and can recommend them to anyone wanting this type of product.eme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink]]</li>
            <li> My older set from Conair get much hotter.</li>
            <li> I got full bouncy curls, and this heats up so fast you don&#x27;t need alot of time in the morning for a different look.</li>
            <li> I love hot rollers and use them nearly everyday.  </li>
            <li> I use hot rollers nearly every day of my life, and I am quite familiar with the different types available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Conair used to be an EXTREMELY reliable brand, especially back in the 70s and 80s with their incredibly long-lasting blow-dryers, but those days are LONG gone.  </li>
            <li> They are amazing at holding the largest (and heaviest) rollers in place, even when there&#x27;s very little hair in them.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part about these is that they come with black clips---I much prefer them to pins.</li>
            <li> I have too long hair to go around the curlers to smooth and add body.&lt;br /&gt;2</li>
            <li> This product is light-years from the early days of hot rollers.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Clairol hot rollers which were getting so brittle that the plastic ends of the rollers were cracking off.  </li>
            <li> This set does heat up faster, but does not seem to get as hot as my old set.  </li>
            <li> I only use the largest ones and there are more than enough rollers to do my whole head.  </li>
            <li> my tried and true Conair set finally gave out on me.</li>
            <li> No matter how long I leave them plugged in or leave them in my hair, the rollers won&#x27;t get hot enough and will not hold the curl for more than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and need to use the wire clips from my old set for the upper layers of hair or there&#x27;s a tendency to get dents in my hair.</li>
            <li> My old Conair model had a heat dial from 1-12 in which I always had it high like on 10, and in replacing it with this model found that it didn&#x27;t heat hot at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve had the other set - which is essentially the same as this one but for the variations in roller size and the clips - I can say this is a GREAT set.</li>
            <li> These are nothing like the older model Conair rollers.  </li>
            <li> These heat up fast, stays warm for at least 20-25 minutes</li>
            <li> Now, you can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t know how to use hot rollers because I have been using Conair Hot Rollers (Big Curls) for almost 30 years.  </li>
            <li> main advantages to these rollers are 1.</li>
            <li> The price is decent, and I have tried Connair, Baby Bliss, and Remington.</li>
            <li> mainly use the rollers for smoothing my hair and adding bounce.</li>
            <li> The only styling tool I use on a regular basis is the Chi iron because most heated styling tools do nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> set does not work for me for two main reasons ...&lt;</li>
            <li> highly recommend them for your consideration as a purchase or gift.  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this set, but I figured what the heck</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this set of rollers.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The rollers were comfortable -- even though I had to use every single one!</li>
            <li> They are easy to use, not hot on your fingers</li>
            <li> I figured out how to avoid the dreaded clip crimp - quick flat iron after removing the rollers.  </li>
            <li> Surprised how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li> The rollers cooled as I walked around the house, drinking coffee, checking my email, you know normal morning routine</li>
            <li> A round brush and hair dryer would even work better than these did.</li>
            <li> Than on the third time, they stopped working, completely, I let them cool off and tried turning them on again, and nothing.</li>
            <li> I just have not been able to master curling my long hair with those slits up the middle.  </li>
            <li> I also think the set could eliminate the largest size which is too large even for long hair to hold a curl for very long and in addition, extend the set to 24-30 rollers with more of them in the medium sizes.  </li>
            <li> But for long-lasting curls, use a hot curling iron and clip your hair into curls to cool down.</li>
            <li> I just used the wire pins from the other set, and like that set, they stayed just fine in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My guess is if you have shoulder length hair that has a fine or thin texture, this unit will probably be fine.  </li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro (ceramic) electric rollers heat up very quickly and are ready to use in just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a little wave, these are fine, but they don&#x27;t really make or hold a curl.</li>
            <li> Do not heat properly and rollers are not the right size.</li>
            <li> I only use about 12 of the 20 rollers but the sizes seemed just right for what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t curl my hair and there was no way to put the curlers back into the right slots.</li>
            <li> Not enough of the right size curlers.</li>
            <li> The large and medium rollers left my hair straight, not even a wave.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers since high school and wasn&#x27;t a big fan then.</li>
            <li> nothing really new here, except for the clips.  </li>
            <li> nothing really new here, except for the clips.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;--The directions are easy to follow (though, oddly, the pictures included make it seem as if you&#x27;re going to come out of the process with an 80&#x27;s hair</li>
            <li> My hair was much shorter back then, but my shoulder length hair was just as straight as before I used them.  </li>
            <li> One complete and the second half there u are only as good as all departments.</li>
            <li> My daily routine after getting up is turn on the hot roller, make coffee, put curlers on while coffee is brewing, then hair and makeup.</li>
            <li> The rollers do no seem to get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> I let it heat for awhile to make sure I was not letting it heat all the way, but it still was not hot enough.</li>
            <li> I used another brand of hot rollers, and it finally stopped working after years of service.  </li>
            <li> I have to take the first ones out as the last ones go in, or else I&#x27;d be giving Orphan Annie a run for the money in the curly</li>
            <li> I used to use hot rollers religiously.  </li>
            <li> but rollers did not get hot enough for my hair.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t get the rollers hot enough I think</li>
            <li> It just simply does not get hot enough...and the contact is so soft that it does not leave any defined curl at all!</li>
            <li> last hot curler set was a Clairol that I bought in the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> it does not get hot enough to curl hair.</li>
            <li> I put the larger rollers on top and work my way down.</li>
            <li> This Extreme set by Conair does heat up quickly, but it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair with all day curl.  </li>
            <li> Whether you have long, short, fine or thick hair, this product is sure to do wonders.</li>
            <li> have basically straight hair, but it&#x27;s not naturally pin straight and has some natural wave to it.  </li>
            <li> The rollers heated up quickly (just watch the one curler in the front turn from red to white)</li>
            <li> set is better than my current set for two reasons; the very small rollers work for the short layers, and I can vary my result (soft waves, use the larger roller, more curly, use the smallest.)</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and these rollers fall right out, never get caught in my hair and make my hair look silky, shiny and with a bouncy curl that lasts.</li>
            <li> I use the medium and large rollers only, and can curl all my hair with it.</li>
            <li> The rollers come in 4 sizes -- 4 jumbo, 6 large, 6 medium-small, and 4 tiny.  </li>
            <li> However, if you like a certain size of rollers for your hair, whether large or small, you can be pretty certain that this won&#x27;t have enough of what you want.</li>
            <li> so I end up with a little wave instead of the smooth look I seek.</li>
            <li> My  main goal was to smooth out my hair and to give a small amount of curl.</li>
            <li> My current set of rollers only has medium and large and it doesn&#x27;t produce a very long-lasting curl.</li>
            <li> I since have ordered new replacement rollers from Conair which they only had left certain sizes since my old model is discontinued, but will suffice until I find a model that has a heat dial that may confirm it can heat up hot enough.</li>
            <li> The unit didn&#x27;t heat fast enough and rollers did not retain heat to hold style</li>
            <li> I also allow them to sit in my hair until they are COMPLETELY cooled.  </li>
            <li> So, rollers from my old set are not interchangeable.  </li>
            <li> My old ones were early 2000.  </li>
            <li> So naturally it shortened the unit.  </li>
            <li> Naturally, I checked out customer reviews to find a reliable replacement.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old one of 10 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I changed out the clips because I prefer a different style than the type that came with the set and the rollers still hold very well.  </li>
            <li> The old wire ones always slipped through my hair and never held the rollers in place.  </li>
            <li> I upgraded to these when the fuzzy coating on my old rollers was wearing off, and I was burning my fingers.</li>
            <li> Plus, I can do my whole head of hair at one time rather than in two segments since there are enough rollers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> At times, with my old set, it felt like my hair was going to burst into flames; that&#x27;s not a problem with this set.</li>
            <li> Time will tell, though, whether the felt covering the metal seam on the rollers will start to wear as it did on my old set.</li>
            <li> I kept my old set with the metal clips.  </li>
            <li> (my fingers always sizzled on my old set).</li>
            <li> Within a short amount of time the curl relaxed leaving my hair almost straight.</li>
            <li> This set has just the right size rollers that I needed (small and mediums were smaller than the other set, which is a positive) and they really do heat up fast and HOT.  </li>
            <li> set the flimsy gray roller binder thingys (they  hold the rollers in place, they look a little like a rounded hair clamp, but uglier) on the clean counter and then set to rolling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rollers are very light weight and plastic and have a slit down the center...</li>
            <li> I have an old Conair Big Curls flocked set from about 15 years ago that I love because the curlers are 1.75\\&quot; and they sit on small posts (not bars, like these).  </li>
            <li> Then I use hot rollers to create loose curls on my chin-length hair.</li>
            <li> The temperature gets hot enough in a short time.</li>
            <li> I can easily make it last longer if I just make it hotter before I put them on and leave it on my hair longer, or with a little bit of hair product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for several reasons though I already have a set of flocked heated rollers: First, my other set, though I really do like it, does not have enough of the right sized rollers (small and medium) for me to be able to set all my hair at once and second, it takes a bit long to heat up.  </li>
            <li> I paid attention to the reviews which said essentially 1) experiment to learn the right roller size for your hair type and style and, 2) also to discover how long you needed to keep the rollers in your hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is thin and fine textured, and about shoulder length, has its own natural curl and tends to frizz a little with all the hot and humid weather we&#x27;ve been having in the midwest the past month.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;ready in 85 seconds\\&quot; is not long enough for me.  </li>
            <li> I wasted about 45 minutes getting ready between heating them up, putting in the rollers and then making sure I left them in long enough.  </li>
            <li> hair is VERY very thick, I had enough rollers to go all around with nice curls.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a new set of rollers, there are some things to know about Conair&#x27;s Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bring back the old unit PLEASE!  </li>
            <li> It is rather poorly made and looks very cheap.</li>
            <li> This set of heated rollers heats up fast and has four sizes of rollers, small, med, large and extra-large.</li>
            <li> The dent in the middle of my hair that the last set of Conair left was mostly missing and with the new clamp style roller trapper thingys, rolling my hair was quicker and it was also a lot more solid, as only one roller began to unravel before the 12 minute timer sounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wire clips generally don&#x27;t hold the hair as well, but they don&#x27;t leave dents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because even after a long day and the shape is all gone, my hair still looks much shinier and smoother than my regular hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I leave the rollers in for 15 minutes before gently and carefully removing them, and let my hair &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; for a minute before brushing.  </li>
            <li> Where the edge touches the skin, however, I slip in a was of TP to protect bare skin from the heat.</li>
            <li> It comes with various sizes rollers, but my only issue is that for the woman on the go it takes way too long to get hot.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to fit the rollers back into the tray once you have used them as there is no clear indicator for where each size will fit.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not careful your hair might get tangled in the slits of the rollers.</li>
            <li> Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink]]</li>
            <li> but because the velvet was wearing thin and I thought an upgrade would be better.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this set though to those who are new to hot rollers since they are very simple to use and do not burn your fingers and for those are are looking for that slightly curled, Victoria Secret-ish model look!</li>
            <li> Because I have always been skeptical of their worth, at almost 30 years old, I have never owned a set of hot rollers, until now.  </li>
            <li> I have another set of their rollers (not as nice as these), and I actually ended up buying these clips because those were so useless.</li>
            <li> The clips have super long claws (albeit weak and flimsey claws) to really hold the curlers in place.  </li>
            <li> the style of clamps that hold the hair in place are not good either they do not hold the hair and roller secure.</li>
            <li> in past years I&#x27;ve rarely used.  </li>
            <li> And since I want curls, not a smooth bob, I&#x27;m prefer these to using a curling iron (which I find too hot for the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I usually leave the curlers on my hair for 15mins or a little more.</li>
            <li> Dry your hair completely</li>
            <li> I have board straight, thin hair and remember years ago I use hot rollers that worked.  </li>
            <li> If you were to step on one, you&#x27;d easily break it and the tines of the grippers are extremely thin.  </li>
            <li> If you were to step on one, you&#x27;d easily break it and the tines of the grippers are extremely thin.  </li>
            <li> The result usually stays in really good shape (big loose curls) for at least 4-6 hours WITHOUT any hair products.</li>
            <li> rollers heat up rather quickly but they are hard to figure out where to put them back once you take them out...</li>
            <li> do heat up in a short amount of time but to have them really hot enough, it takes a few minutes.</li>
            <li> They were not too hot to hold and it only took a few seconds to roll each individual section.  </li>
            <li> My previous Conair product&#x27;s heating elements are covered by plastic, with holes only large enough for the rollers.</li>
            <li> The velvet coating (and I do mean COATING) wears off quickly and these things burn your hands BIG TIME.  </li>
            <li> For my hair (middle of my back, moderate thickness), they give me a cute, casual bouncy look.</li>
            <li> The element does not heat up enough to produce a tight curl like I had with the older Conair I owned.  </li>
            <li> No more digging the clips into your skull or twisting the roller so tight to get it close enough to secure.</li>
            <li> remember the OLD hot rollers with those weird metal clips that never really kept them in place -- these new big plastic clips kept these in place and locked my hair down, nice and tight, with very little added weight.</li>
            <li> I allowed them to heat for several minutes, left the rollers in my hair for what I think should be long enough</li>
            <li> I actually think using these rollers is going to be quicker to do in the mornings than using my flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I tried a few times and it did curl, but the curls fell out quickly and my hair just looked like a mess.</li>
            <li> This set is very easy to use and hot enough for my crazy thick hair.</li>
            <li> I like the SUPER JUMBO size hot rollers (which are next to impossible to find).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been around long enough to know</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been around long enough to know</li>
            <li> I see some minor cracks in the rollers now, but this is after several years.  </li>
            <li> It also melted 2 of the rollers, when I noticed that it shut off, they had only been plugged in for 10 minutes, so it&#x27;s not because they were on for too long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like flat irons or curling irons.</li>
            <li> they create a flat spot in the curl.</li>
            <li> Not easy to use &amp; hard to hold curlers on with fine hair.</li>
            <li> My pins do not fit the new curlers or I would use them instead of the clips.</li>
            <li> , I tried them again and this time put them in (again with my hair 100% dry) and left them in for about thirty minutes.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;d be surprised how just a few days clothes and shoes make the entire weight limit.</li>
            <li> currently use a \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; coated set where the clips do the work, but this style of clip is rather loose.</li>
            <li> currently use a \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; coated set where the clips do the work, but this style of clip is rather loose.</li>
            <li> Providing a place for storage in the actual curler set probably wouldn&#x27;t work due to the heating temps on the plastic or the sheer amount of room you&#x27;d need for 20 clips!  </li>
            <li> Even though I heat the rollers much longer than directed and leave them in my hair much longer than directed, they fail to curl my hair sufficient for a single comb-through.  </li>
            <li> I thought that with both of them, I could set my hair beginning with the small and medium rollers on this one, and while they were cooling, finish up with the other, more slowly heating set.  </li>
            <li> These curlers are a nightmare-they do not sit on a post but rather a metal strip and the curlers are difficult to move on or off and impossible to fit all curlers in the set-there are no definite spots for specific size curlers-I have owned many sets in my life</li>
            <li> At least twice as much as I need.</li>
            <li> The ultimate is to blow dry the hair, to dry it almost dry, give it some volume, and roll the hair in the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is 4-6 inches long</li>
            <li> Really strange.</li>
            <li> but they take too long</li>
            <li> Then I figured, maybe I didn&#x27;t leave the rollers in long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re hair isn&#x27;t long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--It doesn&#x27;t take long to use the curlers.</li>
            <li> and I took too long to decide to return it</li>
            <li> I have long, medium thickness hair</li>
            <li> how long I keep the rollers in my hair.</li>
            <li> I am not a professional when it comes</li>
            <li> The curlers are NOT large enough ...</li>
            <li> have the other Infiniti Pro that has just big rollers which I wanted for my long hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;--The rollers occasionally caused creases in my hair (though admittedly that may be due to my inexperience using them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long hair (almost to my waist), and don&#x27;t have a problem getting my hair to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because I don&#x27;t get the hold I want, I&#x27;m spray tons of products on my hair causing it to dry out.  </li>
            <li> Since I have been using the Infiniti Pro my hair feels softer and is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I do my hair by washing, then air drying (I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair unless I&#x27;m in a hurry.)</li>
            <li> Then, I just take my dry hair</li>
            <li> However, even when making an effort, it&#x27;s pretty tough to touch the heating element on this set, so I don&#x27;t consider it to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I researched these devices online for my wife who still has limited computer savvy.</li>
            <li> It still works, but it irks, though it&#x27;s not worth sending the curlers back at all.  </li>
            <li> I think the \\&quot;set\\&quot; is loose because my hair is not \\&quot;held\\&quot; in the roller.  </li>
            <li> have a slit down the middle and they slide on to it.  </li>
            <li> and I have trouble getting my hair to stay on the roller long enough to put the clips in place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been more disappointed with a product especially from Conair than this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only managed to get curls that were in between tight and loose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although, I like the big clips that come with the rollers, they don&#x27;t hold the rollers as tightly as the wire slip on clip</li>
            <li> So I washed and dried my hair, just like I usually do, plugged the curlers in, set a timer for ten minutes (not sure how long you really have to wait for these to heat up</li>
            <li> /&gt;--The rollers are hard to put back into their container because each roller has a specific spot</li>
            <li> Put them in carefully or they will make lines in your hair.</li>
            <li> I have always stored them carefully.  </li>
            <li> Curls set in a few minutes and last all day.  </li>
            <li> Be careful for you fingers&#x27; sake when handling them.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are to big, so i&#x27;m forced to use the 4 tiny ones.  </li>
            <li> Then the hot metal comes in direct contact with my hair or scalp and is very uncomfortable, not to mention, unsafe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But it will heat up as long as the cover is down.  </li>
            <li> The downside is that the curls only stay in for about a half hour!</li>
            <li> My long hair doesn&#x27;t snag on  them like it would with my previous set.  </li>
            <li> last set of rollers I bought had the unfortunate problem of not heating up enough to actually curl my hair.  </li>
            <li> would recommend to other customers.</li>
            <li> Sadly, yesterday morning I plugged in the unit and came back to roll my hair only 5 minutes later and the clips and rollers were melting.  </li>
            <li> The machine is small enough that you could pack it in a suitcase.</li>
            <li> This set comes with the spring clips which do not hold the curler in place at all, (long hair is heavy).  </li>
            <li> Also, unlike my other set, this came with no pouch for the clips which irked me a bit because</li>
            <li> The clips are terrible for the bigger rollers, I have to watch out turning my head so they don&#x27;t fall off the top!</li>
            <li> This method cuts down on the damage from blow-drying when you are brushing and pulling on wet hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American woman with lots of very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> However, the design has been changed for the worse in the new model.  </li>
            <li> There was a concern regarding the clips due to several negative comments about the quality of them</li>
            <li> But ceramic heat is much less damaging than other types of heat.</li>
            <li> The rollers are hard to put back in place.  </li>
            <li> The rollers are confusing to insert back into the tray.  </li>
            <li> Still a lot quicker than the average roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is about shoulder length with average thickness; the rollers would not stay in my hair using these clips.  </li>
            <li> , the only complaint I have is that the clips do not have  a storage compartment</li>
            <li> So, this set of rollers is recommended for thin hair and for soft waves.</li>
            <li> I prefer the curles to have a small hole at the bottom, not a huge slit up the middle of the curler.  </li>
            <li> The ceramic base holds the heat well - much better than the plastic rollers of days gone by.</li>
            <li> You probably won&#x27;t hand it down to your daughter in 20 years, but the clips should make it a few years, at least...very similar to sets put out in the past 5 years...</li>
            <li> Not a perfect solution, but at least the clips won&#x27;t be laying all over the counter or crammed in a drawer full of all my other things!</li>
            <li> if traveling abroad, besides, there is no dual voltage switch, so you&#x27;d need a step down transformer.</li>
            <li> if traveling abroad, besides, there is no dual voltage switch, so you&#x27;d need a step down transformer.</li>
            <li> They always start dropping down.  </li>
            <li> and it still dips down.  </li>
            <li> The curl twirls down in a coil without creases.</li>
            <li> But this product has very weak grips, does not hold hair in place and the rollers cause creases in my hair, very ugly marks from the rollers, probably because of my lack of experience using them, but with the Hot Tools Hairsetter it wasn&#x27;t so hard, this last one provides rollers that can be hold without getting burned and of a better quality.</li>
            <li> I keep it sorta short, slightly below my shoulders because I like it to have a little body and when it gets longer I have a hard time getting it bouncy and</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t managed to get very loose or very tight curls yet.</li>
            <li> I used the wire pins in the previous curler set I owned.</li>
            <li> up a lot of room on my counter for something that does less than the mini one.</li>
            <li> During that week an a half.  </li>
            <li> The curlers seem less damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li> By the time I got to the office, the slight wave they gave me was gone.  </li>
            <li> They heat up in probably less than 5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> the metals prongs my previous set had.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and long.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re basically butterfly clips that are a little shorter than a typical butterfly clip</li>
            <li> travel, this set is not extremely large (the size of a small shoebox, let&#x27;s say)</li>
            <li> It was just a little bit weighty.</li>
            <li> (it can still be a little damp) and start rolling it up.  </li>
            <li> I wish it had come with the u-shpaed pins my old set had, rather than the useless clips that do not hold the rollers tight on your head.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have very thick hair and is only shoulder length.</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and coarse</li>
            <li> The rollers do not fit in the heating box</li>
            <li> I bought a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I bought a few years ago.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I did a bit of research and landed on these for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> to have my hair hold a curl; but after a few hours, they fall out.</li>
            <li> but within a few hours the curls fall and hair expands to frizz.</li>
            <li> The rollers seemed to really not fit on the wire heat element that they were provided with...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re a bit flimsy, but they keep the rollers in place firmly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m simply not thrilled with this set due to the split groves and spring clips.</li>
            <li> You probably won&#x27;t hand it down to your daughter in 20 years, but the clips should make it a few years, at least...</li>
            <li> and unfortunately I threw my last set away not because they didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> So I am sorry to say that I was totally dis-satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> It was unbelievable.  </li>
            <li> enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to let them heat up longer, and see if that helps, but I am pretty disappointed in the product if it can&#x27;t do what I intended it to do.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was defect or not</li>
            <li> You could travel with it, but it would take up quite a bit of space in a small carryon or even a small size rolling suitcase.</li>
            <li> Her hair is thick, fluffy and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> It also came with a small bottle of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> When I have used curlers in the past, the curl (style) has lasted for days.</li>
            <li> I am past my return mark since I tried to give them every chance.</li>
            <li> It hardly produced a curl.  </li>
            <li> I am having a hard time trying to wrap my hair around the curlers.</li>
            <li> Difficult to wrap hair around curlers-the hair keeps slipping off.</li>
            <li> And now it&#x27;s too late to return for refund!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I let them heat up for at least 5 to 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My stylist says that this is the least damaging method to styling hair</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how thick it is.)</li>
            <li> I am forced to find something else and hope it does what your rollers used to</li>
            <li> Idk if I just haven&#x27;t mastered it or maybe my hair is just too thick?</li>
            <li> As I have thick hair, I allowed my rollers to heat up for about 10 minutes before using them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small but works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small but works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so about half are useless.</li>
            <li> hair is VERY thick and hard to manage.</li>
            <li> Additionally, the clips are useless for holding rollers firmly.</li>
            <li> I have to say after using this product it is not good...</li>
            <li> I have long hair and these splits are horrible as my long hair will get caught and tangle when trying to remove the roller.  </li>
            <li> My hair is very hard to control or use rollers on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Latina and have very, very thick hair.  </li>
            <li> already one has a prong broken off.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what it is about these rollers - whether it is the ceramic base or the flocking on the rollers or the clips that hold the rollers in place that make them actually work on my hair.</li>
            <li> I also wish the rollers in today&#x27;s sets would sit on a stem instead of the split in the roller which fits onto a long plate in the base.  </li>
            <li> I have used rollers and curling irons for years - this by far was the worst set I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> they came on and keep them clipped to that, but alas I know those will just become useless at some point.</li>
            <li> I gave one star because the goods sent very late from the estimated time, and the box is damaged as another person&#x27;s used, and the goods are very very dusty.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit annoying that there isn&#x27;t anywhere to store the clips, but I just put them in a cosmetic bag and call it a day.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t leak, the bottle was tiny and flimsy.t, it smelled horrible, like patchouli incense, yukka.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to use this product in Australia as it was 120v and</li>
            <li> My hair is difficult to wrap around the rollers.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also difficult to pinch the clips and position them on to the roller.  </li>
            <li> Uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I am not impressed with these.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I bought this set based on the reviews that had previously been written and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it does not have an auto shut off, which I need so badly at my age.  </li>
            <li> So disappointing.</li>
            <li> This product is LOUSY !  </li>
            <li> (me not doing that in the beginning, bad results).</li>
            <li> My hair gets caught inside or gets those ugly</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I was SO disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I hate looking like a clipped bag of potato chips with these plastic things on my head.  </li>
            <li> My hair looked like crap.  </li>
            <li> Metal clips is still the way to go even with discomfort--beauty is painful!</li>
            <li> well.i am very disappointed in this product.i</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> For the price i&#x27;m very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> , it smelled horrible, like patchouli incense, yukka.  </li>
            <li> However, it was the worst set of rollers Conair ever put out.  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  </li>
            <li> The cheaper Conair rollers have absolutely awful clips.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> The unit didn&#x27;t heat fast enough and rollers did not retain heat to hold style&lt;br /&gt;long enough for me .</li>
            <li> The clips don&#x27;t hold the curlers except very loosely.therefore it doesn&#x27;t curl my hair well.i am very disappointed in this product.i don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> The rollers are great, the only problem I have is there is  no place to put the clips and the clips are some what big.</li>
            <li> Difficult to wrap hair around curlers-the hair keeps slipping off. Additionally, the clips are useless for holding rollers firmly. Very disappointed.  Returning asap!</li>
            <li> Do not heat properly and rollers are not the right size.</li>
            <li> Put them in carefully or they will make lines in your hair.</li>
            <li> I own an older version of this product that was very good.  However, the design has been changed for the worse in the new model.  The clips are now cheap and flimsy and tangle together easily.  The rollers do not fit in the heating box right.  The old rollers had a hole in the center and each one fit on its own post.  These have a slit instead.  It is like a puzzle to fit them back on the rack. A hassle and time wasting. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast and does the job</li>
            <li> I have dry  medium length hair and these rollers work good on it.  I like the different size rollers.&lt;br /&gt;Cheapest place I found</li>
            <li> This set of hot rollers works well.  It heats up fast and is gentle on hair.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Still getting used to the roller sizes.  They aren&#x27;t the same size rollers as the set I bought 12 years ago (these curlers last a loooong time!). Heats very fast.  I used the wire pins in the previous curler set I owned. I prefer them to the clips as the clips make dents in my hair and the pins fit tighter and leave no dents. My pins do not fit the new curlers or I would use them instead of the clips.</li>
            <li> I gave this item 1 star because it physically appears as described.  However, it does nothing for my hair!  I am very disappointed.  These are nothing like the older model Conair rollers.  My hair is 4-6 inches long and I have trouble getting my hair to stay on the roller long enough to put the clips in place.  Even though I heat the rollers much longer than directed and leave them in my hair much longer than directed, they fail to curl my hair sufficient for a single comb-through.  I have tried several combinations of efforts to achieve body and/or curl, but now I give up.  And now it&#x27;s too late to return for refund!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> Heat up fast good curls.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for this product. Found it here. I love it ! It&#x27;s perfect and gets the curls done ! It&#x27;s easy to use and stores well.</li>
            <li> The giant rollers don&#x27;t curl your hair, they just give you more body. The rest work great but a good amount of them are the large size so about half are useless. The curls didn&#x27;t hold up as well as the red travel set they have on here. My curls looked and held a lot better with the red one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Takes up a lot of room on my counter for something that does less than the mini one.</li>
            <li> heats quickly, better than other options in this price range, I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love them TY fast shipping</li>
            <li> This product is light-years from the early days of hot rollers. The rollers are lighter and easier to manage than others. They do become very WARM but not hot. To it&#x27;s advantage, that means the rollers shouldn&#x27;t burn your head once they&#x27;re set in place. Though in order to set a curl you need to heat the hair and then allow it to cool while curled for the style to set. So, this set of rollers is recommended for thin hair and for soft waves. But for long-lasting curls, use a hot curling iron and clip your hair into curls to cool down. The clips for the rollers also are cheap, with bits of extra plastic not trimmed off, and feel flimsy and thin. You get what you pay for. I still recommend a curling iron over rollers.</li>
            <li> As far as the curlers I would give a 4.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon did a great job of shipping. There were no clips so I opted for return&lt;br /&gt;I give ups for shipping  One they supposedly&lt;br /&gt;Brought return shipping three nights. We were working all three nights. They left no message saying they had been by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went by ups three times.  During that week an a half.  So I decided it was easier topay for two sets. One complete and the second half there u are only as good as all departments. So I give youa one</li>
            <li> like it very much  The amount of rollers is quite adequate. The temperature gets hot enough in a short time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product almost two years ago as my first hot roller set. I use it almost daily and it still works GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is VERY thick and hard to manage. (I can even floss using my hair if I want to. That&#x27;s how thick it is.) This set is very easy to use and hot enough for my crazy thick hair. The clips are very convenient and secure enough. My daily routine after getting up is turn on the hot roller, make coffee, put curlers on while coffee is brewing, then hair and makeup. I usually leave the curlers on my hair for 15mins or a little more. Depends on how slowI finish my makeup. The result usually stays in really good shape (big loose curls) for at least 4-6 hours WITHOUT any hair products. (It would last shorter on a humid day.) I can easily make it last longer if I just make it hotter before I put them on and leave it on my hair longer, or with a little bit of hair product. I have a lot of hair and it&#x27;s very frizzy/coarse. I absolutely love this hot roller. Because even after a long day and the shape is all gone, my hair still looks much shinier and smoother than my regular hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*the photo: my curlers still are in good shape after two years of daily usage. The ceramic coatings are still all on there. Hasn&#x27;t worn off at all. *</li>
            <li> Looks great, has all the right features and will try it out soon!</li>
            <li> i like this set - but i wish it was hotter.  it just does not hold the set well.  could be my hair</li>
            <li> I wanted hot rollers that got hot but would not burn the ends of my fingers or my ears off!  I do warm these up longer than directions state and they do get hot but I am able to use them.  The clips that came with these are the best I have ever used!</li>
            <li> Surprised how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li> Put your hair in a pony tail, seperate strands and roll. It&#x27;s easy and fast! (My hair dresser taught me the pony tail trick.) I have very long hair and these rollers fall right out, never get caught in my hair and make my hair look silky, shiny and with a bouncy curl that lasts. I promise you won&#x27;t be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for years.  From the good old days of the plastic ones to the ones you had to use the U-shaped clips that burned your finger tips.  Now the era of Tourmaline and Ceramic is upon us - which of course has been proven to be better for your hair.  Both technologies give better heat distribution and will not strip hair of moisture or oils, which prevents the cuticle from damaging or splitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am Latina and have very, very thick hair.  I straighten my hair with a keratin treatment every 3 to 4 months.  Putting hot rollers in my hair is very easy and using the Infiniti Pro by Conair and I was ready to go out the door in less than 30 minutes.  I like to get the rollers as hot as possible because that allows a better set in your hair.  The \\&quot;ready in 85 seconds\\&quot; is not long enough for me.  I let them heat up for at least 5 to 10 minutes.  I also allow them to sit in my hair until they are COMPLETELY cooled.  The clips hold the hot roller securely in place.  The variety of different sized \\&quot;flocked\\&quot; (fuzzy coating that grab your hair) rollers in this set offer a variety of different hair-do, up-do, and glamor style possibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The added bonus of the Argan oil is nice since I use [[ASIN:B002QG6P9G Agadir  Argan Oil Spray Treatment]] prior to blow drying and as a finishing mist.  Argan oil is a great heat protector and moisturizer to hair. It restores shine, cares for the scalp, and minimizing the damage caused by split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful hot roller set that will be used often for years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with a limited 3-year warranty.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these ceramic rollers and plugged them in to do my hair for a party I was attending. My hair is thin and fine textured, and about shoulder length, has its own natural curl and tends to frizz a little with all the hot and humid weather we&#x27;ve been having in the midwest the past month. My  main goal was to smooth out my hair and to give a small amount of curl. The rollers heated up quickly (just watch the one curler in the front turn from red to white) and I put them in. The best part was the hair clips! They work great to securely hold all 4 sizes of the rollers! No more digging the clips into your skull or twisting the roller so tight to get it close enough to secure. I only use about 12 of the 20 rollers but the sizes seemed just right for what I wanted. The flocked curlers didn&#x27;t tug on my hair and the temperature for setting seemed perfect. My hair turned out great -- smooth with a hint of curl. I could have kept the rollers in longer or used the smaller rollers if I had wanted a tighter curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I&#x27;m not giving this 5 stars is because of the storage problem of those 20 plastic curler grips. As perfect as they are for securing the curler, they take up a LOT OF SPACE. In most of the sets the clips are stored right inside the cover, but this one has no place for that many. I solved the clutter problem by obtaining a drawstring bag and putting all the clips in there and then hanging it from my towel rack next to where I plug in the curler set. Not a perfect solution, but at least the clips won&#x27;t be laying all over the counter or crammed in a drawer full of all my other things! Providing a place for storage in the actual curler set probably wouldn&#x27;t work due to the heating temps on the plastic or the sheer amount of room you&#x27;d need for 20 clips!  I hope they hold up well to constant use, as I said, they&#x27;re some type of plastic. Will let you know if they don&#x27;t!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this to replace the [[ASIN:B00007M0CP Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Multisized Hot Rollers, Pink]] (actually mine are blue) I bought a few years ago.

            <li> These are some of the best hot curlers I have ever used!!  They heat up quickly (about 2 minutes) and I think that&#x27;s FAST.  There are several sized curlers in the set to give you different types of curls.  Since they heat up quickly they are ready to reuse in a flash.&lt;br /&gt;I felt the price for these was comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend them for your consideration as a purchase or gift.  Enjoy&lt;br /&gt;The oil that is included with this purchase is also very nice.  Almost used all of it....LOL</li>
            <li> My hair is straight and slippery.  I keep it sorta short, slightly below my shoulders because I like it to have a little body and when it gets longer I have a hard time getting it bouncy and curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last set of rollers I bought had the unfortunate problem of not heating up enough to actually curl my hair.  But these curlers, which look practically the same, do heat up and do curl my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this set, but I figured what the heck, my hair can&#x27;t look any messier and undone.  So I washed and dried my hair, just like I usually do, plugged the curlers in, set a timer for ten minutes (not sure how long you really have to wait for these to heat up, the name includes the words; instant heat, but maybe ten minutes is considered &#x27;instant&#x27; in the heated roller industry).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I set the flimsy gray roller binder thingys (they  hold the rollers in place, they look a little like a rounded hair clamp, but uglier) on the clean counter and then set to rolling my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned how to use hot rollers when I was a teenager, so for me, rolling my whole head took about five minutes.  The rollers didn&#x27;t feel very warm to me (no burnt digits, bonus!), so I wasn&#x27;t prepared for great results when I set a timer for 12 minutes.  The rollers cooled as I walked around the house, drinking coffee, checking my email, you know normal morning routine (best things about rollers, no time wastage - they are the five minute bread of the hair styling world) and when the timer dinged I removed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now comes the amazing part, my hair looked great.  It was shiny, bouncy and had a ton of body and fat sexy waves.  The dent in the middle of my hair that the last set of Conair left was mostly missing and with the new clamp style roller trapper thingys, rolling my hair was quicker and it was also a lot more solid, as only one roller began to unravel before the 12 minute timer sounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the argan oil, I didn&#x27;t use it, it smelled horrible, like patchouli incense, yukka.  Thank goodness it didn&#x27;t leak, the bottle was tiny and flimsy.t, it smelled horrible, like patchouli incense, yukka.  Thank goodness it didn&#x27;t leak, the bottle was tiny and flimsy.</li>
            <li> The front row of rollers melted in device. Went to curl my hair, pulled out rollers with stretching melted plastic bottoms. I believe it to be a fire hazard.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift for a frend it worked well for her but not for me those rollers were too hot for me to hold</li>
            <li> I have used hair setters for 35 years.  For the price i&#x27;m very disappointed.  The rollers do no seem to get hot enough.  The set has 8 large rollers, 4 jumbo, 4 medium(which are the one I use the most) and 4 tiny rollers(which in past years I&#x27;ve rarely used.  The rollers are to big, so i&#x27;m forced to use the 4 tiny ones.  I&#x27;m now going to have to order another 4 medium rollers which will be about another $12.00.  Because I don&#x27;t get the hold I want, I&#x27;m spray tons of products on my hair causing it to dry out.  These rollers are not on a post to warm them.  They have put 3 metal bars in the unit with the rollers have a slit down the middle and they slide on to it.  So, rollers from my old set are not interchangeable.  The only good thing I can say is they mastered the plastic clips.</li>
            <li> this is nice, but nothing to rave about....for me, there are too many of the X-Large curlers....and the small curlers are too small...so not enough medium curlers.  I have shoulder length fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for over 20 years.  My hair is thick and long.  I&#x27;ve gone through several Conair rollers in my lifetime and unfortunately I threw my last set away not because they didn&#x27;t work but because the velvet was wearing thin and I thought an upgrade would be better.  My old ones were early 2000.  I don&#x27;t know who the think tank was on this but I would really like to talk to them!  The only thing compact about this is that they removed the tray in it that held the metal prong-style clips. So naturally it shortened the unit.  Now, I need a basket or Ziploc bag to hold all these bulky plastic hinged clips that don&#x27;t get close enough to the scalp for a tighter curl and I have to find a place to store them! THAT is NOT a space saver!  Metal clips is still the way to go even with discomfort--beauty is painful! I&#x27;d rather have the metal clips, thank you.  I hate looking like a clipped bag of potato chips with these plastic things on my head.  The element does not heat up enough to produce a tight curl like I had with the older Conair I owned.  Why re-invent the wheel Conair?  If you weren&#x27;t selling enough you should be changing your marketing team NOT a product that was just fine before.  I need more heat, metal clips back and the tray to hold them inside the unit.  It takes me longer to roll my hair and I do this every morning for work!  I&#x27;ve used this unit for over a week now and I had hoped it would grow on me and it has not.  I also hoped it would get warmer with more use and it has not.  I&#x27;ve never been more disappointed with a product especially from Conair than this.  Bring back the old unit PLEASE!  I am forced to find something else and hope it does what your rollers used to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to be a total discourager here.  My guess is if you have shoulder length hair that has a fine or thin texture, this unit will probably be fine.  And... if this is the first hot roller unit you&#x27;ve ever bought and cannot compare, it might be good to you as well.  I&#x27;ve been around long enough to know there IS something better and I would like to have that again.you as well.  I&#x27;ve been around long enough to know there IS something better and I would like to have that again.</li>
            <li> my wife loved this product and she said it is fast and efficient and will make her life easy</li>
            <li> I found this model to not heat up very hot at all.  My old Conair model had a heat dial from 1-12 in which I always had it high like on 10, and in replacing it with this model found that it didn&#x27;t heat hot at all. I don&#x27;t have very thick hair and is only shoulder length. I let it heat for awhile to make sure I was not letting it heat all the way, but it still was not hot enough. Really strange. Amazon was great with my return.  I since have ordered new replacement rollers from Conair which they only had left certain sizes since my old model is discontinued, but will suffice until I find a model that has a heat dial that may confirm it can heat up hot enough.</li>
            <li> I used another brand of hot rollers, and it finally stopped working after years of service.  Naturally, I checked out customer reviews to find a reliable replacement.  The Infiniti Pro does a good job for me.  I paid attention to the reviews which said essentially 1) experiment to learn the right roller size for your hair type and style and, 2) also to discover how long you needed to keep the rollers in your hair.  I also paid attention to one reviewer who said that she closes the lid after selecting each roller to retain the heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, lightly layered hair.  For me, I use the large rollers around the top of my head, and then switch to the 1&amp;#34; diameter rollers for the remainder of my hair.  I leave the rollers in for 15 minutes before gently and carefully removing them, and let my hair &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; for a minute before brushing.  I have been very satisfied with the end result.</li>
            <li> These heat up fast, stays warm for at least 20-25 minutes and I love it! I bought it because of the reviews, the clips are very good at holding the different size rollers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item not knowing that it was not Dual Voltage. I was unable to use this product in Australia as it was 120v and Australia runs 240v. I have returned this product at a great cost to myself, the postage to return this item was more then I actually paid for it. So I am sorry to say that I was totally dis-satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> works great...cool to the touch. lives up to its marketing.  would recommend to other customers. The  clips hold in rollers</li>
            <li> These curlers are a nightmare-they do not sit on a post but rather a metal strip and the curlers are difficult to move on or off and impossible to fit all curlers in the set-there are no definite spots for specific size curlers-I have owned many sets in my life and I lan to replace these as soon as I can</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very hot or curl my hair like I wanted. They seem to be good rollers and I am keeping them but if you are looking for something to give lots of curl and you have a lot of hair. Then I wouldn&#x27;t get them</li>
            <li> The curlers heated up fairly quickly but did NOTHING for my hair.  The large and medium rollers left my hair straight, not even a wave.  The smallest curler left my hair kinky curly and unmanageable.  Save your money and use a curling iron.  A round brush and hair dryer would even work better than these did.</li>
            <li> I returned the item. It didn&#x27;t curl my hair and there was no way to put the curlers back into the right slots. Big huge clips.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my old one of 10 years. The current model did not have a temperature adjustment. It is rather poorly made and looks very cheap. But it will heat up as long as the cover is down.  Unfortunately it does not have an auto shut off, which I need so badly at my age.  Would buy a more expensive model next time with all my bells and whistles, if there is such an animal.</li>
            <li> Great, effective rollers - my hair will hold a curl with these and it never has done that with a curling iron.  I figured out how to avoid the dreaded clip crimp - quick flat iron after removing the rollers.  It is a little bit annoying that there isn&#x27;t anywhere to store the clips, but I just put them in a cosmetic bag and call it a day.</li>
            <li> This rollers did nothing for my hair.  I have board straight, thin hair and remember years ago I use hot rollers that worked.  My hair was much shorter back then, but my shoulder length hair was just as straight as before I used them.  Probably that my hair just doesn&#x27;t curl.  My neice uses them and her hair comes out bouncy and full of body.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for my old Clairol hot rollers which were getting so brittle that the plastic ends of the rollers were cracking off.  This set does heat up faster, but does not seem to get as hot as my old set.  I wish it had come with the u-shpaed pins my old set had, rather than the useless clips that do not hold the rollers tight on your head.  I also wish the rollers in today&#x27;s sets would sit on a stem instead of the split in the roller which fits onto a long plate in the base.  I also think the set could eliminate the largest size which is too large even for long hair to hold a curl for very long and in addition, extend the set to 24-30 rollers with more of them in the medium sizes.  With that said, this is probably the best choice among today&#x27;s available hot roller sets.</li>
            <li> Do like the Conair Xtreme roller are easy to use and never get to hot...I use them every day and give a great curl.</li>
            <li> These rollers were great for the first year.  Sadly, yesterday morning I plugged in the unit and came back to roll my hair only 5 minutes later and the clips and rollers were melting.  Malfunction for sure!  I have always stored them carefully.  I will not purchase this Conair product again.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the use of this product. The curlers warm but I never get the results I am looking for. I thinking about getting another curler. Right now I just go the beauty parlor.</li>
            <li> I had one of these years ago, had gone to the straight iron and the curling iron but they take too long, I like the fact I can roll my hair and then get ready for work and it&#x27;s done when I&#x27;m ready</li>
            <li> my wife wishes that she had gotten one years ago</li>
            <li> First, it looks really good in my black &amp; white bathroom and it does an excellent job on my hair!</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers as I swear by Conair.  I won&#x27;t use any other brand as I find that Conair produces the best products over the competition,  I had high hopes for this set of rollers.  However, it was the worst set of rollers Conair ever put out.  It took forever to heat up, and when it did, it actually burned my fingers.  Now, you can&#x27;t say I don&#x27;t know how to use hot rollers because I have been using Conair Hot Rollers (Big Curls) for almost 30 years.  So, if the rollers are hot, I know how to handle them.  These were too hot to handle.  I had to use the glove from the You Curl iron while rolling my hair.  But, that would hardly be a drawback if my hair came out great, which it didn&#x27;t.  It hardly produced a curl.  I would have returned these rollers had my husband not been so hasty and thrown out the box.</li>
            <li> rollers heat up rather quickly but they are hard to figure out where to put them back once you take them out...</li>
            <li> I like that there are more rollers in this set than my compact version of my old-style Revlon rollers.  The hair goes onto a felt-like material covering the rollers.  I really like the clips.  They don&#x27;t fall out, and grip really well, no matter what size roller you use.  There are a lot of clips.  At least twice as much as I need. And you need a bit more space to store this set, because of the four cardboard strips which hold the clips.  The clips are very sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curls are different from the curls with the old-style, spiky rollers.  The curl is softer, fuller.  The hair really doesn&#x27;t wrap around much to hold the hair in place. The longer your hair the better in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next to largest of the rollers curls like the largest of the old-style rollers in my opinion.  I spritz water and/or product on my hair before wrapping the curls.  Hairspray works good too.  The ultimate is to blow dry the hair, to dry it almost dry, give it some volume, and roll the hair in the curlers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want my hair to look like it has more body I use these curlers.  For tighter curls I use my compact set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main advantages to these rollers are 1. There are lots of rollers and clips, 2. The clip idea is  superior, 3. The curlers seem less damaging to the hair.  The heat is centered on the inside.</li>
            <li> I think my mistake was trying first the \\&quot;Hot Tools HairSetter 20 Rollers Wax Core &amp; Ionic Technology HTS1401\\&quot;, which leaves beautiful bouncy curls.  But this product has very weak grips, does not hold hair in place and the rollers cause creases in my hair, very ugly marks from the rollers, probably because of my lack of experience using them, but with the Hot Tools Hairsetter it wasn&#x27;t so hard, this last one provides rollers that can be hold without getting burned and of a better quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the curlers twice now.  The first time I used them before going to work.  By the time I got to the office, the slight wave they gave me was gone.  I used Kendra hairspray to keep the hold, but it obviously didn&#x27;t help enough.  Then I figured, maybe I didn&#x27;t leave the rollers in long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried them again and this time put them in (again with my hair 100% dry) and left them in for about thirty minutes.  The curlers honestly don&#x27;t seem to heat up enough.  I allowed them to heat for several minutes, left the rollers in my hair for what I think should be long enough (I&#x27;m not going to leave them in for an hour if they seem to have cooled off after 30 minutes).  I was SO disappointed.  My hair looked like crap.  I wasted about 45 minutes getting ready between heating them up, putting in the rollers and then making sure I left them in long enough.  I should have taken a picture so I could&#x27;ve posted it (or done a video).  It was unbelievable.  I have used rollers and curling irons for years - this by far was the worst set I&#x27;ve ever used.  What a waste of money.  The only curlers that seemed to do anything were the teeny tiny ones - all the medium and larger rollers didn&#x27;t do ANYTHING.  Horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have basically straight hair, but it&#x27;s not naturally pin straight and has some natural wave to it.  I have never before had my hair not take a curl.  Bizarre.</li>
            <li> I really liked using the product. The rollers were comfortable -- even though I had to use every single one! It was just a little bit weighty. The rollers are comfy and didn&#x27;t pull, especially when I took them out of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My curls were very pretty too -- for the first ten minutes, until humidity took over and made them just frizballesque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait for winter when I can use this and have them actually work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is VERY very thick, I had enough rollers to go all around with nice curls. The rollers fit back very nicely also into the tray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remember the OLD hot rollers with those weird metal clips that never really kept them in place -- these new big plastic clips kept these in place and locked my hair down, nice and tight, with very little added weight. My only dislike about the product was that I don&#x27;t have anywhere to store the clips - they are rather big. I kept the piece of cardboard they came on and keep them clipped to that, but alas I know those will just become useless at some point. A bag or box would have been nice for storage.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re hair isn&#x27;t long. Mine is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the other Infiniti Pro that has just big rollers which I wanted for my long hair. That one comes with U-shaped pins to hold the rollers to your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clips included in this set simply don&#x27;t work with my hair. I just used the wire pins from the other set, and like that set, they stayed just fine in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve had the other set - which is essentially the same as this one but for the variations in roller size and the clips - I can say this is a GREAT set. The rollers heat up fast, they curl quick, and are totally worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, they work so fast I have to take the first ones out as the last ones go in, or else I&#x27;d be giving Orphan Annie a run for the money in the curly dept.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a quick solution to fast curls, AND your hair isn&#x27;t superheavy or very long, you absolutely cannot do better than this set.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this considering I never curled my hair before. I tried a few times and it did curl, but the curls fell out quickly and my hair just looked like a mess. Idk if I just haven&#x27;t mastered it or maybe my hair is just too thick? But the positives are they do get hot and the clips work good.</li>
            <li> I gave one star because the goods sent very late from the estimated time, and the box is damaged as another person&#x27;s used, and the goods are very very dusty.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for quite a while now. They work excellent. There is a color indicator on one of the rolls when they are warm and ready to roll, but I heat them up a little longer, for about 10 min. Dry your hair completely (me not doing that in the beginning, bad results). I use the medium and large rollers only, and can curl all my hair with it. I see some minor cracks in the rollers now, but this is after several years.  Very pleased overall and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love the big clips, but these rollers do not get very hot.  My older set from Conair get much hotter. My hair is very thick and coarse so I need the heat to penetrate to add curl and body.</li>
            <li> It was on her Christmas Wish List and has been used almost every day since she got it.  Rave Reviews.  This is we worth the money.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my daughter to give to her mother, my wife, for Christmas.  My wife was thrilled and used the rollers that Christmas afternoon.  She raved about how easy they are to use and how it did &amp;#34;exactly what I wanted it to do to my hair!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I don&#x27;t know much about &amp;#34;rollers.&amp;#34;  I can comment on the construction and overall quality of the product: which are both very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Needed these for extra so I got them and very happy I did especially in purple my fav color yeah</li>
            <li> Bought these rollers to keep my hair styled for a special occasion -- family wedding -- and they did their job and worked great.  The Infiniti Pro (ceramic) electric rollers heat up very quickly and are ready to use in just a few minutes.  My results have been good and even in the heat and humidity of Florida my hair stays styled for many hours after using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I changed out the clips because I prefer a different style than the type that came with the set and the rollers still hold very well.  My set came with some sample products of hair conditioner etc, which is always nice to have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use rollers all that often but when I do, I find the set heats up quickly, rolls nicely without frizzing my hair, and give me good results that hold.  The case has an on/off switch that works well.  The case is sturdy.  There are plenty of sizes of rollers to work with in the set.  And the set is easy to clean.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> i love it it was my first  time using this. it was very easy to put in my hair . i will buy  heat rollers again</li>
            <li> Great look, and the clips are great.  There could be more medium rollers but other than that these are great</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, the clips work great. I got full bouncy curls, and this heats up so fast you don&#x27;t need alot of time in the morning for a different look.</li>
            <li> very good product and also customer service&lt;br /&gt;surely wiil buy again&lt;br /&gt;very good understanding of one needs&lt;br /&gt;have a good day!</li>
            <li> I love hot rollers and use them nearly everyday.  This Extreme set by Conair does heat up quickly, but it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to curl my hair with all day curl.  I still prefer a wax core roller to ceramic and currently use [[ASIN:B005D5TCJ2 Remington KF-20i Protect and Shine Flocked Ionic Hair Rollers]].&lt;br /&gt;The clips that come with this Conair set are the best I&#x27;ve found, and they can be purchased separately [[ASIN:B000R87B1Q Conair SPC10X Super Clips, 10 Count]].</li>
            <li> I used to use hot rollers religiously.  The results were at best inconsistent, certainly not enough to compensate for the damage to my hair.  This neat little set provides a nice variety of sizes, allk covered with a felt-like \\&quot;flocking\\&quot; which is gentle.  These are ceramic which is reputed to enhance shine and smoothness.  But perhaps the biggest improvement is in the design of the clips.  The old wire ones always slipped through my hair and never held the rollers in place.  These are easier to use and provide a sturdy grip.  I found these rollers provided me with nice bouncy, shiny curls that lasted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to the package, they do take a bit longer than 85 seconds to heat up. There is no storage area for the clips in the case so you need to improvise by putting them in a separate bag or box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take some time and experimentation to maximize your styling mojo but these rollers will help you take your hair to the next level.</li>
            <li> The Infiniti Pro Ceramic Curlers seem to do a decent job of curling hair, though I did not always get great results. My experiences may not be representative, however. The directions say that users should experiment, trying different heats, times, and sizes for their hair type, and it may be that I just haven&#x27;t found the optimal setting for my own hair yet. That said, here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The directions are easy to follow (though, oddly, the pictures included make it seem as if you&#x27;re going to come out of the process with an 80&#x27;s hair style).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The set comes with 20 rollers (in four different sizes) and 20 hair clips (and you can order more if you need to).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--It doesn&#x27;t take long to use the curlers. (The curlers take only 85 seconds to heat up.) The time used will vary depending on hair type, but the directions say no longer than ten minutes. I found that a couple minutes worked on my curly/wavy hair. In other words, users (unless they oversleep) should be able to curl their hair before work or school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The curlers are hot to the touch but won&#x27;t burn you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The machine is small enough that you could pack it in a suitcase. (It&#x27;s about the size of a loaf of bread.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The set comes with a vial of anti-friz serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The clips are very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The rollers are hard to put back into their container because each roller has a specific spot and it&#x27;s not immediately obvious which spot it belongs in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--The rollers occasionally caused creases in my hair (though admittedly that may be due to my inexperience using them).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Some of the curls don&#x27;t turn out as you&#x27;d expect them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- I&#x27;ve only managed to get curls that were in between tight and loose. I haven&#x27;t managed to get very loose or very tight curls yet. Mine were loose on the top of the strand and curly at the bottom. (Again, it&#x27;s possible that further experimentation will improve my results.) My hair is long, however, so it may be that the top of the hair was not being treated as much. Perhaps users with medium-length hair will get more consistent results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- The curlers add a lot of volume to one&#x27;s hair. I don&#x27;t like this because my hair is already dense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I&#x27;d recommend this product more for people with thinner, medium-length hair because the curlers add volume and my experience suggests that they don&#x27;t create a consistent curl with longer hair.xperimentation will improve my results.)

            <li> I was so pleased to receive the Conair Xtreme Infiniti Pro Heat Rollers. It&#x27;s the first time in many years, I&#x27;ve had one set of hot rollers that met my hair needs. Usually because of differing sizes in each set, I&#x27;ve always had to have two hot roller sets just to get jumbo and medium rollers. Thanks Conair! You saved the day!</li>
            <li> I upgraded to these when the fuzzy coating on my old rollers was wearing off, and I was burning my fingers. I did a bit of research and landed on these for a few reasons.&lt;br /&gt;1. I liked the variety of sizes&lt;br /&gt;2. I wanted something that heated quickly&lt;br /&gt;3. The price was within my range&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros&lt;br /&gt;- They&#x27;re very compact and don&#x27;t take up alot of room on your countertop&lt;br /&gt;- The clips hold very well without leaving marks on your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons&lt;br /&gt;- You&#x27;ll have to find a place to store the clips, the set does not include a bag for this (no big deal, I keep them in a drawer)&lt;br /&gt;- I really cannot keep a curl with these. Normally, my hair kind of fades in 6 hrs or so, but with these, in an hour its lost its curl. It will retain a smooth shape, but no curl. I really don&#x27;t think its my hair, as I can keep a curl with an iron as well. They just don&#x27;t seem to get hot enough!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try to let them heat up longer, and see if that helps, but I am pretty disappointed in the product if it can&#x27;t do what I intended it to do.</li>
            <li> The heat is way too low on this and I took too long to decide to return it so now I&#x27;m stuck.  The only thing I like is the holders, they work well</li>
            <li> I used these rollers twice, and they worked great. Than on the third time, they stopped working, completely, I let them cool off and tried turning them on again, and nothing. It also melted 2 of the rollers, when I noticed that it shut off, they had only been plugged in for 10 minutes, so it&#x27;s not because they were on for too long. I bought these because they weren&#x27;t the cheapest, but I&#x27;m starting to think that the cheaper products would have worked better. I will never buy Conair again, and I don&#x27;t recommend it to anyone either</li>
            <li> The rollers are confusing to insert back into the tray.  I don&#x27;t think they get very hot. I have even tried different gels, etc. to have my hair hold a curl; but after a few hours, they fall out.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it was defect or not but rollers did not get hot enough for my hair. I was very happy with how I was able to return the item though and hope to find something else.</li>
            <li> NIce, hot, and they stay in. I like the variety of sizes and my curls last a day or 2 :)</li>
            <li> At first glance, I thought the uncovered heating elements might be a problem. My previous Conair product&#x27;s heating elements are covered by plastic, with holes only large enough for the rollers. However, even when making an effort, it&#x27;s pretty tough to touch the heating element on this set, so I don&#x27;t consider it to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original Conair set has 12 jumbo size rollers; I hoped there would be more large rollers, but I&#x27;ve been able to use all but the smallest rollers. Plus, I can do my whole head of hair at one time rather than in two segments since there are enough rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair and need to use the wire clips from my old set for the upper layers of hair or there&#x27;s a tendency to get dents in my hair. It would be nice if there were wire clips included, not just the plastic clips. Wire clips generally don&#x27;t hold the hair as well, but they don&#x27;t leave dents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older set also tends to get too hot. There isn&#x27;t a way to increase or decrease the temperature of the rollers in either set. At times, with my old set, it felt like my hair was going to burst into flames; that&#x27;s not a problem with this set. Time will tell, though, whether the felt covering the metal seam on the rollers will start to wear as it did on my old set. Then the hot metal comes in direct contact with my hair or scalp and is very uncomfortable, not to mention, unsafe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rollers reach maximum temp in just a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting the rollers back in their slots is something of a puzzle, although the positioning is a bit more forgiving than anticipated. I thought they&#x27;d have to go back in the same places, which isn&#x27;t necessary symmetrical, but that&#x27;s not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, a rather pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mom for Christmas, she used it for a couple times then she had this to say; &#x27;It sets hair well but within a few hours the curls fall and hair expands to frizz. It happens whether you put product in or not. Would not recommend this to anyone&#x27;</li>
            <li> Very nice curler. Does a good job and very easy to do. I love the fast start up heat. Thank you</li>
            <li> I love my Infiniti Pro.  It is easy to use.  Curls set in a few minutes and last all day.  I have stopped using a curling iron.  Since I have been using the Infiniti Pro my hair feels softer and is no longer dry.</li>
            <li> I love the clips but the heating time takes longer than advertised. THE rollers work best when in your hair at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used hot rollers since high school and wasn&#x27;t a big fan then. But I am definitely impress with this product! I have long, medium thickness hair and this was perfect for giving some body and bounce without being overly &amp;#34;done up.&amp;#34; Even my husband noticed the difference between my bumping the ends with a curling iron and using these rollers - we both agree the rollers are the way to go! The heat up was under 5 minutes and the heat was maintained once I started taking the rollers out. And I do like the clips - I know some people have said they think the clips are cheap - but I like how the plastic is &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; and the clips did not leave any marks in my hair. And the clips did a great job of holding on to the rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m super happy with this product. I would buy it again and will be recommending it to friends.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set based on the versatility of  4 size rollers with the velvet flocking which I require in hot rollers.  However the rollers are split with a grove for them to &amp;#34;hang&amp;#34; on the heating elements.  I have long hair and these splits are horrible as my long hair will get caught and tangle when trying to remove the roller.  This set comes with the spring clips which do not hold the curler in place at all, (long hair is heavy).  I have always preferred the wire clip as they hold the roller in my long hair much more efficiently.  If you want to travel with this set plan on more room in the suitcase for all these spring clips, they take up too much room and you must find a container or bag to store them in.  I&#x27;m simply not thrilled with this set due to the split groves and spring clips.</li>
            <li> Product is okay overall but dislike curler holders. Not easy to use &amp; hard to hold curlers on with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried many curling sets, and this one seems to be the best.  The rollers get hot, but not SO hot that you take the skin off your fingers or have scalp burns.  Also the curl lasts pretty well and the set is versatile with many different sizes. The price is decent, and I have tried Connair, Baby Bliss, and Remington. I would recommend this set first.</li>
            <li> Was so excited to get this.  Wasn&#x27;t that impressed.  It doesn&#x27;t work very well, doesn&#x27;t get the rollers hot enough I think</li>
            <li> Beautiful curls...makes make curls look shiny!!! Love!</li>
            <li> This set of heated rollers heats up fast and has four sizes of rollers, small, med, large and extra-large. My current set of rollers only has medium and large and it doesn&#x27;t produce a very long-lasting curl. I do my hair by washing, then air drying (I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair unless I&#x27;m in a hurry.) Then I use hot rollers to create loose curls on my chin-length hair. This method cuts down on the damage from blow-drying when you are brushing and pulling on wet hair. And since I want curls, not a smooth bob, I&#x27;m prefer these to using a curling iron (which I find too hot for the hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is better than my current set for two reasons; the very small rollers work for the short layers, and I can vary my result (soft waves, use the larger roller, more curly, use the smallest.) The flocked surface is kinder to the hair. My stylist says that this is the least damaging method to styling hair and I find it efficient--heat up the curlers as I get ready for work, heat for 2 minutes (FAST!) put them in, 10 minutes later, I drop them out (don&#x27;t pull, just let gravity drop them off the curl), run fingers through and I&#x27;m set to go. The instructions have illustrations to show you how to put in the rollers to achieve various styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ceramic is said to hold heat better. These do get nice and hot but not uncomfortably so. Where the edge touches the skin, however, I slip in a was of TP to protect bare skin from the heat. These seem not to have so many \\&quot;hot spots\\&quot; that burn me, very comfy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For travel, this set is not extremely large (the size of a small shoebox, let&#x27;s say) but the clips are bulky though light weight. You could travel with it, but it would take up quite a bit of space in a small carryon or even a small size rolling suitcase. These days, there are all kinds of sneaky weight limits on suitcases (40lbs on one airline, 50 on another if going overseas) and you&#x27;d be surprised how just a few days clothes and shoes make the entire weight limit. So I&#x27;d find a smaller set if traveling abroad, besides, there is no dual voltage switch, so you&#x27;d need a step down transformer. For travel, I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:B000EPJNMW Remington Compact Set]] though it also has no dual voltage. It&#x27;s very small but works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I currently use a \\&quot;tourmaline\\&quot; coated set where the clips do the work, but this style of clip is rather loose. It doesn&#x27;t seem to set as strongly as the set I currently use. These plastic tooth style clips hold very well, but from experience I can tell you that you should make sure you put them back in a bag when you are done. Also, these clips are very light gauge plastic. If you were to step on one, you&#x27;d easily break it and the tines of the grippers are extremely thin.  Otherwise you have to order replacement clips.  This is a versatile set, and I recommend it if you use rollers or a curling iron and want to avoid burning your hair. This is a good method and a good set.. So I&#x27;d find a smaller set if traveling abroad, besides, there is no dual voltage switch, so you&#x27;d need a step down transformer.

            <li> I use hot rollers nearly every day of my life, and I am quite familiar with the different types available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set is a sort of update to a Conair set that used plastic clips that were heated individually inside the unit.  (This unit does not heat the clips.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Heats up quickly...but not in 85 seconds.  Come on, anything that heats up in 85 seconds would scorch your hair off anyway!  ;-)  I&#x27;d say more like 5 minutes to get them good and hot...fast enough.&lt;br /&gt;- The clips are AWESOME!!  I have used everything from the old wire clips to the plastic claw-style clips, and then ones that come with this set are the best at both holding the roller in place AND not \\&quot;denting\\&quot; your hair.  They are amazing at holding the largest (and heaviest) rollers in place, even when there&#x27;s very little hair in them.  The only problem?  I&#x27;m not so sure they&#x27;ll last for many years...already one has a prong broken off.  It still works, but if that happens every time, this set may not have longevity.&lt;br /&gt;- Flocked rollers are &#x27;kind&#x27; to hair -- and tends to make it easier to get the job done without burning your fingers or scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Not enough smaller rollers.  The rollers come in 4 sizes -- 4 jumbo, 6 large, 6 medium-small, and 4 tiny.  Inevitably, you won&#x27;t have enough of whatever size you prefer.  I generally end up using two hot rollers sets in order to get more of the smaller rollers.&lt;br /&gt;- The jumbo size rollers are simply TOO large, I think, for most people -- they do not produce a curl at all.  So, they&#x27;re great for smoothing your hair out...but then there aren&#x27;t enough of them to do all of your hair at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;- Clips bend out of shape and break somewhat easily (though they are GREAT at holding the rollers in place).&lt;br /&gt;- No bag or container to hold the clips.  (Conair used to give you a drawstring bag to hold the clips in.)  No big deal, just a company getting cheap!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this set of hot rollers is very similar to sets put out in the past 5 years...nothing really new here, except for the clips.  You probably won&#x27;t hand it down to your daughter in 20 years, but the clips should make it a few years, at least...very similar to sets put out in the past 5 years...nothing really new here, except for the clips.

            <li> The felt helps protect the hair and I love this.  It smooths my frizzy ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They do heat up in a short amount of time but to have them really hot enough, it takes a few minutes. Still a lot quicker than the average roller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mainly use the rollers for smoothing my hair and adding bounce. I don&#x27;t like flat irons or curling irons. I&#x27;ve been using hot rollers for about 35 years.  I put the larger rollers on top and work my way down. I pretty much use all of the rollers except the smallest ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried them in my daughter&#x27;s hair. She&#x27;s Spanish. Her hair is thick, fluffy and frizzy.  The rollers smooth it out very well in a short amount of time.  Much better than spending 30 minutes to smooth it with a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although, I like the big clips that come with the rollers, they don&#x27;t hold the rollers as tightly as the wire slip on clip but they are easier to clip on and remove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair feel silky.</li>
            <li> Because I have always been skeptical of their worth, at almost 30 years old, I have never owned a set of hot rollers, until now.  I can proudly say that I love the Infiniti Pro by Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American woman with lots of very thick hair.  The only styling tool I use on a regular basis is the Chi iron because most heated styling tools do nothing for my hair.  The Infinit Pro Rollers are the exception.  I used every one of the 20 rollers included with the set and came out with a head full of soft, beautiful curls in less than 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti Pro by Conair Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers were very easy to set up and pretty much ready to go straight out of the box.  A quick read of the directions, cleanse of the roller holders, and my rollers were ready for use.  The amazing thing about this product is that it takes less than 2 minutes to heat up for use on the hair!  As I have thick hair, I allowed my rollers to heat up for about 10 minutes before using them.  When it was time to curl my hair, the rollers were easy to use.  They were not too hot to hold and it only took a few seconds to roll each individual section.  The roller holders firmly held each roller in place, and after 15 minutes, I was able to quickly and easily remove each roller and was left with beautiful, springy curls!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Infiniti Pro Rollers have exceeded my expectations, and I have received several compliments on my curls.  In fact, I have been so excited about this product, that for the first time ever, I am excited about styling my hair each morning to create a lovely curled style.  I highly recommend this product for those who wish to have beautiful curls, but have limited time on their hands.  Whether you have long, short, fine or thick hair, this product is sure to do wonders.</li>
            <li> The rollers on this hairsetter heat up quite well &amp; stay hot;  and would create very nice curl IF the clips would hold the rollers place, but they don&#x27;t with longer hair.  My hair is about shoulder length with average thickness; the rollers would not stay in my hair using these clips.  It might be great for shorter hair, but unfortunately not mine.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length, straight, fine hair that gets kind of ridges in it if I don&#x27;t use a flat iron on it after it dries.  I actually think using these rollers is going to be quicker to do in the mornings than using my flat iron.  They heat up in probably less than 5 minutes.  Then, I just take my dry hair (it can still be a little damp) and start rolling it up.  I haven&#x27;t been really neat about putting the rollers in at all and just grab sections and start rolling. It always turns out great.  I only use the largest ones and there are more than enough rollers to do my whole head.  The clips that hold the rollers on are very secure and once I have my hair set, I just keep going with my routine of getting ready.  Then I take them out, brush my hair and it&#x27;s done.  The curls are just nice big bouncy curls and it doesn&#x27;t look that unusual on me considering that I always wear my hair straight.  The curls stay all day and I don&#x27;t even use hairspray.  I would highly recommend this for someone who just wants to do something quick with their hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> Curls hair, but the curls don&#x27;t last. Also, the hair becomes frizzy for use. The rods heat up within about 2 minutes, but need to remain in hair for over an hour to hold curls.</li>
            <li> Purchased for a gift.  Just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work great!  My daughter loves these ceramic curlers.  Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The set in itself seems wonderful. It comes with various sizes rollers, but my only issue is that for the woman on the go it takes way too long to get hot.</li>
            <li> I find these rollers pretty easy to put in and the clips work good. The downside is that the curls only stay in for about a half hour! I&#x27;ve used these twice now, and the curl doesn&#x27;t stay in no matter how long I keep the rollers in my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used hot rollers for well over 20 years.  I have fine (but a lot of it) hair that falls about mid-back.  I use hot rollers to smooth my hair and add body.  I do not like lots of curls.  I also use curlers so that I don&#x27;t have to stand in front of the mirror while the curlers are doing their thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This set does not work for me for two main reasons ...&lt;br /&gt;1. The curlers are NOT large enough ... in circumference or length.  I like the SUPER JUMBO size hot rollers (which are next to impossible to find).  I have an old Conair Big Curls flocked set from about 15 years ago that I love because the curlers are 1.75\\&quot; and they sit on small posts (not bars, like these).  I have too long hair to go around the curlers to smooth and add body.&lt;br /&gt;2. I do not like the \\&quot;slits\\&quot; in the curlers.  I prefer the curles to have a small hole at the bottom, not a huge slit up the middle of the curler.  I just have not been able to master curling my long hair with those slits up the middle.  My hair gets caught inside or gets those ugly dents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these are not issues for you, then this set works great.  It heats up to a nice temperature in under 5 minutes.  The clips have super long claws (albeit weak and flimsey claws) to really hold the curlers in place.  The smaller curlers do a good job of curling shorter hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, a good set of curlers just not the right set for someone looking for super jumbo size curlers without the slit for smoothing and adding body.</li>
            <li> The wife says it doesn&#x27;t get as hot as ceramic curlers and therefore doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I picked this set up for my wife after her old curler set had seen better days and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She raved to me about the variety of curlers available, the ease of use and how quickly they warmed up for use.  She was extremely enthusiastic about the product, saying she&#x27;d highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  My hair is difficult to wrap around the rollers.  Using the flippy clips is a pain.  They are very light weight and don&#x27;t grasp or hold the hair.  It&#x27;s also difficult to pinch the clips and position them on to the roller.  Once I set my hair, I have huge flippy clips waving all over my head.  It sort of torks my head.  Uncomfortable.  I think the \\&quot;set\\&quot; is loose because my hair is not \\&quot;held\\&quot; in the roller.  Thank God I kept my old set with the metal clips.  Much easier.  Much faster.  Better curl!  And by the way, Don didn&#x27;t write this review or use this product.  He bought it for me as a present.  Me, his wife, Paula, is writing the review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using rollers [by Conair] for about 15 years and like always these are great. They heat up fast, give great curl and go in and out easily. My favorite part about these is that they come with black clips---I much prefer them to pins. If you want smooth, shiny, non-frizzy hair try these out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a little wave, these are fine, but they don&#x27;t really make or hold a curl.</li>
            <li> These work very well, the only complaint I have is that the clips do not have  a storage compartment and I know I will lose them.</li>
            <li> Was a gift well received.</li>
            <li> Did not work on my hair at all....I dont think it is my hair either.  It just simply does not get hot enough...and the contact is so soft that it does not leave any defined curl at all!</li>
            <li> Not enough of the right size curlers.</li>
            <li> I wanted to have curled hair for my stepson&#x27;s wedding.  I tried all kinds of curl enhancers, hair spray and anything else I could think of, but the curls just don&#x27;t last.  My best solution was to remove the curlers and then secure the curls with clips until it was absolutely necessary to remove them.  (My husband was horrified that I went to the church with all kinds of clips sticking off my head! LOL)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last hot curler set was a Clairol that I bought in the 80&#x27;s.  It would make smooth curls that would last all day.  I am not impressed with these.  I don&#x27;t know if the curlers just don&#x27;t get hot enough, if they cool too quickly or what.</li>
            <li> This product is LOUSY !  The velvet coating (and I do mean COATING) wears off quickly and these things burn your hands BIG TIME.  Another huge problem is that the curlers do NOT stay stable in the air.  They always start dropping down.  I&#x27;ve even tried using TWO clips on the roller and it still dips down.  Conair used to be an EXTREMELY reliable brand, especially back in the 70s and 80s with their incredibly long-lasting blow-dryers, but those days are LONG gone.  And my hair is still frizzy when I use these, too.  Would not recommend this product at ALL !</li>
            <li> I purchased this for several reasons though I already have a set of flocked heated rollers: First, my other set, though I really do like it, does not have enough of the right sized rollers (small and medium) for me to be able to set all my hair at once and second, it takes a bit long to heat up.  This set has 4 sized rollers and promised a quick heat up.  I thought that with both of them, I could set my hair beginning with the small and medium rollers on this one, and while they were cooling, finish up with the other, more slowly heating set.  That&#x27;s how it worked out, and it worked well.  This set has just the right size rollers that I needed (small and mediums were smaller than the other set, which is a positive) and they really do heat up fast and HOT.  Be careful for you fingers&#x27; sake when handling them.  On the downside, the clips are a bit flimsy.  They came clipped onto cardboard, and one of them was not on the cardboard and was damaged.  Also, unlike my other set, this came with no pouch for the clips which irked me a bit because with a protective pouch, I don&#x27;t think the clip would have been damaged.  It still works, but it irks, though it&#x27;s not worth sending the curlers back at all.  IT does the job, making beautiful curls and for that I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.  The only reason, in fact, that I didn&#x27;t give it five stars was because of the lack of the pouch for the clips and the one damaged clip.  As I&#x27;ve already said, it&#x27;s irksome.  Aside from that, if you don&#x27;t mind keeping the clips in a plastic bag, this is a nice set that does what it says it would do and I&#x27;m glad that I bought it.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s great as a gift, except for yourself, but it really does do the job.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t heat up for me at all. I can leave them pulled in for 20 minutes and they are still not all the way heated up. So disappointing.</li>
            <li> My hair is very hard to control or use rollers on. I don&#x27;t know what it is about these rollers - whether it is the ceramic base or the flocking on the rollers or the clips that hold the rollers in place that make them actually work on my hair. In any case, it&#x27;s a miracle! The ceramic base holds the heat well - much better than the plastic rollers of days gone by. The unit heats up quickly and the rollers don&#x27;t feel too hot to handle. One of the things I especially love about this is the way the clips work on the roller. They&#x27;re basically butterfly clips that are a little shorter than a typical butterfly clip so they fit the size of the roller perfectly. The other good thing about the clips is they hold much better than pins and don&#x27;t leave a dent in the hair in the way a long bobby pin does. The curl twirls down in a coil without creases. Lovely set. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using hot rollers for years and my tried and true Conair set finally gave out on me. I decided to try these because of some of the reviews and the price. Though they do a great job, they don&#x27;t give me the defined curl I&#x27;m used to getting hot rollers. They are easy to use, not hot on your fingers (my fingers always sizzled on my old set). The clips are terrible for the bigger rollers, I have to watch out turning my head so they don&#x27;t fall off the top! The clips work fine for the smaller rollers and since those are always on the bottom, I don&#x27;t really mind it too much. For my hair (middle of my back, moderate thickness), they give me a cute, casual bouncy look. It does look nice and stays styled for the day! But like I said, I&#x27;m used to getting a more defined curl. I will probably look for a set with more smaller rollers to get that curl :) For people with shorter/thinner hair, they might give a better curl than me with this set! I recommend this set though to those who are new to hot rollers since they are very simple to use and do not burn your fingers and for those are are looking for that slightly curled, Victoria Secret-ish model look!</li>
            <li> I bought this set based on the reviews that had previously been written and was very disappointed.  No matter how long I leave them plugged in or leave them in my hair, the rollers won&#x27;t get hot enough and will not hold the curl for more than 5 minutes.  Spend your money elsewhere.</li>
            <li> easy to operate and keeping all day without any hair styling products</li>
            <li> It is difficult to fit the rollers back into the tray once you have used them as there is no clear indicator for where each size will fit. The rollers do not create nice tight pin curl style rolls. In my hair, they almost worked like a straightening iron except where the slot goes through the roll- there they create a flat spot in the curl. Not at all what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I really like the Infiniti. I am having a hard time trying to wrap my hair around the curlers. I guess I am just use to the older kind of  curlers.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I researched these devices online for my wife who still has limited computer savvy. After viewing the various features on different units and evaluating the reviews she selected this one. There was a concern regarding the clips due to several negative comments about the quality of them but she is totally pleased. She has not had any of the problems listed by others and would happliy purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Beautiful great looking hair with smooth curls that look professional are accompanished with this great equipment in minutes.  Fast heating and light to hold and carried anywhere.</li>
            <li> The rollers seemed to really not fit on the wire heat element that they were provided with...Sorry but they just didn&#x27;t have the quality I was looking for especially for the price.  The clips are flimsy.  seems like they are always trying to cut corners somewhere. They do heat up nicely though.</li>
            <li> The Conair is perfect as the rollers are easy to put in, and the clips hold tight!  Never thought I&#x27;d be using rollers again, but love the curl and bounce created by these rollers.  I&#x27;m from the generation that slept on orange juice cans (straight was better), so greatly appreciate the ease of instant curl.</li>
            <li> It does want it says.  But I would really like this style but with steam.  Again, it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Heats up pretty quick and provides lasting curls. I definitely prefer this to my iron. Very easy to use.  Just use a heat protection spray before using obviously.  It also came with a small bottle of Argan oil.</li>
            <li> The clips for this set are flimsy and leave dents in your hair.  Otherwise the set is OK, just not what I expected for the money.</li>
            <li> The product shipped very quickly. I would have love if this set came with a lot more rollers. If you&#x27;re not careful your hair might get tangled in the slits of the rollers. It was just okay.</li>
            <li> Getting used to it. But I like it alot</li>
            <li> Expected a better quality product from Conair.  Unit seems cheaply made.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a new set of rollers, there are some things to know about Conair&#x27;s Xtreme Instant Heat Ceramic Rollers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- CERAMIC: Let&#x27;s face it. Putting heat on your hair isn&#x27;t good for it, period. But ceramic heat is much less damaging than other types of heat. This means your hair will be healthier using these rollers than regular rollers. Plus ceramic maintains heat much better than most other materials, so once the curlers get hot, they stay hot.&lt;br /&gt;- QUICK WARM-UP: The curlers claim to warm up in 85 seconds. I suppose if you have really obedient hair, this might be enough, but for most people, it&#x27;s better to let them warm up for 5 minutes or so. But that&#x27;s still not overly long, and they get good and hot.&lt;br /&gt;- CLIPS: The cheaper Conair rollers have absolutely awful clips. I have another set of their rollers (not as nice as these), and I actually ended up buying these clips because those were so useless. They&#x27;re a bit flimsy, but they keep the rollers in place firmly. I have very long hair (almost to my waist), and don&#x27;t have a problem getting my hair to stay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- ROLLER SIZE: This seems to be more of a \\&quot;sample set\\&quot; of rollers. If you&#x27;ve never used them before and want to learn how, this might be a great set because you get all different sizes of rollers. However, if you like a certain size of rollers for your hair, whether large or small, you can be pretty certain that this won&#x27;t have enough of what you want. If you want rollers of different sizes, though, this is a great bet.</li>
            <li> This curled my extensions perfectly. The curls also lasted all day. The only reason i didn&#x27;t give it a 5 is because i wish there were extra rollers that came along with the set.</li>
            <li> When I have used curlers in the past, the curl (style) has lasted for days. Neither of the Conair hair setters did this. Within a short amount of time the curl relaxed leaving my hair almost straight.</li>
            <li> This is the must have item. I am not a professional when it comes&lt;br /&gt;to doing my hair but this makes me look like one. This has made it so&lt;br /&gt;easy for me to do my hair and have a fantastic look. It is so easy to use&lt;br /&gt;anyone can really do it. I love how i can just put the rollers on and do my&lt;br /&gt;makeup. I think every women should have this.</li>
            <li> Like this but would be nice if there was somewhere to store the clips. Have to put roller clips in another container as these won&#x27;t fit inside the unit.</li>
            <li> I have been very pleased with these rollers.  My long hair doesn&#x27;t snag on  them like it would with my previous set.  Heats up quickly and I like the claw clips instead of the metals prongs my previous set had.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have both tried these several times.  They don&#x27;t seem to get as warm as my old set and our hair does not keep a set.</li>
            <li> the clips make a mark in my hair so I end up with a little wave instead of the smooth look I seek. The rollers are hard to put back in place.  There is no place to hold the clips.  I like the pins better.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I have to say after using this product it is not good...it does not get hot enough to curl hair. the style of clamps that hold the hair in place are not good either they do not hold the hair and roller secure. The rollers are very light weight and plastic and have a slit down the center...they will not last. I am past my return mark since I tried to give them every chance. I am going to buy something else.</li>
