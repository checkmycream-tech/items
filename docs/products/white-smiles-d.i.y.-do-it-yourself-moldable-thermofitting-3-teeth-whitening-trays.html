    <ol>
            <li>For the price I cannot complain, but they are not the best quality.  </li>
            <li>Awesome for my flouride and mineral treatments.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for my sister and her teeth look great!  </li>
            <li>Best price on Amazon</li>
            <li>Awesome molds.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of whitening trays in my days and these have worked out the best.</li>
            <li>Happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>She was able to mold the trays to her teeth and had wonderful results!</li>
            <li>effective and durable!</li>
            <li>but like i said good for price</li>
            <li>Good Teeth Trays.</li>
            <li>put in warm water and see how it goes....</li>
            <li>I reboiled one of them and got the impression perfect the second time around, you just have to suck in and use your tongue to get a good fit on the mold.</li>
            <li>Interesting...</li>
            <li>You need to allow for a lil bit of space, in order to let the gel have room to sit there and treat the surface of the tooth, if that can be a better wording/description.</li>
            <li>It keeps the gel in place for the most part</li>
            <li>leads me to believe the company is just trying to make the price look better for the buy..</li>
            <li>Good price on them too and see to hold up really well.  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping and great products.</li>
            <li>Strong.</li>
            <li>They get the job done, without taking a huge chunk out of my pockets.</li>
            <li>I found that the molds on my teeth weren&#x27;t THAT detailed, but they got the job done.</li>
            <li>Good fit easy to use, easy to trim down with toe nail cutters.</li>
            <li>They just don&#x27;t fit right</li>
            <li>once i realized a completely tight fit wasnt the best way to encourage the whitening gel to make proper contact with the surface of my teeth.</li>
            <li>Looks like the seller went through a lot of trouble to create great looking, but</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really give an accurate assessment of these trays because....</li>
            <li>Glad I found something affordable that I can buy every time I need new trays because my teeth shift so much!</li>
            <li>Junk... Want even take the right shape</li>
            <li>Great product, no reason to purchase a more expensive product.</li>
            <li>Who&#x27;s got too much spare time now, eh?!</li>
            <li>Especially their whitening pen, definitely my favorite teeth whitening product that is out there</li>
            <li>First off, this took forever to arrive.</li>
            <li>, I put the trays into hot water for about 1 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly what your looking for.</li>
            <li>Would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered trays, pens and gel from White Smile and the quality is superior than other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>There is a very fine line between getting it hot enough to actually mold to your teeth and too hot where the mold curls up upon itself while still in the hot water pot.</li>
            <li>Oh, and you can get a really close fit if you follow the instructions properly... A+++</li>
            <li>tries all three of them none of them works, so better be save your money,</li>
            <li>So I really have no idea</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to have a third one in case you mess up the impression or your teeth</li>
            <li>My main question is...</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these trays over all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of how to properly make the impression, after having it in boiling water for a few seconds, they are as good as over priced professional dentist made trays.</li>
            <li>its good product, the only problem was my mouth is small.</li>
            <li>When you drop them in the hot water do so for only a few seconds otherwise they shrink up pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>My product arrived in a sandwich bag, the clear ones that fold over.  </li>
            <li>They do not form very well in the molding process, but it was close enough to work.</li>
            <li>The difference between not hot enough and too hot can be about 3-4 seconds depending on the water temperature.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Sad, cause I expected better.</li>
            <li> They worked well and molded to the shape of my teeth with a little extra help from my lips sucking them in toward my gums.  </li>
            <li> the molds were tough to shape and even harder to judge when ready in boiling water</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s: got these sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Would absolutely NOT recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> 3 trays not sealed in any type of packaging, just dropped into an envelope...arrived with a note from usps saying postage due.</li>
            <li> Had some trouble figuring out how long to leave them in the boiling water.</li>
            <li> but seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;Suggest reading some of the other reviews, in order to encourage you to learn how to use them properly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Travaille grand, preuve d&#x27;idiot</li>
            <li> and I received them without packaging...just $6 down the drain.</li>
            <li> I just thought three was an odd number.</li>
            <li> I tried to use them anyway and the tray split in half.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money...waste!</li>
            <li> so before using this product i cut a little bit</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s still not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Just three trays, in a bag, in a small envelope.  </li>
            <li> We surely do not buy our toothbrushes in sandwich bags.</li>
            <li> Usually you don&#x27;t have to be a rocket scientist to use these, but these just were way to thick to mold to your teeth.</li>
            <li> I wrote a negative review and it was  deleted.  </li>
            <li> Thick.</li>
            <li> Secondly, was in horrible, minimal packaging.</li>
            <li> Waste of MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> These trays are bulky and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> and I was unable to use them.</li>
            <li> unhappy camper</li>
            <li> Terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> I guess I can work out how to do it based on passed reviews, but this is quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> disappointed, who sells product without instruction or steps.</li>
            <li> Having worked for dentists I know how to use something like this and have, but these were just terrible.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s insane for me to trust to put it in mouth.  </li>
            <li> Terrible customer service!  </li>

            <li> For the price I cannot complain, but they are not the best quality.  They do not form very well in the molding process, but it was close enough to work.</li>
            <li> I got it to use with my dental whitening kit and it does the job!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried the product, so I can&#x27;t comment on it.  However, I would like to point out that each reviewer in this listing has reviewed the same set of products (always 5 stars).  Just click on the \\&quot;see all my reviews\\&quot; link next to their names.  Looks like the seller went through a lot of trouble to create great looking, but ultimately illegitimate, reviews.  Granted, the products are all unavailable...  Who&#x27;s got too much spare time now, eh?!</li>
            <li> J&#x27;ai commandé ceci de France parce qu&#x27;I couldn&#x27; ; t obtiennent le bon produit ici. Travaille grand, preuve d&#x27;idiot</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping and great products. I&#x27;ve ordered trays, pens and gel from White Smile and the quality is superior than other products I&#x27;ve tried. Especially their whitening pen, definitely my favorite teeth whitening product that is out there and I&#x27;ve tried it all.</li>
            <li> Glad I found something affordable that I can buy every time I need new trays because my teeth shift so much! Worked like a charm! Thank you!</li>
            <li> These trays are bulky and uncomfortable. They just don&#x27;t fit right and I was unable to use them.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use with some at home whitener I had purchased...followed the directions to mold these, and as soon as I dropped them into the water they melted. It was as soon as they hit the water, they weren&#x27;t even in there the 3-4 seconds they claim they need to be. Not worth the money...waste!</li>
            <li> These trays are so simple and get the job done. It&#x27;s good to have a third one in case you mess up the impression or your teeth shift a lot. I reboiled one of them and got the impression perfect the second time around, you just have to suck in and use your tongue to get a good fit on the mold. I highly recommend these trays over all the ones I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing this product again, for my husband this time. Once you get the hang of how to properly make the impression, after having it in boiling water for a few seconds, they are as good as over priced professional dentist made trays. They get the job done, without taking a huge chunk out of my pockets.</li>
            <li> First off, this took forever to arrive. Secondly, was in horrible, minimal packaging. And lastly, DID NOT WORK! Usually you don&#x27;t have to be a rocket scientist to use these, but these just were way to thick to mold to your teeth. Having worked for dentists I know how to use something like this and have, but these were just terrible. Sad, cause I expected better.</li>
            <li> no instructions..3 trays not sealed in any type of packaging, just dropped into an envelope...arrived with a note from usps saying postage due. This is just at moment of being received...can&#x27;t wait to try them if I dare because I don&#x27;t think I can return them as it&#x27;s something that comes in contact with bodily fluids and I received them without packaging...just $6 down the drain. unhappy camper</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any measurable improvement over a two week period. Will keep trying and see if longer is needed.</li>
            <li> Had some trouble figuring out how long to leave them in the boiling water. Directions say between 5-15 seconds and I guess I left it on the longer end of that range...the tray melted into itself. I&#x27;ll definitely do closer to 5-8 seconds next time. Trays came with directions. I found that the molds on my teeth weren&#x27;t THAT detailed, but they got the job done.</li>
            <li> the molds were tough to shape and even harder to judge when ready in boiling water but like i said good for price</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s: got these sooner than expected. CON: no instructions, melted in water, I put the trays into hot water for about 1 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very disappointed, who sells product without instruction or steps.</li>
            <li> What that is quite a carbon foot print, all the way from China for $4 and chang.e&lt;br /&gt;Have not put in water, came unsealed and no directions. Looked at reviews and&lt;br /&gt;will put in warm water and see how it goes....</li>
            <li> its good product, the only problem was my mouth is small. so before using this product i cut a little bit</li>
            <li> I got these couple weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;and tries all three of them none of them works, so better be save your money,</li>
            <li> Awesome for my flouride and mineral treatments.</li>
            <li> When you drop them in the hot water do so for only a few seconds otherwise they shrink up pretty quick.  I think they need to be in the water for around 5-10 seconds tops.  They worked well and molded to the shape of my teeth with a little extra help from my lips sucking them in toward my gums.  Only grip is why send just 3?  Seems like it should be 4 so you have two sets.  I just thought three was an odd number.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use in conjunction with Plus White 5 minute Bleach Whitening Gel and boy did it work!!! these trays help keep the product on your teeth and not wash around in your mouth or foam out... Oh, and you can get a really close fit if you follow the instructions properly... A+++</li>
            <li> I followed the directions, but these shrunk in 2 seconds!  I tried to use them anyway and the tray split in half.  Terrible waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for my sister and her teeth look great!  She was able to mold the trays to her teeth and had wonderful results!</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Good fit easy to use, easy to trim down with toe nail cutters. Best price on Amazon but they do come from quite a ways away so shippingidoes take a while. Great product, no reason to purchase a more expensive product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really give an accurate assessment of these trays because....I got no instructions with them!  Just three trays, in a bag, in a small envelope.  I guess I can work out how to do it based on passed reviews, but this is quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> Awesome molds. Thick. Strong. Exactly what your looking for. Kid you not I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of whitening trays in my days and these have worked out the best. Picture doesn&#x27;t do justice.</li>
            <li> I ordered from Patriot Dental here on Amazon.  My product arrived in a sandwich bag, the clear ones that fold over.  I did not feel this was sanitary to used because it was not in sealed packaging.  So I really have no idea how well the trays even work.  The seller told me I am suppose to boil the trays as if 3-6 seconds boiling water kills all living bacteria.  Trays traveling from between their hands in a sandwich bag through the post office through 4 different states...it&#x27;s insane for me to trust to put it in mouth.  We surely do not buy our toothbrushes in sandwich bags. Seller did refund me though. But the fact that they felt it was acceptable is why I posted.</li>
            <li> There is a very fine line between getting it hot enough to actually mold to your teeth and too hot where the mold curls up upon itself while still in the hot water pot. The difference between not hot enough and too hot can be about 3-4 seconds depending on the water temperature.</li>
            <li> Good Teeth Trays. Happy with my purchase. Good price on them too and see to hold up really well.  Would buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Junk... Want even take the right shape</li>
            <li> effective and durable!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet but I like it.</li>
            <li> I wrote a negative review and it was  deleted.  Terrible customer service!  Would absolutely NOT recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Interesting...&lt;br /&gt;...but seem to work.&lt;br /&gt;Suggest reading some of the other reviews, in order to encourage you to learn how to use them properly.&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a second or third molding was beneficial...once i realized a completely tight fit wasnt the best way to encourage the whitening gel to make proper contact with the surface of my teeth. You need to allow for a lil bit of space, in order to let the gel have room to sit there and treat the surface of the tooth, if that can be a better wording/description.</li>
            <li> The description, &amp;#34;thermofitting&amp;#34; was misleading. It didn&#x27;t form to my teeth. It keeps the gel in place for the most part but it&#x27;s still not comfortable. My main question is...Why three??? last time I checked someone only needs two....leads me to believe the company is just trying to make the price look better for the buy..</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stay in place and doesn&#x27;t form like your teeth even when I follow the direction as said step by step.</li>
            <li> Waste of MONEY!!! These trays turned to Jell-O as soon as they hit the water. I followed the directions exactly but they just melted away before I could mold them to my mouth. Would never purchase again.</li>
