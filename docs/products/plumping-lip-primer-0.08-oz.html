    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It is a wonderful balm, primer, and chap</li>
            <li>Excellent</li>
            <li>I especially love the minty/menthol feeling on my lips and when I breath in.</li>
            <li>But anyway, this is a good one!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for moisturizing and plumping up lips in a Chapstick form which is preferred instead of lip gloss.</li>
            <li>It does work as a good primer also.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>but it does moisturize and provide a nice barrier</li>
            <li>Received quickly and feels good.</li>
            <li>but when I do put gloss over this primer plumper, my lips do look healthy for a while.</li>
            <li>I like it better than City Lips.</li>
            <li>I love this product and cannot imagine why it&#x27;s no longer available in stores!  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>it feels just like lip gloss and the colors seem to stick to my lips more.</li>
            <li>My lips love this product.</li>
            <li>Someone else may have better results.</li>
            <li>Keeps your lips smooth and allows for better lipstick application.</li>
            <li>But it decreases wrinkles so makes lipstick go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>My lips are now smooth and fuller looking.</li>
            <li>I personally haven&#x27;t experienced any pain or burning sensation at all.</li>
            <li>Makes lips sweet and moist.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t plump the lips at all, but it feels cool.</li>
            <li>so your lipstick doesn&#x27;t run and that is good enough for me!</li>
            <li>I will keep using it till it is gone, but I will have to look for a different kind of plumping primer.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday as a chapstick because it does such a good job at keeping my lips feeling and looking smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>And I don&#x27;t know why, but most stores where I live don&#x27;t carry much Sally Hansen lip products if at all ..mostly all nail.</li>
            <li>This is my most favorite everyday lip product.</li>
            <li>However, he is light skinned and his skin happens to be very sensitive.</li>
            <li>with consistent use you can see the difference.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Well it turns out it really improved my lips!</li>
            <li>Also is tastes great, to me at least.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is a slight tingle every once in a while which is nice.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like that.</li>
            <li>While this product says it &amp;#34;plumps,&amp;#34; it really just smooths.  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really do a lot for me.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say it really plumps lips</li>
            <li>only negative I&#x27;ve experienced was my boyfriend complaining that it kinda burns his lips.</li>
            <li>I have high quality lipstick and cheaper brands and it makes them both stay a lot longer..</li>
            <li>Especially if you have chapped or dry lips, you&#x27;ll like this:)</li>
            <li>It smooths and primes my lips for lipstick and actually makes them last longer and not transfer to my teeth or travel into the fine lines around my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear lipstick on a regular basis</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my most favorite everyday lip product. For me, I actually prefer the tingling/cooling feeling and there&#x27;s also some type of cocoa butter ..or something.. in it that I think contributes to the smoothing of my lips.  I use it everyday as a chapstick because it does such a good job at keeping my lips feeling and looking smooth and healthy. I normally don&#x27;t wear lipstick on a regular basis so I can&#x27;t say if it keeps my lipstick on for a long time.. but when I do put gloss over this primer plumper, my lips do look healthy for a while. And I don&#x27;t know why, but most stores where I live don&#x27;t carry much Sally Hansen lip products if at all ..mostly all nail. I really don&#x27;t like that. So I gotta buy my primer plumper online. But anyway, this is a good one! Especially if you have chapped or dry lips, you&#x27;ll like this:)</li>
            <li> I use this instead of lip balm.  Makes lips sweet and moist. This product has been hard for me to find though. I like it better than City Lips.</li>
            <li> I love this product and cannot imagine why it&#x27;s no longer available in stores!  Keeps your lips smooth and allows for better lipstick application.</li>
            <li> While this product says it &amp;#34;plumps,&amp;#34; it really just smooths.  But it decreases wrinkles so makes lipstick go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> I like the tingling effect it has on my lips but don&#x27;t notice any actual increase in the size of my lips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s makes my lipstick last for extra hours!!! I have high quality lipstick and cheaper brands and it makes them both stay a lot longer..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t plump the lips at all, but it feels cool. It does work as a good primer also.</li>
            <li> Received quickly and feels good.</li>
            <li> I love this it&#x27;s great for moisturizing and plumping up lips in a Chapstick form which is preferred instead of lip gloss. It has a slight stinging/tingling that lets you know it&#x27;s working. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> If I had bought this at Ulta, I would have returned it.</li>
            <li> I put it on overnight and in the morning my lips are noticeably fuller! Not a miracle product but with consistent use you can see the difference.</li>
            <li> it feels just like lip gloss and the colors seem to stick to my lips more. i would probably buy again</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I was expecting. It is a wonderful balm, primer, and chap stick all in one. There is a slight tingle every once in a while which is nice. It has a minty scent and goes on like a matte chap stick. Not greasy at all. My lips love this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this plumper for years and I swear by it.  It smooths and primes my lips for lipstick and actually makes them last longer and not transfer to my teeth or travel into the fine lines around my mouth.  Cannot be without it!</li>
            <li> Well first it doesn&#x27;t work at all and second my tube was broken</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really do a lot for me. Someone else may have better results.</li>
            <li> Excellent but doesn&#x27;t plump the lips like I thought it would</li>
            <li> I like it for the primer part.  But there is no plumping happening in this.  It  is just another type of lip balm.  I will keep using it till it is gone, but I will have to look for a different kind of plumping primer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say it really plumps lips but it does moisturize and provide a nice barrier so your lipstick doesn&#x27;t run and that is good enough for me!</li>
            <li> I purchased this lip primer at a cvs in my area. I have terribly chapped lips and I bought it to help improve the appearance of the lipsticks.  Well it turns out it really improved my lips! I use this primer every day multiple times a day as a chapstick. I love it! My lips are now smooth and fuller looking. Also when I use a lipstick over it I do feel like it last longer, as long as its not too glossy of a lipstick. I especially love the minty/menthol feeling on my lips and when I breath in. Also is tastes great, to me at least. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing more in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I&#x27;ve experienced was my boyfriend complaining that it kinda burns his lips. However, he is light skinned and his skin happens to be very sensitive. I personally haven&#x27;t experienced any pain or burning sensation at all.</li>
