    <ol>
            <li>Has no odor which is great.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I thought at the price I paid</li>
            <li>I bought this product based on some good reviews.</li>
            <li>the good reviews are no longer on here</li>
            <li>and they were very prominent.  </li>
            <li>I have many spider veins in my lower legs, in the ankle area.  </li>
            <li>I was willing to try this product since I had read that vitamin K was actually good at removing the appearance of spider veins.  </li>
            <li>Be aware with this product!</li>
            <li>I used twice a day and waited to put clothes or socks on to make sure it absorbed completely into my legs.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply twice daily in morning and in evening.</li>
            <li>After a month and a half of using it, I still can see my veins, but they are definitely better.</li>
            <li>cuz it&#x27;s not doing anything dif then making skin soft just like lotion dose</li>
            <li>Veins in my legs has been reduced considerably.</li>
            <li>In fact, you can barely see them on the inside of the ankle because I had them on both sides on both legs</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Be aware with this product! I used it twice a day for almost two months and I didn&#x27;t see any changes at all. I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
            <li> After a month and a half of using it, I still can see my veins, but they are definitely better.</li>
            <li> In fact, you can barely see them on the inside of the ankle because I had them on both sides on both legs and they were very prominent.  I used twice a day and waited to put clothes or socks on to make sure it absorbed completely into my legs.  It can take up to 6 months to see changes with products like this, whether it&#x27;s for veins or for wrinkles or hair growth.  Nothing I&#x27;ve ever tried has worked in a week or two, or even a month.  It always takes time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t  seen any inprovement</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t works at all. Nothing happened or any changes. Money wasting at all. It wasn&#x27;t works for me. I am so disappointed to this product.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I thought at the price I paid I&#x27;d rather return it and get my money back and just buy a reg lotion cuz it&#x27;s not doing anything dif then making skin soft just like lotion dose but lotion is cheaper way cheaper so it sucks</li>
            <li> It helped fade a little, I will keep on using it.  Will let you know the results.</li>
            <li> I have many spider veins in my lower legs, in the ankle area.  I was willing to try this product since I had read that vitamin K was actually good at removing the appearance of spider veins.  It didn&#x27;t work.  I could not see any difference at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on some good reviews. the good reviews are no longer on here and I&#x27;m wondering now if they were fake. Don&#x27;t waste your time or money. Wish I had my $18 back.</li>
            <li> Veins in my legs has been reduced considerably. It is easy to apply twice daily in morning and in evening.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! It takes some time but if used consistently it really gets rid of nasty unsightly veins!</li>

            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work I&#x27;ve been using it for month and no changes at all!</li>
            <li> It simply does not work. I used it twice every day as prescribed and it made no difference at all.</li>
            <li> Still waiting to see the change, finish a week(7 days)</li>
            <li> If you have spider vien go to professional don&#x27;t waste your money on this product it is waste of money.</li>
