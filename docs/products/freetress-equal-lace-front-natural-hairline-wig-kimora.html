            <li>LOL!!!</li>
            <li>This wig is awesome it all that, women get jealous and the men keep looking, and even tell me how beautiful I look, they think it is my hair</li>

            <li>Great packaging.</li>
            <li>is great for the price.</li>
            <li>IS GREAT</li>
            <li>This Wig is quite full and very beautiful, the baby hairs do create the perfect invisible hairline but the length is not like the picture.</li>
            <li>very nice lace wig.</li>
            <li>[keep in mind it is CURLY hair also, and that adds to the fullness] but a good change.</li>
            <li>It is VERY full, great quality hair, and fits well.</li>
            <li>And I immediately fell in love!</li>
            <li>The look can take you from work to a nice evening out.</li>
            <li>and i still have a beautiful head full of hair.</li>
            <li>I received the wig VERY quickly!</li>
            <li>Very neat and good service!</li>
            <li>, I can curl it with the hot curlers and make many style, it make me look so beautiful, and I get a lot of attention from everyone.</li>
            <li>I was satisfied with the delivery time.</li>
            <li>It was fantastic!</li>
            <li>I received today, and I am pleased, I know it will take some playing with it to get these curls in shape, but I feel so glad, my girl arrived today.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the Jealousy wig has \\&quot;baby hair\\&quot; more so in the back.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to the perfumes in your conditioner as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you don this wig - make sure you use the straps.  </li>
            <li>Love it about to slay the world</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>CURLS, CURLS AND MORE CURLS LADIES</li>
            <li>LOVE YOU.</li>
            <li>I love this hair but not at the original length.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much kind of layered in the front for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is more bright red.</li>
            <li>Well, after i spritzed this wig with conditioner/water and did a light brushing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;What&#x27;s really cool about the Kimora wig, if you&#x27;re going to wear a ponytail, you don&#x27;t have to cut for the bangs.  </li>
            <li>IT IS COOL</li>
            <li>YOU WILL LOVE THIS HAIR, VERY SOFT TO TOUCH THE LENGTH</li>
            <li>Take notice to how full the hair really is.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
            <li>THAT is exactly what this wig looks like.  </li>
            <li>Maybe wash the wig first before throwing it out..</li>
            <li>You are able to style this wig with a flat iron or curling iron.</li>
            <li>Soak it in mildly soapy cool water, rinse, let drip dry, and apply a generous amount of infusium leave in conditioner treatment while it is still damp.</li>
            <li>It was very \\&quot;full\\&quot; and a lot of body when I tried it on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very curly and big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kimora, it sheds, but not so much - so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The straps you will definitely need to ensure a comfortable grip on your head.</li>
            <li>Covered my whole bathroom floor</li>
            <li>I was able to tone the curls down.</li>
            <li>i wear the Kimora, i didn&#x27;t have a tangling problem - very minor, plus the ponytail was full and curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks natural and doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li>I really would like to send it back and the hairline scratches</li>
            <li>/&gt;The Kimora has very pronounced baby hairs in the back and the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;The Kimora has very pronounced baby hairs in the back and the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To much  hair heavy on head, you must have a big head to wear this, it you like big heavy hair you may like this .</li>
            <li> Tamed the curls some and stretched them out into a longer length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The Jealousy wig is really not made to wear down and pulled back in a pony tail without the tracks showing at the crown.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, with this wig, if you wear a low ponytail?</li>
            <li> /&gt;that&#x27;s really not the style i was looking for when i bought this wig.  </li>
            <li> Just wet and finger threw.</li>
            <li> Most wigs cant be returned so I decided to try to make it work by cutting bangs and tried to make it work but couldn&#x27;t get past the color.</li>
            <li> i have this limp thing hanging down my back</li>
            <li> It came before the due date and was packaged well.</li>
            <li> you can do this style due to  volume.  </li>
            <li> I basically cut mine in half</li>
            <li> Thiswig is not made for small heads.</li>
            <li> Fits small.</li>
            <li> Too bushy and the curls are hard to keep.</li>
            <li> I absolutely hate straight hair.  </li>
            <li> If you are not used to full hair, it is a bit shocking</li>
            <li> Mesh is also very weak and comes apart at slight  stretching</li>
            <li> Was VERY unhappy with this order.</li>
            <li> Husband hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed not look like the picture</li>
            <li> Worst wig I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>

            <li> It wasnt the color I wanted</li>
            <li> Very disappointed not look like the picture</li>
            <li> I was satisfied with the delivery time. It came before the due date and was packaged well. I must say that I am not a big fan of BIG HAIR. It was very \\&quot;full\\&quot; and a lot of body when I tried it on. however, since I know how to do hair I was able to tone the curls down. You are able to style this wig with a flat iron or curling iron. I recommend it for woman who like big hair.</li>
            <li> Looks natural and doesn&#x27;t tangle.</li>
            <li> I received the wig VERY quickly! And I immediately fell in love! It was fantastic! It is VERY full, great quality hair, and fits well. No extra adjusting needed. I didn&#x27;t find myself having to go to the bathroom to &#x27;fix&#x27; its fitting-stayed in place well. Great quality. Great packaging. Very neat and good service! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! Take notice to how full the hair really is. If you are not used to full hair, it is a bit shocking [keep in mind it is CURLY hair also, and that adds to the fullness] but a good change.</li>
            <li> To much  hair heavy on head, you must have a big head to wear this, it you like big heavy hair you may like this .</li>
            <li> very nice lace wig.I often reorder this one. The look can take you from work to a nice evening out.</li>
            <li> It looks like a ball of plastic hair .there are no highlights and its to to big I really would like to send it back and the hairline scratches</li>
            <li> I received today, and I am pleased, I know it will take some playing with it to get these curls in shape, but I feel so glad, my girl arrived today. yessa.</li>
            <li> Well, after i spritzed this wig with conditioner/water and did a light brushing.  THAT is exactly what this wig looks like.  It&#x27;s very curly and big.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;that&#x27;s really not the style i was looking for when i bought this wig.  I actually wanted something to wear to work every day that had some \\&quot;texture\\&quot; to it.  I absolutely hate straight hair.  Thus, i can wear this wig to work, Just as i did with the Jealousy wig. In low ponytail with curly bags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s really cool about the Kimora wig, if you&#x27;re going to wear a ponytail, you don&#x27;t have to cut for the bangs.  It&#x27;s pretty much kind of layered in the front for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll compare this wig to the \\&quot;Jealousy\\&quot; wig that i had also purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Jealousy wig has \\&quot;baby hair\\&quot; more so in the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Kimora has very pronounced baby hairs in the back and the front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jealousy wig is really not made to wear down and pulled back in a pony tail without the tracks showing at the crown.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, with this wig, if you wear a low ponytail? you&#x27;ll see cowlicks sticking up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the Kimora you can do this style due to  volume.  I wore it to the gym in a pony tail, and no tracks showed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jealousy wig sheds like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.  Within 3 weeks, 1/4th of my wig was in the brush and in the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kimora, it sheds, but not so much - so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i wear a low ponytail with the Jealousy wig,  i have this limp thing hanging down my back that&#x27;s scratchy, and tangles up everytime i turn my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i wear the Kimora, i didn&#x27;t have a tangling problem - very minor, plus the ponytail was full and curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these wigs are synthetic, thus beware of having a rash on your skin.  Look for anything  on your shoulders and back.  Maybe wash the wig first before throwing it out.. See if that works.  and make sure you&#x27;re not allergic to the perfumes in your conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost forgot to add?  Thiswig is not made for small heads. When you don this wig - make sure you use the straps.  I always cut out the combs on all of my wigs, they are known for taking out the hair on the temples as well as in the back with repeated use.  The straps you will definitely need to ensure a comfortable grip on your head.</li>
            <li> Fits small. Mesh is also very weak and comes apart at slight  stretching</li>
            <li> Love it about to slay the world</li>
            <li> I love this hair but not at the original length. WARNING is a lot of hair. I basically cut mine in half it is shoulder length now. I also did a lot of thining out of this hair. Covered my whole bathroom floor and i still have a beautiful head full of hair. Just wet and finger threw. is great for the price.</li>
            <li> This wig is awesome it all that, women get jealous and the men keep looking, and even tell me how beautiful I look, they think it is my hair LOL!!! I love it, I can curl it with the hot curlers and make many style, it make me look so beautiful, and I get a lot of attention from everyone.</li>
            <li> Was VERY unhappy with this order. Ordered the color as shown and it is not as pictured. It is more bright red. Most wigs cant be returned so I decided to try to make it work by cutting bangs and tried to make it work but couldn&#x27;t get past the color. Husband hated it. Wish I would&#x27;ve just returned it..</li>
            <li> Too bushy and the curls are hard to keep. Worst wig I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> This Wig is quite full and very beautiful, the baby hairs do create the perfect invisible hairline but the length is not like the picture. It is a lot shorter than pictured, I had to treat it 2 times to get some length out of it. Soak it in mildly soapy cool water, rinse, let drip dry, and apply a generous amount of infusium leave in conditioner treatment while it is still damp. Tamed the curls some and stretched them out into a longer length.</li>
            <li> CURLS, CURLS AND MORE CURLS LADIES YOU WILL LOVE THIS HAIR, VERY SOFT TO TOUCH THE LENGTH IS GREAT&lt;br /&gt;AND IT IS COOL ON YOUR HEAD A MUST HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION OF LACE WIGS.  FEEL JUST LIKE YOUR ON HAIR.&lt;br /&gt;BUY IT AND YOU WILL AGREE.  LOVE YOU.</li>
