            <li>I like the powder cleanser a little better, but this is still a good cleanser.</li>
            <li>Oh, quick tip.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this leaves my skin feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I rarely have a blemish, and when I do, it goes away as quick as it came.</li>
            <li>well worth the $$.  </li>
            <li>With this cleanser my skin always feels fresh, hydrated, exfoliated and looks even-toned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years and can honestly say I think I&#x27;ve only had one pimple.</li>
            <li>It takes so little to get a good squeaky clean feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a budget right now</li>
            <li>Did get credited for this product cause it wasn&#x27;t packaged right .  </li>
            <li>Like when you clean a window too much...</li>
            <li>Helplessly I went to my good old bare mineral store and explained my need.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff,it definitely does it&#x27;s job as a foaming cleanser!</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>I have not had a breakout since using this consistently.</li>
            <li>Overall this cleanser is similar to Lancome Creme Radiance but not as good.</li>
            <li>It easily washes away my mascara along with any other makeup, leaves skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cleansing without being too drying.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reimbursing me .</li>
            <li>Honestly after just a few days my skin truly was looking healthier.</li>
            <li>Takes makeup off nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a deep clean without having any &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I switched to this deep cleansing formula and it get my skin as clean as soap without all the drying effects soap has.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not into spending alot of money on cleansers, as most of it goes down the drain</li>
            <li>And my skin feels more tight after using it.</li>
            <li>Just started using this product and love it, a little goes along way</li>
            <li>I really was surprised at</li>
            <li>I also seem to be getting a few more breakouts.</li>
            <li>I first purchased the Bare Minerals cleanser for combination skin.  </li>
            <li>That way, your skin is ready to really benefit from the Deep Cleansing Foam.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like when I first started this cleanser</li>
            <li>The price is fine because one tube will last a very long time.</li>
            <li>I love the way this cleanser foams and makes you feel like you are getting a deep down scrub.  </li>
            <li>Also smells like old socks or something..</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;foam is like a silk, last very long.&lt;br /&gt;cleanse</li>
            <li>Only use a pea size amount and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Also, my face feels clean without that tight feeling of having moisture stripped skin.</li>
            <li>Great reviews and big disappointment for me.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the feeling of it, kind of like old school soap that leaves weird feeling on the face and hands.</li>
            <li>Sorry I don&#x27;t know how to explain it any better!</li>
            <li>I use it twice a day, followed by the Bare Minerals moisturizer for combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Paired with my favorite tinted moisturizer I have been receiving compliments on my skin which has rarely, if ever, happened before due to its tendency to be dry and oily in all the wrong places.</li>

            <li> Plus whAt other reviewers have said is true - a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> So it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> So this will last me a very long time.</li>
            <li> One tube will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> With sensitive skin and being a golden girl it is difficult to find a cleanser that works for me or does what it says...</li>
            <li> I have used neumorous products including the all natural recent Arbonne too to help my sensitivite skin that strated breaking out continuously for the past 4 months.</li>
            <li> I plan on using it for as long as they make it.  </li>
            <li> Works well with dry skin.  </li>
            <li> The only plus is that a little goes long way.  </li>
            <li> I paid the same amount for a tube half this size.  </li>
            <li> All it takes is a very tiny dab, I use less than the label says to use.  </li>
            <li> Minus that it can not be used to remove eye make up.</li>
            <li> Had to wait 2 weeks longer than expected delivery time.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit of this goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way - sometimes when I have been in a rush and squeezed the tube too frantically</li>
            <li> The product lathers well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A small dab of cleanser works into a luxurious, creamy lather that gets deep into my pores.</li>
            <li> Where do you set it down since it stands on the lid.   </li>
            <li> I use less then a dime size per wash.</li>
            <li> A foaming cleanser that doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight.</li>
            <li> It did not clean the excess oil and gave me blemishes.  </li>
            <li> However, the screw off lid is hard to deal with when you have the product in your hand, its wet, and you are in the shower.</li>
            <li> It just takes a very little bit to do the job.</li>
            <li> Why do companies make it hard to use their products.</li>
            <li> A very small amount needs to be used at a time because of how well it lathers.  </li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t afford for it to go to waste, unfortunately.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love it.  I have used this for several years and do not plan to ever stop.  It easily washes away my mascara along with any other makeup, leaves skin soft and smooth.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love the way this cleanser foams and makes you feel like you are getting a deep down scrub.  However, the screw off lid is hard to deal with when you have the product in your hand, its wet, and you are in the shower. Where do you set it down since it stands on the lid.   A flip top lid would make all the difference...really so simple. Why do companies make it hard to use their products. Beacuse of this - I may never buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had been using the Bare Minerals Purifying Cleanser (which worked great) and was going to order that, but I would have been charged shipping. I saw this cleanser with free shipping and the reviews looked pretty good so I got it instead. That was a big mistake. This cleanser leaves a bit of sort of a film on my face. Just doesn&#x27;t wash away clean. And my skin feels more tight after using it. I also seem to be getting a few more breakouts. I am going to use it until it runs out and then go back to the purifying cleanser. I&#x27;m on a budget right now so can&#x27;t afford for it to go to waste, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,it definitely does it&#x27;s job as a foaming cleanser!</li>
            <li> Finally! A foaming cleanser that doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel tight. This product is all I use, have for years, but was unaware they had this face wash. Arrived early, packaged great. Lots of it, will last quite awhile if used as stated. Very happy buyer.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!  Works well with dry skin.  A very small amount needs to be used at a time because of how well it lathers.  Also saved money by purchasing it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is some of the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used - well worth the $$.  It takes so little to get a good squeaky clean feel.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  It just takes a very little bit to do the job. So it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Best wash ever! I only use it when I wear make up. which is like 2 times a week. So this will last me a very long time. I use less then a dime size per wash. does the job!</li>
            <li> Great reviews and big disappointment for me.  I don&#x27;t like the feeling of it, kind of like old school soap that leaves weird feeling on the face and hands. It actually does leave the residue.  Minus that it can not be used to remove eye make up. Also smells like old socks or something..;)  The only plus is that a little goes long way.  Overall this cleanser is similar to Lancome Creme Radiance but not as good.</li>
            <li> Had to wait 2 weeks longer than expected delivery time. Product is fine though.</li>
            <li> I love the way this leaves my skin feeling clean and soft. I have not had a breakout since using this consistently. Paired with my favorite tinted moisturizer I have been receiving compliments on my skin which has rarely, if ever, happened before due to its tendency to be dry and oily in all the wrong places.</li>
            <li> I paid the same amount for a tube half this size.  I was very pleased and love this product!  Will buy over and over again.</li>
            <li> With sensitive skin and being a golden girl it is difficult to find a cleanser that works for me or does what it says... this one does I will continue using this one.....</li>
            <li> This cleanser always leaves my face feeling very clean.  It has helped alot with my acne and I will keep using it</li>
            <li> wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;foam is like a silk, last very long.&lt;br /&gt;cleanse skin very nicely.</li>
            <li> I really was surprised at how well I liked this face wash. I have hormonal acne and this face wash is perfectly balanced. It&#x27;s very cleansing without being too drying. Honestly after just a few days my skin truly was looking healthier. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, no face wash is but it&#x27;s most definitely worth the price. Plus whAt other reviewers have said is true - a little goes a very long way. This stuff is sudsy!</li>
            <li> I love this product, because it doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.  I have to use eye drops that leave a residue, and this washes it away painlessly.</li>
            <li> I hope my skin is clean...it feels very clean with no suds or feeling of residue.</li>
            <li> This is SO great.  It&#x27;s a deep clean without having any &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; exfoliant which irritates my skin.</li>
            <li> Best Face wash on the market!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use this in the morning and i use the purifying facial cleanser at night. Great pair together and i received the item with great packaging! No problems whatsoever! Everyone women, mother, daughter, friend needs this!</li>
            <li> I first purchased the Bare Minerals cleanser for combination skin.  It did not clean the excess oil and gave me blemishes.  I switched to this deep cleansing formula and it get my skin as clean as soap without all the drying effects soap has.  I love this product.  I plan on using it for as long as they make it.  I use it twice a day, followed by the Bare Minerals moisturizer for combination skin.  My skin is looking so much better!  Oh, quick tip.  All it takes is a very tiny dab, I use less than the label says to use.  One tube will last you a very long time.</li>
            <li> I received a sample bottle of this cleanser and fell in love! This cleanser is the best thing I have ever used to clean my face. A small dab of cleanser works into a luxurious, creamy lather that gets deep into my pores. The price is fine because one tube will last a very long time. Worth every penny! I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Great face wash! Takes makeup off nicely and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.  A little bit of this goes a long way so it lasts a while.</li>
            <li> Really good stuff.  Only use a pea size amount and it cleans very well.</li>
            <li> Did get credited for this product cause it wasn&#x27;t packaged right .  Thanks for reimbursing me . Have tried this product before and I liked it .</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! It is not drying to the skin and still does a great job cleansing!</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best facial cleansers you can get for this price. I buy mine regularly at Ulta, it&#x27;s about $5 cheaper than Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Remove your make-up before washing. This isn&#x27;t meant to be in your eyes, it will burn. Dermalogica&#x27;s Precleanse is truly their best offering to the world. That way, your skin is ready to really benefit from the Deep Cleansing Foam. This is also amazing with a Clarisonic brush. A little does go a long way - sometimes when I have been in a rush and squeezed the tube too frantically and the cream doesn&#x27;t foam as well as it should. A tiny pearl is all you need, making this last for months. I have oily, dehydrated skin that is prone to acne and comedones. With this cleanser my skin always feels fresh, hydrated, exfoliated and looks even-toned. I rarely have a blemish, and when I do, it goes away as quick as it came. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like when I first started this cleanser is it leaves a \\&quot;squeeky\\&quot; feeling on my face. Like when you clean a window too much... Sorry I don&#x27;t know how to explain it any better! It&#x27;s not a big thing and it only lasts until you put your sunscreen/moisturizer. Great cleanser, great price and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not into spending alot of money on cleansers, as most of it goes down the drain (i&#x27;d rather save it for the serums and night creams). This cleanser is amazing though.. can&#x27;t believe how this tiny pea size cream lathers like it does. Also, my face feels clean without that tight feeling of having moisture stripped skin. I use it with an olay spinbrush sometimes too.. love it.</li>
            <li> I like the powder cleanser a little better, but this is still a good cleanser. Washes off easily and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Just started using this product and love it, a little goes along way so makes you feel you got your moneys worth plus makes my skin look and feel great.</li>
            <li> I use these products all the time and it is nice to be able to purchase them on Amazon. It is a great cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about two years and can honestly say I think I&#x27;ve only had one pimple. I am going through surgical menopause and have been on and off hormone therapy, which can cause breakouts. The bottle lasts forever, as each wash only requires a pea-sized amount. It doesn&#x27;t prevent clogged pores, though.</li>
            <li> This combined with the exfoliating powder and a face brush do wonders for the skin. I follow it up with bareMinerals moisturizer. I break out with almost all skin care products, but these work beautifully for me. Don&#x27;t change or discontinue them!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> This is my daily facial cleanser, and I&#x27;ve been using it ever I stumbled upon it in 2010.  I have oil skin and am acne prone.  This product dramatically cuts the oil and reduces my acne.  My skin feels clean and smooth after using this.  I don&#x27;t have to use toner on my face ever since using this.  I use in conjection with the moisturizer daily and my skin is very happy.  The product lathers well and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about 1 week know. I have used neumorous products including the all natural recent Arbonne too to help my sensitivite skin that strated breaking out continuously for the past 4 months. Helplessly I went to my good old bare mineral store and explained my need. The store rep asked me to stop using every thing for 2 weeks and try this Deep Cleansing Foam for 2 wks. It has been only one wk since I strated using it twice daily and amazingly I havent had another pimple since the 1st day I tried this product. I&#x27;m extremely Happy and thankful towards bareminerals for coming up with this amazing product.</li>
