            <li>I have used Braun since I was 14 and have always been impressed by the performance.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything that does a real good job on the neck hairs.</li>
            <li>I have tried them all and find the Braun to be the best for the money.</li>

            <li>It upgraded my razor :P</li>
            <li>The replacement one does not work good...</li>
            <li>but that is a good thing).  </li>
            <li>The online description listed this blade as being for the 6000 series, but I had read elsewhere that it has good compatibility.  </li>
            <li>The shaver battery still holds a good charge, so I pick this up every once in a while.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, good replacement.</li>
            <li>I am very  pleased with my purchase and recommend it to anyone needing replacement parts.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.    </li>
            <li>We were very pleased with both the product and the expeditious way in which we received it.  </li>
            <li>and you will be a happy camper for sure.</li>
            <li>Love it !&lt;</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this cutter, Thanks</li>
            <li>Have bought many of these over time and quality remains good.</li>
            <li>Excellent replacement fit like original.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, recharges quickly great blades, sharpness wise.</li>
            <li>The new part fits perfectly onto my razor, no problems.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would fit the 5775, but it does &amp; now my shaver is happy again....</li>
            <li>blade and foil head are very easy to replace - so do yourself a favor and buy this.</li>
            <li>I found the best price through Amazon, nearly $9.00 including postage.  </li>
            <li>has slightly different foil perforation than the original foil but fits my 5775 model perfectly and works great</li>
            <li>A good product, like the original.</li>
            <li>but it still works fine!  </li>
            <li>I DO know his skin is very smooth after he shaves.</li>
            <li>This was a perfect fit and makes my razor perform like it is brand new.  </li>
            <li>so I ordered this replacement from Amazon and am perfectly satisfied that I have another 5 years&#x27; life for this razor.</li>
            <li>Braun simply makes the best electric shaving products.</li>
            <li>Make sure you get the 6000 series, not the 4000 series.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>also the shaver motor ran a lot better.</li>
            <li>been working great , smooth no nicks easy to clean</li>
            <li>I was glad to find this on Amazon, as my shaver was in need of a refresh.</li>
            <li>You might be able to find it cheaper in stores</li>
            <li>Make sure to look up your model on the Braun service website to find the correct parts.</li>
            <li>For many years I delt with razor burns and bumps.  </li>
            <li>Nice smooth shave</li>
            <li>So you can see that this is a \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; in more ways than one.</li>
            <li>The Braun 5315 is probably the best electric I&#x27;ve owned because it never discharges, no matter if I forget to charge it for an extra day.</li>
            <li>I am glad they still make this item---because I&#x27;d have to have a &amp;#34;Retirement Ceremony&amp;#34; for my Braun Shaver, if they ever discontinue this screen / cutter model.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed for a good price.  </li>
            <li>But the shaver works great with the new foil.</li>
            <li>research and Amazon had the best price when I purchased it especially with the free shipping.</li>
            <li>I have had no problems so far, and am extremly happy with the replacement.</li>
            <li>Wow, it is great.  </li>
            <li>For almost $30, I expect a better fit.  </li>
            <li>These replacement heads for a Braun shaver are effective and worth the money.  </li>
            <li>The screen doesn&#x27;t pop off when you press the release button but it pulls off easily while you are pushing the release button.  </li>
            <li>Installing is easy.</li>
            <li>but it works fine.</li>
            <li>it works just fine.</li>
            <li>It was fine.</li>
            <li>Everything works fine.  </li>
            <li>Braun makes great solid products!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just what I was looking for to fit my razor.  </li>
            <li>I have a light but full-face beard</li>
            <li>no i get a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Not the item that is pictured, it is a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li>Smooth results and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using my Braun razor but had torn a hole in its original foil.  </li>
            <li>finally a clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li>The product is original manufacturer replacement part.  </li>
            <li>This foil/cutterblock appear to be factory produced and shave just like the original blades did.</li>
            <li>where as original one took one time shave...</li>
            <li>The original I had, worked for 4 years(It</li>
            <li>What can you say, It&#x27;s Original Equipment Manucacturer replacement blade for the 5000/6000 series and works like it should.</li>
            <li>Original product and fits as designed.</li>
            <li>I received and original Braun product.</li>
            <li>It does not shave clean..</li>
            <li>I have an old razor and this part fit nicely.</li>
            <li>It cuts close to the face and leaves a clean shave.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted to have my Braun back!</li>
            <li>works better than i could hope, really is as close a shave as my mach 3.</li>
            <li>and it fit right in.  </li>
            <li>These replacement blades sure did the job of replacing and refurbishing my old trusty Braun shave to new .It would be nice if they lasted longer ?</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;new\\&quot; 6000FC-BK &lt;br /&gt;now replaces both the 5000 and 6000 series - it seems to work fine but caused concern when I first received it.</li>
            <li>Have been using them in my electric razor and quickly noticed an improvement in the shave provided.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery from vendor, too.</li>
            <li>Luckily, I discovered this replacement pack.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and after changing the foil and blade.</li>
            <li>I was hoping that I&#x27;d get lucky and get their older version of this, which has more space between the blades (thinner blades).  </li>
            <li>Also, delivery was really quick.</li>
            <li>Overall, excellent replacement that extends the life of my 6520 for a few more years.</li>
            <li>This order came as promised with normal quality and I am completely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my shaver and long lasting</li>
            <li>Although the replacement cutters fit properly on my older model 5824 shaver and cuts well, the noise level of the shaver while in use is significantly louder.  </li>
            <li>The block and foil perfectly fit my 6520 and as promised, I felt like I had a new razor again; smooth and not eating up my skin as the \\&quot;improved\\&quot; Panasonic did (I had bought this to replace my aging 6520)</li>
            <li>but I live outside the country so this worked great for me.</li>
            <li>This razor gives a great shave with little effort and no razor burn.</li>
            <li>All in all I would recommend this to any one seeking a great shave with little effort and burn.</li>
            <li>Great close shaves, relatively quiet and fine battery performance even now after daily use for 3 years.</li>
            <li>This fit my Flex Integral model very well</li>
            <li>These heads have always lasted a year or more, and I&#x27;ve had 4 or 5 so far (do the math</li>
            <li>It feels smoother when you run a finger over it, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s better than the old style.  </li>
            <li>Supplier provided the heads right on time.  </li>
            <li>, I think they were right...</li>
            <li>Your will notice the improvement right away.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and that is my story.</li>
            <li>The replacement installed easily and the razor performs like new.  </li>
            <li>I did a lot a reading and was not sure if this would be a good fit</li>
            <li>Its better to replace the blade than buy a whole new razor.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an older original - turns out</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t want the fabulous Braun design, buy a new razor...</li>
            <li>These blades &amp; screen fit perfectly, though they feel like they&#x27;re pulling or pinching skin occasionally, and I get some tiny cuts(s) over the rough part of my face</li>
            <li>Much nicer!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know better next time...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many, many electric razors over the years, and like my relatively inexpensive (no such thing in the electric razor world)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t aware that Braun recommends replacing the foil &amp; cutter block every 18 months.  </li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>At first we had a confusion with the model, because we receive the 31S, but after rinsing, the replacement was exactly what dealt.</li>
            <li>First I must say that I can&#x27;t believe my Braun 5000 model rechargeable razor still charges after 15 years</li>
            <li>Bought my shaver back in &#x27;98, use it mostly for travel.</li>
            <li>This replacement screen and razor head replacement blade are of great quality and last a long time for shaving comfort.</li>
            <li>it is not the item shown it is a much cheaper version !</li>
            <li>It would be nice if any other users have.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to have a new, sharp one.  </li>
            <li>This 5885 is much faster, the foil seems to collect hairs much better and the charge lasts for several weeks.</li>
            <li>Replaced this on my 6520 that I have had a long time and it works great, better than the previous one that I had for years when finally the plastic part broke.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing another one when this one wears out.</li>
            <li>the new one has a different and smarter pattern on the foil and is better.</li>
            <li>But it works very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>much quicker and much closer shave</li>
            <li>I opted for the whole cutterblock</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to be more careful after rinsing to brush away any standing water on this blade.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll really notice a difference.</li>
            <li>i really like this.</li>
            <li>Hopefully it will last years just like the original screen did.</li>
            <li>Fine craftsmanship, super sharp blades, fit precisely into shaver and last really long time (I kept my original cutter over 5 years, maybe a bit too long, but the fact was it was doing the job!).  </li>
            <li>Price was good but not exceptional.</li>
            <li>Hard to find item that keeps my favorite Braun electic razor working for several more years.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as advertised and allowed me to continue use of an old friend.</li>
            <li>After inserting the new blades, the razor works almost like brand new!!</li>
            <li>For 20 bucks I have a new shaver!</li>
            <li>Made the shaver like new again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely be replacing these much more regularly going forward.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m about to buy one more set before I expect to finally retire and replace my shaver next year.</li>
            <li>I purchased this shaver to replace an older Braun shaver that I had for over 10 years.</li>
            <li>This foil and head replacement works perfectly on my older - over 10 years - Braun Flex 6520 electric razor.  </li>
            <li>I was familiar with the previous version of this shave screen which had all the holes lined up in a nice little grid.  </li>
            <li>No complaint, it work as advertise and make your razor work like new again.</li>
            <li>this kit brought the quality right back.</li>
            <li>believe that right after a year it is necessary to change it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new screen and cutter blade made this shaver perform like a new unit.</li>
            <li>like a new razor.</li>
            <li>I wanted to continue using the shaver and lacked the $s to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>so I have to order online or buy a new razor, Amazon to the rescue.  </li>
            <li>This new shaver head and cutter when installed made all the difference to my shaving,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to reinvest in a new electric</li>
            <li>It feels like a new shaver.</li>
            <li>the new one was on.</li>
            <li>When I installed it, it was literally like a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li>Listen, if you need a new Foil/Cutterblock, you will know that already.</li>
            <li>I have the Braun 5600 series and I figured it was time for a new replacement foil.</li>
            <li>my shave now acts like it is new.  </li>
            <li>And if your battery is still holding a charge...Don&#x27;t go out and buy a new Braun just yet....</li>
            <li>Replaced the foil/cutterblock and it works like new.</li>
            <li>The razor is like new.</li>
            <li>This replacement screen and cutter make it feel like a new shaver all over again.</li>
            <li>the price of a new shaver, too.  </li>
            <li>old razor!  </li>
            <li>pretty well cleaned and use razor oil on the foil for extra life.</li>
            <li>Identical in form/fit/and function as the old one-what a difference!</li>
            <li>Razor that is about 8 years old shaves like a new razor when you put new foil and cutter block.</li>
            <li>My old Braun electric razor is like new again with this new foil and cutter set.</li>
            <li>i couldn&#x27;t be happier, smooth shave that costs much less than a new razor.</li>
            <li>Makes your old razor work like new.</li>
            <li>My old Braun shaver works just like new again....</li>
            <li>My razor is probably close to 25 years old and still works like new.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what was needed to bring my old Braun 6520 back to life!</li>
            <li>Next time, I buy a new shaver, which is perhaps what Braun wants.</li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference these make to the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li>I ended up ordering some AA rechargeable batteries with tabs (from another site) and soldered that in completely rebuilding my razor.  </li>
            <li>So far this one has held up for a month.</li>
            <li>I had my old blade for over a year</li>
            <li>I figured I would need this to replace the old one and then replace the shaver when it quits on me...</li>
            <li>Works like new and is quiet as new.</li>
            <li>The shaver works fine, but I&#x27;ve had faster shavers in the past.</li>
            <li>(I  was not sure when I first read the description as some other similar items seemed to be a more explicit match).  </li>
            <li>and now I am back in business without purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li>I have dropped it several times and chunks have broken off, yet it still functions amazingly well.  </li>
            <li>The replaceable cutting head makes it very cost effective.  </li>
            <li>There is no other use.</li>
            <li>The replacement foil for electric razor was  hard to install but works fine once on.</li>
            <li>Really a major improvement.  </li>
            <li>It takes twice as long to shave with this vs. their older design.  </li>
            <li>If your Braun is dull and lost its smooth shave...</li>
            <li>I got the current model, which, for my beard anyway, does NOT cut nearly as well.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m thinking of hiring fairies to keep my older one sharpened as long as it will last....</li>
            <li>the top fits a little snug but thats comparing it to one thats been popped on and off a few hundred or thousand times.  </li>
            <li>Feels like a new razor now, for a lot less than a new razor.  </li>
            <li>I like the idea of a subscription to this product, but the only time periods offered are far too short.</li>
            <li>Old blade was long in need of replacement sooo. . .</li>
            <li>The first one cracked and broke within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>I am not sure this is the right foil for my shaver.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Have bought many of these over time and quality remains good.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement fit like original.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, recharges quickly great blades, sharpness wise.</li>
            <li> The new part fits perfectly onto my razor, no problems.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would fit the 5775, but it does &amp; now my shaver is happy again....</li>
            <li> blade and foil head are very easy to replace - so do yourself a favor and buy this.</li>
            <li> I found the best price through Amazon, nearly $9.00 including postage.  </li>
            <li> has slightly different foil perforation than the original foil but fits my 5775 model perfectly and works great</li>
            <li> A good product, like the original.</li>
            <li> but it still works fine!  </li>
            <li> I DO know his skin is very smooth after he shaves.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect fit and makes my razor perform like it is brand new.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered this replacement from Amazon and am perfectly satisfied that I have another 5 years&#x27; life for this razor.</li>
            <li> Braun simply makes the best electric shaving products.</li>
            <li> Make sure you get the 6000 series, not the 4000 series.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> also the shaver motor ran a lot better.</li>
            <li> been working great , smooth no nicks easy to clean</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this on Amazon, as my shaver was in need of a refresh.</li>
            <li> You might be able to find it cheaper in stores</li>
            <li> Make sure to look up your model on the Braun service website to find the correct parts.</li>
            <li> For many years I delt with razor burns and bumps.  </li>
            <li> Nice smooth shave</li>
            <li> So you can see that this is a \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; in more ways than one.</li>
            <li> The Braun 5315 is probably the best electric I&#x27;ve owned because it never discharges, no matter if I forget to charge it for an extra day.</li>
            <li> I am glad they still make this item---because I&#x27;d have to have a &amp;#34;Retirement Ceremony&amp;#34; for my Braun Shaver, if they ever discontinue this screen / cutter model.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed for a good price.  </li>
            <li> But the shaver works great with the new foil.</li>
            <li> research and Amazon had the best price when I purchased it especially with the free shipping.</li>
            <li> I have had no problems so far, and am extremly happy with the replacement.</li>
            <li> Wow, it is great.  </li>
            <li> For almost $30, I expect a better fit.  </li>
            <li> These replacement heads for a Braun shaver are effective and worth the money.  </li>
            <li> The screen doesn&#x27;t pop off when you press the release button but it pulls off easily while you are pushing the release button.  </li>
            <li> Installing is easy.</li>
            <li> but it works fine.</li>
            <li> it works just fine.</li>
            <li> It was fine.</li>
            <li> Everything works fine.  </li>
            <li> Braun makes great solid products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for to fit my razor.  </li>
            <li> I have a light but full-face beard</li>
            <li> no i get a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li> Not the item that is pictured, it is a cheap knockoff.</li>
            <li> Smooth results and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy using my Braun razor but had torn a hole in its original foil.  </li>
            <li> finally a clean smooth shave.  </li>
            <li> The product is original manufacturer replacement part.  </li>
            <li> This foil/cutterblock appear to be factory produced and shave just like the original blades did.</li>
            <li> where as original one took one time shave...</li>
            <li> The original I had, worked for 4 years(It</li>
            <li> What can you say, It&#x27;s Original Equipment Manucacturer replacement blade for the 5000/6000 series and works like it should.</li>
            <li> Original product and fits as designed.</li>
            <li> I received and original Braun product.</li>
            <li> It does not shave clean..</li>
            <li> I have an old razor and this part fit nicely.</li>
            <li> It cuts close to the face and leaves a clean shave.  </li>
            <li> I am delighted to have my Braun back!</li>
            <li> works better than i could hope, really is as close a shave as my mach 3.</li>
            <li> and it fit right in.  </li>
            <li> These replacement blades sure did the job of replacing and refurbishing my old trusty Braun shave to new .It would be nice if they lasted longer ?</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;new\\&quot; 6000FC-BK &lt;br /&gt;now replaces both the 5000 and 6000 series - it seems to work fine but caused concern when I first received it.</li>
            <li> Have been using them in my electric razor and quickly noticed an improvement in the shave provided.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery from vendor, too.</li>
            <li> Luckily, I discovered this replacement pack.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and after changing the foil and blade.</li>
            <li> I was hoping that I&#x27;d get lucky and get their older version of this, which has more space between the blades (thinner blades).  </li>
            <li> Also, delivery was really quick.</li>
            <li> Overall, excellent replacement that extends the life of my 6520 for a few more years.</li>
            <li> This order came as promised with normal quality and I am completely satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my shaver and long lasting</li>
            <li> Although the replacement cutters fit properly on my older model 5824 shaver and cuts well, the noise level of the shaver while in use is significantly louder.  </li>
            <li> The block and foil perfectly fit my 6520 and as promised, I felt like I had a new razor again; smooth and not eating up my skin as the \\&quot;improved\\&quot; Panasonic did (I had bought this to replace my aging 6520)</li>
            <li> but I live outside the country so this worked great for me.</li>
            <li> This razor gives a great shave with little effort and no razor burn.</li>
            <li> All in all I would recommend this to any one seeking a great shave with little effort and burn.</li>
            <li> Great close shaves, relatively quiet and fine battery performance even now after daily use for 3 years.</li>
            <li> This fit my Flex Integral model very well</li>
            <li> These heads have always lasted a year or more, and I&#x27;ve had 4 or 5 so far (do the math</li>
            <li> It feels smoother when you run a finger over it, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s better than the old style.  </li>
            <li> Supplier provided the heads right on time.  </li>
            <li> , I think they were right...</li>
            <li> Your will notice the improvement right away.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and that is my story.</li>
            <li> The replacement installed easily and the razor performs like new.  </li>
            <li> I did a lot a reading and was not sure if this would be a good fit</li>
            <li> Its better to replace the blade than buy a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an older original - turns out</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t want the fabulous Braun design, buy a new razor...</li>
            <li> These blades &amp; screen fit perfectly, though they feel like they&#x27;re pulling or pinching skin occasionally, and I get some tiny cuts(s) over the rough part of my face</li>
            <li> Much nicer!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know better next time...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many electric razors over the years, and like my relatively inexpensive (no such thing in the electric razor world)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that Braun recommends replacing the foil &amp; cutter block every 18 months.  </li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> At first we had a confusion with the model, because we receive the 31S, but after rinsing, the replacement was exactly what dealt.</li>
            <li> First I must say that I can&#x27;t believe my Braun 5000 model rechargeable razor still charges after 15 years</li>
            <li> Bought my shaver back in &#x27;98, use it mostly for travel.</li>
            <li> This replacement screen and razor head replacement blade are of great quality and last a long time for shaving comfort.</li>
            <li> it is not the item shown it is a much cheaper version !</li>
            <li> It would be nice if any other users have.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to have a new, sharp one.  </li>
            <li> This 5885 is much faster, the foil seems to collect hairs much better and the charge lasts for several weeks.</li>
            <li> Replaced this on my 6520 that I have had a long time and it works great, better than the previous one that I had for years when finally the plastic part broke.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing another one when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> the new one has a different and smarter pattern on the foil and is better.</li>
            <li> But it works very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast delivery through Amazon.  </li>
            <li> much quicker and much closer shave</li>
            <li> I opted for the whole cutterblock</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be more careful after rinsing to brush away any standing water on this blade.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> i really like this.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will last years just like the original screen did.</li>
            <li> Fine craftsmanship, super sharp blades, fit precisely into shaver and last really long time (I kept my original cutter over 5 years, maybe a bit too long, but the fact was it was doing the job!).  </li>
            <li> Price was good but not exceptional.</li>
            <li> Hard to find item that keeps my favorite Braun electic razor working for several more years.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as advertised and allowed me to continue use of an old friend.</li>
            <li> After inserting the new blades, the razor works almost like brand new!!</li>
            <li> For 20 bucks I have a new shaver!</li>
            <li> Made the shaver like new again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely be replacing these much more regularly going forward.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m about to buy one more set before I expect to finally retire and replace my shaver next year.</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace an older Braun shaver that I had for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> This foil and head replacement works perfectly on my older - over 10 years - Braun Flex 6520 electric razor.  </li>
            <li> I was familiar with the previous version of this shave screen which had all the holes lined up in a nice little grid.  </li>
            <li> No complaint, it work as advertise and make your razor work like new again.</li>
            <li> this kit brought the quality right back.</li>
            <li> believe that right after a year it is necessary to change it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new screen and cutter blade made this shaver perform like a new unit.</li>
            <li> like a new razor.</li>
            <li> I wanted to continue using the shaver and lacked the $s to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> so I have to order online or buy a new razor, Amazon to the rescue.  </li>
            <li> This new shaver head and cutter when installed made all the difference to my shaving,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to reinvest in a new electric</li>
            <li> It feels like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> the new one was on.</li>
            <li> When I installed it, it was literally like a brand new razor.  </li>
            <li> Listen, if you need a new Foil/Cutterblock, you will know that already.</li>
            <li> I have the Braun 5600 series and I figured it was time for a new replacement foil.</li>
            <li> my shave now acts like it is new.  </li>
            <li> And if your battery is still holding a charge...Don&#x27;t go out and buy a new Braun just yet....</li>
            <li> Replaced the foil/cutterblock and it works like new.</li>
            <li> The razor is like new.</li>
            <li> This replacement screen and cutter make it feel like a new shaver all over again.</li>
            <li> the price of a new shaver, too.  </li>
            <li> old razor!  </li>
            <li> pretty well cleaned and use razor oil on the foil for extra life.</li>
            <li> Identical in form/fit/and function as the old one-what a difference!</li>
            <li> Razor that is about 8 years old shaves like a new razor when you put new foil and cutter block.</li>
            <li> My old Braun electric razor is like new again with this new foil and cutter set.</li>
            <li> i couldn&#x27;t be happier, smooth shave that costs much less than a new razor.</li>
            <li> Makes your old razor work like new.</li>
            <li> My old Braun shaver works just like new again....</li>
            <li> My razor is probably close to 25 years old and still works like new.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what was needed to bring my old Braun 6520 back to life!</li>
            <li> Next time, I buy a new shaver, which is perhaps what Braun wants.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference these make to the quality of the shave.  </li>
            <li> I ended up ordering some AA rechargeable batteries with tabs (from another site) and soldered that in completely rebuilding my razor.  </li>
            <li> So far this one has held up for a month.</li>
            <li> I had my old blade for over a year</li>
            <li> I figured I would need this to replace the old one and then replace the shaver when it quits on me...</li>
            <li> Works like new and is quiet as new.</li>
            <li> The shaver works fine, but I&#x27;ve had faster shavers in the past.</li>
            <li> (I  was not sure when I first read the description as some other similar items seemed to be a more explicit match).  </li>
            <li> and now I am back in business without purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li> I have dropped it several times and chunks have broken off, yet it still functions amazingly well.  </li>
            <li> The replaceable cutting head makes it very cost effective.  </li>
            <li> There is no other use.</li>
            <li> The replacement foil for electric razor was  hard to install but works fine once on.</li>
            <li> Really a major improvement.  </li>
            <li> It takes twice as long to shave with this vs. their older design.  </li>
            <li> If your Braun is dull and lost its smooth shave...</li>
            <li> I got the current model, which, for my beard anyway, does NOT cut nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m thinking of hiring fairies to keep my older one sharpened as long as it will last....</li>
            <li> the top fits a little snug but thats comparing it to one thats been popped on and off a few hundred or thousand times.  </li>
            <li> Feels like a new razor now, for a lot less than a new razor.  </li>
            <li> I like the idea of a subscription to this product, but the only time periods offered are far too short.</li>
            <li> Old blade was long in need of replacement sooo. . .</li>
            <li> The first one cracked and broke within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure this is the right foil for my shaver.  </li>
            <li> It slowly became less and less effective.  </li>
            <li> They do not last as long as advertised</li>
            <li> So long, that he can find replacement heads online only.  </li>
            <li> I can tell little difference in a new shaving head when I replace it even though I suspect all heads will eventually need replacing.</li>
            <li> Be aware that when you find these blades on Amazon there is a line just a little ways down the page that says \\&quot;There is a newer version of this item\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> To my old cutter block and foil after 4 days with this on my 6590... I had heard it did not fit properly on the 6590</li>
            <li> the old cap had a little give in it</li>
            <li> This part was so hard to find but thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> I had this razor for a long time but stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t find parts</li>
            <li> I should have bought this a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Wow - this has cut my shaving time in half!</li>
            <li> I got lousy shaves and the same amount of skin irritation as I was getting on my 2 year old cutter and foil, so I just put it up and put the old one back on--</li>
            <li> The Razor head is the wrong style, NOT like the original 5000/6000 Series.</li>
            <li> Went ahead and ordered a second to have on hand as this model gets harder and harder to come by.    </li>
            <li> I have a Braun shaver that is 2 years old, and the foil head had some small breaks.  </li>
            <li> Same thing but less.  </li>
            <li> during my Military Service.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> The mesh design of the holes are of irregular shape instead of the regular circles in the previous model, and also the edge around each hole that touches the face seems to have been made rounder so that one can get a closer shave with less friction, and the foil seems to be made of sturdier metal than before.    </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> I have to be out the door by 6:30 am to make it roughly 50 miles down the road by 7:30 am.</li>
            <li> Not an imitation.</li>
            <li> It is hard to hold for the time necessary to shave an area.</li>
            <li> This is at least the fourth shaver screen I have purchased for my Braun electric shaver.</li>
            <li> and he uses the shaver on a average of 4x per week.</li>
            <li> May even be a bit worse as far as shaving performance is concerned.</li>
            <li> I find the price for the product slightly below those in department stores for this product.</li>
            <li> shaver.[[ASIN:B000050FDV Braun 5000/6000FC- XP 31B Flex Integral Foil/Cutterblock Replacement Pack, Black]]</li>
            <li> The previous Foil/Cutterblock Replacement Pack broke after about 1 yr of use.  </li>
            <li> : How do I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is typical Braun and I use it to shave.</li>
            <li> I shave in half the time</li>
            <li> The replacement pack was the 31s (silver), not the 31B (black) colored item advertised.</li>
            <li> Note that if you are ordering the 31B (black) you will receive the 31S (silver) instead.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I order 31B for 5000/6000 flex foil  with black color sets for my shaver.</li>
            <li> I have had my Braun 5000 series shaver for so long (At least 15 years)</li>
            <li> so I was a little worried</li>
            <li> Just a few weeks ago, I purchased this replacement kit, and lo and behold....</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried it might not fit my Braun 5443, but it does.</li>
            <li> The foil did not fit.</li>
            <li> Try it out, give it a few weeks</li>
            <li> this will not fit braun 5 series .</li>
            <li> No more nicks when shaving with the 3 yr.</li>
            <li> I received this it and got all my small tools out.</li>
            <li> No more irritated underarms or bikini lines.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> I have even tried using different technics and approach as I shave ( thinking that I am applying undue or unequal pressure to cause the cutting head to shave the foul thin thinner and finally all the way through)</li>
            <li> price is not very convenient, it seems a little expensive to me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I may be pushing it too hard on the skin to get a closer shave.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The new screen and cutter blade made this shaver perform like a new unit. I am very  pleased with my purchase and recommend it to anyone needing replacement parts.</li>
            <li> Razor that is about 8 years old shaves like a new razor when you put new foil and cutter block. Braun makes great solid products!</li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference these make to the quality of the shave.  I should have bought these months ago.  I&#x27;ll definitely be replacing these much more regularly going forward.</li>
            <li> has slightly different foil perforation than the original foil but fits my 5775 model perfectly and works great</li>
            <li> I have had my Braun shaver for at least 10 years.  The manufacturer recommends replacing the cutter block every 18 months.  Hogwash!  It performed well up to the last month or two so I ordered this replacement from Amazon and am perfectly satisfied that I have another 5 years&#x27; life for this razor.</li>
            <li> This part was so hard to find but thanks to Amazon I found what the stores did not have. I had this razor for a long time but stopped using it because I couldn&#x27;t find parts and now I am back in business without purchasing a new razor.</li>
            <li> Although the product name and product features does not list it as so, this is the \\&quot;31B.\\&quot;  It says so when it&#x27;s in your shopping cart and up along the window for this product.  The 31B also works with Model: 5691, 5790, 5791, 5795, 5796 (per the service[...] website), and I can personally confirm it works in the 5790 (which we bought it for).    No more nicks when shaving with the 3 yr. old razor!  Much nicer!  Went ahead and ordered a second to have on hand as this model gets harder and harder to come by.    Braun has a \\&quot;service\\&quot; website where you can look up which part you need for your razor. [...]</li>
            <li> Looked everywhere locally for a replacement head to my Braun 5600 razor.  This was a perfect fit and makes my razor perform like it is brand new.  This is what you have been looking for.</li>
            <li> I found the best price through Amazon, nearly $9.00 including postage.  Same thing but less.  Can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this replacement blade and foil for my Braun 6550.  Fits perfectly and works great. Would recommend buying this product.</li>
            <li> Braun simply makes the best electric shaving products. I have used Braun since I was 14 and have always been impressed by the performance. This replacement cutter and foil are not exceptions. Fine craftsmanship, super sharp blades, fit precisely into shaver and last really long time (I kept my original cutter over 5 years, maybe a bit too long, but the fact was it was doing the job!).  So keep it up, Braun!</li>
            <li> I am not sure this is the right foil for my shaver.  I have the Braun 5614 model and I can never find parts for that model.  But it works very well.  The screen doesn&#x27;t pop off when you press the release button but it pulls off easily while you are pushing the release button.  It does well on all parts of the face except the neck.  I haven&#x27;t found anything that does a real good job on the neck hairs.</li>
            <li> These replacement heads for a Braun shaver are effective and worth the money.  Supplier provided the heads right on time.  Have been using them in my electric razor and quickly noticed an improvement in the shave provided.  Would defintely buy they again and from this seller.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver and a good value for the price.  Fast delivery through Amazon.  I recommend the shaver.</li>
            <li> The product is original manufacturer replacement part.  It fits well and works properly.  Installation was so simple no instructions were needed.  No problems.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an older original - turns out the new one has a different and smarter pattern on the foil and is better. definitely a recommendation, especially for this price! It upgraded my razor :P</li>
            <li> This razor gives a great shave with little effort and no razor burn. The shape of the razor leaves bit to be desired though. It is hard to hold for the time necessary to shave an area. The shape lends itself to hand cramps. Easy to clean, recharges quickly great blades, sharpness wise. All in all I would recommend this to any one seeking a great shave with little effort and burn.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews indicated that the item does not work with the 6520, but it worked with mine. Make sure you get the 6000 series, not the 4000 series. Seems obvious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Felt like a new razor.</li>
            <li> This foil/cutterblock appear to be factory produced and shave just like the original blades did. Be aware that when you find these blades on Amazon there is a line just a little ways down the page that says \\&quot;There is a newer version of this item\\&quot;. That supposed \\&quot;newer version\\&quot; is cheaper but it is not factory and does not shave as well. I know because I bought it.</li>
            <li> To my old cutter block and foil after 4 days with this on my 6590... I had heard it did not fit properly on the 6590, I think they were right... I got lousy shaves and the same amount of skin irritation as I was getting on my 2 year old cutter and foil, so I just put it up and put the old one back on--at least I get a close shave... I&#x27;ll know better next time...</li>
            <li> I enjoy using my Braun razor but had torn a hole in its original foil.  I wanted to continue using the shaver and lacked the $s to buy a new one.  Now all is well!</li>
            <li> This is at least the fourth shaver screen I have purchased for my Braun electric shaver. The screen serves the shaver well for facial hair (beard) removal. There is no \\&quot;pulling\\&quot; when using the product. I find the price for the product slightly below those in department stores for this product. Eventually though, the screen will deterriate and the shaving head will begin to bite your skin. I can tell little difference in a new shaving head when I replace it even though I suspect all heads will eventually need replacing.</li>
            <li> I replaced the foil and it restored the cutting performance of this shaver. I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Wal*Mart stopped carrying these so I have to order online or buy a new razor, Amazon to the rescue.  They do not last as long as advertised but it&#x27;s easier than shaving with a blade.</li>
            <li> Its better to replace the blade than buy a whole new razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many, many electric razors over the years, and like my relatively inexpensive (no such thing in the electric razor world) Braun.  These heads have always lasted a year or more, and I&#x27;ve had 4 or 5 so far (do the math and you&#x27;ll see the quality of the razor itself).  And I&#x27;m about to buy one more set before I expect to finally retire and replace my shaver next year.</li>
            <li> Makes your old razor work like new. I&#x27;ve had this shaver for well over ten years, I just replace the parts, and keep using it.</li>
            <li> This new shaver head and cutter when installed made all the difference to my shaving, much quicker and much closer shave also the shaver motor ran a lot better.</li>
            <li> I am not happy..The replacement one does not work good...It does not shave clean..you have to use it 2-3 times...where as original one took one time shave...I guess afer wasting my 29$...I&#x27;ll have to reinvest in a new electric shaver.[[ASIN:B000050FDV Braun 5000/6000FC- XP 31B Flex Integral Foil/Cutterblock Replacement Pack, Black]]</li>
            <li> I have an old razor and this part fit nicely. Great replacement. I have no problems with this product.</li>
            <li> I was familiar with the previous version of this shave screen which had all the holes lined up in a nice little grid.  They did something different with this one, with more of a random pattern.  It feels smoother when you run a finger over it, but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s better than the old style.  May even be a bit worse as far as shaving performance is concerned.</li>
            <li> The product works well.  It cuts close to the face and leaves a clean shave.  It feels like a new shaver.</li>
            <li> I received this it and got all my small tools out. Looked at the directions and pop twist it was off and pop twist the new one was on. No need for any tools. It took just a minute to change head.</li>
            <li> Item was simple to order, no tricks or scams&lt;br /&gt;sweet, to install, no issues as if it were made to do it&lt;br /&gt;has been working great , smooth no nicks easy to clean</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my trusty Braun 5416 for years, but the quality of the shave was getting worse and worse...this kit brought the quality right back.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what was needed to bring my old Braun 6520 back to life! I have had no problems so far, and am extremly happy with the replacement.</li>
            <li> Great part for my electric razor</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as advertised and allowed me to continue use of an old friend. Price was good but not exceptional.</li>
            <li> Product works well.  I opted for the whole cutterblock so I wouldn&#x27;t have to wrestle with the foil and risk breaking the mesh.  Old blade was long in need of replacement sooo. . . it&#x27;s good to have a new, sharp one.  Quick delivery from vendor, too.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t aware that Braun recommends replacing the foil &amp; cutter block every 18 months.  When the foil on my four-year-old shaver broke and started scratching my face, I was all set to replace the razor.  Luckily, I discovered this replacement pack.  When I installed it, it was literally like a brand new razor.  I&#x27;m very pleased.    The product arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  I&#x27;ll certainly be purchasing another one when this one wears out.</li>
            <li> I had replaced the Foil/Cutterblock several times using the Braun 6000 replacement for my Braun 6550. The \\&quot;new\\&quot; 6000FC-BK &lt;br /&gt;now replaces both the 5000 and 6000 series - it seems to work fine but caused concern when I first received it.</li>
            <li> finally a clean smooth shave.  the top fits a little snug but thats comparing it to one thats been popped on and off a few hundred or thousand times.  the old cap had a little give in it so i assume after this one is broken-in, it&#x27;ll be the same.  i couldn&#x27;t be happier, smooth shave that costs much less than a new razor.</li>
            <li> This fit my Flex Integral model very well (I  was not sure when I first read the description as some other similar items seemed to be a more explicit match).  Feels like a new razor now, for a lot less than a new razor.  Installing is easy.</li>
            <li> Replaced this on my 6520 that I have had a long time and it works great, better than the previous one that I had for years when finally the plastic part broke.    The mesh design of the holes are of irregular shape instead of the regular circles in the previous model, and also the edge around each hole that touches the face seems to have been made rounder so that one can get a closer shave with less friction, and the foil seems to be made of sturdier metal than before.    Overall, excellent replacement that extends the life of my 6520 for a few more years.</li>
            <li> Listen, if you need a new Foil/Cutterblock, you will know that already. If you don&#x27;t want to throw away your razor, buy this set! If you don&#x27;t want the fabulous Braun design, buy a new razor...</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and decided to go for it. The block and foil perfectly fit my 6520 and as promised, I felt like I had a new razor again; smooth and not eating up my skin as the \\&quot;improved\\&quot; Panasonic did (I had bought this to replace my aging 6520) I am delighted to have my Braun back!</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and find the Braun to be the best for the money.</li>
            <li> I was glad to find this on Amazon, as my shaver was in need of a refresh. I like the idea of a subscription to this product, but the only time periods offered are far too short.</li>
            <li> I have the Braun 5600 series and I figured it was time for a new replacement foil. Wow - this has cut my shaving time in half! I should have bought this a long time ago. Great price at amazon, too!</li>
            <li> I purchased this shaver to replace an older Braun shaver that I had for over 10 years. This 5885 is much faster, the foil seems to collect hairs much better and the charge lasts for several weeks. The only complaint is that the trimmer is awkward to use.</li>
            <li> The previous Foil/Cutterblock Replacement Pack broke after about 1 yr of use.  The shaver works fine, but I&#x27;ve had faster shavers in the past.</li>
            <li> I have a Braun shaver that is 2 years old, and the foil head had some small breaks.  It slowly became less and less effective.  Just a few weeks ago, I purchased this replacement kit, and lo and behold....my shave now acts like it is new.  One or two passes gives me a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade and foil head are very easy to replace - so do yourself a favor and buy this.</li>
            <li> I do not know about quality yet; but I hope it works well.The original I had, worked for 4 years(It was made in Germany).We have to see what will going on.</li>
            <li> We were very pleased with both the product and the expeditious way in which we received it.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I ordered this foil/cutter kit from Amazon and received the newer style Gillette foil which was recently released.  (So the photo is wrong but that is a good thing).  I ended up ordering some AA rechargeable batteries with tabs (from another site) and soldered that in completely rebuilding my razor.  I&#x27;ll get another 5 to 6 years out of my Braun for about $42.00 all in...</li>
            <li> This is number one in my book!</li>
            <li> This is my second order.  The first one cracked and broke within a few weeks.  So far this one has held up for a month. Hopefully it will last years just like the original screen did.</li>
            <li> If you have the shaver you know the quality already. I did research and Amazon had the best price when I purchased it especially with the free shipping. You might be able to find it cheaper in stores but I live outside the country so this worked great for me.</li>
            <li> My old Braun shaver works just like new again.... If your Braun is dull and lost its smooth shave... And if your battery is still holding a charge...Don&#x27;t go out and buy a new Braun just yet....buy this pack and you will be a happy camper for sure.</li>
            <li> The online description listed this blade as being for the 6000 series, but I had read elsewhere that it has good compatibility.  I  got it for my Braun 5164 and it fit right in.  It works great, no problems, and I&#x27;m getting a great shave again.  I had my old blade for over a year and it was starting to get a bit of rust on the edge.  I&#x27;m going to be more careful after rinsing to brush away any standing water on this blade.</li>
            <li> At first we had a confusion with the model, because we receive the 31S, but after rinsing, the replacement was exactly what dealt.</li>
            <li> The blade needs to be replaced about every 18 months with my beard. I keep mine pretty well cleaned and use razor oil on the foil for extra life. Well packaged. Does the job.</li>
            <li> They sent the 31S instead of the 31B pictured. They then demanded I pay the postage to sent it back.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this cutter, Thanks</li>
            <li> I was a bit worried it might not fit my Braun 5443, but it does.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace foil/cutterblock on my Braun Flex XP 5614.  Exactly what I needed for a good price.  Make sure to look up your model on the Braun service website to find the correct parts.</li>
            <li> The foil did not fit.</li>
            <li> The review guidelines are stupid. Example: How do I use the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is typical Braun and I use it to shave. There is no other use.</li>
            <li> Bought a Braun shaver 20 years ago used it for a while then put it away and forgot about it till I found it a month ago.  Replaced the foil/cutterblock and it works like new.</li>
            <li> My b/f has this shaver for several years, the foil/cutterblock only lasts about 6 months and he uses the shaver on a average of 4x per week. It costs us over $50 each year to order 2 sets of the foil/cutterblock replacement.  I am hoping the price of each sets will drop soon!</li>
            <li> The replacement foil for electric razor was  hard to install but works fine once on. Three different people fiddled with it - trying to get it on before suddenly, it just seemed to click on. Who knows. Very frustrating. But the shaver works great with the new foil.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my shaver and long lasting</li>
            <li> Very good service. Will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for to fit my razor.  Love it !&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend it to a friend anytime .....</li>
            <li> This was great!  Arrived quickly and after changing the foil and blade. Which took 29 seconds, it&#x27;s like having a brand.new razor!  I shave in half the time and it&#x27;s easier on my skin. Bravo!</li>
            <li> For many years I delt with razor burns and bumps.  Trying every razor there was.  &lt;BR&gt;Then I bought 7570 Braun.  Wow, it is great.  No more irritated underarms or bikini lines.&lt;BR&gt;Try it out, give it a few weeks and you&#x27;ll really notice a difference.</li>
            <li> Really a major improvement.  Your will notice the improvement right away.  I am sold on Braun after this shaver (and now the replacement pack).  Excellent product.  The razor is like new.</li>
            <li> Current (Mar 6, 2004) specs indicate this unit is compatible with the Braun 6520. It isn&#x27;t. The product shipped is only compatible with the 4005 thru 4520 models.</li>
            <li> A good product, like the original. No problems with delivery.</li>
            <li> Excellent replacement fit like original.</li>
            <li> First I must say that I can&#x27;t believe my Braun 5000 model rechargeable razor still charges after 15 years (yes, 15!). I have a light but full-face beard and I use my razor for daily maintenance only. When my foil started to show holes I replaced it with this kit that included the cutting blades as well. For 20 bucks I have a new shaver! Works like new and is quiet as new.</li>
            <li> Booooooo Braun.  I was hoping that I&#x27;d get lucky and get their older version of this, which has more space between the blades (thinner blades).  But nope.  I got the current model, which, for my beard anyway, does NOT cut nearly as well.  It takes twice as long to shave with this vs. their older design.  (I&#x27;m thinking of hiring fairies to keep my older one sharpened as long as it will last....but none are answering my ads.)</li>
            <li> Identical in form/fit/and function as the old one-what a difference!</li>
            <li> hubby had a braun 5770. I did a lot a reading and was not sure if this would be a good fit but it works great according to him.  The packaging was not the same as what is in the photo so I was a little worried but it works fine.</li>
            <li> It is one of my razor&#x27;s simple spares.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that right after a year it is necessary to change it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is not very convenient, it seems a little expensive to me.&lt;br /&gt;I like</li>
            <li> Bought my shaver back in &#x27;98, use it mostly for travel. The shaver battery still holds a good charge, so I pick this up every once in a while. These blades &amp; screen fit perfectly, though they feel like they&#x27;re pulling or pinching skin occasionally, and I get some tiny cuts(s) over the rough part of my face where but I may be pushing it too hard on the skin to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> my razor was getting dull now it works just fine. i really like this. no i get a really smooth shave.</li>
            <li> This is for my husband&#x27;s Braun razor that he has had for ages.  So long, that he can find replacement heads online only.  I have not seen any blood on his face since getting this item.  I DO know his skin is very smooth after he shaves.</li>
            <li> This order came as promised with normal quality and I am completely satisfied with the purchase. I would recomment it to others.</li>
            <li> Although the replacement cutters fit properly on my older model 5824 shaver and cuts well, the noise level of the shaver while in use is significantly louder.  There must be some slight compatibility issues between the cutter and the older model shavers, despite being listed as compatible.  For almost $30, I expect a better fit.  Next time, I buy a new shaver, which is perhaps what Braun wants.</li>
            <li> Not the item that is pictured, it is a cheap knockoff. The Razor head is the wrong style, NOT like the original 5000/6000 Series.</li>
            <li> This was NOT what I ordered. The replacement pack was the 31s (silver), not the 31B (black) colored item advertised.</li>
            <li> It was fine. Thank you</li>
            <li> This replacement screen and razor head replacement blade are of great quality and last a long time for shaving comfort.</li>
            <li> this will not fit braun 5 series . because the product you receive is for 3 series not this picture.</li>
            <li> Note that if you are ordering the 31B (black) you will receive the 31S (silver) instead.&lt;br /&gt;I could have bought the silver in stores for the same price and avoided waiting for it to arrive.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. Hard to find item that keeps my favorite Braun electic razor working for several more years. Yhank you.</li>
            <li> Everything works fine.  My razor is probably close to 25 years old and still works like new.  The new part fits perfectly onto my razor, no problems.  Nice smooth shave</li>
            <li> Have bought many of these over time and quality remains good. Lasts about 15-18 months. Only had one that the screen actually wore through. Otherwise, good replacement.</li>
            <li> This foil and head replacement works perfectly on my older - over 10 years - Braun Flex 6520 electric razor.  The replacement installed easily and the razor performs like new.  Also, delivery was really quick.</li>
            <li> I like the convenience of the elctric shaver because it saves time in the morning. I have to be out the door by 6:30 am to make it roughly 50 miles down the road by 7:30 am. So you can see that this is a \\&quot;close shave\\&quot; in more ways than one. The Braun 5315 is probably the best electric I&#x27;ve owned because it never discharges, no matter if I forget to charge it for an extra day. I only have one gripe. It&#x27;s very hard to get this foil, even online.</li>
            <li> GREAT razor.  It never pinches or pulls hairs out like both Norelco rotary razors that I had.  The replaceable cutting head makes it very cost effective.  I used the first set daily for 3 years before a small defect appeared.  Great close shaves, relatively quiet and fine battery performance even now after daily use for 3 years.</li>
            <li> This replacement screen and cutter make it feel like a new shaver all over again. I have had my Braun 5000 series shaver for so long (At least 15 years) I cannot believe it still works!  I have taken it everywhere with me, even to Afghanistan (!) during my Military Service.  I have dropped it several times and chunks have broken off, yet it still functions amazingly well.  I am glad they still make this item---because I&#x27;d have to have a &amp;#34;Retirement Ceremony&amp;#34; for my Braun Shaver, if they ever discontinue this screen / cutter model.</li>
            <li> What can you say, It&#x27;s Original Equipment Manucacturer replacement blade for the 5000/6000 series and works like it should.</li>
            <li> works better than i could hope, really is as close a shave as my mach 3.</li>
            <li> No complaint, it work as advertise and make your razor work like new again. Original product and fits as designed.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Would buy it again and give it as a gift.  The price was right and that is my story.</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly, and shaves like a dream.  Smooth results and comfortable.  1/4  the price of a new shaver, too.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I order 31B for 5000/6000 flex foil  with black color sets for my shaver. It makes supprise that I get 31S 5000/6000 flex foil with white color, it makes me nerve, it works or not. When I try it, it works. Although the color is difference, I like it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if it would fit the 5775, but it does &amp; now my shaver is happy again....&amp; so am I  !!!!</li>
            <li> These replacement blades sure did the job of replacing and refurbishing my old trusty Braun shave to new .It would be nice if they lasted longer ? The foil head gets cut every time after a lot of shaves ... In the same spot ? I have even tried using different technics and approach as I shave ( thinking that I am applying undue or unequal pressure to cause the cutting head to shave the foul thin thinner and finally all the way through) I continue to experiment to try and extend its life ! It would be nice if any other users have. The same issue ? Regards,</li>
            <li> it is not the item shown it is a much cheaper version !</li>
            <li> The product arrived on the date that I was given.  After inserting the new blades, the razor works almost like brand new!!</li>
            <li> My old Braun electric razor is like new again with this new foil and cutter set. I received and original Braun product. Not an imitation.</li>
            <li> Made the shaver like new again!</li>
            <li> I figured I would need this to replace the old one and then replace the shaver when it quits on me...but it still works fine!  I&#x27;m going to have to buy another foil/cutter head replacement.</li>
