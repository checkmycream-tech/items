            <li>I think this is a good place to start for safety razors.</li>
            <li>The carrying case is also good to have for storage or travel.</li>
            <li>And the residue would also stay on the blade, requiring a good cleaning after each shave.  </li>
            <li>The quality is good and it was inexpensive.</li>
            <li>This is a well made razor for a good price.</li>
            <li>razor:  came promptly and in good condition being well boxed up.  </li>
            <li>It seems well-made and gave a good shave.  </li>
            <li>arrived on time and were of good quality</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for shaving against the grain once you get the hang of it.</li>
            <li>Heft is good, seems sturdy.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>The price is good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;He says that it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s had, and that it feels comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slip from his hands</li>
            <li>Good quality, good balance, and looks good.  </li>
            <li>Excellent weight, nice smooth roller opening mechanism.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it and the case is a nice edition, even if it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>My husband says the original is the best for a nice close shave.  </li>
            <li>This style of razors are a very good fit for me and my brother likes the ones i gave him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a truly enjoyable shave with great results, this is the razor for you.</li>
            <li>Adjustables may cost a bit more but the feel is great.</li>

            <li>Perfect size for medium to large hands.  </li>
            <li>The price is nice</li>
            <li>I have one of my own</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not paying for those 5 blades because one blade does the job better for pennies, good razor saves me a lot of money</li>
            <li>Comes with a nice case for traveling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;To summarize: I liked this until I tried what many have said is the best; and when we&#x27;re talking 2-digit number prices; it&#x27;s worth spending $40 vs $13.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this razor, so impressed that I purchased 4 others to give as gifts (and one more for myself as a back up :)</li>
            <li>This handy thing have saved me hundreds of dollars on mach 3 razors.</li>
            <li>it in a bowl&amp;#34; cream of any kind)</li>
            <li>When my husband got this he really liked it ,it shaved</li>
            <li>Excellent razor -great value- save on shaving with this razor and a pkg.&lt;br /&gt;of double edge blades.</li>
            <li>Nice packing and carry case with mirror</li>
            <li>comes with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li>He said he liked the razor</li>
            <li>this comes with a handy traveling case BONUS</li>
            <li>The handle is some kind of chrome like plating over plastic.  </li>
            <li>Really liked this razor.</li>
            <li>Nice, works just like it should.</li>
            <li>The weight, though, is nothing spectacular</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the $30 safety razors are better, but this gets the job done remarkably well.</li>
            <li>great razor better than the plastic disposables that wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Once you perfect it, you will never waste your money on those over priced Quatro blades again!</li>
            <li>The Butterfly handle works fine; it was made well, and I always got a good shave from it.</li>
            <li>It has been working fine for me and seems like a good place to start if you want to try shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>I get a real good shave and so far not nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li>good razor smooth shave</li>
            <li>Great product that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased one of these safety razors and I have to say I am very impressed with how nice it looks</li>
            <li>Not the top of the line as far as quality and workmanship, but for the price, it is impressive.</li>
            <li>Great first safety razor.</li>
            <li>and I would say it is a great opportunity as a first razor</li>
            <li>Great Introductory Razor and would recommend to anyone interested in trying a doubled edged razor.</li>
            <li>Very cheap metal was used, although not made of plastic</li>
            <li>it is still very light.</li>
            <li>it is very smooth</li>
            <li>This is a very cheap razor.</li>
            <li>well the  dropped and broke a part very cheap made .</li>
            <li>It was very cheap</li>
            <li>The razor weighs 49 g, which is an adequate weight for a good shave.</li>
            <li>It performs as advertised; it is easy to use and nice to handle.  </li>
            <li>Much better shave than anything else he was using and very cheap alternative to disposable razors.  </li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>You have to get used to it since it&#x27;ll nick you more than the Quattro or Mach 3, but shave is easier on my face and bumps are improving.</li>
            <li>my husband loves his but would like a better grip like rubberized.</li>
            <li>I love DE Safety razors...</li>
            <li>six more words required o k.</li>
            <li>A wonderful purchase with a terrific price!</li>
            <li>buy a adjustable its better .....</li>
            <li>I also like it because it is cheaper and more stylish than disposable razors.</li>
            <li>This model is OK for someone that has been using a DE for a while.</li>
            <li>The design is much better than the 3 piece DE razors since they have a tendency of stripping the threads out of the head.</li>
            <li>Sure wish the handle was about two inches longer.</li>
            <li>I love the simplicity of the safety razor and not to mention the cost effectiveness of doing so.</li>
            <li>For the price you can&#x27;t expect it to be any better.</li>
            <li>you should notice a better shave.</li>
            <li>was expecting a better shave.</li>
            <li>The movable top popped off while i was shaving.</li>
            <li>them not doing the job i wanted, ilooked for and found your razor and am well pleased with everything about it.  </li>
            <li>I am using it and will do so until I locate a better razor.</li>
            <li>Love this thing always had a problem with bumps</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>and I am getting a better shave every time I use it as I am getting use to shaving without it.</li>
            <li>WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE SAID.</li>
            <li>Delivers a better shave than the disposable variety.  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>I was able to shave faster and as close as I ever have before.</li>
            <li>so I sold it, got cut too many times.  </li>
            <li>and it would be better.</li>
            <li>I had used the Gellett model many years ago.</li>
            <li>I discovered the Shaving Factory with used blades may be used without producing many applications of the styptic pencil.</li>
            <li>Glad I did too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok razor.</li>
            <li>Disposable Gillette  razor work better on my skin.</li>
            <li>I love it, Not too aggressive for us newbies...</li>
            <li>Are there better?</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor for the price.  </li>
            <li>and you will see yourself wanting something better.</li>
            <li>You are fairly safe until you start turning the thing on your face.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the others that have rated this razor, I was looking for an entry level safety razor.  </li>
            <li>It is an ok razor.</li>
            <li>I love this razor.  </li>
            <li>you will like it for sure.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this as a starter for sure.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying my return to DE shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li>Love shaving with this.</li>
            <li>I love mine and invite you to become a penney shave club member.</li>
            <li>I ordered another one today that was rated more to my liking.</li>
            <li>which i&#x27;ve never used before I thought for sure</li>
            <li>I love this razor.</li>
            <li>A steady hand and patience, can&#x27;t rush a great shave.</li>
            <li>I bought this as my first razor and it seemed quite good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how some razors go for a good amount of money, but it&#x27;s my first safety razor</li>
            <li>Which I would not have done if, my first experience had not been so good.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it better if it had more weight to it, but the price was right, so I  took that into consideration.</li>
            <li>The insertion of blades is easy as pie and very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>This is perfect for beginner wet shavers.</li>
            <li>Check out my review of this razor on amazon, or go to ShaveLikeGrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com for a more detailed review with photos.</li>
            <li>My primary shaving tool for many years being the Remington 3 head micro screen.</li>
            <li>This razor is good for those who wants to cut their faces  PERIOD.  </li>
            <li>Real shame as I liked it, have to say the case it came in was very cheap and trashy looking.</li>
            <li>He no longer get razor burn when he shaved and is willing to shave more often!</li>
            <li>so it must be true and for a bargain price you can&#x27;t beat it !</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, it dosent cut or pull.</li>
            <li>It was OK, but it never delivered the “clean”, stubble-free result that a blade would give me.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in using a safety razor for the first time, this is a great razor to start with.</li>
            <li>a great price point to decide if you want to invest more in a proper razor.</li>
            <li>so that I can easily throw it in my travel bag</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did, great shave low price!</li>
            <li>washes up easily and shoes no signs of corrosion in the two months I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Cleans easy.</li>
            <li>The clamping bit does a good job keeping things still and steady.</li>
            <li>but I went with the reviews that others gave, stating that this one holds its own compared to higher priced choices.</li>
            <li>Looks cool, but doesn&#x27;t work too well, esp of you&#x27;re used to more than 1 blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use for the first time safety razor user, and it gave a really clean shave!</li>
            <li>I think the handle length is adequate and the razor is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>If you need it for a shadowbox or a stage prop, fine.</li>
            <li>Used to it now, works fine.</li>
            <li>Cleans easy, comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li>The hinged doors on top of the blade bent and broke quickly.</li>
            <li>It is very attractive, fairly well made for the money, and comes in a very nice black plastic box that has a small shaving mirror built in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really gotten to be an enjoyable experience!</li>
            <li>Once you get the pressure right, it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>This razor is cheap, sturdy, light, regular size, cuts very well, opens/closes easily and best of all when you tighten it, you can change the angle of the cut!  </li>
            <li>, IT IS USER FRIENDLY, FIELD TESTED (LITERALLY), AND EASY TO USE.  </li>
            <li>Made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>The weight of it is heavy and feels perfect in my hand.</li>
            <li>The razor is a bit light, but well constructed.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using this.</li>
            <li>It was cheap, and that is why I bought it.  </li>
            <li>There isnt alot of weight with this razor, but again that is because it is cheap.  </li>
            <li>just a cheap razor added in to a kit</li>
            <li>more money but worth not the cut......</li>
            <li>I get a smooth shave every time I use it.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap piece of s</li>
            <li>After looking at it I could see how cheaply it was made.  </li>
            <li>The razor is well-built, and its well-balanced for shaving with light pressure.</li>
            <li>I received it a couple of weeks ago and have been using the razor daily with great results.  </li>
            <li>This razor is not as smooth as my Bic disposibles.  </li>
            <li>Use light strokes, and a brush and soap if you have that available.</li>
            <li>And you will get a close shave, and shouldn&#x27;t have any cuts or irritation, if you take your time and enjoy the shaving experience.</li>
            <li>This is important because the weight of the shaving head is supposed to do the work without the application of manual</li>
            <li>but this is a really smooth</li>
            <li>ARE A GREAT BUY, AND IT WILL LAST FOREVER</li>
            <li>I like how it opens and how it securely holds the blade.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Shaving Factory Double Edge Safety Razor is attractive and sturdy.</li>
            <li>The blades are so cheap that I can afford to trade them out every couple weeks rather than trying to push them well over a month</li>
            <li>I went for cheap when I ordered this razor and that&#x27;s what I got.  </li>
            <li>It is solidly build and gives me a great shave.</li>
            <li>worth spending more on something that works</li>
            <li>Cheap and crappy.</li>
            <li>Cheap Cheap quality control.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t experienced a nick since my third shave four months ago.</li>
            <li>stray hairs smoothly without bumps or cuts.  </li>
            <li>Blades for these are cheap and available at just about every drug store, and grocery store around.</li>
            <li>Not as good as old Gillette Razors.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;d say that getting the pack of 100 blades is the best part of the whole thing.</li>
            <li>I see products that should last and be around for many years because someone decided to take the time and make something that makes others feel good.</li>
            <li>This my first safety razor, and was pretty happy with it at first.</li>
            <li>Very little catching and pulling, but with the grain isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>Much better bargain and a better shave than all the new razors available on the market, so he tells me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try to return it, I&#x27;m keeping it as a reminder not to go for the fast, cheap, and easy route if I want anything worthwhile.</li>
            <li>Nice looking razor, the little doors open up on top to put the blade in perfect.</li>
            <li>I am enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li>I was sceptical at first, but after it&#x27;s first use, I find it avery good razor at a very affordable price !!</li>
            <li>Well built and worth every Cent!  </li>
            <li>This is the first safety razor I ever bought and I am extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Even though the head looks like its made of metal, i&#x27;m pretty sure its some composite plastic with a shiny finish.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s economical too!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well made and a large size to better fit your hand.</li>
            <li>It also has a good solid feel to it, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li>I have been using it 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t had to clean the residue from the razor one time.  </li>
            <li>and now he is clean shaven again.  </li>
            <li>The best shave IS with an old fashioned double edge razor, however, I suggest getting a good one that will last for years.</li>
            <li>For the same price you can pick up a great Gillette vintage razor on that auction site, or spend another ten bucks and get a Merkur, If you&#x27;re thinking of getting this, or gifting it, do some more research!</li>
            <li>However, the handle has subtle fluting with a smooth finish, which makes it a bit slippery at times; this is not the best design decision by the makers.    </li>
            <li>Good quality for low price.</li>
            <li>It has enough heft that you can get a good shave without added pressure.  </li>
            <li>I prefer this style of razor over all the more modern disposable blades.</li>
            <li>As some others have stated if you tighten the blade holder too much one of the &amp;#34;flaps&amp;#34; will come off, but it is easily able to be reinstalled.</li>
            <li>I wish it weren&#x27;t true, but it is.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only good for side burns</li>
            <li>I know most people recommend Merkur razors, but this thing shaves about as close as a straight razor.</li>
            <li>This is what I was looking for I am delighted with it, I should  not have changed to the twin blade and thrown out my double edge rasor.</li>
            <li>It will never be a Merkur or an Edwin Jagger razor, but then, if you are satisfied with a razor at this much lower price, it will serve you well.</li>
            <li>It gave me close shaves and the kind of control I had with the old safety razor.</li>
            <li>I yearned for the “barber shop” soap cup lather and straight razor luxury that my Dad and Grand Dad used to speak of so fondlyf.</li>
            <li>Amazon for sending them so quickly.. finally got a chance to use it last night looks great nice and close shave.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It shaves well enough and is undoubtedly a good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>;  While I feel that is being a mite generous, it certainly is good enough.  </li>
            <li>It has a very aggressive angle and virtually slices off your whiskers and top layer of skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems like it&#x27;s a good price, and he loves the thing, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>For a lady this makes life pretty easy.</li>
            <li>The razor is nicely balanced and has enough weight to make the shave comfortable (unlike some of the disposable razors I have used).</li>
            <li>gave the electric shaver a fair trial for more than a few years.</li>
            <li>Found many online and tis is reasonably low priced and works way better than cartridges.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I got this and would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>High quality at a very reasonable cost very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Cut my face first time, just too light.</li>
            <li>It may have been a holdover on his part from the original blue blades, the kind that rusted.  </li>
            <li>not bad at all, worth the money.</li>
            <li>All I have to do with this one is to open it up a bit, run it under water, nice and clean.</li>
            <li>so far it&#x27;s worked well, seems to have a good weight and decent balance</li>
            <li>My husband likes the &amp;#34;Old type razor&amp;#34; better than these new ones.  </li>
            <li>I barely notice any difference--except I&#x27;m saving money, efficiently cleaning my razor, being a bit more ecologically prudent, and no longer feeling exploited by Gillette (and its conglomerate owner Proctor &amp; Gamble).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Very functional and easy to use for the price.  </li>
            <li>Put that first 100-200 bucks back in your pocket, spend this $15 bucks with $10!worth of razor blades and you are good for a year.</li>
            <li>Works great, as long as you don&#x27;t use too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>forces me to press down more than I have liked.  </li>
            <li>One of the butterfly sides broke with the FIRST usage!</li>
            <li>a little bit longer shave this way, but the results are still great.</li>
            <li>Great little razor for the price.  </li>
            <li>Great little razor.  </li>
            <li>Great everyday razor.</li>
            <li>It’s as close as you can get to a straight razor and, consequently, needs some respect one may not give to the disposable units available.</li>
            <li>great razor ...use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>Once you get used to it complete your retro shave with the old fashioned soap and mug and good quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I closed them up gently and started shaving, so far so good felt nice then</li>
            <li>Far better shave with this than with disposables or electrics.  </li>
            <li>IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN, better to consider the Merkur models 15C or 33C or the Lord L6 head, which is their model LP1822L.</li>
            <li>Good for the beginner to wet shaving.</li>
            <li>We had to order the acutual razor, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li>worth the effort&lt;</li>
            <li>My 72 year-old cheeks are thinner and more sensitive than my 20 year-old cheeks were.</li>
            <li>I also have a Parker 96R and 99R which are much more aggressive; you have to be more careful with them.  </li>
            <li>It has nice balance, but I often use the hand towell to open and close.</li>
            <li>upgraded to better razor no trouble.</li>
            <li>but I learned how to use a safety razor and rarely cut myself.  </li>
            <li>I think I have a handle for everything except for an old timey injector razor--the kind that you could really slice yourself with if one of the corners wasn&#x27;t seated correctly.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the way you twist the top open.</li>
            <li>The surprising part is that it comes in a wonderful hard plastic travel case with a small mirror inside.</li>
            <li>but hey for that price it&#x27;s all right .</li>
            <li>It went right into the garbage.</li>
            <li>He says that he gets a closer shave and it is much easier to clean the blade for continued shaving.  </li>
            <li>I have very large hands and the razor fits just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Has a nice heavy feel and is easy to grip in my hand.</li>
            <li>I have been using this razor for the past 5 months and can say that this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>I feel it is very eco friendly and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>And you might as well go ahead and get yourself a shaving brush, a mug and some shaving soap (or cream, as long as it&#x27;s not the aerosol kind).</li>
            <li>The case is OK if this is what your buying it for but you can get an all leather case for a few bucks more if you already have a razor.</li>
            <li>Brought back the good old days..</li>
            <li>so I may as well get a good close shave for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li>Very good razor, very solid and durable, gives a very close smooth shave, very aggressive, so if your a newbie to wet shaving do not buy this and cry and whine!</li>
            <li>The razor works fine so far</li>
            <li>Like most guys, I started razor shaving with the free Gillette razor that they send to you when you turn 18 and have tried just about all the other razor combinations, 2, 3, 5 blades, and even vibrating handles.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be sure the blade is aligned evenly when you tighten it down, but that&#x27;s pretty easily done with a tap of the face of the razor on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you already use a safety razor and are looking to replace, spend the extra cash for better quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll spend the $$ to get a higher quality razor when this one breaks.</li>
            <li>however the guide broke on the first day...</li>
            <li>I am really amazed at how nice it looks and the craftsmanship appears to be very well made, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty well built and seems reliable.</li>
            <li>Works different and better than todays razors.</li>
            <li>so had to send e-mails to them pointing it out and now have my money so be aware.</li>
            <li>I made this mistake the first time, even knowing not to push and bled because I probably took skin with it.  </li>
            <li>First thing for buyers: It&#x27;s made in China.</li>
            <li>After some effort I was able to get it back in place.</li>
            <li>When I placed the order I thought about paying $20 more for the German Merkur razor handle but opted for this $13 one.</li>
            <li>If you are looking into DE shaving, this razor does exactly what you need without killing your wallet.</li>
            <li>I thought it was okay, but it was only the first safety razor I had ever used.</li>
            <li>I first started shaving years ago with a safety razor and that&#x27;s all I used until the cartridge razors came into being.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever had during the first shave.  </li>
            <li>The safety razor is what I first used on my adolescent “peach fuzz” beard 60 years ago.</li>
            <li>As a seasoned citizen I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My shaves are now nostalgic events that evoke the wonderful bloom of my youth.</li>
            <li>Thus should not be your first shaving experience.</li>
            <li>He did purchase separate blades that were of higher quality.</li>
            <li>This was the first time for him to use a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>It i s exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>I am getting more shaves now per blade than my last razor gave me!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know how to use the first one</li>
            <li>anyone else remember when the first two-bladed razor appeared (Gillette Trac 2, 1971)?</li>
            <li>, i ended up stepping up for a higher dollar one, mugs, soaps, and foams....</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s the first time  you&#x27;ve used a Double Edge (or as in my case Many years since I&#x27;ve used one)</li>
            <li>Did some research before purchasing my first DE safety razor and after making my head spin with all the information chose this one.  </li>
            <li>The razor is flimsy and malfunctioned with my first shave.  </li>
            <li>I use it with the Derby blades and it gives me a smooth old school shave.</li>
            <li>I believe differences in the shaving routine help to make a closer shave, even using different razors, and types of razor shaving as many as 5 times, and finishing up with an electric razor.</li>
            <li>When I first started using it</li>
            <li>You do have to take more time and care than a disposable razor but its not that big of a difference.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to start safety razor shaving or looking for a good razor please spend a little more money and buy something a little more high quality.</li>
            <li>I am new to shaving with this kind of razor, and have only tried one brand of blade.  </li>
            <li>With the right razor blade this razor performs very well and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li>I may not be doing it exactly right, but I don&#x27;t care because I save so much money on blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You can cut yourself easily if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>bring back the old high quality constucion with good razor blades the shaver cant be beat .</li>
            <li>Opted for the BIC blades and so far not disappointed.</li>
            <li>The top part that spreads to open for the blade has come off twice, but it was easy to put back together.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking that I would save a few bucks instead of getting a reputable razor, but not be so cheap as to buy the three dollar ones floating around here.</li>
            <li>I have a German safety razor that cost much more than twice as much</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning it is an absolute breeze - open the top and rinse off the blade and the razor.</li>
            <li>It will clog up on you if you are shaving a few days worth of growth, but hit your face with a buzzer first like an intelligent human being and you won&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li>I saw ad and feel positive, but it is not as my expectation.</li>
            <li>I was really concerned at first</li>
            <li>The blade position is moderate, seeming to be a more aggressive than a Merkur Classic or Lord L6.    </li>
            <li>I personally use a shavette, and he wants to start easy</li>
            <li>Comfort wise, the single blade is the same as the five blade with no additional razor burn.</li>
            <li>Yes it was 3x the price, but it is heavier, made of smoother metal (which I didn&#x27;t think possible, the Shaving Factory one seemed fine)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Derby Extra blades and they&#x27;ve been treating my face just fine.</li>
            <li>Nice Little Razor</li>
            <li>The case isn&#x27;t spectacular, but the little mirror is helpful sometimes.</li>
            <li>This particular razor is clearly cheaply made--but what can you expect for a 12-dollar version of an item that generally costs $30-50 for an entry-level model.  </li>
            <li>Why buy expensive multi-blade razors when a double edge single blade is very effective and works great.</li>
            <li>The type of blade will obviously make a huge difference in how well it works.  </li>
            <li>I use it when I don&#x27;t have time to do the straight shave.</li>
            <li>But, it shaves, it&#x27;s very inexpensive, it does</li>
            <li>thanks to ebay</li>
            <li>It looks like stainless steel</li>
            <li>Very sturdy, well built.</li>
            <li>Thanks for offering this product.  </li>
            <li>Very affordable and well built razor.</li>
            <li>You really just have to let it glide.</li>
            <li>I had purchased the razor as a cheap easier solution than the big name brand one.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have to shave often</li>
            <li>It works very well and seems to be constructed very well.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy a real Gillette on Ebay</li>
            <li>DE-blade edges are supposed to be dead straight, and any warp to the edge is a formula for a harsh shave at best.</li>
            <li>Then treat the mechanism gently.</li>
            <li>Looks very cheep .</li>
            <li>very flimsy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to use this razor, and I like my friends too much to give it to any of them.</li>
            <li>The blades are soo much cheaper then the razors offer.  </li>
            <li>Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>thank you so much</li>
            <li>Be advised, that this razor is very aggressive.</li>
            <li>I like the box it comes in and has a mirror if you want to go camping or something (who really shaves when their camping though?).</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t blame the razor, though.  </li>
            <li>Much technology and metallurgy has been directed at the shaving market since.</li>
            <li>After getting used to the razor he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>but like this every bit as much.</li>
            <li>A very functional razor.</li>
            <li>I still like it just as much now as I did when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>But, it does really shave well and close.</li>
            <li>I get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li>The blade angle is very aggressive .</li>
            <li>One of the great joys of childhood in the early fifties was to find old rusted blue blades in the trash and then slicing your hands open when you insisted on playing with the damn things.</li>
            <li>I wanted to determine whether switching to the safety razor was feasible, without investing much money up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, if you decide you don&#x27;t like it, you are only out a few bucks, but I am sure you will be glad you got it.</li>
            <li>Quality actually better than expected.  </li>
            <li>My husband really likes blades like this</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really say much else about it.  </li>
            <li>I find the shave to be very close</li>
            <li>Works very well, had to learn to let it glide over my face with almost no pressure</li>
            <li>i preferred a straight razor.</li>
            <li>If you decide to order this razor, or the others that I purchased your shipping time is much shorter than what the order says.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t find it a noticeable improvement from the cheap-o Chinese model I bought before (also available on Amazon).</li>
            <li>razor also has a nice solid feel to it, it&#x27;s gonna last me a while</li>
            <li>The opening doors of this razor are pretty tight, although you&amp;#34;ll probably end up tightening the handle before each shave to make sure you don&#x27;t knick yourself with a slip.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the included case is okay.</li>
            <li>BUT.....then it gets TOO loose very quickly</li>
            <li>Gillette, Schick, Wilkinson and others have spent billions on R&amp;D, “clinical” trials and advertising in an effort to win both male and female blade-shaver customers.</li>
            <li>It has a nice weight to it and comes with a carrying case that has a small mirror.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll have to see if the higher end really offers a shaving advantage.</li>
            <li>dad&#x27;s old Gillette double edge worked fine after I got the feel of the thing</li>
            <li>New life for used blades!</li>
            <li>I was able to correct this problem by using jewelry pliers to slightly re-shape the defective door, which corrected the problem but damaged the chrome a bit.</li>
            <li>Decent price for entry into using a tradtional razor.</li>
            <li>My father does not like &amp;#34;new technology&amp;#34; so he was used to the older type razors.</li>
            <li>paired this with some Derby blades; the only thing to watch out for is the pressure and angle your shaving with; you want to have the metal grooves sliding over first; then the blade, if you hit blade first you will get knicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>Take a step back in time and get a get shave the old way at a very economical price.</li>
            <li>I own another handle that with the same fresh blades slices me usually</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Recommend it highly.....</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend this razor</li>
            <li>I dropped the razor in the shower (not even a high drop), and the head broke in two.</li>
            <li>Finish is high polish SS and chrome.  </li>
            <li>The thing cut me and again, looked at the unit and one end of the little doors on top had popped out, I opened the doors and it pinged (yes pinged) off.</li>
            <li>I am begging you, spend a little more up front.</li>
            <li>little razor gives me a better shave than any of the fancy&lt;br</li>
            <li>my husband still prefers disposable, but my 17 year old son really really likes it a lot.  </li>
            <li>and I just bought an old Gillette brand razor that is very well made.  </li>
            <li>Near drops and the imprecision of a slippery razor twisting in my fingers takes away too much of the pleasure of my morning shave ritual.</li>
            <li>In the early 1960s Gillette came out with the stainless steel blade and virtually doubled the quality and durability of the safety razor experience.</li>
            <li>That gets old fast.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a quality razor at an economical price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought the badger bristle brush and Taylor-of-old-Bond-Street soap disk from Amazon and have thoroughly enjoyed the transition from aerosol mediocrity.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more dollars and buy an Edwin James or a Merkur - get quality.  </li>
            <li>have used a few times and love it.  </li>
            <li>You cannot shave with one of these like you would with a normal cartridge safety razor (like a Fusion, Trac II, etc).  </li>
            <li>I found going to a razor type that was invented over 80 years ago was worth the investment...very low cost at that.  </li>
            <li>I considered more expensive razors, but wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like shaving the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li>Saturday Night Live made fun of their commercial by imagining a three-bladed razor.</li>
            <li>These blue blades were sharp as the devil but only good for a shave or two</li>
            <li>On reflection, one can probably safely assume that most of the second, third, and fourth world countries of the earth probably either still use double edge, cut throat razors, or just let their beards grown to disguise themselves from American drone</li>
            <li>As a TTO alternative, consider the Weishi 9306-f, which is a little less expensive, is chrome over brass, can give a good shave although it is very mild/non-aggressive, and has a great texture on the handle.</li>
            <li>I do think this razor will become a travel razor once I get a new one.</li>
            <li>Even with a brand new blade it does not work as it is supposed to work.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li>I am getting back into wet shaving after using an electric razor for many years.</li>
            <li>This one actually works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Paired with Derby Extra blades and Shave Secret it provides a great shave for both my son and me.</li>
            <li>Having bigger hands makes it a bit more to harder to control.</li>
            <li>For the last five years I settled in comfortably with a  Wahl Electric 4500 shaver with extra close screen.</li>
            <li>The only drawbacks to the Good News blade were the “clog” factor (need to flush repeatedly) and the inability to get a tight (under the nostrils) shave… without “digging” and perhaps nicking my upper lip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It closes tight and holds the blade straight, doesn&#x27;t clog up and rinses clean with ease.</li>
            <li>works much better than any disposable no more nicks on the face, I would recommend this to everyone I know</li>
            <li>No more Cheap Plastic Razors!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it again, but may go with a higher quality/heavier build next time.</li>
            <li>By middle of the first shave I required application of the styptic pencil.</li>
            <li>I received this razor and used it for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li>Haha, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll even bother \\&quot;upgrading\\&quot; to a more expensive razor since this one is doing such a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It could be a little longer for my big hands but other than it is doing a great job.</li>
            <li>I usually follow up with a shave balm made by mixing a spot of body lotion with Old Spice aftershave, and enjoy the baby butt smooth face all day long.</li>
            <li>opens up fine to insert blade and also closes tight so blade doesn&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li>But this new item is fixed and thus, not what I had desired.</li>
            <li>After shaving, dad used to open the butterfly and let some hot water from the tap run over the exposed blade though I don&#x27;t know if this is really helpful or standard procedure.  </li>
            <li>Not after feeling how smooth a single double edge razor cuts.  </li>
            <li>Its all metal just seems a little light.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t had any trouble opening and closing it so far and the case is not at all fancy, but it works fine.</li>
            <li>I purchased what i thought was a  low end orice razor to try it out, and so far i have not lost too much skin.  </li>
            <li>Completely usless.  </li>
            <li>Old time shaver</li>
            <li>an old time guy.</li>
            <li>I just received this razor and have to say I was extremely surprised.</li>
            <li>Old fashion razor that I like.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for a friend who wants to get into proper shaving.</li>
            <li>But the overall razor is very sturdy.</li>
            <li>Too early to tell if there are any long-term consequences.    </li>
            <li>After my operation they cut the nerves on both sides of my face and now my face is so sensitive</li>
            <li>After buying an old gillette for six bucks, I compared the two for a month.</li>
            <li>For the beginner, I would recommend shopping around for an old razor online or at an antique shop.</li>
            <li>Straight abd to the point with basic info on fish holding lakes, helped plan the backpacling route but have not taken the trip yet.</li>
            <li>As with any double-edge safety razor, the cost is MUCH lower for replacement blades than a standard cartridge</li>
            <li>Concurrently the Remingtons, Norelcos and others have developed and touted the electric alternatives to beard and “stubble” control.</li>
            <li>AGGRESSIVE is an understatement when describing the safety razor’s action on your beard.</li>
            <li>The body  of the handle is coming of very easily, so do not waste your money in this razor.</li>
            <li>As far as recommending the razor to someone else, that would have to be up to the one I gave it to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood and a Tweezerman badger brush and am amazed at the quality of shaves.  </li>
            <li>I just got into the traditional wet-shaving scene since I was really quite fed up with the disposable cartridges.</li>
            <li>I somehow inherited a whole bunch of razors and various packs of blades and cartridges.  </li>
            <li>I even bought a barber straight razor though, with my current eyesight</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think I plan to get that thing anywhere near my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the old days.</li>
            <li>Not too light  and not too heavy for my hand.  </li>
            <li>Chrome plated pot metal as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I get a smooth shave, and with shaving only three or four times a week they will  probably last me ten years.</li>
            <li>That old one is going in the trash</li>
            <li>just like I has when I was young.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Didnt work on my soft beard.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It appears to be durable, and the appearance and quality of the metal seem to be right in line with the more expensive safety razors.  </li>
            <li>fairly good razor handle narrow though hard to hold with large hands easy to us though its hard to control .</li>
            <li>Hefty razor, handle could be a little long but nice to get back to the old fashion way of shaving using brush and soap dish.  </li>
            <li>Shaving takes about half again as long now because I have to be a lot more careful with the single blade - it is quite easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li>The shaver is satisfactory but the more expensive shavers may be of higher quality.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be the exact same razor as the Mingshi razor that I bought last week.</li>
            <li>I have been shaving for sixty years and Years back when my hand was steady</li>
            <li>Solid razor, arrived quickly, and the case will (crucially) keep me from thoughtlessly slicing my finger open and pouring blood into my bags while camping.</li>
            <li>Cool little gift.</li>
            <li>See my other review to see if a Parker could be the right razor for you.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor especially if you&#x27;re looking for something to travel with.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend springing for the chromed Merkur design instead, it only costs $40</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another caution:  with the butterfly opening type of razor, which this is, make sure the razor is completely closed by giving the bottom of the handle a slight tighten.  </li>
            <li>While it is a less-expensive alternative when experimenting with wet shaving, the aggressiveness of the razor (and resulting rash) could scare off a less adventurous person.  </li>
            <li>While it is a less-expensive alternative when experimenting with wet shaving, the aggressiveness of the razor (and resulting rash) could scare off a less adventurous person.  </li>
            <li>Decent quality - had a minor problem with the clamp closing correctly that I fixed with a pair of pliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My husband loves his new razor, &amp;#34;fantastic&amp;#34; is how he describes it, he won&#x27;t go back to plastic shaving razors ever again.</li>
            <li>Because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a new type of razor without trying it first--and because I didn&#x27;t want to wait--I purchased this razor locally about a week ago, and have shaved with it twice.  </li>
            <li>I do not know why we ever switched to these new ones with multiple blades.</li>
            <li>With a twist of the handle a new blade is placed in this razor and I go back 50 years... except for the wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I even learned a new trick I never figured out in my youth when I last shaved with one of this type: the edge seems to blunt in one direction.</li>
            <li>The chrome plating seems high quality with no apparent defects.</li>
            <li>Funny how a man finally calms down as he grows older.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had both the twist open type here and the very old unscrew the handle and disassemble the razor type.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not extremely sturdy</li>
            <li>Another reason I like it might not be exactly why other people like it.  </li>
            <li>The top was a tad crooked when closed completely, but that took little to no effort fixing.</li>
            <li>I was a little leary at first because of the cuts one can get using this type of razor!</li>
            <li>Also, a tip about inexpensive TTO razors: you may get more durability if you oil the TTO mechanism periodically (let mineral oil drops run down the center post of the open razor head -- I do this to all my TTO razors, even the vintage Gillette).</li>
            <li>The twist to open mechanism works solidly, the finish is decent, and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>The blade doesn&#x27;t even extend out far enough to touch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>The safety razor could trigger a 911 call if I was not really careful.</li>
            <li>First wet razor, travel razor,, 2nd razor</li>
            <li>Then I am going to get a nice expensive one to use that</li>
            <li>Being new to the use of double edge razors the product had a low entry price for starters, which is what enticed me to pick it up.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, spring the extra cash for a new $30-40 razor that will last for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some have speculated stainless steel underneath, but I doubt that because one wouldn&#x27;t chrome over stainless, plus it&#x27;s a more difficult metal to stamp or cast than more common razor materials including common steel, brass, and aluminum.    </li>
            <li>I still want to punch a wall in exasperation at how much I paid for other razors.  </li>
            <li>I wanted something cheap to try this whole SR thing out vs extremely expensive cartridge shaving.  </li>
            <li>I had another brand of comparable price (actually more expensive) that did not perform nearly as well.</li>
            <li>Basically I spent the extra money on this version for the case and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I came to own this razor because it was erroneously sent to me by a seller who kept insisting it was the same as the Weishi 9306-f that I ordered.</li>
            <li>/&gt;When looking for single edge blades for my new microtome (see my microtome review)</li>
            <li>I only gave it four stars in comparison with my dad&#x27;s old Gillette which was, when he bought it, a more expensive</li>
            <li>At least I get a full refund for sending it back, no option for replacement.</li>
            <li>I have big hands and long fingers, so I wish it was a little more heavy</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly to anyone who has had&lt;br /&gt;problems using a conventional disposable razor.  </li>
            <li>Not ready to toss it yet, I&#x27;ll try other blades first.</li>
            <li>You definitely have to practice shaving with this thing very carefully if you&#x27;re coming from normal disposable razors.</li>
            <li>The doors open adequately for easy blade changing (one other TTO razor model, by contrast, doesn&#x27;t open quite enough, making blade changing a bit awkward).    </li>
            <li>The carrying case is light plastic but appears tough enough for travel.</li>

            <li> Was looking for an affordable safety razor and this product fit the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, it is a good razor.</li>
            <li> For about 20 years I was a Gillette “Good News” disposable shaver user.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good place to start for safety razors.</li>
            <li> The carrying case is also good to have for storage or travel.</li>
            <li> And the residue would also stay on the blade, requiring a good cleaning after each shave.  </li>
            <li> The quality is good and it was inexpensive.</li>

            <li> Comes with a nice case for traveling.</li>
            <li> /&gt;To summarize: I liked this until I tried what many have said is the best; and when we&#x27;re talking 2-digit number prices; it&#x27;s worth spending $40 vs $13.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this razor, so impressed that I purchased 4 others to give as gifts (and one more for myself as a back up :)</li>
            <li> This handy thing have saved me hundreds of dollars on mach 3 razors.</li>
            <li> it in a bowl&amp;#34; cream of any kind)</li>

            <li> this comes with a handy traveling case BONUS</li>
            <li> The handle is some kind of chrome like plating over plastic.  </li>
            <li> Really liked this razor.</li>
            <li> Nice, works just like it should.</li>
            <li> The weight, though, is nothing spectacular</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the $30 safety razors are better, but this gets the job done remarkably well.</li>
            <li> great razor better than the plastic disposables that wear out very quickly.</li>
            <li> Once you perfect it, you will never waste your money on those over priced Quatro blades again!</li>
            <li> The Butterfly handle works fine; it was made well, and I always got a good shave from it.</li>
            <li> It has been working fine for me and seems like a good place to start if you want to try shaving with a safety razor.</li>
            <li> I get a real good shave and so far not nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> good razor smooth shave</li>
            <li> Great product that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased one of these safety razors and I have to say I am very impressed with how nice it looks</li>
            <li> Not the top of the line as far as quality and workmanship, but for the price, it is impressive.</li>
            <li> Great first safety razor.</li>
            <li> and I would say it is a great opportunity as a first razor</li>
            <li> Great Introductory Razor and would recommend to anyone interested in trying a doubled edged razor.</li>
            <li> Very cheap metal was used, although not made of plastic</li>
            <li> it is still very light.</li>
            <li> it is very smooth</li>
            <li> This is a very cheap razor.</li>
            <li> well the  dropped and broke a part very cheap made .</li>
            <li> It was very cheap</li>
            <li> The razor weighs 49 g, which is an adequate weight for a good shave.</li>
            <li> It performs as advertised; it is easy to use and nice to handle.  </li>
            <li> Much better shave than anything else he was using and very cheap alternative to disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> You have to get used to it since it&#x27;ll nick you more than the Quattro or Mach 3, but shave is easier on my face and bumps are improving.</li>
            <li> my husband loves his but would like a better grip like rubberized.</li>
            <li> I love DE Safety razors...</li>
            <li> six more words required o k.</li>
            <li> A wonderful purchase with a terrific price!</li>
            <li> buy a adjustable its better .....</li>
            <li> I also like it because it is cheaper and more stylish than disposable razors.</li>
            <li> This model is OK for someone that has been using a DE for a while.</li>
            <li> The design is much better than the 3 piece DE razors since they have a tendency of stripping the threads out of the head.</li>
            <li> Sure wish the handle was about two inches longer.</li>
            <li> I love the simplicity of the safety razor and not to mention the cost effectiveness of doing so.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t expect it to be any better.</li>
            <li> you should notice a better shave.</li>
            <li> was expecting a better shave.</li>
            <li> The movable top popped off while i was shaving.</li>
            <li> them not doing the job i wanted, ilooked for and found your razor and am well pleased with everything about it.  </li>
            <li> I am using it and will do so until I locate a better razor.</li>
            <li> Love this thing always had a problem with bumps</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> and I am getting a better shave every time I use it as I am getting use to shaving without it.</li>
            <li> WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE SAID.</li>
            <li> Delivers a better shave than the disposable variety.  </li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I was able to shave faster and as close as I ever have before.</li>
            <li> so I sold it, got cut too many times.  </li>
            <li> and it would be better.</li>
            <li> I had used the Gellett model many years ago.</li>
            <li> I discovered the Shaving Factory with used blades may be used without producing many applications of the styptic pencil.</li>
            <li> Glad I did too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok razor.</li>
            <li> Disposable Gillette  razor work better on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love it, Not too aggressive for us newbies...</li>
            <li> Are there better?</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor for the price.  </li>
            <li> and you will see yourself wanting something better.</li>
            <li> You are fairly safe until you start turning the thing on your face.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the others that have rated this razor, I was looking for an entry level safety razor.  </li>
            <li> It is an ok razor.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  </li>
            <li> you will like it for sure.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this as a starter for sure.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my return to DE shaving with this razor.</li>
            <li> Love shaving with this.</li>
            <li> I love mine and invite you to become a penney shave club member.</li>
            <li> I ordered another one today that was rated more to my liking.</li>
            <li> which i&#x27;ve never used before I thought for sure</li>
            <li> I love this razor.</li>
            <li> A steady hand and patience, can&#x27;t rush a great shave.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first razor and it seemed quite good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how some razors go for a good amount of money, but it&#x27;s my first safety razor</li>
            <li> Which I would not have done if, my first experience had not been so good.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it better if it had more weight to it, but the price was right, so I  took that into consideration.</li>
            <li> The insertion of blades is easy as pie and very easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for beginner wet shavers.</li>
            <li> Check out my review of this razor on amazon, or go to ShaveLikeGrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com for a more detailed review with photos.</li>
            <li> My primary shaving tool for many years being the Remington 3 head micro screen.</li>
            <li> This razor is good for those who wants to cut their faces  PERIOD.  </li>
            <li> Real shame as I liked it, have to say the case it came in was very cheap and trashy looking.</li>
            <li> He no longer get razor burn when he shaved and is willing to shave more often!</li>
            <li> so it must be true and for a bargain price you can&#x27;t beat it !</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, it dosent cut or pull.</li>
            <li> It was OK, but it never delivered the “clean”, stubble-free result that a blade would give me.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in using a safety razor for the first time, this is a great razor to start with.</li>
            <li> a great price point to decide if you want to invest more in a proper razor.</li>
            <li> so that I can easily throw it in my travel bag</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did, great shave low price!</li>
            <li> washes up easily and shoes no signs of corrosion in the two months I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Cleans easy.</li>
            <li> The clamping bit does a good job keeping things still and steady.</li>
            <li> but I went with the reviews that others gave, stating that this one holds its own compared to higher priced choices.</li>
            <li> Looks cool, but doesn&#x27;t work too well, esp of you&#x27;re used to more than 1 blade.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use for the first time safety razor user, and it gave a really clean shave!</li>
            <li> I think the handle length is adequate and the razor is very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> If you need it for a shadowbox or a stage prop, fine.</li>
            <li> Used to it now, works fine.</li>
            <li> Cleans easy, comfortable grip.  </li>
            <li> The hinged doors on top of the blade bent and broke quickly.</li>
            <li> It is very attractive, fairly well made for the money, and comes in a very nice black plastic box that has a small shaving mirror built in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really gotten to be an enjoyable experience!</li>
            <li> Once you get the pressure right, it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> This razor is cheap, sturdy, light, regular size, cuts very well, opens/closes easily and best of all when you tighten it, you can change the angle of the cut!  </li>
            <li> , IT IS USER FRIENDLY, FIELD TESTED (LITERALLY), AND EASY TO USE.  </li>
            <li> Made a huge difference.</li>
            <li> The weight of it is heavy and feels perfect in my hand.</li>
            <li> The razor is a bit light, but well constructed.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using this.</li>
            <li> It was cheap, and that is why I bought it.  </li>
            <li> There isnt alot of weight with this razor, but again that is because it is cheap.  </li>
            <li> just a cheap razor added in to a kit</li>
            <li> more money but worth not the cut......</li>
            <li> I get a smooth shave every time I use it.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap piece of s</li>
            <li> After looking at it I could see how cheaply it was made.  </li>
            <li> The razor is well-built, and its well-balanced for shaving with light pressure.</li>
            <li> I received it a couple of weeks ago and have been using the razor daily with great results.  </li>
            <li> This razor is not as smooth as my Bic disposibles.  </li>
            <li> Use light strokes, and a brush and soap if you have that available.</li>
            <li> And you will get a close shave, and shouldn&#x27;t have any cuts or irritation, if you take your time and enjoy the shaving experience.</li>
            <li> This is important because the weight of the shaving head is supposed to do the work without the application of manual</li>
            <li> but this is a really smooth</li>
            <li> ARE A GREAT BUY, AND IT WILL LAST FOREVER</li>
            <li> I like how it opens and how it securely holds the blade.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Shaving Factory Double Edge Safety Razor is attractive and sturdy.</li>
            <li> The blades are so cheap that I can afford to trade them out every couple weeks rather than trying to push them well over a month</li>
            <li> I went for cheap when I ordered this razor and that&#x27;s what I got.  </li>
            <li> It is solidly build and gives me a great shave.</li>
            <li> worth spending more on something that works</li>
            <li> Cheap and crappy.</li>
            <li> Cheap Cheap quality control.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t experienced a nick since my third shave four months ago.</li>
            <li> stray hairs smoothly without bumps or cuts.  </li>
            <li> Blades for these are cheap and available at just about every drug store, and grocery store around.</li>
            <li> Not as good as old Gillette Razors.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;d say that getting the pack of 100 blades is the best part of the whole thing.</li>
            <li> I see products that should last and be around for many years because someone decided to take the time and make something that makes others feel good.</li>
            <li> This my first safety razor, and was pretty happy with it at first.</li>
            <li> Very little catching and pulling, but with the grain isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> Much better bargain and a better shave than all the new razors available on the market, so he tells me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try to return it, I&#x27;m keeping it as a reminder not to go for the fast, cheap, and easy route if I want anything worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Nice looking razor, the little doors open up on top to put the blade in perfect.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first, but after it&#x27;s first use, I find it avery good razor at a very affordable price !!</li>
            <li> Well built and worth every Cent!  </li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I ever bought and I am extremely satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Even though the head looks like its made of metal, i&#x27;m pretty sure its some composite plastic with a shiny finish.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s economical too!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well made and a large size to better fit your hand.</li>
            <li> It also has a good solid feel to it, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> I have been using it 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t had to clean the residue from the razor one time.  </li>
            <li> and now he is clean shaven again.  </li>
            <li> The best shave IS with an old fashioned double edge razor, however, I suggest getting a good one that will last for years.</li>
            <li> For the same price you can pick up a great Gillette vintage razor on that auction site, or spend another ten bucks and get a Merkur, If you&#x27;re thinking of getting this, or gifting it, do some more research!</li>
            <li> However, the handle has subtle fluting with a smooth finish, which makes it a bit slippery at times; this is not the best design decision by the makers.    </li>
            <li> Good quality for low price.</li>
            <li> It has enough heft that you can get a good shave without added pressure.  </li>
            <li> I prefer this style of razor over all the more modern disposable blades.</li>
            <li> As some others have stated if you tighten the blade holder too much one of the &amp;#34;flaps&amp;#34; will come off, but it is easily able to be reinstalled.</li>
            <li> I wish it weren&#x27;t true, but it is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only good for side burns</li>
            <li> I know most people recommend Merkur razors, but this thing shaves about as close as a straight razor.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for I am delighted with it, I should  not have changed to the twin blade and thrown out my double edge rasor.</li>
            <li> It will never be a Merkur or an Edwin Jagger razor, but then, if you are satisfied with a razor at this much lower price, it will serve you well.</li>
            <li> It gave me close shaves and the kind of control I had with the old safety razor.</li>
            <li> I yearned for the “barber shop” soap cup lather and straight razor luxury that my Dad and Grand Dad used to speak of so fondlyf.</li>
            <li> Amazon for sending them so quickly.. finally got a chance to use it last night looks great nice and close shave.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It shaves well enough and is undoubtedly a good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li> ;  While I feel that is being a mite generous, it certainly is good enough.  </li>
            <li> It has a very aggressive angle and virtually slices off your whiskers and top layer of skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems like it&#x27;s a good price, and he loves the thing, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> For a lady this makes life pretty easy.</li>
            <li> The razor is nicely balanced and has enough weight to make the shave comfortable (unlike some of the disposable razors I have used).</li>
            <li> gave the electric shaver a fair trial for more than a few years.</li>
            <li> Found many online and tis is reasonably low priced and works way better than cartridges.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this and would highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> High quality at a very reasonable cost very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Cut my face first time, just too light.</li>
            <li> It may have been a holdover on his part from the original blue blades, the kind that rusted.  </li>
            <li> not bad at all, worth the money.</li>
            <li> All I have to do with this one is to open it up a bit, run it under water, nice and clean.</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s worked well, seems to have a good weight and decent balance</li>
            <li> My husband likes the &amp;#34;Old type razor&amp;#34; better than these new ones.  </li>
            <li> I barely notice any difference--except I&#x27;m saving money, efficiently cleaning my razor, being a bit more ecologically prudent, and no longer feeling exploited by Gillette (and its conglomerate owner Proctor &amp; Gamble).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> Very functional and easy to use for the price.  </li>
            <li> Put that first 100-200 bucks back in your pocket, spend this $15 bucks with $10!worth of razor blades and you are good for a year.</li>
            <li> Works great, as long as you don&#x27;t use too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> forces me to press down more than I have liked.  </li>
            <li> One of the butterfly sides broke with the FIRST usage!</li>
            <li> a little bit longer shave this way, but the results are still great.</li>
            <li> Great little razor for the price.  </li>
            <li> Great little razor.  </li>
            <li> Great everyday razor.</li>
            <li> It’s as close as you can get to a straight razor and, consequently, needs some respect one may not give to the disposable units available.</li>
            <li> great razor ...use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> Once you get used to it complete your retro shave with the old fashioned soap and mug and good quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I closed them up gently and started shaving, so far so good felt nice then</li>
            <li> Far better shave with this than with disposables or electrics.  </li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN, better to consider the Merkur models 15C or 33C or the Lord L6 head, which is their model LP1822L.</li>
            <li> Good for the beginner to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> We had to order the acutual razor, but well worth it.  </li>
            <li> worth the effort&lt;</li>
            <li> My 72 year-old cheeks are thinner and more sensitive than my 20 year-old cheeks were.</li>
            <li> I also have a Parker 96R and 99R which are much more aggressive; you have to be more careful with them.  </li>
            <li> It has nice balance, but I often use the hand towell to open and close.</li>
            <li> upgraded to better razor no trouble.</li>
            <li> but I learned how to use a safety razor and rarely cut myself.  </li>
            <li> I think I have a handle for everything except for an old timey injector razor--the kind that you could really slice yourself with if one of the corners wasn&#x27;t seated correctly.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the way you twist the top open.</li>
            <li> The surprising part is that it comes in a wonderful hard plastic travel case with a small mirror inside.</li>
            <li> but hey for that price it&#x27;s all right .</li>
            <li> It went right into the garbage.</li>
            <li> He says that he gets a closer shave and it is much easier to clean the blade for continued shaving.  </li>
            <li> I have very large hands and the razor fits just fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Has a nice heavy feel and is easy to grip in my hand.</li>
            <li> I have been using this razor for the past 5 months and can say that this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> I feel it is very eco friendly and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> And you might as well go ahead and get yourself a shaving brush, a mug and some shaving soap (or cream, as long as it&#x27;s not the aerosol kind).</li>
            <li> The case is OK if this is what your buying it for but you can get an all leather case for a few bucks more if you already have a razor.</li>
            <li> Brought back the good old days..</li>
            <li> so I may as well get a good close shave for a lot less money.  </li>
            <li> Very good razor, very solid and durable, gives a very close smooth shave, very aggressive, so if your a newbie to wet shaving do not buy this and cry and whine!</li>
            <li> The razor works fine so far</li>
            <li> Like most guys, I started razor shaving with the free Gillette razor that they send to you when you turn 18 and have tried just about all the other razor combinations, 2, 3, 5 blades, and even vibrating handles.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be sure the blade is aligned evenly when you tighten it down, but that&#x27;s pretty easily done with a tap of the face of the razor on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you already use a safety razor and are looking to replace, spend the extra cash for better quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spend the $$ to get a higher quality razor when this one breaks.</li>
            <li> however the guide broke on the first day...</li>
            <li> I am really amazed at how nice it looks and the craftsmanship appears to be very well made, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty well built and seems reliable.</li>
            <li> Works different and better than todays razors.</li>
            <li> so had to send e-mails to them pointing it out and now have my money so be aware.</li>
            <li> I made this mistake the first time, even knowing not to push and bled because I probably took skin with it.  </li>
            <li> First thing for buyers: It&#x27;s made in China.</li>
            <li> After some effort I was able to get it back in place.</li>
            <li> When I placed the order I thought about paying $20 more for the German Merkur razor handle but opted for this $13 one.</li>
            <li> If you are looking into DE shaving, this razor does exactly what you need without killing your wallet.</li>
            <li> I thought it was okay, but it was only the first safety razor I had ever used.</li>
            <li> I first started shaving years ago with a safety razor and that&#x27;s all I used until the cartridge razors came into being.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever had during the first shave.  </li>
            <li> The safety razor is what I first used on my adolescent “peach fuzz” beard 60 years ago.</li>
            <li> As a seasoned citizen I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My shaves are now nostalgic events that evoke the wonderful bloom of my youth.</li>
            <li> Thus should not be your first shaving experience.</li>
            <li> He did purchase separate blades that were of higher quality.</li>
            <li> This was the first time for him to use a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> It i s exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I am getting more shaves now per blade than my last razor gave me!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how to use the first one</li>
            <li> anyone else remember when the first two-bladed razor appeared (Gillette Trac 2, 1971)?</li>
            <li> , i ended up stepping up for a higher dollar one, mugs, soaps, and foams....</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s the first time  you&#x27;ve used a Double Edge (or as in my case Many years since I&#x27;ve used one)</li>
            <li> Did some research before purchasing my first DE safety razor and after making my head spin with all the information chose this one.  </li>
            <li> The razor is flimsy and malfunctioned with my first shave.  </li>
            <li> I use it with the Derby blades and it gives me a smooth old school shave.</li>
            <li> I believe differences in the shaving routine help to make a closer shave, even using different razors, and types of razor shaving as many as 5 times, and finishing up with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> When I first started using it</li>
            <li> You do have to take more time and care than a disposable razor but its not that big of a difference.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to start safety razor shaving or looking for a good razor please spend a little more money and buy something a little more high quality.</li>
            <li> I am new to shaving with this kind of razor, and have only tried one brand of blade.  </li>
            <li> With the right razor blade this razor performs very well and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I may not be doing it exactly right, but I don&#x27;t care because I save so much money on blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can cut yourself easily if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> bring back the old high quality constucion with good razor blades the shaver cant be beat .</li>
            <li> Opted for the BIC blades and so far not disappointed.</li>
            <li> The top part that spreads to open for the blade has come off twice, but it was easy to put back together.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that I would save a few bucks instead of getting a reputable razor, but not be so cheap as to buy the three dollar ones floating around here.</li>
            <li> I have a German safety razor that cost much more than twice as much</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning it is an absolute breeze - open the top and rinse off the blade and the razor.</li>
            <li> It will clog up on you if you are shaving a few days worth of growth, but hit your face with a buzzer first like an intelligent human being and you won&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I saw ad and feel positive, but it is not as my expectation.</li>
            <li> I was really concerned at first</li>
            <li> The blade position is moderate, seeming to be a more aggressive than a Merkur Classic or Lord L6.    </li>
            <li> I personally use a shavette, and he wants to start easy</li>
            <li> Comfort wise, the single blade is the same as the five blade with no additional razor burn.</li>
            <li> Yes it was 3x the price, but it is heavier, made of smoother metal (which I didn&#x27;t think possible, the Shaving Factory one seemed fine)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derby Extra blades and they&#x27;ve been treating my face just fine.</li>
            <li> Nice Little Razor</li>
            <li> The case isn&#x27;t spectacular, but the little mirror is helpful sometimes.</li>
            <li> This particular razor is clearly cheaply made--but what can you expect for a 12-dollar version of an item that generally costs $30-50 for an entry-level model.  </li>
            <li> Why buy expensive multi-blade razors when a double edge single blade is very effective and works great.</li>
            <li> The type of blade will obviously make a huge difference in how well it works.  </li>
            <li> I use it when I don&#x27;t have time to do the straight shave.</li>
            <li> But, it shaves, it&#x27;s very inexpensive, it does</li>
            <li> thanks to ebay</li>
            <li> It looks like stainless steel</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, well built.</li>
            <li> Thanks for offering this product.  </li>
            <li> Very affordable and well built razor.</li>
            <li> You really just have to let it glide.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the razor as a cheap easier solution than the big name brand one.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have to shave often</li>
            <li> It works very well and seems to be constructed very well.</li>
            <li> Save your money and buy a real Gillette on Ebay</li>
            <li> DE-blade edges are supposed to be dead straight, and any warp to the edge is a formula for a harsh shave at best.</li>
            <li> Then treat the mechanism gently.</li>
            <li> Looks very cheep .</li>
            <li> very flimsy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to use this razor, and I like my friends too much to give it to any of them.</li>
            <li> The blades are soo much cheaper then the razors offer.  </li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> thank you so much</li>
            <li> Be advised, that this razor is very aggressive.</li>
            <li> I like the box it comes in and has a mirror if you want to go camping or something (who really shaves when their camping though?).</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t blame the razor, though.  </li>
            <li> Much technology and metallurgy has been directed at the shaving market since.</li>
            <li> After getting used to the razor he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> but like this every bit as much.</li>
            <li> A very functional razor.</li>
            <li> I still like it just as much now as I did when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> But, it does really shave well and close.</li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave.</li>
            <li> The blade angle is very aggressive .</li>
            <li> One of the great joys of childhood in the early fifties was to find old rusted blue blades in the trash and then slicing your hands open when you insisted on playing with the damn things.</li>
            <li> I wanted to determine whether switching to the safety razor was feasible, without investing much money up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , if you decide you don&#x27;t like it, you are only out a few bucks, but I am sure you will be glad you got it.</li>
            <li> Quality actually better than expected.  </li>
            <li> My husband really likes blades like this</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really say much else about it.  </li>
            <li> I find the shave to be very close</li>
            <li> Works very well, had to learn to let it glide over my face with almost no pressure</li>
            <li> i preferred a straight razor.</li>
            <li> If you decide to order this razor, or the others that I purchased your shipping time is much shorter than what the order says.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t find it a noticeable improvement from the cheap-o Chinese model I bought before (also available on Amazon).</li>
            <li> razor also has a nice solid feel to it, it&#x27;s gonna last me a while</li>
            <li> The opening doors of this razor are pretty tight, although you&amp;#34;ll probably end up tightening the handle before each shave to make sure you don&#x27;t knick yourself with a slip.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the included case is okay.</li>
            <li> BUT.....then it gets TOO loose very quickly</li>
            <li> Gillette, Schick, Wilkinson and others have spent billions on R&amp;D, “clinical” trials and advertising in an effort to win both male and female blade-shaver customers.</li>
            <li> It has a nice weight to it and comes with a carrying case that has a small mirror.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll have to see if the higher end really offers a shaving advantage.</li>
            <li> dad&#x27;s old Gillette double edge worked fine after I got the feel of the thing</li>
            <li> New life for used blades!</li>
            <li> I was able to correct this problem by using jewelry pliers to slightly re-shape the defective door, which corrected the problem but damaged the chrome a bit.</li>
            <li> Decent price for entry into using a tradtional razor.</li>
            <li> My father does not like &amp;#34;new technology&amp;#34; so he was used to the older type razors.</li>
            <li> paired this with some Derby blades; the only thing to watch out for is the pressure and angle your shaving with; you want to have the metal grooves sliding over first; then the blade, if you hit blade first you will get knicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Take a step back in time and get a get shave the old way at a very economical price.</li>
            <li> I own another handle that with the same fresh blades slices me usually</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Recommend it highly.....</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend this razor</li>
            <li> I dropped the razor in the shower (not even a high drop), and the head broke in two.</li>
            <li> Finish is high polish SS and chrome.  </li>
            <li> The thing cut me and again, looked at the unit and one end of the little doors on top had popped out, I opened the doors and it pinged (yes pinged) off.</li>
            <li> I am begging you, spend a little more up front.</li>
            <li> little razor gives me a better shave than any of the fancy&lt;br</li>
            <li> my husband still prefers disposable, but my 17 year old son really really likes it a lot.  </li>
            <li> and I just bought an old Gillette brand razor that is very well made.  </li>
            <li> Near drops and the imprecision of a slippery razor twisting in my fingers takes away too much of the pleasure of my morning shave ritual.</li>
            <li> In the early 1960s Gillette came out with the stainless steel blade and virtually doubled the quality and durability of the safety razor experience.</li>
            <li> That gets old fast.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a quality razor at an economical price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought the badger bristle brush and Taylor-of-old-Bond-Street soap disk from Amazon and have thoroughly enjoyed the transition from aerosol mediocrity.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more dollars and buy an Edwin James or a Merkur - get quality.  </li>
            <li> have used a few times and love it.  </li>
            <li> You cannot shave with one of these like you would with a normal cartridge safety razor (like a Fusion, Trac II, etc).  </li>
            <li> I found going to a razor type that was invented over 80 years ago was worth the investment...very low cost at that.  </li>
            <li> I considered more expensive razors, but wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like shaving the old fashioned way.  </li>
            <li> Saturday Night Live made fun of their commercial by imagining a three-bladed razor.</li>
            <li> These blue blades were sharp as the devil but only good for a shave or two</li>
            <li> On reflection, one can probably safely assume that most of the second, third, and fourth world countries of the earth probably either still use double edge, cut throat razors, or just let their beards grown to disguise themselves from American drone</li>
            <li> As a TTO alternative, consider the Weishi 9306-f, which is a little less expensive, is chrome over brass, can give a good shave although it is very mild/non-aggressive, and has a great texture on the handle.</li>
            <li> I do think this razor will become a travel razor once I get a new one.</li>
            <li> Even with a brand new blade it does not work as it is supposed to work.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like new again.</li>
            <li> I am getting back into wet shaving after using an electric razor for many years.</li>
            <li> This one actually works better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Paired with Derby Extra blades and Shave Secret it provides a great shave for both my son and me.</li>
            <li> Having bigger hands makes it a bit more to harder to control.</li>
            <li> For the last five years I settled in comfortably with a  Wahl Electric 4500 shaver with extra close screen.</li>
            <li> The only drawbacks to the Good News blade were the “clog” factor (need to flush repeatedly) and the inability to get a tight (under the nostrils) shave… without “digging” and perhaps nicking my upper lip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It closes tight and holds the blade straight, doesn&#x27;t clog up and rinses clean with ease.</li>
            <li> works much better than any disposable no more nicks on the face, I would recommend this to everyone I know</li>
            <li> No more Cheap Plastic Razors!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it again, but may go with a higher quality/heavier build next time.</li>
            <li> By middle of the first shave I required application of the styptic pencil.</li>
            <li> I received this razor and used it for the first time last night.  </li>
            <li> Haha, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll even bother \\&quot;upgrading\\&quot; to a more expensive razor since this one is doing such a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It could be a little longer for my big hands but other than it is doing a great job.</li>
            <li> I usually follow up with a shave balm made by mixing a spot of body lotion with Old Spice aftershave, and enjoy the baby butt smooth face all day long.</li>
            <li> opens up fine to insert blade and also closes tight so blade doesn&#x27;t move around.</li>
            <li> But this new item is fixed and thus, not what I had desired.</li>
            <li> After shaving, dad used to open the butterfly and let some hot water from the tap run over the exposed blade though I don&#x27;t know if this is really helpful or standard procedure.  </li>
            <li> Not after feeling how smooth a single double edge razor cuts.  </li>
            <li> Its all metal just seems a little light.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t had any trouble opening and closing it so far and the case is not at all fancy, but it works fine.</li>
            <li> I purchased what i thought was a  low end orice razor to try it out, and so far i have not lost too much skin.  </li>
            <li> Completely usless.  </li>
            <li> Old time shaver</li>
            <li> an old time guy.</li>
            <li> I just received this razor and have to say I was extremely surprised.</li>
            <li> Old fashion razor that I like.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who wants to get into proper shaving.</li>
            <li> But the overall razor is very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Too early to tell if there are any long-term consequences.    </li>
            <li> After my operation they cut the nerves on both sides of my face and now my face is so sensitive</li>
            <li> After buying an old gillette for six bucks, I compared the two for a month.</li>
            <li> For the beginner, I would recommend shopping around for an old razor online or at an antique shop.</li>
            <li> Straight abd to the point with basic info on fish holding lakes, helped plan the backpacling route but have not taken the trip yet.</li>
            <li> As with any double-edge safety razor, the cost is MUCH lower for replacement blades than a standard cartridge</li>
            <li> Concurrently the Remingtons, Norelcos and others have developed and touted the electric alternatives to beard and “stubble” control.</li>
            <li> AGGRESSIVE is an understatement when describing the safety razor’s action on your beard.</li>
            <li> The body  of the handle is coming of very easily, so do not waste your money in this razor.</li>
            <li> As far as recommending the razor to someone else, that would have to be up to the one I gave it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood and a Tweezerman badger brush and am amazed at the quality of shaves.  </li>
            <li> I just got into the traditional wet-shaving scene since I was really quite fed up with the disposable cartridges.</li>
            <li> I somehow inherited a whole bunch of razors and various packs of blades and cartridges.  </li>
            <li> I even bought a barber straight razor though, with my current eyesight</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t think I plan to get that thing anywhere near my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the old days.</li>
            <li> Not too light  and not too heavy for my hand.  </li>
            <li> Chrome plated pot metal as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> I get a smooth shave, and with shaving only three or four times a week they will  probably last me ten years.</li>
            <li> That old one is going in the trash</li>
            <li> just like I has when I was young.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didnt work on my soft beard.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It appears to be durable, and the appearance and quality of the metal seem to be right in line with the more expensive safety razors.  </li>
            <li> fairly good razor handle narrow though hard to hold with large hands easy to us though its hard to control .</li>
            <li> Hefty razor, handle could be a little long but nice to get back to the old fashion way of shaving using brush and soap dish.  </li>
            <li> Shaving takes about half again as long now because I have to be a lot more careful with the single blade - it is quite easy to cut yourself.</li>
            <li> The shaver is satisfactory but the more expensive shavers may be of higher quality.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be the exact same razor as the Mingshi razor that I bought last week.</li>
            <li> I have been shaving for sixty years and Years back when my hand was steady</li>
            <li> Solid razor, arrived quickly, and the case will (crucially) keep me from thoughtlessly slicing my finger open and pouring blood into my bags while camping.</li>
            <li> Cool little gift.</li>
            <li> See my other review to see if a Parker could be the right razor for you.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor especially if you&#x27;re looking for something to travel with.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend springing for the chromed Merkur design instead, it only costs $40</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another caution:  with the butterfly opening type of razor, which this is, make sure the razor is completely closed by giving the bottom of the handle a slight tighten.  </li>
            <li> While it is a less-expensive alternative when experimenting with wet shaving, the aggressiveness of the razor (and resulting rash) could scare off a less adventurous person.  </li>
            <li> While it is a less-expensive alternative when experimenting with wet shaving, the aggressiveness of the razor (and resulting rash) could scare off a less adventurous person.  </li>
            <li> Decent quality - had a minor problem with the clamp closing correctly that I fixed with a pair of pliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new razor, &amp;#34;fantastic&amp;#34; is how he describes it, he won&#x27;t go back to plastic shaving razors ever again.</li>
            <li> Because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a new type of razor without trying it first--and because I didn&#x27;t want to wait--I purchased this razor locally about a week ago, and have shaved with it twice.  </li>
            <li> I do not know why we ever switched to these new ones with multiple blades.</li>
            <li> With a twist of the handle a new blade is placed in this razor and I go back 50 years... except for the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I even learned a new trick I never figured out in my youth when I last shaved with one of this type: the edge seems to blunt in one direction.</li>
            <li> The chrome plating seems high quality with no apparent defects.</li>
            <li> Funny how a man finally calms down as he grows older.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had both the twist open type here and the very old unscrew the handle and disassemble the razor type.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not extremely sturdy</li>
            <li> Another reason I like it might not be exactly why other people like it.  </li>
            <li> The top was a tad crooked when closed completely, but that took little to no effort fixing.</li>
            <li> I was a little leary at first because of the cuts one can get using this type of razor!</li>
            <li> Also, a tip about inexpensive TTO razors: you may get more durability if you oil the TTO mechanism periodically (let mineral oil drops run down the center post of the open razor head -- I do this to all my TTO razors, even the vintage Gillette).</li>
            <li> The twist to open mechanism works solidly, the finish is decent, and it does the job.  </li>
            <li> The blade doesn&#x27;t even extend out far enough to touch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> The safety razor could trigger a 911 call if I was not really careful.</li>
            <li> First wet razor, travel razor,, 2nd razor</li>
            <li> Then I am going to get a nice expensive one to use that</li>
            <li> Being new to the use of double edge razors the product had a low entry price for starters, which is what enticed me to pick it up.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, spring the extra cash for a new $30-40 razor that will last for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some have speculated stainless steel underneath, but I doubt that because one wouldn&#x27;t chrome over stainless, plus it&#x27;s a more difficult metal to stamp or cast than more common razor materials including common steel, brass, and aluminum.    </li>
            <li> I still want to punch a wall in exasperation at how much I paid for other razors.  </li>
            <li> I wanted something cheap to try this whole SR thing out vs extremely expensive cartridge shaving.  </li>
            <li> I had another brand of comparable price (actually more expensive) that did not perform nearly as well.</li>
            <li> Basically I spent the extra money on this version for the case and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I came to own this razor because it was erroneously sent to me by a seller who kept insisting it was the same as the Weishi 9306-f that I ordered.</li>
            <li> /&gt;When looking for single edge blades for my new microtome (see my microtome review)</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars in comparison with my dad&#x27;s old Gillette which was, when he bought it, a more expensive</li>
            <li> At least I get a full refund for sending it back, no option for replacement.</li>
            <li> I have big hands and long fingers, so I wish it was a little more heavy</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly to anyone who has had&lt;br /&gt;problems using a conventional disposable razor.  </li>
            <li> Not ready to toss it yet, I&#x27;ll try other blades first.</li>
            <li> You definitely have to practice shaving with this thing very carefully if you&#x27;re coming from normal disposable razors.</li>
            <li> The doors open adequately for easy blade changing (one other TTO razor model, by contrast, doesn&#x27;t open quite enough, making blade changing a bit awkward).    </li>
            <li> The carrying case is light plastic but appears tough enough for travel.</li>
            <li> It is a very economical old school razor but shaves like a expensive one.</li>
            <li> I flip the blade upside down for new sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The case it comes in is decent and has a little mirror that I guess you could use in emergencies.  </li>
            <li> As other have suggested, I use Feather brand blades and find them to be consistent quality, very sharp and long lasting.</li>
            <li> If you have never used a safety razor or have been away from it for a while you may find that this type of razor is a bit less forgiving than say a Trac II or similar razor as far as nicks go</li>
            <li> Worse, while the blade angle isn&#x27;t necessarily too mild, I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave without applying some pressure (again a balance issue).</li>
            <li> One blade lasts much longer than the multi-blade gillete fusion cartridges I was spedning a small fortune on.</li>
            <li> The handle is 3-1/2 inches long, which is a bit generous for a standard twist-to-open (TTO) razor.</li>
            <li> the Merkur long handle 3 piece earlier</li>
            <li> Should be flat to align shaving angle.</li>
            <li> like using a mug and brush so, a few weeks back, I started to use my dad&#x27;s old double edge blade.  </li>
            <li> this razor is not great.. and is not bad.</li>
            <li> So far I see little reason to replace it unless I want a different design.</li>
            <li> However, even if this did not happen this razor would not last very long.</li>
            <li> Lost a lot of confidence that it would last very long.</li>
            <li> Had not used one in a very long time and It coms back to you in no time nick or cuts.</li>
            <li> Stopped buying Aramis, too and am now using Old Spice and smelling like the common old man I am.  </li>
            <li> I was initially concerned about more easily cutting myself, but that has not been an issue at all.  </li>
            <li> I only have a sample size of one razor, but mine arrived with a manufacturing defect in that one of the double edges of the blade acquires a hump-shaped curve when the razor doors are closed.</li>
            <li> I decided to try shaving with a single edge blade at last.</li>
            <li> In addition, the chrome finish began to come off of my razor after about two months of normal use, cutting me mildly.</li>
            <li> This is just a little heaver than my old one</li>
            <li> The shave is smoother than ever, no cuts, and the Shaving Factory one, unfortunately, feels almost as light to me now as a disposable, even though it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaving factory razor was too light and difficult to balance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only given myself one small knick shaving with this product so far, and it was while shaving over a pimple</li>
            <li> The weight of it is enough and the mechanics work as expected.  </li>
            <li> This will save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> They are evidently far from being dead dinosaurs.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful when using this double edge razor!</li>
            <li> Like the ones from long ago.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s alright (which would be three stars by there rating system) by my thought it would only get one and a half based only on the build alone.</li>
            <li> It made it a much more difficult experience to shave, taking the experience from something in line with a Mach 3 down to something like a single blade Bic dry shaving.</li>
            <li> Some of the moving parts may seem a little bit loose or slightly misaligned, but when there is a blade in the mechanism it can be clamped down tightly so the blade bends to the correct angle and is held securely in place.  </li>
            <li> I have since shaved with a lot of other razors and this is the only one to leave me bleeding all over.</li>
            <li> Going to save me alot of money in the long run!</li>
            <li> Slicingback and fourt with any blade in a sawing motion is a big no no with any sharp edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sounds silly, but it saves a lot of time after you shave because you don&#x27;t have to clean it.  </li>
            <li> and you had to dry them thoroughly to keep them from rusting.  </li>
            <li> The only modification that he made was to rough up the handle with a file so that the razor doesn&#x27;t slip out of his wet and soapy hand during shaving.</li>
            <li> It heavy enough so that when you shave, you don&#x27;t have to apply any extra force on your skin (don&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> so I suggested that he start with a safety razor to get used to using a single blade.</li>
            <li> How long until it breaks again, unknown.</li>
            <li> Some reviewers said they had problems with their razors coming loose while shaving, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with mine</li>
            <li> One must remember to tighten it down constantly.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my first razor because I couldn&#x27;t get the flaps up to replace the blade after a few weeks of mineral (as in my case, hard water), whiskers, and shaving cream build up.</li>
            <li> I tried various blades and cut myself somewhat with about half the blade brands.</li>
            <li> Subsequent online research has taught me that this is a common problem with using safety razors in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how to compare to some of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> The blades last longer And cost considerably less.</li>
            <li> I like the slightly shorter handle because it&#x27;s easier to flip around for the against-grain stroke when necessary.  </li>
            <li> My little girl (6 yr old) tells me in e morning that &amp;#34;the black circles are gone, and my face is shiny like hers.  </li>
            <li> This may be the last razor I&#x27;ll ever buy, at least as long the double edged blades are still made.</li>
            <li> Only problem is the handle can get a little slippery when wet</li>
            <li> Only problem is , he is having a hard time finding blades locally.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied,.......gives me a shave equal to the expensive multi blade razers......</li>
            <li> The guard is too wide.  </li>
            <li> This razor is poorly made, and VERY aggressive.</li>
            <li> The same thing almost happened to this razor after a few days.</li>
            <li> to be careful after using safety razors all these years</li>
            <li> Not what I expected .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s everything i expected plus.  </li>
            <li> safety razor is not to be treatedcasually by the inexperienced user.</li>
            <li> It was affordable and works as expected.</li>
            <li> I get the razor wet all the time</li>
            <li> It is heavy and too short handle.</li>
            <li> Got to be careful with them or you&#x27;ll have those &amp;#34;toilet paper&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Recommend you tube videos of how to wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I finally game up and replaced it with a slightly more expensive Parker that is solid brass.</li>
            <li> The razor is everything I expected it to be.  </li>
            <li> This razor has met and gone beyond the close shave which I had expected.</li>
            <li> be careful to center the blades while loading or you&#x27;ll be off center and unintentionally reenact the bathroom scene of poltergeist.</li>
            <li> The gates are a bit loose when open but when closed hold the blade very tight.</li>
            <li> Got sick of high priced cartrige blades and heard from a friend that there is a resurgence in old school double edge wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price; I had expected an adjustable razor</li>
            <li> Not interested in spending anything over $15.  </li>
            <li> I ran afoul of blades in the trash twice even though I was allowed to carry a razor sharp sheath knife around in the woods when I turned six and never once sliced myself on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, it corroded or something, and became difficult to open or close (increasing the chance of a sliced finger) until it jammed completely.  </li>
            <li> lots of blood and cuts  does not compare to fusion or any other multi blade shaver&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
            <li> You can get an acceptable shave IF you take your time &amp; are VERY careful.</li>
            <li> When it arrived, I started using it very carefully</li>
            <li> i was tired of the new type razors and</li>
            <li> Like many others I got so tired of paying for expensive multi-blade razor cartridges.  </li>
            <li> Guide was bent... not a very good design...get the $2.50 Chinese one..</li>
            <li> and it is harder to get in tight stops (like under the nose or against the ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I suppose that isn&#x27;t bad considering the location, not to mention the fact that it was my first time using a double edge safety razor.</li>
            <li> I used to have a pretty bad five o&#x27;clock shadow by lunch time, now I can shave the night before and actually don&#x27;t feel like I need a touch up before the day is over.</li>
            <li> and it seems impossible to clean out and continue shaving.</li>
            <li> now if I shop around $10.00 is blades should last me at least a year......</li>
            <li> I use Feather Hi-Stanless platinum coated blades from Japan and find this shaves much closer than the expensive multi-blade disposable razor I was using.</li>
            <li> After some time, I am forced to downgrade my initial review to 2 stars.  </li>
            <li> but when you tried to close it down on a blade it just keeps turning and turning and applies no pressure on the blade anymore.  </li>
            <li> In the mean time I will stick with my Wahl Shaver until the next shaver arrives.</li>
            <li> Where as getting nicks was a common occurrence with my previous razor, I&#x27;ve only received two very minor nicks with this razor over the past month of every day shaving.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad about it besides it is a little on the light side.</li>
            <li> I found this DE Razor to be uneven and extremely aggressive.</li>
            <li> I have nicked myself, but less than I did with cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> the twin blades cost a fraction less than the fancy multiple&lt;br /&gt;Blade</li>
            <li> If stubble begins to clog razor just a half turn on handle, rinse</li>
            <li> Razor lasted less that two weeks before the opening and closing mechanism gave up.  </li>
            <li> Came in 5 days or less</li>
            <li> but I thought I would like a slightly longer</li>
            <li> I got the razor and about a 3 year supply of blades for less than a four pack of my previous quattro refills.  </li>
            <li> get an easier close shave, it saves money, less litter.</li>
            <li> The shave is a bit too harsh (due to razor, not blade) and the handle is just too darned slippery!</li>
            <li> Construction is not as tight as Merkur, Edwin Jagger or Feather Polymer DE Razor but useable with care of blade alignment.</li>
            <li> Gorilla force is likely to damage small, delicate parts.    </li>
            <li> There is A LOT less waste material at the end of a blade&#x27;s life.  </li>
            <li> I wish the handle was a little longer, but it works well.</li>
            <li> This razor requires a little practice to get a hang of.</li>
            <li> functional and gets the job done,quality leaves a little to be desired but for the price who can complain .</li>
            <li> had hundreds of little cuts.  </li>
            <li> Could be a little sturdier but no issues.</li>
            <li> I also like the little carrying case that this razor comes with.</li>
            <li> The chrome plating is a little crappy too.</li>
            <li> I can say that it seems a little on the no frills side</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a little oxidation in the assembly already</li>
            <li> With a little practice, you&#x27;ll have few if any problems using this type of razor.  </li>
            <li> Dont push down!  </li>
            <li> This shaver does well, but it is hard to grasp when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> I plan to use this for a few weeks as I learn to shave with it.  </li>
            <li> The razor itself doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as well-made as some others I&#x27;ve used, not holding the blade quite as evenly or firmly.</li>
            <li> Dont Waste Money on $25.00 Refills Get a Safety</li>
            <li> Besides wasting money, the Gillette cartridge wastes the environment--chunks of plastic and four or five (one-edge) blades per shave.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Years ago during a move my razor like this was misplaced &amp; has never shown up.</li>
            <li> Blade exposure along edge may be uneven requiring care when tighten handle.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Had this razor for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> There are a few things you need to know though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beyond this, a few weeks in, it is giving a shave that rivals my Gilette Quattro (as evaluated by wife and daughter).  </li>
            <li> Have been using this razor almost everyday, though I still use others as well to get the closest shaves.</li>
            <li> Yep, I do have a few wrinkles</li>
            <li> So I got this razor to reduce plastic waste.</li>
            <li> I have cut around my ankle a few times but now that i&#x27;ve got the hang of it I haven&#x27;t cut myself.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as I had hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Just glide the blade slowly and carefully!</li>
            <li> This was not easy to get the residue out of the holes in the razor itself, because running it under the faucet didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, with the blade tightened down all the way it won&#x27;t shave close at all hardly, but with it loosened just a bit</li>
            <li> purchased this sshaver never closed properly very poor quality.</li>
            <li> TAKES VERY LITTLE</li>
            <li> Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and very little irritation.</li>
            <li> With straight blade edges, this razor doesn&#x27;t shave badly.</li>
            <li> I decided to try my hand at wet shaving as I&#x27;ve become annoyed at paying for overpriced disposable cartridge razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already recouped the small expense for this razor and a pack of blades (doesn&#x27;t come with any) vs. the cartridges I was buying in just one month.</li>
            <li> I was wary of supercheap razors, and did not want to pay a fortune for European razors.  </li>
            <li> The handle is too small.</li>
            <li> The holes designed for the cream and discarded hair were too small.  </li>
            <li> It is made below standard, and looked that it would fail the passing of time.</li>
            <li> caution with a double edge is you have to be wary of the blade corners.  </li>
            <li> This razor gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with only one tiny nick at the base of my nose</li>
            <li> When you calculate how long you will use the razor (years), the price differential becomes meaningless.</li>
            <li> Use this razor every 2 to 3 days, dry it off and store it in it&#x27;s case, after about 5 months chrome started peeling off the TTO knob, now it&#x27;s difficult to change blades.  </li>
            <li> Was looking forward to using this, the head is plastic, was broken in half on delivery, heard the rattling in the package when I picked it up, didn&#x27;t think anything till I opened up the box, (the box itself was unbroken) and found the razor in pieces.</li>
            <li> I am tired of paying exorbitant prices for the three and four bladed razor blades and still getting a less than close shave</li>
            <li> I was expecting at least one blade to come with it.</li>
            <li> I never liked the pivoting-head disposable razors because I could not control the angle of the blades on my beard.</li>
            <li> At least the plastic case can be used for travel since the Merkur 34C fits in it.</li>
            <li> I got this razor and it was broken into a few pieces inside the box.  </li>
            <li> I have a thick beard I keep in a goatee</li>
            <li> I went reaaaaaallllllyyyyy slow.</li>
            <li> I mean disposable razors.</li>
            <li> Safety razors give a closest shave (can be too close if you know what I mean there in a learning curve)</li>
            <li> less expensive than the disposables which I had been buying.</li>
            <li> Your shave will quickly turn into a bloody disaster!)</li>
            <li> This caused the door not to close properly, which in turn caused the blade to be incorrectly aligned, which in turn lead to bad shaves.</li>
            <li> Not a good shave.</li>
            <li> You could see the difference in blade gap between the two edges of the razor, which I gather is not a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I was tired of disposable razors.  </li>
            <li> If you are not experienced with a DE razor get an adjustable one.</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> Instead of a mass of plastic, there&#x27;s a thin sliver of steel that can be recycled.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made the decision to step up the game, rather than get out.e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made the decision to step up the game, rather than get out.</li>
            <li> Got this because I was tired of the disposable nonsense I&#x27;d been using.  </li>
            <li> recommend not to purchase this shaver poor construction.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I was tired of spending 30 bucks a pack for Gillette fusion cartridges.</li>
            <li> is a false advertising.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had such a bad shave in 40 years!</li>
            <li> The razor itself isn&#x27;t bad; but as mentioned by a few others I would like a longer handle and will upgrade to another.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately a piece had broken off during shipping</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t think of any reason someone wouldn&#x27;t prefer a safety razor over those irritating and expensive cartridge or disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so let down and disappointed....</li>
            <li> ....... cuts if you dont watch out or held at the wrong angle ......</li>
            <li> decided to go with a double-edge handheld razor because 3, 4, and 5-blade disposable cartridges  have become obscenely expensive.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the build of this razor, just the design in general.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The base is too heavy and the construction of the razor is below par.</li>
            <li> Cant go wrong...</li>
            <li> made the switch from the Mach 5 (5 blade razors) because the blades are so ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend this over any expensive multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li> razor looks expensive but is not.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I did not save time that day.)</li>
            <li> is a disappointment to me everything I have ever ordered from Amazon</li>
            <li> As an ex-haircutter I am used to quality hand cutting tools</li>
            <li> This began to lift over time and became a hazard to cutting fingers when opening or closing the razor.  </li>
            <li> I cut my face up like crazy.</li>
            <li> Conservative shave that keeps the blade from niking and cutting for pennies a month.</li>
            <li> That was a bad omen.</li>
            <li> Got it for a friend who used to buy those ugly Costco bags with like a zillion disposable plastic razors, he uses it and he likes it</li>
            <li> YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY:(</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> I hate to shave anyway</li>
            <li> I hate amazon&#x27;s 20 word requirement.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, this is the worst decision I&#x27;ve made in a while.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst shaving razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This razor gave me the worst razor burn</li>
            <li> For my beard I might as well been using a kitchen knife, horrible razor.</li>
            <li> Terrible would not work for my husband.</li>
            <li> but this one was awful.</li>

            <li> Broke within two (2) weeks of owning it, JUNK do not buy this P.O.S</li>
            <li> I wish the handle was a little longer, but it works well.</li>
            <li> Use this razor every 2 to 3 days, dry it off and store it in it&#x27;s case, after about 5 months chrome started peeling off the TTO knob, now it&#x27;s difficult to change blades.  Good starter razor but if you already use a safety razor and are looking to replace, spend the extra cash for better quality.</li>
            <li> Hubbys and he seems to like!</li>
            <li> Finish started coming off after 30 days, leaving jagged edges.</li>
            <li> I call out a starter only because of the price.  So far I see little reason to replace it unless I want a different design.</li>
            <li> Great Shave.  I use it when I don&#x27;t have time to do the straight shave.</li>
            <li> was just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Good quality for low price. Razor feels good in hand and has a nice weight to it.</li>
            <li> The guard is too wide.  Non-aggressive shave.</li>
            <li> Lasted 6 months before handle broke off.</li>
            <li> Love this and I never touched Crack again. I mean disposable razors.</li>
            <li> For some reason, with the blade tightened down all the way it won&#x27;t shave close at all hardly, but with it loosened just a bit it shaves good, BUT.....then it gets TOO loose very quickly and you get cut. I&#x27;ll spend the $$ to get a higher quality razor when this one breaks. But, it shaves, it&#x27;s very inexpensive, it does it&#x27;s job, for what I paid, I got what I needed. Something to shave with that&#x27;s better than those lousy disposable razors.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking that I would save a few bucks instead of getting a reputable razor, but not be so cheap as to buy the three dollar ones floating around here. As it turns out, this is the worst decision I&#x27;ve made in a while. This razor is poorly made, and VERY aggressive. I have since shaved with a lot of other razors and this is the only one to leave me bleeding all over. The blade angle is WAY off, and the build quality is low. For the same price you can pick up a great Gillette vintage razor on that auction site, or spend another ten bucks and get a Merkur, If you&#x27;re thinking of getting this, or gifting it, do some more research! You won&#x27;t be happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. No I didn&#x27;t try to return it, I&#x27;m keeping it as a reminder not to go for the fast, cheap, and easy route if I want anything worthwhile.</li>
            <li> Used to use Quattro razor and had some problems with razor bumps.  Switched to safety razor about 2 weeks ago.  It&#x27;s worked perfectly.  You have to get used to it since it&#x27;ll nick you more than the Quattro or Mach 3, but shave is easier on my face and bumps are improving.</li>
            <li> my husband loves his but would like a better grip like rubberized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it simple.  Razor is awesome,  works great,  cheaper than new razors,  and makes you feel like a boss.</li>
            <li> The price is nice BUT... It&#x27;s the worst shaving razor I&#x27;ve ever used. The case is OK if this is what your buying it for but you can get an all leather case for a few bucks more if you already have a razor. Anyone who is buying this as an introduction to DE shaving is going to be turned off before they have a chance to understand the benefits. You can get an acceptable shave IF you take your time &amp; are VERY careful. THIS WILL NEVER BE YOUR ONLY DE RAZOR!</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor as a way to start shaving using safety razors. Being new to the use of double edge razors the product had a low entry price for starters, which is what enticed me to pick it up. Unfortunately a piece had broken off during shipping and I had to return it. It seemed like it would be a perfect travel razor, being that it came with a case/mirror.</li>
            <li> I love DE Safety razors...this one appears to be made well..however the guide broke on the first day...I was wondering why this razor came as a subscription service...They recommend you replace the razor monthly...the entire idea here is to keep the razor for years and save money....I&#x27;m so let down and disappointed....I went back to my Gillette Double Edged safety razor...can&#x27;t be beat.....thanks to ebay I&#x27;m set...</li>
            <li> I recently purchased one of these safety razors and I have to say I am very impressed with how nice it looks and well it functions. I decided to try my hand at wet shaving as I&#x27;ve become annoyed at paying for overpriced disposable cartridge razors. I am really amazed at how nice it looks and the craftsmanship appears to be very well made, especially for the price. Has a nice heavy feel and is easy to grip in my hand. The weight of it is heavy and feels perfect in my hand. This razor gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with only one tiny nick at the base of my nose but I suppose that isn&#x27;t bad considering the location, not to mention the fact that it was my first time using a double edge safety razor. Some reviewers said they had problems with their razors coming loose while shaving, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with mine so maybe it&#x27;s just them not using theirs properly. I would definitely recommend this razor to anyone looking for a quality razor at an economical price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;classact72</li>
            <li> back to the Fusion blades</li>
            <li> Completely usless.  The blade doesn&#x27;t even extend out far enough to touch the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Like trying to shave without a blade.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a year, and I am still using this</li>
            <li> Do Not Buy This Razor If You Want To Shave. If you need it for a shadowbox or a stage prop, fine. The shave you get will burn and bleed.</li>
            <li> works much better than any disposable no more nicks on the face, I would recommend this to everyone I know</li>
            <li> Love it! Going to save me alot of money in the long run! Will refer it to all my friends and family!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing fancy but does what you want it to.  It has enough heft that you can get a good shave without added pressure.  The clamping bit does a good job keeping things still and steady.</li>
            <li> bring back the old high quality constucion with good razor blades the shaver cant be beat . I have one of my own</li>
            <li> Guide was bent... not a very good design...get the $2.50 Chinese one.. it&#x27;s great...I had no problems returning this item</li>
            <li> Old time shaver fo0r an old time guy.</li>
            <li> The razor was a gift for a friend. Only problem is , he is having a hard time finding blades locally.</li>
            <li> this was a gift from me to my son and husband for christmas.  my husband still prefers disposable, but my 17 year old son really really likes it a lot.  I gave him a 50 pack sample of razors to try with it as well.</li>
            <li> I prefer this style of razor over all the more modern disposable blades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. One blade lasts much longer than the multi-blade gillete fusion cartridges I was spedning a small fortune on. It also gives no irritation what so ever. This razor requires a little practice to get a hang of. I suggest any novice (such as I was) to do some research online on how to use one. Shaving with a safety razor is different from a cartridge or disposable razor. You will definately want a shaving brush and soap bowl or mug. If you&#x27;re looking for a truly enjoyable shave with great results, this is the razor for you. It&#x27;s pretty well built and seems reliable. I&#x27;ve already recouped the small expense for this razor and a pack of blades (doesn&#x27;t come with any) vs. the cartridges I was buying in just one month. You&#x27;ll also save money by using [shaving] soap instead of cream or gel. It does take a little bit longer shave this way, but the results are still great. I used to have a pretty bad five o&#x27;clock shadow by lunch time, now I can shave the night before and actually don&#x27;t feel like I need a touch up before the day is over. I can&#x27;t think of any reason someone wouldn&#x27;t prefer a safety razor over those irritating and expensive cartridge or disposable razors. STOP reading and click &#x27;add to cart&#x27; already!</li>
            <li> My husband loves his new razor, &amp;#34;fantastic&amp;#34; is how he describes it, he won&#x27;t go back to plastic shaving razors ever again.</li>
            <li> Great first safety razor. As some others have stated if you tighten the blade holder too much one of the &amp;#34;flaps&amp;#34; will come off, but it is easily able to be reinstalled. I will never go back to Gillete.  Safety razors give a closest shave (can be too close if you know what I mean there in a learning curve)</li>
            <li> Cut my face first time, just too light. Used to it now, works fine. six more words required o k.</li>
            <li> The razor works fine so far (I used it already several days) and I would say it is a great opportunity as a first razor</li>
            <li> Learn how to use this razor! Works different and better than todays razors. Take your time and buy a Steptic pencil! Once you get used to it complete your retro shave with the old fashioned soap and mug and good quality shaving brush.</li>
            <li> I just received this razor and have to say I was extremely surprised. The razor is a bit light, but well constructed. The gates are a bit loose when open but when closed hold the blade very tight. The surprising part is that it comes in a wonderful hard plastic travel case with a small mirror inside. I would highly recommend this razor especially if you&#x27;re looking for something to travel with. A wonderful purchase with a terrific price!</li>
            <li> Same Close shave as the more expensive models.  Well built and worth every Cent!  No more Cheap Plastic Razors!  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my father and he said it works great and he now knows where to get this type razor with the hassle of going to search at store</li>
            <li> Nice looking razor, the little doors open up on top to put the blade in perfect. Unfortunately I closed them up gently and started shaving, so far so good felt nice then ouch! The thing cut me and again, looked at the unit and one end of the little doors on top had popped out, I opened the doors and it pinged (yes pinged) off. I had to put it back together so I could try and finish but it never shaved the same after that. Real shame as I liked it, have to say the case it came in was very cheap and trashy looking. I have returned it and awaiting a refund from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: seller Beauty Supply 4less refunded me for this unit but short changed me around $5 so had to send e-mails to them pointing it out and now have my money so be aware.</li>
            <li> Came in good time,simple shaver,good weight,cleans easy,good buy,.It looks like stainless steel I hope it is as duriable, time will tell about the screw drive.</li>
            <li> Good value used on vacation</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not paying for those 5 blades because one blade does the job better for pennies, good razor saves me a lot of money</li>
            <li> Brought back the good old days.. I enjoy using this. I only cut my self twice.. The doctor said they would heal</li>
            <li> Excellent weight, nice smooth roller opening mechanism. I have been using it now for several months and it has not started to deteriorate after daily shaving (and sometimes twice per day).</li>
            <li> Not worth the price; I had expected an adjustable razor like I used to have. But this new item is fixed and thus, not what I had desired.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy, well built. Great everyday razor. Comes with a nice case for traveling. Does a superb job on the face.</li>
            <li> I wish the handle was an inch or so longer. I have big hands and long fingers, so I wish it was a little more heavy duty.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have never used a double edge razor before.  I got this one and didnt know what to expect.  It was cheap, and that is why I bought it.  I didnt want to invest in alot of money for something I would never use.  I used this razor today and my face feels great!  There isnt alot of weight with this razor, but again that is because it is cheap.  I plan to use this for a few weeks as I learn to shave with it.  Then I am going to get a nice expensive one to use that has alot of weight to it.  I would recommend anyone use this razor if they have never used a safety razor before.  Thanks for offering this product.  I do think this razor will become a travel razor once I get a new one.</li>
            <li> I tried the razor several times with Astra blades with no satisfaction. Possibly a different brand blade would improve.</li>
            <li> not adjustable just a cheap razor added in to a kit ....... cuts if you dont watch out or held at the wrong angle ......buy a adjustable its better .....more money but worth not the cut......</li>
            <li> Sure it&#x27;s not the best, but you&#x27;re not PAYING for the best.  I&#x27;m very happy with it and the case is a nice edition, even if it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> Old fashion razor that I like.  I was expecting at least one blade to come with it. There were none.</li>
            <li> Great Introductory Razor and would recommend to anyone interested in trying a doubled edged razor. Very affordable and well built razor.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor ! I&#x27;ll never go back to the disposable triple blades !!! Double edge blades shave closer and save a ton of money !</li>
            <li> I was wary of supercheap razors, and did not want to pay a fortune for European razors.  Tried these.  Have had this razor for over a month with no problems.  Good deal.  Far better shave with this than with disposables or electrics.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I was tired of disposable razors.  This razor is just what I wanted.  I feel it is very eco friendly and is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I wanted something cheap to try this whole SR thing out vs extremely expensive cartridge shaving.  Seems to be really good but don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  The weight of it is enough and the mechanics work as expected.  The blades fit perfectly.  The case it comes in is decent and has a little mirror that I guess you could use in emergencies.  Only problem is the handle can get a little slippery when wet but I have never dropped it or anything.  I will probably stick with this one for a year or two until i am a pro at this shaving thing and then look to a merkur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say this, I will never go back to cartridge shaving.  The cost difference is incredible, The shave is better to.  Take your time learning, watch some you tube videos.  Dont push down!  Let the weight do the work.  This is the biggest difference. I made this mistake the first time, even knowing not to push and bled because I probably took skin with it.  Not a cut, just blotchy bleeding.  You really just have to let it glide.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because it this is the type of razor my Grandfather used. It is so easy to use, it dosent cut or pull. I get a smooth shave every time I use it. I also like it because it is cheaper and more stylish than disposable razors.</li>
            <li> If you are not experienced with a DE razor get an adjustable one. This model is OK for someone that has been using a DE for a while. Adjustables may cost a bit more but the feel is great.</li>
            <li> I had purchased the razor as a cheap easier solution than the big name brand one. I really don&#x27;t have to shave often but when I do its a lot easier. The biggest issue I have while shaving is the razor filling up with hair and it seems impossible to clean out and continue shaving. All I have to do with this one is to open it up a bit, run it under water, nice and clean.</li>
            <li> Was looking forward to using this, the head is plastic, was broken in half on delivery, heard the rattling in the package when I picked it up, didn&#x27;t think anything till I opened up the box, (the box itself was unbroken) and found the razor in pieces. At least I get a full refund for sending it back, no option for replacement.</li>
            <li> This razor is good for those who wants to cut their faces  PERIOD.  It is a cheap piece of s*** and * * * WARNING THE PUBLIC * * *  DO NOT BUY THIS S***.</li>
            <li> This is just a little heaver than my old one but then that may just be me.  I&#x27;ve had both the twist open type here and the very old unscrew the handle and disassemble the razor type.  It&#x27;s not like the cheep multi-blade razor of today.</li>
            <li> I bought this as my first razor and it seemed quite good. The Butterfly handle works fine; it was made well, and I always got a good shave from it. I tried various blades and cut myself somewhat with about half the blade brands. I thought I was just not that good at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then my daughter bought me an Edwin Jagger razor for around $40. Yes it was 3x the price, but it is heavier, made of smoother metal (which I didn&#x27;t think possible, the Shaving Factory one seemed fine) and now I almost NEVER cut myself shaving, not even with the sharper blades that I thought I just couldn&#x27;t tolerate. The shave is smoother than ever, no cuts, and the Shaving Factory one, unfortunately, feels almost as light to me now as a disposable, even though it&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To summarize: I liked this until I tried what many have said is the best; and when we&#x27;re talking 2-digit number prices; it&#x27;s worth spending $40 vs $13. I wish it weren&#x27;t true, but it is.</li>
            <li> First thing for buyers: It&#x27;s made in China. I am not exaggerating here: as I was opening the blue plastic &#x27;&#x27;travel container&amp;#34; the razor slid out and a piece fell onto the floor. That piece was one of the clamps that holds the blade in place while you are using it. It fell off the razor while I was unpacking it! That was a bad omen. After some effort I was able to get it back in place. (I hope it stays.) When I placed the order I thought about paying $20 more for the German Merkur razor handle but opted for this $13 one. That was my mistake. When you calculate how long you will use the razor (years), the price differential becomes meaningless. I am begging you, spend a little more up front. I have used it just once and it held together. Not having to make a trip to the ER was a pleasant surprise, given that it fell into pieces during unpacking. I won&#x27;t be cast as Tony for &amp;#34;Scarface II&amp;#34; anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to go with a double-edge handheld razor because 3, 4, and 5-blade disposable cartridges  have become obscenely expensive. 10 cartridges for my Gillette Sensor are $20... at Walmart! I did get a close shave with this shaver with no blood shed.</li>
            <li> I use this razor every morning to shave. It works very well and seems to be constructed very well. I like the flip open doors for changing the blade.</li>
            <li> If you are looking into DE shaving, this razor does exactly what you need without killing your wallet. The design is much better than the 3 piece DE razors since they have a tendency of stripping the threads out of the head. The opening doors of this razor are pretty tight, although you&amp;#34;ll probably end up tightening the handle before each shave to make sure you don&#x27;t knick yourself with a slip.</li>
            <li> I got this razor and it was broken into a few pieces inside the box.  After looking at it I could see how cheaply it was made.  It is going back and I just bought an old Gillette brand razor that is very well made.  Save your money and buy a real Gillette on Ebay</li>
            <li> I bought this for a friend who wants to get into proper shaving. I personally use a shavette, and he wants to start easy so I suggested that he start with a safety razor to get used to using a single blade. This product was well packaged. Does what is advertised, and my friend says it works great!</li>
            <li> I am getting back into wet shaving after using an electric razor for many years. The razor is well-built, and its well-balanced for shaving with light pressure. For anyone looking for a well-built razor, I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe the hype, it was a blood bath! I was cut in 13 places! I haven&#x27;t had such a bad shave in 40 years!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for beginner wet shavers. I had another brand of comparable price (actually more expensive) that did not perform nearly as well. Where as getting nicks was a common occurrence with my previous razor, I&#x27;ve only received two very minor nicks with this razor over the past month of every day shaving. One suggestion I&#x27;ll make is to always store the razor with the head flaps up after every shave. I had to replace my first razor because I couldn&#x27;t get the flaps up to replace the blade after a few weeks of mineral (as in my case, hard water), whiskers, and shaving cream build up. The same thing almost happened to this razor after a few days. Subsequent online research has taught me that this is a common problem with using safety razors in general.</li>
            <li> Works great&lt;br /&gt;Have to be careful after using safety razors all these years but it gives a good close shave.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to all who shave</li>
            <li> A good razor except for one fact. The handle is too small. But the overall razor is very sturdy. Sure wish the handle was about two inches longer.</li>
            <li> Not a good shave. Not what I remember pf double-edge unless it&#x27;s the blade quality. Not ready to toss it yet, I&#x27;ll try other blades first.</li>
            <li> The razor came but no blades. In the picture it shows 5 razor blades.  Did not happen no blades.&lt;br /&gt;This is a false advertising.  Where are the blades.&lt;br /&gt;This is a disappointment to me everything I have ever ordered from Amazon was correct.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed in Amazon.</li>
            <li> I came to own this razor because it was erroneously sent to me by a seller who kept insisting it was the same as the Weishi 9306-f that I ordered. (It definitely is not the same, and likely is made by a different Chinese manufacturer, Mingshi; the Mingshi and Shaving Factory razors and travel cases appear identical except for branding.)    The Shaving Factory (SF) razor&#x27;s construction is chrome plate over unspecified metal(s). The chrome plating seems high quality with no apparent defects. Some have speculated stainless steel underneath, but I doubt that because one wouldn&#x27;t chrome over stainless, plus it&#x27;s a more difficult metal to stamp or cast than more common razor materials including common steel, brass, and aluminum.    The razor weighs 49 g, which is an adequate weight for a good shave. The handle is 3-1/2 inches long, which is a bit generous for a standard twist-to-open (TTO) razor. However, the handle has subtle fluting with a smooth finish, which makes it a bit slippery at times; this is not the best design decision by the makers.    I only have a sample size of one razor, but mine arrived with a manufacturing defect in that one of the double edges of the blade acquires a hump-shaped curve when the razor doors are closed. DE-blade edges are supposed to be dead straight, and any warp to the edge is a formula for a harsh shave at best. I was able to correct this problem by using jewelry pliers to slightly re-shape the defective door, which corrected the problem but damaged the chrome a bit. Too early to tell if there are any long-term consequences.    With straight blade edges, this razor doesn&#x27;t shave badly. The blade position is moderate, seeming to be a more aggressive than a Merkur Classic or Lord L6.    The doors open adequately for easy blade changing (one other TTO razor model, by contrast, doesn&#x27;t open quite enough, making blade changing a bit awkward).    Also, a tip about inexpensive TTO razors: you may get more durability if you oil the TTO mechanism periodically (let mineral oil drops run down the center post of the open razor head -- I do this to all my TTO razors, even the vintage Gillette). Then treat the mechanism gently. Gorilla force is likely to damage small, delicate parts.    Because of the less-than-ideal handle texture -- making for an occasionally-insecure grip -- and the unacceptable blade alignment, I can give this razor only three stars AT BEST.     Also, I have taken the razor out of my shaving rotation and put it into the closet -- perhaps as a loaner to friends wanting to try DE-safety-razor shaving. Reason? The shave is a bit too harsh (due to razor, not blade) and the handle is just too darned slippery! Near drops and the imprecision of a slippery razor twisting in my fingers takes away too much of the pleasure of my morning shave ritual. As a TTO alternative, consider the Weishi 9306-f, which is a little less expensive, is chrome over brass, can give a good shave although it is very mild/non-aggressive, and has a great texture on the handle. Check out my review of this razor on amazon, or go to ShaveLikeGrandad[dot]blogspot[dot]com for a more detailed review with photos. IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN, better to consider the Merkur models 15C or 33C or the Lord L6 head, which is their model LP1822L.</li>
            <li> Looks very cheep . Nothing like what my grandpa had in his time. very flimsy. Not happy but it&#x27;ll do</li>
            <li> nothing to write to mom about…. does the job… kinda of basic finish and tuff to load the blade in…</li>
            <li> fairly good razor handle narrow though hard to hold with large hands easy to us though its hard to control .</li>
            <li> I am tired of paying exorbitant prices for the three and four bladed razor blades and still getting a less than close shave so I am going back to my shaving beginnings fifty years ago when I was sixteen.  Bought this razor and 100 double edge blades and I should be good for quite a while.  Stopped buying Aramis, too and am now using Old Spice and smelling like the common old man I am.  I hate to shave anyway so I may as well get a good close shave for a lot less money.  Funny how a man finally calms down as he grows older.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected . It&#x27;s only good for side burns but hey for that price it&#x27;s all right .</li>
            <li> This is the first safety razor I ever bought and I am extremely satisfied with it. I have had it a month and I&#x27;ve had zero problems with it. I know most people recommend Merkur razors, but this thing shaves about as close as a straight razor. I have nicked myself, but less than I did with cartridge razors. I&#x27;m sure the $30 safety razors are better, but this gets the job done remarkably well. Again, I&#x27;ve had no problems. If you&#x27;re a newby and thinking about switching from cartridge razors, buy this razor. You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Like most guys, I started razor shaving with the free Gillette razor that they send to you when you turn 18 and have tried just about all the other razor combinations, 2, 3, 5 blades, and even vibrating handles. I love the simplicity of the safety razor and not to mention the cost effectiveness of doing so. It took all of one time shaving to get the hang of this razor and the correct angle to hold the blade against your face. I can&#x27;t compare this razor to more expensive model but I went with the reviews that others gave, stating that this one holds its own compared to higher priced choices. As other have suggested, I use Feather brand blades and find them to be consistent quality, very sharp and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Part of it is plastic and when i was rinsing and tapping on the edge of the sink a piece broke off.</li>
            <li> functional and gets the job done,quality leaves a little to be desired but for the price who can complain .</li>
            <li> Good for the beginner to wet shaving. Not as good as old Gillette Razors. For the price you can&#x27;t expect it to be any better.</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for I am delighted with it, I should  not have changed to the twin blade and thrown out my double edge rasor. After my operation they cut the nerves on both sides of my face and now my face is so sensitive this Razor and Shave Secret gives a smooth shave with out hurting.</li>
            <li> Hefty razor, handle could be a little long but nice to get back to the old fashion way of shaving using brush and soap dish.  Will save money by using double edge blades. I get a real good shave and so far not nicks or cuts.</li>
            <li> Please understand that I have not used the razor yet I&#x27;m only going on the way it appears to be put together. it&#x27;s not extremely sturdy but it&#x27;s alright (which would be three stars by there rating system) by my thought it would only get one and a half based only on the build alone.</li>
            <li> This razor is relatively well made for something around twelve dollars. I thought it was okay, but it was only the first safety razor I had ever used. After buying an old gillette for six bucks, I compared the two for a month. What did I find? The shaving factory razor was too light and difficult to balance. Worse, while the blade angle isn&#x27;t necessarily too mild, I couldn&#x27;t get a close shave without applying some pressure (again a balance issue). It led to lots of razor burn and cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely think safety razors are the way to go. For the beginner, I would recommend shopping around for an old razor online or at an antique shop. Otherwise, spring the extra cash for a new $30-40 razor that will last for the rest of your life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to use this razor, and I like my friends too much to give it to any of them.</li>
            <li> What a treat it is to be shaving with a double edge safety razor again.  It was what I learned to shave with when I started to shave and what was issued to me when I joined the Army.  I have to say the Shaving Factory safety razor is a very good product.  I received it a couple of weeks ago and have been using the razor daily with great results.  The razor is nicely balanced and has enough weight to make the shave comfortable (unlike some of the disposable razors I have used). If you have never used a safety razor or have been away from it for a while you may find that this type of razor is a bit less forgiving than say a Trac II or similar razor as far as nicks go but, once you get used to the pull of the razor you should notice a better shave. I chose the &amp;#34;Derby Extra&amp;#34; double edged blades and they work well with this razor.  This may be the last razor I&#x27;ll ever buy, at least as long the double edged blades are still made.</li>
            <li> I have seen items of this quality for about twice the price. I am very impressed with this razor, so impressed that I purchased 4 others to give as gifts (and one more for myself as a back up :)</li>
            <li> was expecting a better shave. this razor is not great.. and is not bad. it did the job. i thought it would give a closer smoother shave. but it was acceptable.</li>
            <li> I left my razor at my apartment when I was traveling over the holidays and ordered this one to fill the gap.  I have shaved four times with it and have always cut myself since the lightness of the razor forces me to press down more than I have liked.  If you&#x27;re looking to start safety razor shaving or looking for a good razor please spend a little more money and buy something a little more high quality.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the build of this razor, just the design in general.&lt;br /&gt;This is a skin slicer.  If you are used to a safety razor, don&#x27;t even think of getting this.&lt;br /&gt;I had hundreds of little cuts.  It and 100 blades went into the trash.</li>
            <li> Could be a little sturdier but no issues. Decent price for entry into using a tradtional razor. Its all metal just seems a little light.</li>
            <li> It broke after using it four times. The movable top popped off while i was shaving.I couldn&#x27;t reattach it and when i tried the stem also broke.It went right into the garbage. I first started shaving years ago with a safety razor and that&#x27;s all I used until the cartridge razors came into being. The best shave IS with an old fashioned double edge razor, however, I suggest getting a good one that will last for years. You&#x27;ll save plenty on using the double edge blades. Don&#x27;t skimp on the razor</li>
            <li> My husband says the original is the best for a nice close shave.  The blades are soo much cheaper then the razors offer.  We had to order the acutual razor, but well worth it.  Great product.  Very prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> Very functional and easy to use for the price.  I am hoping I can continue to get good service out of this Razor.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this razor! He no longer get razor burn when he shaved and is willing to shave more often! We both win.</li>
            <li> This razor is not as smooth as my Bic disposibles.  Handle seems to short.  Not going to be using it.</li>
            <li> These safety razors are  the best for a guy&#x27;s shaving needs.&lt;br /&gt;This little razor gives me a better shave than any of the fancy&lt;br /&gt;four blade razors or electric shavers on the market today.&lt;br /&gt;And the twin blades cost a fraction less than the fancy multiple&lt;br /&gt;Blade razors.&lt;br /&gt;I love it !!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W.Boggs ..... Brewster, Wa.</li>
            <li> My father does not like &amp;#34;new technology&amp;#34; so he was used to the older type razors. I actually got him this and he loves it! Great item from here! Keep my father happy cause I could not find it nowhere to save my life.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s everything i expected plus.  i was tired of the new type razors and them not doing the job i wanted, ilooked for and found your razor and am well pleased with everything about it.  thank you so much</li>
            <li> best shave I&#x27;ve had&lt;br /&gt;Takes some learning to use because of its closeness. worth the effort&lt;br /&gt;give it a try</li>
            <li> Was looking for an affordable safety razor and this product fit the bill perfectly.  Not interested in spending anything over $15.  This product has a great feel to it and comes in a case that has a mirror attached to the inside of the case.  Great weight and feels good in hand.  Fits great in m Dopp kit as an added bonus.</li>
            <li> Straight abd to the point with basic info on fish holding lakes, helped plan the backpacling route but have not taken the trip yet.</li>
            <li> The shaver is satisfactory but the more expensive shavers may be of higher quality.  The Derby blades do not measure up to the Personna blades.</li>
            <li> One of the butterfly sides broke with the FIRST usage! I have had to bend, force, squeeze to get it back in position. However, even if this did not happen this razor would not last very long. Very cheap metal was used, although not made of plastic it is still very light. I am using it and will do so until I locate a better razor. The angle to hold the razor at is acceptable and does work. How long until it breaks again, unknown. Just hope it does not do it when actually shaving around my juggler.</li>
            <li> I have not actually bought this Shaving Factory razor, but I believe that I have bought the razor. It appears to be the exact same razor as the Mingshi razor that I bought last week. Same identical razor and blue box pictured, but just with a different name. The factory in China may have manufactured it for several different distributors. At any rate, it is a good razor. Not the top of the line as far as quality and workmanship, but for the price, it is impressive. It will never be a Merkur or an Edwin Jagger razor, but then, if you are satisfied with a razor at this much lower price, it will serve you well. The only drawback for me, is that I prefer the solid feel and non-moving parts of a three piece razor, over a butterfly opening one, such as this one. Moving parts are something that may wear out eventually. Be advised, that this razor is very aggressive. Use light strokes, and a brush and soap if you have that available. And you will get a close shave, and shouldn&#x27;t have any cuts or irritation, if you take your time and enjoy the shaving experience. I usually follow up with a shave balm made by mixing a spot of body lotion with Old Spice aftershave, and enjoy the baby butt smooth face all day long.</li>
            <li> This handy thing have saved me hundreds of dollars on mach 3 razors. BUT, when placed in the blue case, the razor develops rust.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say anything bad about it besides it is a little on the light side. I&#x27;ve only given myself one small knick shaving with this product so far, and it was while shaving over a pimple (yes I&#x27;m 30 and still get acne, FML).  It will clog up on you if you are shaving a few days worth of growth, but hit your face with a buzzer first like an intelligent human being and you won&#x27;t have that problem. I like the box it comes in and has a mirror if you want to go camping or something (who really shaves when their camping though?). I&#x27;d buy it again, but may go with a higher quality/heavier build next time.</li>
            <li> I made the swap from canned shaving cream to soap and a brush about two years ago in an effort to eliminate waste--and I never turned back.  Moving to a safety razor seems like the next rational step.  Because I didn&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on a new type of razor without trying it first--and because I didn&#x27;t want to wait--I purchased this razor locally about a week ago, and have shaved with it twice.  It has inspired me to move forward on purchasing a higher-quality razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this razor a solid three stars, simply because the pro&#x27;s outweigh the con&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;S:&lt;br /&gt;  As with any double-edge safety razor, the cost is MUCH lower for replacement blades than a standard cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;  There is A LOT less waste material at the end of a blade&#x27;s life.  Instead of a mass of plastic, there&#x27;s a thin sliver of steel that can be recycled.  Just remember to take care in storing used blades.&lt;br /&gt;  I got the CLOSEST shave I&#x27;ve ever had--in fact, maybe too close!  This razor gave me the worst razor burn/rash I&#x27;ve ever had during the first shave.  I really can&#x27;t blame the razor, though.  I am new to shaving with this kind of razor, and have only tried one brand of blade.  I gather that there are a lot of variables to safety razors, and a bit of technique to using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;  This particular razor is clearly cheaply made--but what can you expect for a 12-dollar version of an item that generally costs $30-50 for an entry-level model.  Don&#x27;t expect it to last a lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;  This razor is a bit on the aggressive side--see the razor burn statement above!  You could see the difference in blade gap between the two edges of the razor, which I gather is not a good thing.  I doubt it has the precision of a more-expensive unit.&lt;br /&gt;  It doesn&#x27;t have the weight that I remember my grandfather&#x27;s safety razor having. This is important because the weight of the shaving head is supposed to do the work without the application of manual pressure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m torn on whether or not I would recommend this razor to a friend.  While it is a less-expensive alternative when experimenting with wet shaving, the aggressiveness of the razor (and resulting rash) could scare off a less adventurous person.  I&#x27;ve made the decision to step up the game, rather than get out.e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m torn on whether or not I would recommend this razor to a friend.

            <li> Love this thing always had a problem with bumps so I went for one of these cleared me up good and its a very good shave.</li>
            <li> Best Safety Razor - great price !</li>
            <li> Works well arrived on time</li>
            <li> Why buy expensive multi-blade razors when a double edge single blade is very effective and works great. Simple and inexpensive and works.</li>
            <li> The safety razor is what I first used on my adolescent “peach fuzz” beard 60 years ago. Back in the 1950s the “state of the art” was the Gillette “blue blade”. It was carbon steel and one blade lasted 2 shaves, maximum. In the early 1960s Gillette came out with the stainless steel blade and virtually doubled the quality and durability of the safety razor experience. Much technology and metallurgy has been directed at the shaving market since. Gillette, Schick, Wilkinson and others have spent billions on R&amp;D, “clinical” trials and advertising in an effort to win both male and female blade-shaver customers. Concurrently the Remingtons, Norelcos and others have developed and touted the electric alternatives to beard and “stubble” control. As a seasoned citizen I have tried them all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the electric shaver a fair trial for more than a few years. It was OK, but it never delivered the “clean”, stubble-free result that a blade would give me. For about 20 years I was a Gillette “Good News” disposable shaver user. It gave me close shaves and the kind of control I had with the old safety razor. I never liked the pivoting-head disposable razors because I could not control the angle of the blades on my beard. The only drawbacks to the Good News blade were the “clog” factor (need to flush repeatedly) and the inability to get a tight (under the nostrils) shave… without “digging” and perhaps nicking my upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About 2 years ago I ditched aerosol shaving cream I had been using for about 45 years. I yearned for the “barber shop” soap cup lather and straight razor luxury that my Dad and Grand Dad used to speak of so fondlyf. I bought the badger bristle brush and Taylor-of-old-Bond-Street soap disk from Amazon and have thoroughly enjoyed the transition from aerosol mediocrity. I recently made the final change to get back to the 50s “barber shop” luxury I craved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The safety razor is not to be treatedcasually by the inexperienced user. It’s as close as you can get to a straight razor and, consequently, needs some respect one may not give to the disposable units available. AGGRESSIVE is an understatement when describing the safety razor’s action on your beard. My 72 year-old cheeks are thinner and more sensitive than my 20 year-old cheeks were. A “nick” while shaving today can be a 2 hour bleeding event. The safety razor could trigger a 911 call if I was not really careful. But I can report that this safety razor has transported me back to the 50s. My shaves are now nostalgic events that evoke the wonderful bloom of my youth. The “icing” on the cake is achievable with Bay Rum after shave… Go for it!</li>
            <li> I bought one just like this for like 3 dollars on here, but after waiting a month I never got it so Amazon gave me my money back. I knew I would get this one with Amazon prime. I don&#x27;t see how some razors go for a good amount of money, but it&#x27;s my first safety razor and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t come with any blades though. I bough the durby pack of 100 and I am getting a better shave every time I use it as I am getting use to shaving without it. I think this is a good place to start for safety razors.</li>
            <li> Got this because I was tired of the disposable nonsense I&#x27;d been using.  Also the wife won&#x27;t use it on her legs.  Solid unit.  Cleans easy, comfortable grip.  A great value.</li>
            <li> This razor gives great results ( according to my husband ) when I feel his face after a shave it is very smooth so it must be true and for a bargain price you can&#x27;t beat it !</li>
            <li> I switched to this razor and after one shave I noticed my skin wasn&#x27;t as irritated as it was with the disposables. This is a strong razor and holds the blades perfectly in place. It also has a good solid feel to it, it doesn&#x27;t feel cheap.</li>
            <li> This razor is garbage.The body  of the handle is coming of very easily, so do not waste your money in this razor.</li>
            <li> great razor ...use it everyday.  Saves a lot of money.  I do not know why we ever switched to these new ones with multiple blades.</li>
            <li> It performs as advertised; it is easy to use and nice to handle.  With the right razor blade this razor performs very well and a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I will NEVER buy a &amp;#34;multi-blade&amp;#34; razor again.  Not after feeling how smooth a single double edge razor cuts.  I still use my regular shave cream out of a can (haven&#x27;t gone &amp;#34;all-in&amp;#34; and bought any &amp;#34;stir it in a bowl&amp;#34; cream of any kind) but this is a really smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;For the price of one pack of multi disposables, you can buy this shaver AND a one hundred pack of blades.  I figure at the rate I shave, and considering I&#x27;ve been using this ONE blade for about 3 weeks now, I will get about 100 MONTHS out of this combo.  That is a lot longer than what I would get out of the disposables.  Yes, Im &amp;#34;hooked&amp;#34;,  safety razor for me all the way!!!</li>
            <li> This is a very cheap razor. I ordered 6 and. 3 were broke from shipping alone.  Spend a few more dollars and buy an Edwin James or a Merkur - get quality.  Thus should not be your first shaving experience.</li>
            <li> When my husband got this he really liked it ,it shaved well the  dropped and broke a part very cheap made .</li>
            <li> The razor itself doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as well-made as some others I&#x27;ve used, not holding the blade quite as evenly or firmly. It made it a much more difficult experience to shave, taking the experience from something in line with a Mach 3 down to something like a single blade Bic dry shaving. The case is definitely convenient though.</li>
            <li> The razor itself isn&#x27;t bad; but as mentioned by a few others I would like a longer handle and will upgrade to another. The insertion of blades is easy as pie and very easy to clean and maintain. I would recommend for someone just starting with the safety razors just to see if you like it; it&#x27;s inexpensive enough to try it out before investing in a more expensive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paired this with some Derby blades; the only thing to watch out for is the pressure and angle your shaving with; you want to have the metal grooves sliding over first; then the blade, if you hit blade first you will get knicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor -great value- save on shaving with this razor and a pkg.&lt;br /&gt;of double edge blades. Nice packing and carry case with mirror</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for a friend to learn to shave with and he likes it . comes with a nice travel case.</li>
            <li> LOOK, IT IS A GREAT PRICE, TIME PROVEN, NO ELECTRICITY NEEDED, IT ISN&#x27;T DISPOSABLE, TAKES VERY LITTLE WATER,&lt;br /&gt;BLADES ARE A GREAT BUY, AND IT WILL LAST FOREVER OR IT WILL OUT LAST YOU.  PLUS, IT IS USER FRIENDLY, FIELD TESTED (LITERALLY), AND EASY TO USE.  WHAT MORE NEEDS TO BE SAID.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my dad.  After getting used to the razor he really likes it.  He did purchase separate blades that were of higher quality.</li>
            <li> I found it to be what i was expecting. The last one i had, I lost it. I am enjoying it very much. It takes me back to my dad.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try an inexpensive safety razor that uses traditional double-edged razor blades.  This one actually works better than I expected.  Some of the moving parts may seem a little bit loose or slightly misaligned, but when there is a blade in the mechanism it can be clamped down tightly so the blade bends to the correct angle and is held securely in place.  The carrying case is also good to have for storage or travel.</li>
            <li> He said he liked the razor, however, I felt it was chintzy of you not to include a packet of blades to go along with the razor.  This was the first time for him to use a safety razor.  As far as recommending the razor to someone else, that would have to be up to the one I gave it to.</li>
            <li> Got it for a friend who used to buy those ugly Costco bags with like a zillion disposable plastic razors, he uses it and he likes it; why did I get it for him?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Friends don&#x27;t let friends use plastic disposable razors&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The base is too heavy and the construction of the razor is below par.Even with a brand new blade it does not work as it is supposed to work.</li>
            <li> It i s exactly what I was looking for and it exceeded my expectations. I am getting more shaves now per blade than my last razor gave me!</li>
            <li> For my beard I might as well been using a kitchen knife, horrible razor.</li>
            <li> Great ! as promised !</li>
            <li> I finally got the razor yesterday Thank you. Amazon for sending them so quickly.. finally got a chance to use it last night looks great nice and close shave.</li>
            <li> have used several weeks with no problems. I&#x27;m not sure how to compare to some of the more expensive brands. I&#x27;m happy with this one at this price</li>
            <li> I like how it opens and how it securely holds the blade.  The carrying case is light plastic but appears tough enough for travel.</li>
            <li> Great little razor for the price.  Bought extra blades at the same time.  Delivers a better shave than the disposable variety.  This will save me money in the long run.</li>
            <li> I am quite pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent razor for the money.  I also have a Parker 96R and 99R which are much more aggressive; you have to be more careful with them.  I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and started shaving with a safety razor.  Like many others I got so tired of paying for expensive multi-blade razor cartridges.  I&#x27;m now using Taylor of Old Bond Street Sandalwood and a Tweezerman badger brush and am amazed at the quality of shaves.  It&#x27;s really gotten to be an enjoyable experience!</li>
            <li> I saw a similar razor being sold on TV which is more expensive. This Razor came in a case that has a mirror inside, I assume for travel. I also bought 50 blade for under $4. I was able to shave faster and as close as I ever have before. If stubble begins to clog razor just a half turn on handle, rinse and it&#x27;s like new again. I&#x27;ve been on the same blade for 4 day now, still like new,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor also has a nice solid feel to it, it&#x27;s gonna last me a while, I have no doubt.</li>
            <li> It has nice balance, but I often use the hand towell to open and close.</li>
            <li> With a twist of the handle a new blade is placed in this razor and I go back 50 years... except for the wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Got this for my bf and he loves it.</li>
            <li> I have a German safety razor that cost much more than twice as much but like this every bit as much. I have very large hands and the razor fits just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to be sure the blade is aligned evenly when you tighten it down, but that&#x27;s pretty easily done with a tap of the face of the razor on a counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paired with Derby Extra blades and Shave Secret it provides a great shave for both my son and me. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Razor lasted less that two weeks before the opening and closing mechanism gave up.  You could still open it but when you tried to close it down on a blade it just keeps turning and turning and applies no pressure on the blade anymore.  At least the plastic case can be used for travel since the Merkur 34C fits in it.</li>
            <li> I was sceptical at first, but after it&#x27;s first use, I find it avery good razor at a very affordable price !!</li>
            <li> A very functional razor. Construction is not as tight as Merkur, Edwin Jagger or Feather Polymer DE Razor but useable with care of blade alignment.</li>
            <li> purchased this sshaver never closed properly very poor quality. upgraded to better razor no trouble. recommend not to purchase this shaver poor construction. I returned it!!!</li>
            <li> I like this razor.  It appears to be durable, and the appearance and quality of the metal seem to be right in line with the more expensive safety razors.  Another reason I like it might not be exactly why other people like it.  This is my 3rd safety razor.  I didn&#x27;t know how to use the first one so I sold it, got cut too many times.  Then I got one that resembled a disposable razor, it was plastic, made by \\&quot;Laser\\&quot;.  It was very cheap but I learned how to use a safety razor and rarely cut myself.  The problem with that razor was the shaving soap or cream, along with the discarded cut hair would get caught in the bottom of the razor where the holes are, just beneath the blade.  The holes designed for the cream and discarded hair were too small.  This was not easy to get the residue out of the holes in the razor itself, because running it under the faucet didn&#x27;t work.  You had to manually poke something through the holes and get the residue out.  It was time consuming.  And the residue would also stay on the blade, requiring a good cleaning after each shave.  This razor doesn&#x27;t have that problem.  The holes are big enough to let the residue pass through after you pass it under the faucet.  I have been using it 3 weeks now and haven&#x27;t had to clean the residue from the razor one time.  Sounds silly, but it saves a lot of time after you shave because you don&#x27;t have to clean it.  The actual shave isn&#x27;t as close as a mach 3, but for me none of the safety razors I have used were.  I may not be doing it exactly right, but I don&#x27;t care because I save so much money on blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have been using this razor for almost 2 years now.  I still like it just as much now as I did when I bought it.  The top part that spreads to open for the blade has come off twice, but it was easy to put back together.</li>

            <li> Great razor. Great price.</li>
            <li> Yes it does since I have two razors this one needs a longer handle and it would be better. Having bigger hands makes it a bit more to harder to control.</li>
            <li> I bought this razor because I was tired of spending 30 bucks a pack for Gillette fusion cartridges. Besides wasting money, the Gillette cartridge wastes the environment--chunks of plastic and four or five (one-edge) blades per shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shaving Factory Double Edge Safety Razor is attractive and sturdy. It takes regular razor blades. I just use regular shaving cream and shave as I did before. I barely notice any difference--except I&#x27;m saving money, efficiently cleaning my razor, being a bit more ecologically prudent, and no longer feeling exploited by Gillette (and its conglomerate owner Proctor &amp; Gamble).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone else remember when the first two-bladed razor appeared (Gillette Trac 2, 1971)? Saturday Night Live made fun of their commercial by imagining a three-bladed razor. Now we&#x27;ve got a five-bladed one. I await the Fusion 6 and 7.</li>
            <li> Hubby loves this razor.  Had to get used to the double edge, but now loves it.  Much better bargain and a better shave than all the new razors available on the market, so he tells me.</li>
            <li> This shaver does well, but it is hard to grasp when your hands are wet.</li>
            <li> My husband likes the &amp;#34;Old type razor&amp;#34; better than these new ones.  He says that he gets a closer shave and it is much easier to clean the blade for continued shaving.  The only modification that he made was to rough up the handle with a file so that the razor doesn&#x27;t slip out of his wet and soapy hand during shaving.</li>
            <li> This razor is a very good buy. It was affordable and works as expected. I would recommend it. Note it does not come with blades.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in using a safety razor for the first time, this is a great razor to start with. It&#x27;s well made and a large size to better fit your hand. Not to mention the 10 pack of blades for these razors are a fraction of the price of newer razors. It does however take some time to get used to using a safety razor. You can cut yourself easily if you are not careful. But, it does really shave well and close. Definitely recommend as a purchase.</li>
            <li> I get a much closer shave. My wife would always get me these 3, 4, &amp; 5 blade disposable razors. Years ago during a move my razor like this was misplaced &amp; has never shown up. I remembered the closeness of the shave so I bought this. My order arrived on the date scheduled in an unopened undamaged carton.</li>
            <li> This Razor is made in China,I haven&#x27;t used it so i don&#x27;t know hoe well or crapping it is.I hate amazon&#x27;s 20 word requirement.</li>
            <li> Why spend $110 at the art of shaving. The quality is good and it was inexpensive. Will buy again. Came in 5 days or less</li>
            <li> I had used the Gellett model many years ago.Now with eager anticipation I ordered the Shaving Factory butter fly. It came with a blade. I had order the Merkur long handle 3 piece earlier which is my bench mark for comparison. My primary shaving tool for many years being the Remington 3 head micro screen. The Merkur Rite Aid combination produce acceptable shave no blood.Back to Amazon to check out verity packs and notice the butterfly model. By middle of the first shave I required application of the styptic pencil. The blade angle is very aggressive . Blade exposure along edge may be uneven requiring care when tighten handle.&lt;br /&gt;With a collection of blades, Rite Aide, Wilkinson and Feather I tried something using the Feather having 5 shaves in the Merkur  in the butter fly. I discovered the Shaving Factory with used blades may be used without producing many applications of the styptic pencil. New life for used blades!</li>
            <li> Had this razor for a few weeks now and it&#x27;s been consistently wonderful with each shave. I just got into the traditional wet-shaving scene since I was really quite fed up with the disposable cartridges. I wanted to find an inexpensive safety-razor to see how it compared, and so I decided on this one. Glad I did too, I&#x27;m never going back to those piece-of-crap disposable razors again! Haha, I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll even bother \\&quot;upgrading\\&quot; to a more expensive razor since this one is doing such a fine job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve been using Derby Extra blades and they&#x27;ve been treating my face just fine. I feel I should add that this razor does NOT come with blades, you&#x27;ll have to get them separately. I also like the little carrying case that this razor comes with. And you might as well go ahead and get yourself a shaving brush, a mug and some shaving soap (or cream, as long as it&#x27;s not the aerosol kind). I can&#x27;t begin to tell you all how great it feels compared to the junk in the can.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok razor. Nothing out of this word. Disposable Gillette  razor work better on my skin.</li>
            <li> Fair price, good shaver starter kit, if you will keep up the good work shaving factory!!</li>
            <li> I love it, Not too aggressive for us newbies... Recommend it highly..... First wet razor, travel razor,, 2nd razor just because.... Works great for all of it.... Are there better? Probably. But this one is all you need. But if you are like me, you are just getting started.... It was so easy and perfect, i ended up stepping up for a higher dollar one, mugs, soaps, and foams.... Which I would not have done if, my first experience had not been so good. Put that first 100-200 bucks back in your pocket, spend this $15 bucks with $10!worth of razor blades and you are good for a year. Cant go wrong...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this with crystal razors for over 6 months. Smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had and very little irritation. I get the razor wet all the time and it hasn&#x27;t rusted yet. The case isn&#x27;t spectacular, but the little mirror is helpful sometimes.</li>
            <li> Great little razor.  Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better razor for the price.  Good quality, good balance, and looks good.  If it&#x27;s the first time  you&#x27;ve used a Double Edge (or as in my case Many years since I&#x27;ve used one) this is an excellent starter razor.  Take a step back in time and get a get shave the old way at a very economical price. - Kaleb</li>
            <li> It heavy enough so that when you shave, you don&#x27;t have to apply any extra force on your skin (don&#x27;t! Your shave will quickly turn into a bloody disaster!)</li>
            <li> This is my third attempt on Amazon to replace my shaver.  !!!DO NOT BUY ANYTHING PARKER!!!!! See my other review to see if a Parker could be the right razor for you.  I lost the one I had previosly used for 25 years.  I wanted to cry.  This razor is cheap, sturdy, light, regular size, cuts very well, opens/closes easily and best of all when you tighten it, you can change the angle of the cut!  I still want to punch a wall in exasperation at how much I paid for other razors.  BEWARE price means nothing in razors, a good/bad one can be cheap/expensive. ***** WHOO HOO this comes with a handy traveling case BONUS GOODIE!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Love JR Have a nice day!</li>
            <li> I saw ad and feel positive, but it is not as my expectation. It is heavy and too short handle.</li>
            <li> This my first safety razor, and was pretty happy with it at first. One of the movable parts that holds the blade in fell off while I was shaving. It took some doing, but I got it back on there. Lost a lot of confidence that it would last very long. You always get what you pay for. Just ordered an Edwin Jagger DE89LBL...</li>
            <li> not bad at all, worth the money. use it some and you will see yourself wanting something better. a great price point to decide if you want to invest more in a proper razor. be careful to center the blades while loading or you&#x27;ll be off center and unintentionally reenact the bathroom scene of poltergeist.</li>
            <li> Was very satisfied,.......gives me a shave equal to the expensive multi blade razers......I was spending $16.00 a month on replacement blades........now if I shop around $10.00 is blades should last me at least a year......</li>
            <li> I decided to try shaving with a single edge blade at last. This is a well made razor for a good price.</li>
            <li> When receiving this and inspection it I knew it was not the shaving device I wanted. It is made below standard, and looked that it would fail the passing of time. 1 try with it I found this DE Razor to be uneven and extremely aggressive. Not for me. As an ex-haircutter I am used to quality hand cutting tools so I went another route with a Murker Futur and have a Gillette Slim Boy adjustable.</li>
            <li> I only wish the shaving head was not continuously curved.  Should be flat to align shaving angle.</li>
            <li> had been looking for a double edge for awile now.  have used a few times and love it.  was delivered on time. very happy with this razor.</li>
            <li> I somehow inherited a whole bunch of razors and various packs of blades and cartridges.  I think I have a handle for everything except for an old timey injector razor--the kind that you could really slice yourself with if one of the corners wasn&#x27;t seated correctly.  I even bought a barber straight razor though, with my current eyesight, I don&#x27;t think I plan to get that thing anywhere near my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like using a mug and brush so, a few weeks back, I started to use my dad&#x27;s old double edge blade.  Way back when the Trac II double blade razor came out I had switched to that and then gone to a Sensor and then to three blades and then onward ad astra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dhad assumed that double edge blades would have sort of died out though the local Walgreen&#x27;s here does carry the Gillette 5 pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for single edge blades for my new microtome (see my microtome review) I looked up double edge razors just out of curiosity.  They are evidently far from being dead dinosaurs.  On reflection, one can probably safely assume that most of the second, third, and fourth world countries of the earth probably either still use double edge, cut throat razors, or just let their beards grown to disguise themselves from American drone attacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dad&#x27;s old Gillette double edge worked fine after I got the feel of the thing but I thought I would like a slightly longer handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor:  came promptly and in good condition being well boxed up.  It is very attractive, fairly well made for the money, and comes in a very nice black plastic box that has a small shaving mirror built in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves well enough and is undoubtedly a good deal for the price.  I only gave it four stars in comparison with my dad&#x27;s old Gillette which was, when he bought it, a more expensive item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caution with a double edge is you have to be wary of the blade corners.  You are fairly safe until you start turning the thing on your face.  Slicingback and fourt with any blade in a sawing motion is a big no no with any sharp edge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another caution:  with the butterfly opening type of razor, which this is, make sure the razor is completely closed by giving the bottom of the handle a slight tighten.  After shaving, dad used to open the butterfly and let some hot water from the tap run over the exposed blade though I don&#x27;t know if this is really helpful or standard procedure.  It may have been a holdover on his part from the original blue blades, the kind that rusted.  These blue blades were sharp as the devil but only good for a shave or two and you had to dry them thoroughly to keep them from rusting.  One of the great joys of childhood in the early fifties was to find old rusted blue blades in the trash and then slicing your hands open when you insisted on playing with the damn things. I ran afoul of blades in the trash twice even though I was allowed to carry a razor sharp sheath knife around in the woods when I turned six and never once sliced myself on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shaving.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and it arrived two days sooner than the estimated time. The top was a tad crooked when closed completely, but that took little to no effort fixing. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Like many of the others that have rated this razor, I was looking for an entry level safety razor.  I wanted to determine whether switching to the safety razor was feasible, without investing much money up front.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor exceeded my expectations for such an affordable price.  The areas that the razor excel are:&lt;br /&gt;  - Butterfly opening, so that I don&#x27;t lose my ......components&lt;br /&gt;  - Sufficient heft, so that do not look like I was making out with barbwire&lt;br /&gt;  - Compact design so that I can easily throw it in my travel bag&lt;br /&gt;  - Solid construction, this is also part of the heft, but it can be considered separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a $40 razor, yes, but for a &amp;#60;$20 razor, it is a great product.  And if you are considering joining the manly club, or just looking for a closer shave, this is a great entry razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor does not come with blades or a cleaning brush.  This did not affect my rating, since it was such an affordable purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a while since i used a safety razor.  I purchased what i thought was a  low end orice razor to try it out, and so far i have not lost too much skin.  I am still learning how to best use thi product but i can say that i do like it.</li>
            <li> i ordered this razor for my husband when his razor broke.  he started to talk about growing a beard so i went to amazon and found this razor for him.  he likes it and now he is clean shaven again.  i think i am happier with this razor than he is.  its great.</li>
            <li> I received this razor and used it for the first time last night.  It seems well-made and gave a good shave.  There are a few things you need to know though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  It does not come with blades.  You need to order blades if you don&#x27;t have any.  The type of blade will obviously make a huge difference in how well it works.  Mine were whatever brand Walgreens had as I bought them for the razor I thought I still had (but could not find).&lt;br /&gt;2)  You cannot shave with one of these like you would with a normal cartridge safety razor (like a Fusion, Trac II, etc).  Let the weight of the razor do the work,  Don&#x27;t put any additional pressure on it.&lt;br /&gt;3)  Don&#x27;t expect a Cadillac for the price of a Chevrolet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is an absolute breeze - open the top and rinse off the blade and the razor.</li>
            <li> great razor better than the plastic disposables that wear out very quickly. Had not used one in a very long time and It coms back to you in no time nick or cuts. High quality at a very reasonable cost very easy to use. I may even teach my sons about the advantage of these great products. A steady hand and patience, can&#x27;t rush a great shave.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves well, however the butterfly mechanism loosens with almost every stroke.  One must remember to tighten it down constantly. That gets old fast.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband for his birthday and he loves it.  Much better shave than anything else he was using and very cheap alternative to disposable razors.  It has a nice weight to it and comes with a carrying case that has a small mirror.  Cool little gift.</li>
            <li> This gives a better shave than those expensive, multi-bladed razors.  I got the razor and about a 3 year supply of blades for less than a four pack of my previous quattro refills.  It does take a day or two to get used to, but once you do, you will kick yourself for not making the switch years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend this razor, if you decide you don&#x27;t like it, you are only out a few bucks, but I am sure you will be glad you got it.</li>
            <li> Terrible would not work for my husband.</li>
            <li> My Dad was looking for a &amp;#34;old&#x3D;fashioned, GOOD&amp;#34; razor.  So glad I found one for him! I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor for the price. It gives a close shave if you know how to use one of these. I would suggest newcomers to safety razors watch some youtube videos on how to use it otherwise you might end up with some wicked razorburn</li>
            <li> arrived on time and were of good quality</li>
            <li> Decent quality - had a minor problem with the clamp closing correctly that I fixed with a pair of pliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the switch from the Mach 5 (5 blade razors) because the blades are so ridiculously expensive. Shaving takes about half again as long now because I have to be a lot more careful with the single blade - it is quite easy to cut yourself. The shaves are not as close and it is harder to get in tight stops (like under the nose or against the ears).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I will not be going back to the 5 blades. Comfort wise, the single blade is the same as the five blade with no additional razor burn. The blades are so cheap that I can afford to trade them out every couple weeks rather than trying to push them well over a month like I did with the 5 blades. I&#x27;d recommend this over any expensive multi-blade razor.</li>
            <li> Reminds me of the old days. Got to be careful with them or you&#x27;ll have those &amp;#34;toilet paper&amp;#34; blotters hanging all over your face. Good product and great seller.</li>
            <li> Thought these had been relagated to the dust bin of history. Got sick of high priced cartrige blades and heard from a friend that there is a resurgence in old school double edge wet shaving. Found many online and tis is reasonably low priced and works way better than cartridges. Way cheaper too. If you have no experience with DE shaving there is a learning curve and you can nick yourself. Recommend you tube videos of how to wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor looks expensive but is not.</li>
            <li> My Father use to shave with a Wilkinson double edge razor back in the 1960&#x27;s. I was a little leary at first because of the cuts one can get using this type of razor! When it arrived, I started using it very carefully and I must say that it is the best shave that I have had in years! Just be careful when using this double edge razor! It is quite different than using a Gillette or Schick! DO NOT put pressure on the blade when shaving! Just glide the blade slowly and carefully! Once you perfect it, you will never waste your money on those over priced Quatro blades again!</li>
            <li> Did some research before purchasing my first DE safety razor and after making my head spin with all the information chose this one.  Quality actually better than expected.  Not too light  and not too heavy for my hand.  Opted for the BIC blades and so far not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Like others, I feel the handle is too short. Beyond this, a few weeks in, it is giving a shave that rivals my Gilette Quattro (as evaluated by wife and daughter).  The blades last longer And cost considerably less. My little girl (6 yr old) tells me in e morning that &amp;#34;the black circles are gone, and my face is shiny like hers.  We match.&amp;#34;  While I feel that is being a mite generous, it certainly is good enough.  I was initially concerned about more easily cutting myself, but that has not been an issue at all.  UPDATE: After some time, I am forced to downgrade my initial review to 2 stars.  The handle is some kind of chrome like plating over plastic.  This began to lift over time and became a hazard to cutting fingers when opening or closing the razor.  Additionally, it corroded or something, and became difficult to open or close (increasing the chance of a sliced finger) until it jammed completely.  I finally game up and replaced it with a slightly more expensive Parker that is solid brass.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this. My husband really likes blades like this but this one was awful.</li>
            <li> I went for cheap when I ordered this razor and that&#x27;s what I got.  The razor is flimsy and malfunctioned with my first shave.  I recommend it be taken off the Amazon offerings.  I returned the razor and ordered a Merkur razor.  It is solidly build and gives me a great shave.</li>
            <li> I already used this product and it exceeded my expectations!  I like this type of razor because you don&#x27;t have to throw it away.  You only need to replace the blade thus helping the environment.</li>
            <li> Even though the head looks like its made of metal, i&#x27;m pretty sure its some composite plastic with a shiny finish.  I know this b/c I dropped the razor in the shower (not even a high drop), and the head broke in two.</li>
            <li> It is an ok razor. You definitely have to practice shaving with this thing very carefully if you&#x27;re coming from normal disposable razors. I cut my face up like crazy. Once you get the pressure right, it does a pretty good job. It&#x27;s really good for shaving against the grain once you get the hang of it. Very little catching and pulling, but with the grain isn&#x27;t that great. Overall I&#x27;d say that getting the pack of 100 blades is the best part of the whole thing. I won&#x27;t have to get shaving stuff for like a year now.</li>
            <li> I love this razor.  I can&#x27;t really say much else about it.  However, I do recommend buying it along with some Derby Extra Razors.</li>
            <li> It is a very economical old school razor but shaves like a expensive one. I use it with the Derby blades and it gives me a smooth old school shave. I didn&#x27;t think I would go back to them but I&#x27;m glad I did, great shave low price!</li>
            <li> lots of blood and cuts  does not compare to fusion or any other multi blade shaver&lt;br /&gt;its worth spending more on something that works</li>
            <li> I found going to a razor type that was invented over 80 years ago was worth the investment...very low cost at that.  For less than $12, this is a decent safety razor.  I think the handle length is adequate and the razor is very easy to clean.  I&#x27;m using Personna blades, and I only change the blade once a week....a 100 pack of blades will last almost two years.  So that is around 4 cents a shave (if you shave every day)!  I find the shave to be very close and yes, you may get the occasional nick, but that happens with disposable razors, etc. too.  With a little practice, you&#x27;ll have few if any problems using this type of razor.  No complaints about switching to the &amp;#34;razor of the past&amp;#34;....I like it, and you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> Really liked this razor. It is very easy to use for the first time safety razor user, and it gave a really clean shave! If you are considering switching to safety razors versus disposables, this is the way to go as a starter.</li>
            <li> Cheap and crappy. Chrome plated pot metal as far as I can tell. The chrome plating is a little crappy too. I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I had always used a miltiblade razor and thought I would give this a try...&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t get the results I had hoped for . Not the razors fault . Just not my cup of tea as they say</li>
            <li> Cheap Cheap quality control. The adjuster at the bottom lock up and you cannot get a razor blade in or out of the probably Chinese made piece of metal.....DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL BE VERY SORRY:(</li>
            <li> Works, but not as well as it could. Some of the design is lacking: there&#x27;s a support bar that tends to catch hair just under the middle of both undersides of the blade. In addition, the chrome finish began to come off of my razor after about two months of normal use, cutting me mildly. On the other hand, the included case is okay. I highly recommend springing for the chromed Merkur design instead, it only costs $40 and it has none of these issues.</li>
            <li> This style of razors are a very good fit for me and my brother likes the ones i gave him.I see products that should last and be around for many years because someone decided to take the time and make something that makes others feel good.These razors even come with a holder and a mirror for those who hunt or camp,buy it you will like it for sure.</li>
            <li> The razor is everything I expected it to be.  Best shaves in years. I have friends who say they intend to buy one.  I gave them the Amazon page to find it.</li>
            <li> It has been working fine for me and seems like a good place to start if you want to try shaving with a safety razor. I can say that it seems a little on the no frills side and I have noticed a little oxidation in the assembly already, I haven&#x27;t had any trouble opening and closing it so far and the case is not at all fancy, but it works fine. I will probably just upgrade to a fancier safety razor when and if this one breaks or gets too rusty. I guess I&#x27;ll have to see if the higher end really offers a shaving advantage. I can say that I still prefer my fusion, but don&#x27;t want to spend money on the blades anymore. I would recommend this as a starter for sure.</li>
            <li> Product does what it is advertised to do.  Some questions about the quality of the product because of uneasy closure.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great, as long as you don&#x27;t use too much pressure.  Have been using this razor almost everyday, though I still use others as well to get the closest shaves. I believe differences in the shaving routine help to make a closer shave, even using different razors, and types of razor shaving as many as 5 times, and finishing up with an electric razor.</li>
            <li> Very good razor, very solid and durable, gives a very close smooth shave, very aggressive, so if your a newbie to wet shaving do not buy this and cry and whine! Stay with your mach 3 and stfu!</li>
            <li> Works very well, had to learn to let it glide over my face with almost no pressure but it is great.</li>
            <li> Nice, works just like it should.</li>
            <li> I am enjoying my return to DE shaving with this razor. I considered more expensive razors, but wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like shaving the old fashioned way.  It could be a little longer for my big hands but other than it is doing a great job. It closes tight and holds the blade straight, doesn&#x27;t clog up and rinses clean with ease. Haven&#x27;t experienced a nick since my third shave four months ago. I chose not to experiment with blades but just bought a 100 pack of Personna blades. I get a smooth shave, and with shaving only three or four times a week they will  probably last me ten years.</li>
            <li> The price was great. It&#x27;s a perfect starter razor. Love shaving with this.</li>
            <li> Conservative shave that keeps the blade from niking and cutting for pennies a month. I own another handle that with the same fresh blades slices me usually once each shave. That old one is going in the trash and I am buying another for the Firehouse(homeawayfromhome). I love mine and invite you to become a penney shave club member.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this and would highly recommend it.  Make is solid and well machined.  Finish is high polish SS and chrome.  Perfect size for medium to large hands.  I like the slightly shorter handle because it&#x27;s easier to flip around for the against-grain stroke when necessary.  I have a thick beard I keep in a goatee so I use this to shave cheeks and neck.  I use Feather Hi-Stanless platinum coated blades from Japan and find this shaves much closer than the expensive multi-blade disposable razor I was using.</li>
            <li> good razor smooth shave</li>
            <li> I have shaved with almost every tool made for the daily chore. For the last five years I settled in comfortably with a  Wahl Electric 4500 shaver with extra close screen. In hope of getting a closer shave I tried to go back in history and try a double edge shaver. I have been shaving for sixty years and Years back when my hand was steady i preferred a straight razor. This shaver has problems with blade alignment. It has a very aggressive angle and virtually slices off your whiskers and top layer of skin. Yep, I do have a few wrinkles so buyer beware. I have not given up on double edge shavers yet. I ordered another one today that was rated more to my liking. In the mean time I will stick with my Wahl Shaver until the next shaver arrives. The shave might not be as close as a blade but you can&#x27;t beat the comfort.</li>
            <li> so far it&#x27;s worked well, seems to have a good weight and decent balance though I thought the handle could be just a bit longer. opens up fine to insert blade and also closes tight so blade doesn&#x27;t move around. washes up easily and shoes no signs of corrosion in the two months I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> So I got this razor to reduce plastic waste. I was really concerned at first because well, its a razor! which i&#x27;ve never used before I thought for sure I was going to chop my legs up. When I first started using it I went reaaaaaallllllyyyyy slow. I have cut around my ankle a few times but now that i&#x27;ve got the hang of it I haven&#x27;t cut myself. I actually added a rubber band to the handle and now I have much better control! Made a huge difference. I use this on my legs, armpits and have even ventured to my bikini line and it works great! You do have to take more time and care than a disposable razor but its not that big of a difference.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy as I had hoped it would be. I would have liked it better if it had more weight to it, but the price was right, so I  took that into consideration.</li>
            <li> finish peeled away from the bottom ring.</li>
            <li> Heft is good, seems sturdy. No problems. Cleans easy. Stays shiny. I even learned a new trick I never figured out in my youth when I last shaved with one of this type: the edge seems to blunt in one direction. I flip the blade upside down for new sharpness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get an easier close shave, it saves money, less litter. Good.</li>
            <li> The hinged doors on top of the blade bent and broke quickly. This caused the door not to close properly, which in turn caused the blade to be incorrectly aligned, which in turn lead to bad shaves.I replaced this one with a Merkur screw on top style, and it is excellent.</li>
            <li> It seems to be doing what it should. Like the ones from long ago.</li>
            <li> It is just what my husband wanted.  And was shipped in two days when we needed it to be.  The price is good.</li>
            <li> This razor has met and gone beyond the close shave which I had expected. It has cleared up&lt;br /&gt;my stray hairs smoothly without bumps or cuts.  I recommend it highly to anyone who has had&lt;br /&gt;problems using a conventional disposable razor.  It&#x27;s economical too!  The changeable blades&lt;br /&gt;are less expensive than the disposables which I had been buying.</li>
            <li> I love this razor. I enjoy the way you twist the top open. For a lady this makes life pretty easy. If you decide to order this razor, or the others that I purchased your shipping time is much shorter than what the order says. Great buy just like I has when I was young.</li>
            <li> Blades for these are cheap and available at just about every drug store, and grocery store around. The shave is close, and the money Ive saved is great</li>
            <li> I have no clue how he uses it, and he keeps trying to get me to use it.. maybe one day I&#x27;ll try it, but today is not that day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says that it&#x27;s the best razor he&#x27;s had, and that it feels comfortable and doesn&#x27;t slip from his hands easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like it&#x27;s a good price, and he loves the thing, so I&#x27;d definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Solid razor, arrived quickly, and the case will (crucially) keep me from thoughtlessly slicing my finger open and pouring blood into my bags while camping. (This happened with my last razor when I packed, and unpacked, in a rush. Needless to say, I did not save time that day.) The weight, though, is nothing spectacular and I don&#x27;t find it a noticeable improvement from the cheap-o Chinese model I bought before (also available on Amazon). Basically I spent the extra money on this version for the case and the fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor from a national beauty supply chain while traveling as I delved into the world of traditional wet-saving.  I have been using this razor for the past 5 months and can say that this is a great product.  The twist to open mechanism works solidly, the finish is decent, and it does the job.  This is a great, inexpensive razor for beginner!  Great product that is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Looks cool, but doesn&#x27;t work too well, esp of you&#x27;re used to more than 1 blade.&lt;br /&gt;Didnt work on my soft beard.&lt;br /&gt;But it will save you beaucoup bucks on razors if it works for your beard.</li>
