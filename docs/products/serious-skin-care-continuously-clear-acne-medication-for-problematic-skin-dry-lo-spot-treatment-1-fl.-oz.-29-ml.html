            <li>The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does tend to sting a little when first applied.</li>
            <li>Both my boys (ages 15 &amp; 11) have issues and this is the only product that works to dry up, clear, and prevent any issues.  </li>

            <li> My son uses this daily and it&#x27;s mostly used as a cover up for his acne. As far as reducing outbreaks, I believe it has helped if used daily.</li>
            <li> I totally love this product.  I don&#x27;t break out but I  have a very oily nose and large pores.  I dip my Q-tip into jar (do not shake up leave as is, those are the instructions.  Take a lot out and spread thickly at night and in the day spread very thinly let it dry, put on your makeup and no pores!!  I also use nose pore removers once in a while and my pores are smaller and not as oily.  Great product been using for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product works for me. If theres a new pimple on my face, I just dab a little bit on my face and leave it on overnight and the next morning, my zit got smaller. I was shocked that it works on me. I have purchase something similar to this product but sadly it didn&#x27;t work on me. I will definitely be purchasing this product again!</li>
            <li> The best product to get rid of acne fast. It dries the acne so quickly</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write reviews ever so in order for me to do this it would have had to blow me away, and it did!  I have struggled  with chin acne since having my daughter 7 years ago.  This stuff literally stops the acne.  Once you feel one coming, put it on and wow, gone by the morning!!  Can&#x27;t live without and my face hasn&#x27;t looked this good in years.  Thanks !!</li>
            <li> Great product! Worked fast! Was recommended to me. I would recommend to anyone !  It  saved me  and my daughter on her wedding day!</li>
            <li> I have seen a huge improvement with my blemishes since I have started using this product. It does not burn or leave a nasty rash on my face like the Serious Skin Care Glycerin product. I would recommend using this product at night before bed. As with anything, if you would like to see a turn around drink plenty of water. This only take care of the blemishes on the surface, hydrate your skin in order to see the full effects on a continued basis.</li>
            <li> I love this product except for the fact that it has sulphur in it and I&#x27;m allergic to sulphur.  Regardless, it worked and cleared up my blemish in record time.  I just have to be careful of how often I use it.  It also turned all my sterling jewelry black because of the sulphur in my system.  Oh well.  The price we pay for beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it worked for my blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have used Dry-Lo for many years. Helps control oily areas and reduces breakouts and keeps skin clear. You can use it as a mask as well. Wear it alone, under foundation or over foundation.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best stuff you can use for acne or breakouts.  Both my boys (ages 15 &amp; 11) have issues and this is the only product that works to dry up, clear, and prevent any issues.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it does tend to sting a little when first applied.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, if you have a pimple just dab some on for a couple of days and it will be gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a over 40 year old adult. Why do I get the occasional pimple? It&#x27;s embarrassing. I have found this product to get rid of it super fast;. I have tried all kinds of products and this has worked the best. Usually I&#x27;ll rub it in and then I&#x27;ll put more on my pimple and let it dry up overnight.  But remember, everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> Pretty much overnight improvement noticed on my daughter&#x27;s acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> awesome stuff... my daughters can&#x27;t live w/out it!</li>
            <li> I tend to break out A LOT and I have especially oily skin.  I was recommended this product by a friend, and when I first used it, I was hooked.  It&#x27;s my go-to product if I have a pimple emergency.  I had to order more online when I ran out.  It doesn&#x27;t completely clear up the acne, but it reduces the amount and keeps it under control!  You can&#x27;t always just rely on acne medications.  The way to completely clear your acne is a healthy diet and LOTS of water!  This product just speeds up the process :) I hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> This product works! Fast! I cant say enough about it. Don&#x27;t shake the bottle. Just dip in your q-tip &amp; apply. LOVE THIS SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> ive been using this product for almost 6 months now and IT IS THE BEST STUFF EVER!!! if you see a pimple starting to arrive, you just dab some of it on it, keep it on over night, and BAM its gone!!! love it so much!!!</li>
            <li> Got rid of breakout within 3 days.</li>
            <li> Serious Skin Care Continuously Clear Acne Medication for Problematic Skin is great stuff.  Stops breakouts in its tracks. I highly recommend it.</li>
