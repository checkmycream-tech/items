            <li>Delivered quickly good product.</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>Smells likes rose water and creamy easy to spread and does not leave a sticky surface !</li>
            <li>So far so good !!</li>
            <li>I need more time to evaluate this product.</li>
            <li>It again arrived promptly, but when my wife tried to use it, it was not a cream, but more like a watery substance.  </li>
            <li>The results for me over a two month period were phenomenal.</li>
            <li>We ordered 2 more this time.</li>
            <li>I like how it does not burn like most creams containing hydroquinone.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the service, but I don&#x27;t feel the same.:</li>
            <li>I no longer wear my concealer or foundation, and I&#x27;m so excited to not have to worry about whether or not scars show up in pictures.</li>
            <li>Just recived my package today , it came rather quick ...</li>
            <li>FANTASTIC product that I found many years ago (don&#x27;t even remember how) that works very well and FAST.  </li>
            <li>I am so excited to have finally found a product that is effective and delivers on its promise to fade spots.  </li>
            <li>AMAZING, is the only word to describe this provide.  </li>
            <li>not crazy about the scent either.</li>
            <li>It was more of a milk consistency and was not due to product being overheated.</li>
            <li>Brown spots not fully gone but very much faded and continue to improve.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I started seeing results the first week of use, and now I&#x27;m buying it for the second time...</li>
            <li>Thanks Dr. Oz!</li>
            <li>First two times product was of a cream consistency (as it should be).</li>
            <li>I did not use it for long but its good give me a natural  skin</li>
            <li>However, it does seem to be having some positive effect on brown spots.</li>
            <li>maybe thats why I broke out fast.</li>
            <li>It does take effort and care, but I believe this works better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I just started using the Cream; one for the Day the other for the Night; within the past week  so I have not been able to give an honest evaluation of the products.  </li>
            <li>and I use to buy this product from a store that carries a lot of natural product.</li>
            <li>Has hydroquonine, and I&#x27;m sensitive</li>
            <li>No strange smell either, which is a bonus!</li>

            <li> No strange smell either, which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> Really to early to notice major differences since I have been using less than two weeks.  </li>
            <li> My wife could not use it at all, and it probed to be a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t take long to see results.</li>
            <li> terrific price and $60-70 less than products that do the same thing!  </li>
            <li> Worked well on a few initmate areas and spots on my back.</li>
            <li> The discoloring on my legs is due to bleeding capillaries from injuries to my ankles staining my skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is some slight improvement in lessening the the color, until I get another slight injury making bleeding&lt;</li>
            <li> it was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this cream hasn&#x27;t lightened up the brown spots but it does make my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I saw a difference within a few days.  </li>
            <li> Small container so had to reorder twice as I have a few areas to cover.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this brand;however,this time I have noticed this cream has a terrible smell that I have never experienced !</li>
            <li> Im skeptical about this cream now.</li>
            <li> It has weird smell i stopped using it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know about lightening yet but afraid to use it again.</li>
            <li> No need to buy expensive exfoliants - just use baking soda!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

            <li> This did not work  a t all for me I would not  buy it again  it was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> Regular use of this product helps to diminish brown spots on back of one&#x27;s hands.  It takes time to see results.</li>
            <li> Really to early to notice major differences since I have been using less than two weeks.  However, it does seem to be having some positive effect on brown spots.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly good product.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC product that I found many years ago (don&#x27;t even remember how) that works very well and FAST.  I have also used it on a scar that is on my ankle....  terrific price and $60-70 less than products that do the same thing!  No strange smell either, which is a bonus!</li>
            <li> I just started using the Cream; one for the Day the other for the Night; within the past week  so I have not been able to give an honest evaluation of the products.  I hope they work !!!!!!</li>
            <li> I like this brown spot remover.</li>
            <li> I purchased this cream at my wife&#x27;s request from Drugstore.com.  It arrived promptly, worked the way it was supposed to and was totally satisfactory.  When it  was used up, I purchased it again, but this time from a different supplier which offered a lower price.  It again arrived promptly, but when my wife tried to use it, it was not a cream, but more like a watery substance.  My wife could not use it at all, and it probed to be a complete waste of money.  Back to Drugstore.com.</li>
            <li> The discoloring on my legs is due to bleeding capillaries from injuries to my ankles staining my skin red.&lt;br /&gt; My age of 89 may have something to do with it, you think?  Also it has been this way for several years now.&lt;br /&gt;There is some slight improvement in lessening the the color, until I get another slight injury making bleeding&lt;br /&gt;under my skin again.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I started seeing results the first week of use, and now I&#x27;m buying it for the second time...love it!</li>
            <li> unfortunately, this cream hasn&#x27;t lightened up the brown spots but it does make my skin soft.  not crazy about the scent either.</li>
            <li> AMAZING, is the only word to describe this provide.  buy it today</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a year and I use to buy this product from a store that carries a lot of natural product. I am so pleased with this brand;however,this time I have noticed this cream has a terrible smell that I have never experienced ! I wonder if this product has mercury... Im skeptical about this cream now. I don&#x27;t feel the same, but I got this product on time. I am happy with the service, but I don&#x27;t feel the same.:(</li>
            <li> works wonders. I have been using this product for 7 months and i tell you its a miracle worker</li>
            <li> I bought this cream to help with post acne scarring and hyper pigmentation. The results for me over a two month period were phenomenal. I used the day and night cream together religiously.  I am so excited to have finally found a product that is effective and delivers on its promise to fade spots.  I no longer wear my concealer or foundation, and I&#x27;m so excited to not have to worry about whether or not scars show up in pictures. Thanks Dr. Oz!</li>
            <li> Working well.i luv it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! I saw a difference within a few days.  After a week my face was noticeably clearer, brighter, and softer.  You must exfoliate regularly.  No need to buy expensive exfoliants - just use baking soda!</li>
            <li> Along with the day cream, this product has improved the look of my mother&#x27;s facial brown spots dramatically.  I do not even notice them anymore.  We ordered 2 more this time.</li>
            <li> Got one from the vitamin shoppe. Caused me to break out. Don&#x27;t know about lightening yet but afraid to use it again. Has hydroquonine, and I&#x27;m sensitive maybe thats why I broke out fast.</li>
            <li> I did not use it for long but its good give me a natural  skin</li>
            <li> It has weird smell i stopped using it</li>
            <li> I like how it does not burn like most creams containing hydroquinone. It does take effort and care, but I believe this works better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Purchased twice before. Product is awesome! Worked well on a few initmate areas and spots on my back. Didn&#x27;t take long to see results. Brown spots not fully gone but very much faded and continue to improve. Small container so had to reorder twice as I have a few areas to cover. First two times product was of a cream consistency (as it should be). Third time, ordered the product from AmericaRx. It was more of a milk consistency and was not due to product being overheated. Very disappointed. Sent back. Will definitely reorder again, just from another company. Gave this product 5 stars as I am reviewing the product and not the company.</li>
            <li> Only giving 3 Stars because it&#x27;s my 1st day of using product !!! Just recived my package today , it came rather quick ... It&#x27;s pretty small ,Smells likes rose water and creamy easy to spread and does not leave a sticky surface ! So far so good !!</li>
