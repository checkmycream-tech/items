            <li>What we really want is an organzier that perfectly fits all lipstick brands.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to have my lipstick standing up</li>
            <li>, they are of a nice, heavy-quality acrylic</li>
            <li>It has a nice sleek look to it, and it serves its purpose to a T.</li>
            <li>looks good and is very good quality, I just need more for my whole collection now!</li>
            <li>I was so happy and excited. .</li>
            <li>Aesthetically, this is very nice and clean looking.</li>
            <li>Perfect for my new growing lipstick collection.</li>
            <li>these are super helpful, well made products, incredibly happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It literally took 3 days after placing my order when I received my organizer, which made me super happy.</li>
            <li>My shorter tubes like Revlon, Maybelline, etc fit nicely, but the my WNW matte longer tubes do not sit in the holder good.</li>

            <li>The product is a good quality, however it didn&#x27;t fit my need.  </li>

            <li>I am so happy that I bought this, it showcases all the pretty lipsticks you have.</li>
            <li>Great exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It is a great concept, but the sides of the holders need to be higher to prevent the lipsticks from falling over.  </li>
            <li>The acrylic is crystal clear and strong and it fits perfectly in my vanity drawer.</li>
            <li>I Love this.</li>

            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Most of what I find are those that hold maybe 8 lipsticks.  </li>

            <li>I was looking for an organizer that will hold the lipsticks while they are still in their boxes so that I can better organize my Mary Kay inventory.  </li>
            <li>My Mac, Tarte, YSL, Dior, and Bobbi Browns all fit nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more.</li>

            <li>and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>Does not look cheap, but the price is!</li>
            <li>I love that the organizer is so compact and holds all my lipstick in one place.</li>
            <li>It holds even my fatter tubes of lipstick and looks stylish.</li>

            <li>:)</li>

            <li>I love product as it met all my expectations.  </li>
            <li>He wanted me to be sure and tell ya&#x27;ll that.</li>
            <li>I have to be able to see the labels</li>
            <li>Maybe I will collect more NARS</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have many of these.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE IT.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing two more</li>
            <li>I invert my lipstick tubes so that I can see what color they are (by reading the name on the bottom) and my MAC lipsticks slant to the side because of their domed top.  </li>
            <li>I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m not picky, but I love this lipstick organizer.</li>
            <li>I also store my lipsticks with the top facing up and not the bottom up.</li>
            <li>I really love this organizer for holding my lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more from them as gifts for my girlie friends :)</li>
            <li>The quality of the acrylic is amazing and doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all.</li>
            <li>so I can view the colors better.</li>
            <li>All and All I was satisfied and will purhcase again.</li>
            <li>An extra 3/4 inch to an inch of height would make this organizer just perfect!  </li>
            <li>It does work perfectly for my shorter lip glosses and funnily enough, for my &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; of perfume sample tubes.  </li>
            <li>If you love OPI polishes, order it.  </li>
            <li>Love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>

            <li>I love this lipstick organizer.</li>
            <li>I always had all my lipsticks in a makeup bag and now I&#x27;m able to have them all organized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to purchase another one because I have so many.</li>

            <li>It all fit in there nicely and securely.</li>
            <li>So neat and so clean!</li>
            <li>I was able to fit all my lipsticks as well.</li>
            <li>So I am becoming a makeup junkie</li>
            <li>I love the size, the finish and the way it looks full of lipsticks :-)</li>
            <li>Got one as a gift on Christmas, and loved it so much that I ordered another.</li>

            <li>this, my lipsticks look so organized and easy to grab</li>
            <li>I was concerned that it might be too wide to fit on the med cabinet shelf, but it fits perfectly.</li>
            <li>An easy organization lipstick holder.</li>
            <li>I put it in the drawer in my bathroom so I can easily access my lipsticks.</li>
            <li>Holds lipsticks so they are easily visible.</li>
            <li>great quality for such a cheap price!</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t seem like it would scratch or break easily.</li>
            <li>I just ordered two more, yes i liked that much.</li>
            <li>This organizer is nice and sturdy and so far fits all of the lipsticks I own.  </li>
            <li>so many lipsticks this really comes in handy of corse</li>
            <li>Finally found one thats cheap and good quality!</li>
            <li>Arrived super quick, and it just looks soo nice-</li>
            <li>Strong sturdy and very pretty!</li>
            <li>I remember all of my lipsticks and have them arranged so that I know where each one is without having to look at the label on the bottom, which is probably why this organizer works just fine for me.</li>
            <li>Great  way to organizes lipstick and having it out in the open, easy to look for what you need.</li>
            <li>Awesome little lipstick holder.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m huge on watching YouTube beauty gurus, and they all seem to have acrylic organizers.  </li>
            <li>Fit is very similar to NARS, so this organizer would work great with these.</li>
            <li>and it fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of sturdy acrylic that does not look cheap.</li>
            <li>My octagon-shaped, square-shaped and rounded lipsticks all fit in here, although some of the non-round ones fit rather snugly.</li>
            <li>Looks nice and it&#x27;s very convienant.</li>
            <li>all my lips stick fit</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy.</li>
            <li>Nice grade of plastic - not thin or flimsy either.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this lipstick organizer.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li>Considering how inexpensive this is, I was expecting one of those cheap plastic trays you&#x27;d find at Target.</li>
            <li>but a great product overall</li>
            <li>All my brands of lipstick fit</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit SNUG</li>
            <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t even do this acrylic holder justice, it honestly looks so much nicer in person</li>
            <li>I have a lot of Clinique and Elizabeth Arden lipsticks, and they fit well.</li>
            <li>Was concerned this would be flimsy or cheap but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t fit all my lipsticks -</li>
            <li>At last a great make-up organizer that can hold lip products.</li>
            <li>Fabulous, five star product.</li>
            <li>This holder will fit:</li>
            <li>Purchased for a different purpose than makeup and it works great for organization.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these a couple of months ago and liked it so much</li>
            <li>it fit :</li>
            <li>MAC, NYX Matte , ELF minerals ,Revlon,SLEEK&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t fit some of NYX lipsticks .</li>
            <li>I am so happy I finally found one!  </li>
            <li>you have lipsticks that are about the same size and diameter of any of the ones that I&#x27;ve listed fits, then you should be good. :)</li>
            <li>It is heavy duty, yet light, so would be perfect as a lipstick holder.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s very sleek and stylish for in the drawer or on top of a makeup vanity.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to see what colors you have so you can make the best choice everyday!</li>
            <li>This is a great lipstick organizer for those who love makeup n cant seem to get it all organize defenitly would recommend this n other acrilic organizers</li>
            <li>Its so pretty (:&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li>Very useful.  </li>
            <li>but actually this is very handy.</li>

            <li>it is very nice for the low price.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more as one didn&#x27;t fit my whole collection!</li>
            <li>Is okay-- all squares are not the consistent size and not all my lipstick will fit in</li>
            <li>Nice, high quality product.</li>
            <li>Fun product!  </li>
            <li>I love the lipstick organizer so much that I ordered another one!</li>
            <li>I love this so much!</li>
            <li>While I did not need this organizer for lipstick, it works perfectly for organizing my small sample bottles.</li>
            <li>The product was exactly as described and now I have a place to store my many lipsticks/glosses.</li>
            <li>They are just what I needed to keep my art table clean and organized.  </li>
            <li>I love these organizers SO much they don&#x27;t look cheap at all.</li>
            <li>Much more cost effective than purchasing from local beauty stores.</li>
            <li>It was sturdy, clean, and well-made (five stars for quality).</li>
            <li>Width wise, all of my lipsticks fit in the individual slots of this organizer</li>
            <li>The clear design is great for finding things fast.</li>
            <li>Solid, pleasantly looking lipstick organizer.</li>
            <li>It is weighted nicely and is very clear as opposed to being cloudy.</li>
            <li>It was fast shipping and very accurate on description.</li>
            <li>but it is very sturdy and cute.  </li>
            <li>I purchased 2 of them because they are so cute and organize my lipsticks very well.</li>
            <li>I love it, very practical and sleek</li>
            <li>Clinique ones hold up a lot better, but I really needed them for the Mac ones.</li>
            <li>however i really need more than one of that holder..</li>
            <li>and I love the tilt because it makes reading the labels much easier.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and practical for lipstick organizer, I love how neat my lipstick looked in one place</li>
            <li>Thanks :)</li>
            <li>Thick acrylic and perfect size!!</li>
            <li>drops fit great with the tops up or down.</li>
            <li>I love mine and the company had super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It looks good on top of your vanity and takes up little space.</li>
            <li>If you are a lipstick fanatic, it is a great way to keep the many types of lipsticks together.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting one if you have too many colors to choose from, like myself</li>
            <li>The acrylic is thick and nice and it looks amazing filled with my lipsticks.</li>
            <li>This lipstick holder is fantastic, it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>However, if you store lippies with the caps up (label down), this organizer works just great.</li>
            <li>I purchased two of this lipstick holder only $13.49 for each.it is pretty much good deal.  </li>
            <li>The MAC Pro Long Wear tubes seem to sit a little more stable and do their best to stay upright, regardless of position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to be purchasing more of these soon!</li>
            <li>Exactly as described!</li>
            <li>It would be nice if these could be made a little taller, so they can hold longer lipstick tubes better.</li>
            <li>Great, not cheap</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s really into makeup and needs to have a lot of organization this really fit the bill with her lipsticks and her mascaras</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great place to store your extra lipsticks that won&#x27;t fit in your regular makeup organizer.</li>
            <li>Also, there are a couple of my lipstick tubes that don&#x27;t fit in the slots, such as my YSL lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though this is a great organizer for regular lipstick tubes.</li>
            <li>But yea this is great product and is well done and not cheap</li>
            <li>Really nice quality as well especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>beautiful heavy acrylic!  </li>
            <li>I love the way the clear acrylic looks on my vanity.  </li>
            <li>Nice sleek tray, and surprisingly solid.</li>
            <li>They jiggle a bit when stored upside down, BUT actually fit pretty good if stored with the caps up.</li>
            <li>Good product which allows for organization of lipsticks &amp; other small,cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>I like this lipstick holder and the price is just right.</li>
            <li>The slots are the right size for MAC lipsticks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;MAC COSMETICS (Not The Right Organizer</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s almost full) and out of all my lipsticks I&#x27;ve only had one that didn&#x27;t fit!</li>
            <li>This thing is nice and thick, super cute, and holds all of my lipsticks, lip glosses and liquid lipsticks.</li>
            <li>The acrylic looks so much better than plastic organizers, so I highly recommend paying the extra buck because it will really look so much better in your bathroom.</li>
            <li>I just wish that my lipstick didn&#x27;t have so much room in between, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I can put different sizes in it.</li>
            <li>I liked this so much that I did purchase a second one.</li>
            <li>Received very fast</li>
            <li>Very reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li>Well made and very sturdy!</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>This organizer is really sturdy!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I needed it to be.</li>
            <li>I bought one at first</li>
            <li>I really like this product!</li>
            <li>A definite must if you have a lot of lip products and want them readily available to choose from!</li>
            <li>Amazed how fast it arrived!</li>
            <li>the Kat Von D studded kiss lipsticks are too big but sit nicely on top of the holder).</li>
            <li>I have it packaged still because I&#x27;m thinking where to place my vanity, but opening them up they look expensive and great quality!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Holds many different brands: Mac, YSL, ect...</li>
            <li>Came on time, and exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li>The organizer has allowed me to organize my lipsticks for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li>but if there a bigger one will be more helpful</li>
            <li>I can finally see exactly how many lipsticks I have and what color they are.  </li>
            <li>If anyone is interested, please email me at mamalavana@hotmail.com.  </li>
            <li>Love this lil guy, you can store not only Mac sized lippies but longer Revlon just bitten kissable balm type tubes.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I am actually about to purchase another one because I&#x27;ve become a lip product addict and already need more space</li>
            <li>First of all, this is Robert&#x27;s wife (Cee Cee) writing this review</li>
            <li>The diameter of the case is almost the same size as the slot, so the fit is really good, and there is not much jiggling/moving around.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m debating on buying a third organizer when I accumulate more lipsticks.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to receiving this lipstick holder!  </li>
            <li>Overall the item is cute.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this lipstick organizer and I am so in love with it.</li>
            <li>In the first order I received what is pictured and what was described on the page.</li>
            <li>This products is exactly what is described.</li>
            <li>This was my second purchase because I love lipsticks and i like this tray because they are all even and not like a hill tray where some lipsticks are higher than the bottom ones.</li>
            <li>It actually had weight in them and was very clean and sleek looking.</li>
            <li>Finally I can organize all my lipsticks instead of just throwing them in my top draw and have to pick up each one when I want a certain color.</li>
            <li>It is clear so it&#x27;ll go with anything and only one kind of lipstick</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is that my MAC lipsticks cannot stand straight because of the bullet shape top.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for sending it to me so fast!</li>
            <li>It also has a tiny footprint, which is great considering it holds 24 lipsticks (or other similarly-sized items, like mini mascaras).     </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lip stick holder, its very sturdy and heavy not made out of cheap plastic like others.</li>
            <li>I have searched far and wide in stores for this kind of item without success.</li>
            <li>Some may kind of fall over a little, but they don&#x27;t go all the way over, so I&#x27;m so cool with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy acrylic, feels nice and smooth and quality, and I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>All her cosmetics are in a local location and can easily be identified.</li>
            <li>LAUDER PURE COLOR LIPSTICK (</li>
            <li>do have one positive feedback; it&#x27;s made very well.</li>
            <li>This is the same great product at half the cost.  </li>
            <li>I have all my fav shade in each little cube and place nicely on my vanity table.</li>
            <li>I ordered several of these, as I have a huge lipstick collection.  </li>
            <li>They are very well made, with a nice heavy feel.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy fit all different types of lipsticks mac, nars, and maybeline.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Like it, only thing is some of my mac lip sticks won&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li>Any lipstick cases that are rounded or slanted tend to flop around instead of standing straight in the organizer.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful to have them in an organizer.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a whole seprerate one for my lip glosses and liquid lipsticks.</li>
            <li>superrrr fast delivery</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>im really liking this holder.</li>
            <li>I was very suprised about the quality of this lipstick organizer.</li>
            <li>I received it fast.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and</li>
            <li>And the shipping was extremely fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just much prettier in person than a picture.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and holds all my brands.</li>
            <li>This lipstick holder is very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li>They stay in place, but they don&#x27;t stand up straight.</li>
            <li>all but the shortest lipsticks don&#x27;t stand up straight, bounce around when opening the drawer.</li>
            <li>(so they don&#x27;t wobble as much) and therefore, cannot see the lipstick color names.  </li>
            <li>so I can easily ready each color and pick the one I want to wear that day.  </li>
            <li>Its made of very sturdy material;  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s affordable and now my vanity looks very organized.</li>
            <li>I bought this to put in all of my lipsticks and my Mac ones don&#x27;t stand up so straight.  </li>
            <li>I bought two and because its sturdy, I can even fit some of my smaller mascaras without them falling out.</li>
            <li>Worked out really well.</li>
            <li>straight.  </li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t deal with how much tipping</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think these would work for any slim shine or gloss in a very skinny</li>
            <li>This lipstick holder is very sturdy and holds my lipsticks with no problems.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li>Product arrived fast and with no issues.</li>
            <li>This keeps my things organized and ready to use when in a rush.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Did I mention how fast the shipping was?</li>
            <li>I must say I really really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>US Acrylic makes a High Quality Product!  </li>
            <li>Fast transaction, fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Fit all my lipsticks even the larger ones.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>This lipstick organizer is very durable.</li>
            <li>Highly recommed the quality!</li>
            <li>I ended up ordered several more of these because they look so classy on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks so nice, not cheap at all.</li>
            <li>It actually looks pretty cool when done that way.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that I&#x27;ve completely validated the idea of buying as many lipsticks as I want.</li>
            <li>I guess you could put the Mac lippies in the compartment bottoms down but that defeats the purpose of being able to see the different shades easily.    </li>
            <li>I have an unhealthy amount of lipsticks and wanted a nice clean orderly way to keep them.</li>
            <li>It is a very sturdy and well made, which is nice because some organizers I have  had in the past were very flimsy.</li>
            <li>It looks way better than my other makeup organizer that I got at target years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, when I put my lipsticks in the holders, they all fall over to the side (just as many other reviewers have reported.)  </li>
            <li>so badly it&#x27;s a super sleek little device that would fit in all of my cubbies for storage.  </li>
            <li>The product seems to be very durable and made of high quality acrylic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very nice holder - not too big and not too small.  </li>
            <li>It fits most lipsticks and the acrylic is so smooth &amp; thick!</li>
            <li>Lipstick tubes that are not flat on top (such as MAC, Julie Hewett, Besame Cosmetics, and so on) flop to the side.</li>
            <li>When I do this, most of them wobble and fall slightly to the side.  </li>
            <li>This is phenomenal and I would definitely purchase another in the future.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of these organizers in the future.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m definitely ordering more, I will go for the bigger size....loved it,,....</li>
            <li>It is a chic display that allows me quick access to a specific color, as I store my lipsticks name side up.</li>
            <li>of my \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; Estee Lauder Pure Color lipsticks in the square gold cases fit really well upside down in this organizer.</li>
            <li>Daughter loves this, sturdy and looks very classy!</li>
            <li>The whole purpose of organizing my multiple lipsticks is to simplify my routine, and if I wanted to pull each one out to hunt for the right color, I might as well leave the lipsticks in my vanity drawer.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Feels like high quality;  </li>
            <li>i highly recommend it</li>
            <li>It feels and looks like it is high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>High quality</li>
            <li>high quality plastic.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>You can put the taller things like lipgloss in the back, and it&#x27;s large enough that all your brands of lipstick should fit.</li>
            <li>It is very nicely made, thick and sturdy, but I do agree with the other reviews that said the sides should be higher.  </li>
            <li>Some lipsticks may be too wide to fit in the slots (like my YSL one).</li>
            <li>Gonna buy a few more.</li>
            <li>Worth it to get especially when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li>I do not care to see the labels on top because it is messy looking so</li>
            <li>Lip Fusion glosses are square but taller, and these will fall over if the stand is moved or jiggled at all (top heavy).</li>
            <li>These are mostly samples I received in gifts with purchase, but I have quite a few.</li>
            <li>Material nice n thick n sturdy.</li>
            <li>Nice, sturdy construction - thick acrylic.  </li>
            <li>My lipsticks used to live in a drawer</li>
            <li>Fit all my lipsticks from multiple different brands...</li>
            <li>I expected it to be a tad wider, but this actually works better for my needs.</li>
            <li>Very cute, not to big or to small.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavy to not flop over and holds lipstick very nicely.</li>
            <li>I thought it was all flat and not angled, but it did not ultimately make any difference and it works fine for what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li>However; I will say that I was very surprised by the sturdy design of this organizer.  </li>
            <li>High quality and crystal clear material.</li>
            <li>when i first open the box, i am so surprise.</li>
            <li>This lipstick organizer works pretty well for the smaller bottles.  </li>
            <li>My NARS lipsticks (like my fav Niagara) are shorter than average and have square cases, so these fit verynicely.</li>
            <li>When stored with the cap up, it&#x27;s more stable because the weight of the case helps keep it upright in spite of the small case diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The compartments are low, I wish they could be a little higher so that lipsticks with rounded tips (I.e MAC) would fit in without tipping to the side.</li>
            <li>I have a few &amp;#34;plus sized&amp;#34; lipsticks and this organizer fits them just fine.  </li>
            <li>I was looking for a craft organizer for little bottles, and this looked to fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Cute little way to organize your makeup and display it at the same time.  </li>
            <li>If the slots were taller, I could have put other lipsticks (taller sizes) in the slots, but since they are so short, you will be limited to what kind of lipsticks you put in</li>
            <li>but this is crystal clear and shiny.  </li>
            <li>It is a 24 space sturdy clear acrylic lipstick holder.</li>
            <li>Way nicer than I thought it would be....sturdy and shiny clear.</li>
            <li>It holds them upright and easier to tell apart a lipstick by the clear bottom of the case.</li>
            <li>By the way, I also purchased the US Acrylic clear multi tier nail polish organizer.</li>
            <li>Whether your lipstick is round or square, they&#x27;ll fit.</li>
            <li>Makes all of my make up look like a professional display.</li>
            <li>So, I have this product added to my wishlist and will purchase at least a couple more as I make additional purchases on Amazon.</li>
            <li>From Kat von D liquid lipstick, MAC, Urban Decay, a whole bunch of Tarte lipsurgence,  Stila, Melted too faced, Nyx, you know it</li>
            <li>The tilted stand only holds 12 lipsticks, but it is much deeper</li>
            <li>I was surprised with the quality of the product</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product, and if I accumulate a few more lipsticks I will repurchase it.</li>
            <li>picture is a flat acrylic, mine was elevated a little at the top</li>
            <li>for storing MAC lipsticks upside down, yes, they&#x27;ll lean (because of the bullet shaped top) but you can make one row lean in one direction and the next row in the opposite direction.</li>
            <li>However, I have found this height (based on researching different organization options) to be pretty standard for lipstick holders.  </li>
            <li>However, 1\\&quot;high isn&#x27;t quite as deep as I needed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality material, fits my 7 different brands of lipstick.</li>
            <li>This feels very solid and like it is high quality  </li>
            <li>I searched high and low for a lipstick organizer.  </li>
            <li>This replaced my old acrylic lipstick holder which would not hold the new larger lipstick cases.  </li>
            <li>I really like that the organizer is clear, almost like glass vs cloudy clear like other acrylic organizers.</li>
            <li>They look a lot more expensive than they really are sitting on my vanity.</li>
            <li>Clinique lippies are cylindrical with flat bottoms (light green cases).</li>
            <li>The second order I recieved a different 24 slot holder that was slanted or trapezoidal in shape instead of the flat rectangular one that I got the first time.</li>
            <li>I was trying to find a holder for my essential oil bottles from Young Living.  </li>
            <li>This is not bad but the size is small.  </li>
            <li>I should subtract two stars for functionality, but I won&#x27;t because some people are fine with the shallow slots.</li>
            <li>then I bought 2 more for lipstick and other small items.</li>
            <li>I work for a small cosmetic company and needed something to keep all our lipsticks in where I could find any color I needed, quickly.</li>
            <li>I do really like the holder, will look for something else to hold my Mac lippies but for the other brands I have (elf, milani, nyx, loreal, Jordana, revlon)</li>
            <li>problem is that the slots are barely over an inch deep.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping, this arrived in  less than  a week.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the slots aren&#x27;t tall enough to hold MAC lipsticks straight when they are upside down.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to be a little flimsy because it was so cheap, but this thing is heavy (for it&#x27;s size).</li>
            <li>The shallow slots cannot support/hold up most of my lipsticks which makes it a lot less functional for my purposes.</li>

            <li> What we really want is an organzier that perfectly fits all lipstick brands.</li>
            <li> It is so nice to have my lipstick standing up</li>
            <li> , they are of a nice, heavy-quality acrylic</li>
            <li> It has a nice sleek look to it, and it serves its purpose to a T.</li>

            <li> Aesthetically, this is very nice and clean looking.</li>

            <li> Great exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> It is a great concept, but the sides of the holders need to be higher to prevent the lipsticks from falling over.  </li>
            <li> The acrylic is crystal clear and strong and it fits perfectly in my vanity drawer.</li>
            <li> I Love this.</li>

            <li> I invert my lipstick tubes so that I can see what color they are (by reading the name on the bottom) and my MAC lipsticks slant to the side because of their domed top.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not picky, but I love this lipstick organizer.</li>

            <li> I remember all of my lipsticks and have them arranged so that I know where each one is without having to look at the label on the bottom, which is probably why this organizer works just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Great  way to organizes lipstick and having it out in the open, easy to look for what you need.</li>
            <li> Awesome little lipstick holder.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m huge on watching YouTube beauty gurus, and they all seem to have acrylic organizers.  </li>
            <li> Fit is very similar to NARS, so this organizer would work great with these.</li>
            <li> and it fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of sturdy acrylic that does not look cheap.</li>
            <li> My octagon-shaped, square-shaped and rounded lipsticks all fit in here, although some of the non-round ones fit rather snugly.</li>
            <li> Looks nice and it&#x27;s very convienant.</li>
            <li> all my lips stick fit</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy.</li>
            <li> Nice grade of plastic - not thin or flimsy either.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this lipstick organizer.&lt;br /&gt;With</li>
            <li> Considering how inexpensive this is, I was expecting one of those cheap plastic trays you&#x27;d find at Target.</li>
            <li> but a great product overall</li>
            <li> All my brands of lipstick fit</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit SNUG</li>
            <li> The picture doesn&#x27;t even do this acrylic holder justice, it honestly looks so much nicer in person</li>
            <li> I have a lot of Clinique and Elizabeth Arden lipsticks, and they fit well.</li>
            <li> Was concerned this would be flimsy or cheap but it wasn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fit all my lipsticks -</li>
            <li> At last a great make-up organizer that can hold lip products.</li>
            <li> Fabulous, five star product.</li>
            <li> This holder will fit:</li>
            <li> Purchased for a different purpose than makeup and it works great for organization.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these a couple of months ago and liked it so much</li>
            <li> it fit :</li>
            <li> MAC, NYX Matte , ELF minerals ,Revlon,SLEEK&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t fit some of NYX lipsticks .</li>
            <li> I am so happy I finally found one!  </li>
            <li> you have lipsticks that are about the same size and diameter of any of the ones that I&#x27;ve listed fits, then you should be good. :)</li>
            <li> It is heavy duty, yet light, so would be perfect as a lipstick holder.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s very sleek and stylish for in the drawer or on top of a makeup vanity.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to see what colors you have so you can make the best choice everyday!</li>
            <li> This is a great lipstick organizer for those who love makeup n cant seem to get it all organize defenitly would recommend this n other acrilic organizers</li>
            <li> Its so pretty (:&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Very useful.  </li>
            <li> but actually this is very handy.</li>
            <li> and find!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> it is very nice for the low price.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more as one didn&#x27;t fit my whole collection!</li>
            <li> Is okay-- all squares are not the consistent size and not all my lipstick will fit in</li>
            <li> Nice, high quality product.</li>
            <li> Fun product!  </li>
            <li> I love the lipstick organizer so much that I ordered another one!</li>
            <li> I love this so much!</li>
            <li> While I did not need this organizer for lipstick, it works perfectly for organizing my small sample bottles.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and now I have a place to store my many lipsticks/glosses.</li>
            <li> They are just what I needed to keep my art table clean and organized.  </li>
            <li> I love these organizers SO much they don&#x27;t look cheap at all.</li>
            <li> Much more cost effective than purchasing from local beauty stores.</li>
            <li> It was sturdy, clean, and well-made (five stars for quality).</li>
            <li> Width wise, all of my lipsticks fit in the individual slots of this organizer</li>
            <li> The clear design is great for finding things fast.</li>
            <li> Solid, pleasantly looking lipstick organizer.</li>
            <li> It is weighted nicely and is very clear as opposed to being cloudy.</li>
            <li> It was fast shipping and very accurate on description.</li>
            <li> but it is very sturdy and cute.  </li>
            <li> I purchased 2 of them because they are so cute and organize my lipsticks very well.</li>
            <li> I love it, very practical and sleek</li>
            <li> Clinique ones hold up a lot better, but I really needed them for the Mac ones.</li>
            <li> however i really need more than one of that holder..</li>
            <li> and I love the tilt because it makes reading the labels much easier.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and practical for lipstick organizer, I love how neat my lipstick looked in one place</li>
            <li> Thanks :)</li>
            <li> Thick acrylic and perfect size!!</li>
            <li> drops fit great with the tops up or down.</li>
            <li> I love mine and the company had super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It looks good on top of your vanity and takes up little space.</li>
            <li> If you are a lipstick fanatic, it is a great way to keep the many types of lipsticks together.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting one if you have too many colors to choose from, like myself</li>
            <li> The acrylic is thick and nice and it looks amazing filled with my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> This lipstick holder is fantastic, it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> However, if you store lippies with the caps up (label down), this organizer works just great.</li>
            <li> I purchased two of this lipstick holder only $13.49 for each.it is pretty much good deal.  </li>
            <li> The MAC Pro Long Wear tubes seem to sit a little more stable and do their best to stay upright, regardless of position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to be purchasing more of these soon!</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!</li>
            <li> It would be nice if these could be made a little taller, so they can hold longer lipstick tubes better.</li>
            <li> Great, not cheap</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s really into makeup and needs to have a lot of organization this really fit the bill with her lipsticks and her mascaras</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great place to store your extra lipsticks that won&#x27;t fit in your regular makeup organizer.</li>
            <li> Also, there are a couple of my lipstick tubes that don&#x27;t fit in the slots, such as my YSL lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though this is a great organizer for regular lipstick tubes.</li>
            <li> But yea this is great product and is well done and not cheap</li>
            <li> Really nice quality as well especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> beautiful heavy acrylic!  </li>
            <li> I love the way the clear acrylic looks on my vanity.  </li>
            <li> Nice sleek tray, and surprisingly solid.</li>
            <li> They jiggle a bit when stored upside down, BUT actually fit pretty good if stored with the caps up.</li>
            <li> Good product which allows for organization of lipsticks &amp; other small,cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> I like this lipstick holder and the price is just right.</li>
            <li> The slots are the right size for MAC lipsticks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MAC COSMETICS (Not The Right Organizer</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s almost full) and out of all my lipsticks I&#x27;ve only had one that didn&#x27;t fit!</li>
            <li> This thing is nice and thick, super cute, and holds all of my lipsticks, lip glosses and liquid lipsticks.</li>
            <li> The acrylic looks so much better than plastic organizers, so I highly recommend paying the extra buck because it will really look so much better in your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I just wish that my lipstick didn&#x27;t have so much room in between, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I can put different sizes in it.</li>
            <li> I liked this so much that I did purchase a second one.</li>
            <li> Received very fast</li>
            <li> Very reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li> Well made and very sturdy!</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> This organizer is really sturdy!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed it to be.</li>
            <li> I bought one at first</li>
            <li> I really like this product!</li>
            <li> A definite must if you have a lot of lip products and want them readily available to choose from!</li>
            <li> Amazed how fast it arrived!</li>
            <li> the Kat Von D studded kiss lipsticks are too big but sit nicely on top of the holder).</li>
            <li> I have it packaged still because I&#x27;m thinking where to place my vanity, but opening them up they look expensive and great quality!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Holds many different brands: Mac, YSL, ect...</li>
            <li> Came on time, and exactly what i ordered.</li>
            <li> The organizer has allowed me to organize my lipsticks for the first time ever.  </li>
            <li> but if there a bigger one will be more helpful</li>
            <li> I can finally see exactly how many lipsticks I have and what color they are.  </li>
            <li> If anyone is interested, please email me at mamalavana@hotmail.com.  </li>
            <li> Love this lil guy, you can store not only Mac sized lippies but longer Revlon just bitten kissable balm type tubes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> I am actually about to purchase another one because I&#x27;ve become a lip product addict and already need more space</li>
            <li> First of all, this is Robert&#x27;s wife (Cee Cee) writing this review</li>
            <li> The diameter of the case is almost the same size as the slot, so the fit is really good, and there is not much jiggling/moving around.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m debating on buying a third organizer when I accumulate more lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this lipstick holder!  </li>
            <li> Overall the item is cute.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this lipstick organizer and I am so in love with it.</li>
            <li> In the first order I received what is pictured and what was described on the page.</li>
            <li> This products is exactly what is described.</li>
            <li> This was my second purchase because I love lipsticks and i like this tray because they are all even and not like a hill tray where some lipsticks are higher than the bottom ones.</li>
            <li> It actually had weight in them and was very clean and sleek looking.</li>
            <li> Finally I can organize all my lipsticks instead of just throwing them in my top draw and have to pick up each one when I want a certain color.</li>
            <li> It is clear so it&#x27;ll go with anything and only one kind of lipstick</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is that my MAC lipsticks cannot stand straight because of the bullet shape top.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for sending it to me so fast!</li>
            <li> It also has a tiny footprint, which is great considering it holds 24 lipsticks (or other similarly-sized items, like mini mascaras).     </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip stick holder, its very sturdy and heavy not made out of cheap plastic like others.</li>
            <li> I have searched far and wide in stores for this kind of item without success.</li>
            <li> Some may kind of fall over a little, but they don&#x27;t go all the way over, so I&#x27;m so cool with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy acrylic, feels nice and smooth and quality, and I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> All her cosmetics are in a local location and can easily be identified.</li>
            <li> LAUDER PURE COLOR LIPSTICK (</li>
            <li> do have one positive feedback; it&#x27;s made very well.</li>
            <li> This is the same great product at half the cost.  </li>
            <li> I have all my fav shade in each little cube and place nicely on my vanity table.</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these, as I have a huge lipstick collection.  </li>
            <li> They are very well made, with a nice heavy feel.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy fit all different types of lipsticks mac, nars, and maybeline.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Like it, only thing is some of my mac lip sticks won&#x27;t fit</li>
            <li> Any lipstick cases that are rounded or slanted tend to flop around instead of standing straight in the organizer.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful to have them in an organizer.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a whole seprerate one for my lip glosses and liquid lipsticks.</li>
            <li> superrrr fast delivery</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> im really liking this holder.</li>
            <li> I was very suprised about the quality of this lipstick organizer.</li>
            <li> I received it fast.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and</li>
            <li> And the shipping was extremely fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just much prettier in person than a picture.  </li>
            <li> Very sturdy and holds all my brands.</li>
            <li> This lipstick holder is very sturdy and well made.</li>
            <li> They stay in place, but they don&#x27;t stand up straight.</li>
            <li> all but the shortest lipsticks don&#x27;t stand up straight, bounce around when opening the drawer.</li>
            <li> (so they don&#x27;t wobble as much) and therefore, cannot see the lipstick color names.  </li>
            <li> so I can easily ready each color and pick the one I want to wear that day.  </li>
            <li> Its made of very sturdy material;  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s affordable and now my vanity looks very organized.</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in all of my lipsticks and my Mac ones don&#x27;t stand up so straight.  </li>
            <li> I bought two and because its sturdy, I can even fit some of my smaller mascaras without them falling out.</li>
            <li> Worked out really well.</li>
            <li> straight.  </li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t deal with how much tipping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think these would work for any slim shine or gloss in a very skinny</li>
            <li> This lipstick holder is very sturdy and holds my lipsticks with no problems.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived fast and with no issues.</li>
            <li> This keeps my things organized and ready to use when in a rush.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Did I mention how fast the shipping was?</li>
            <li> I must say I really really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> US Acrylic makes a High Quality Product!  </li>
            <li> Fast transaction, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Fit all my lipsticks even the larger ones.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This lipstick organizer is very durable.</li>
            <li> Highly recommed the quality!</li>
            <li> I ended up ordered several more of these because they look so classy on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks so nice, not cheap at all.</li>
            <li> It actually looks pretty cool when done that way.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that I&#x27;ve completely validated the idea of buying as many lipsticks as I want.</li>
            <li> I guess you could put the Mac lippies in the compartment bottoms down but that defeats the purpose of being able to see the different shades easily.    </li>
            <li> I have an unhealthy amount of lipsticks and wanted a nice clean orderly way to keep them.</li>
            <li> It is a very sturdy and well made, which is nice because some organizers I have  had in the past were very flimsy.</li>
            <li> It looks way better than my other makeup organizer that I got at target years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, when I put my lipsticks in the holders, they all fall over to the side (just as many other reviewers have reported.)  </li>
            <li> so badly it&#x27;s a super sleek little device that would fit in all of my cubbies for storage.  </li>
            <li> The product seems to be very durable and made of high quality acrylic.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice holder - not too big and not too small.  </li>
            <li> It fits most lipsticks and the acrylic is so smooth &amp; thick!</li>
            <li> Lipstick tubes that are not flat on top (such as MAC, Julie Hewett, Besame Cosmetics, and so on) flop to the side.</li>
            <li> When I do this, most of them wobble and fall slightly to the side.  </li>
            <li> This is phenomenal and I would definitely purchase another in the future.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of these organizers in the future.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m definitely ordering more, I will go for the bigger size....loved it,,....</li>
            <li> It is a chic display that allows me quick access to a specific color, as I store my lipsticks name side up.</li>
            <li> of my \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; Estee Lauder Pure Color lipsticks in the square gold cases fit really well upside down in this organizer.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this, sturdy and looks very classy!</li>
            <li> The whole purpose of organizing my multiple lipsticks is to simplify my routine, and if I wanted to pull each one out to hunt for the right color, I might as well leave the lipsticks in my vanity drawer.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Feels like high quality;  </li>
            <li> i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> It feels and looks like it is high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> High quality</li>
            <li> high quality plastic.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> You can put the taller things like lipgloss in the back, and it&#x27;s large enough that all your brands of lipstick should fit.</li>
            <li> It is very nicely made, thick and sturdy, but I do agree with the other reviews that said the sides should be higher.  </li>
            <li> Some lipsticks may be too wide to fit in the slots (like my YSL one).</li>
            <li> Gonna buy a few more.</li>
            <li> Worth it to get especially when it&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> I do not care to see the labels on top because it is messy looking so</li>
            <li> Lip Fusion glosses are square but taller, and these will fall over if the stand is moved or jiggled at all (top heavy).</li>
            <li> These are mostly samples I received in gifts with purchase, but I have quite a few.</li>
            <li> Material nice n thick n sturdy.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy construction - thick acrylic.  </li>
            <li> My lipsticks used to live in a drawer</li>
            <li> Fit all my lipsticks from multiple different brands...</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a tad wider, but this actually works better for my needs.</li>
            <li> Very cute, not to big or to small.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavy to not flop over and holds lipstick very nicely.</li>
            <li> I thought it was all flat and not angled, but it did not ultimately make any difference and it works fine for what I needed it to do.</li>
            <li> However; I will say that I was very surprised by the sturdy design of this organizer.  </li>
            <li> High quality and crystal clear material.</li>
            <li> when i first open the box, i am so surprise.</li>
            <li> This lipstick organizer works pretty well for the smaller bottles.  </li>
            <li> My NARS lipsticks (like my fav Niagara) are shorter than average and have square cases, so these fit verynicely.</li>
            <li> When stored with the cap up, it&#x27;s more stable because the weight of the case helps keep it upright in spite of the small case diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The compartments are low, I wish they could be a little higher so that lipsticks with rounded tips (I.e MAC) would fit in without tipping to the side.</li>
            <li> I have a few &amp;#34;plus sized&amp;#34; lipsticks and this organizer fits them just fine.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a craft organizer for little bottles, and this looked to fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Cute little way to organize your makeup and display it at the same time.  </li>
            <li> If the slots were taller, I could have put other lipsticks (taller sizes) in the slots, but since they are so short, you will be limited to what kind of lipsticks you put in</li>
            <li> but this is crystal clear and shiny.  </li>
            <li> It is a 24 space sturdy clear acrylic lipstick holder.</li>
            <li> Way nicer than I thought it would be....sturdy and shiny clear.</li>
            <li> It holds them upright and easier to tell apart a lipstick by the clear bottom of the case.</li>
            <li> By the way, I also purchased the US Acrylic clear multi tier nail polish organizer.</li>
            <li> Whether your lipstick is round or square, they&#x27;ll fit.</li>
            <li> Makes all of my make up look like a professional display.</li>
            <li> So, I have this product added to my wishlist and will purchase at least a couple more as I make additional purchases on Amazon.</li>
            <li> From Kat von D liquid lipstick, MAC, Urban Decay, a whole bunch of Tarte lipsurgence,  Stila, Melted too faced, Nyx, you know it</li>
            <li> The tilted stand only holds 12 lipsticks, but it is much deeper</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the quality of the product</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product, and if I accumulate a few more lipsticks I will repurchase it.</li>
            <li> picture is a flat acrylic, mine was elevated a little at the top</li>
            <li> for storing MAC lipsticks upside down, yes, they&#x27;ll lean (because of the bullet shaped top) but you can make one row lean in one direction and the next row in the opposite direction.</li>
            <li> However, I have found this height (based on researching different organization options) to be pretty standard for lipstick holders.  </li>
            <li> However, 1\\&quot;high isn&#x27;t quite as deep as I needed.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s high quality material, fits my 7 different brands of lipstick.</li>
            <li> This feels very solid and like it is high quality  </li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a lipstick organizer.  </li>
            <li> This replaced my old acrylic lipstick holder which would not hold the new larger lipstick cases.  </li>
            <li> I really like that the organizer is clear, almost like glass vs cloudy clear like other acrylic organizers.</li>
            <li> They look a lot more expensive than they really are sitting on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Clinique lippies are cylindrical with flat bottoms (light green cases).</li>
            <li> The second order I recieved a different 24 slot holder that was slanted or trapezoidal in shape instead of the flat rectangular one that I got the first time.</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a holder for my essential oil bottles from Young Living.  </li>
            <li> This is not bad but the size is small.  </li>
            <li> I should subtract two stars for functionality, but I won&#x27;t because some people are fine with the shallow slots.</li>
            <li> then I bought 2 more for lipstick and other small items.</li>
            <li> I work for a small cosmetic company and needed something to keep all our lipsticks in where I could find any color I needed, quickly.</li>
            <li> I do really like the holder, will look for something else to hold my Mac lippies but for the other brands I have (elf, milani, nyx, loreal, Jordana, revlon)</li>
            <li> problem is that the slots are barely over an inch deep.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, this arrived in  less than  a week.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the slots aren&#x27;t tall enough to hold MAC lipsticks straight when they are upside down.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a little flimsy because it was so cheap, but this thing is heavy (for it&#x27;s size).</li>
            <li> The shallow slots cannot support/hold up most of my lipsticks which makes it a lot less functional for my purposes.</li>
            <li> My NYX Matte were slightly wobbly, but my Wet n Wild (the long skinny ones) were very wobbly.</li>
            <li> The only problem is I wish it was a bit higher as I store my mac lipsticks upside down to see the names and due to the tubes design</li>
            <li> This lipstick organizer is identical to the other company who offers the acrylic products for lipstick.</li>
            <li> I might get a few other items from the other styles they have available</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s just fine for the price:) I&#x27;d have to say the only bad thing is that i have to fill all 24 spaces!!</li>
            <li> Thought these were flat lipstick holders like in the picture</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to share information about ease of cleaning/maintaining it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits all of my lipsticks (even the fat maybelline lipsticks), and it will definitely last a very long time.  </li>
            <li> because of the price, I expected a cheap thin lipstick organizer.</li>
            <li> Heavy, solid, clear acrylic.  </li>
            <li> Its wide enough to hold various sizes/brands of lipsticks    </li>
            <li> the fact that it is not deep enough for actual gloss tubes, or upside down mac lipsticks, does not bother me one bit.</li>
            <li> little item worked well for me, my lipsticks had to be stood upright so the names of them were on the bottom,  and I purchased the clear one.</li>
            <li> The plastic is perfectly clear, sturdy, heavy, and durable.  </li>
            <li> Wide enough for thicker lipstick cases.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why Imput up.w/ items falling &amp; rolling around in drawers so long.</li>
            <li> I had some empty slots left in the organizer.  </li>
            <li> Need to be extra careful.  </li>
            <li> As others have posted, the holder is not tall, so long, skinny lipsticks will sit at an angle.  </li>
            <li> fits basic lipstics like M.A.C. and Maybelline but not Kat Von D or something bigger than a regular round M.A.C. or square Maybelline.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not surprised.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and the glass is thick.</li>
            <li> but I go wish it was a little taller so that my round lipsticks wouldn&#x27;t lean over as much</li>
            <li> I only wished the actual dividers were a little longer</li>
            <li> I ordered several other acrylic organizers for jewelry and makeup also.</li>
            <li> When I wanted a second one, I had to wait until I had other items on Amazon to purchase.  </li>
            <li> only dislike for this product is that the walls are a little low</li>
            <li> was looking for a specific one, not exact fron picture.</li>
            <li> Better suited for lipsticks with a straight or round flat base.</li>
            <li> If I had input on a redesign on this holder, I would make it at least 2 inches high for added stability.</li>
            <li> and I found with my limited space</li>
            <li> The design and quality was way above average.</li>
            <li> But Not Perfect)&lt;br /&gt;Stored upside down, my Lipstick Queen Medieval rolls and flops around a bit.  </li>
            <li> After shopping around for similar acrylic lipstick holders, though, this was my choice as it was a far less expensive way to hold 24 lipsticks in a clear acrylic option.  </li>
            <li> tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLINIQUE LIPSTICKS (Got On My Last Little</li>
            <li> Made of very thick acrylic and very well.</li>
            <li> item was received timely and was as expected</li>
            <li> It even holds a few of my regular 5mL vials.  </li>
            <li> Came carefully packed.</li>
            <li> The only lipstick that did not fit was my Laura Mercier.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> Only thing is I have Mac lipsticks in narrow tubes</li>
            <li> Simple and not cheap.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that the labels showing the names of the lipsticks is hidden, and with lipsticks such as MAC, you cannot display them bottom up to show the label using this organizer.</li>
            <li> I wish US Acrylic offered the other organizer to.  </li>
            <li> I realize I could turn the tubes over so their bottoms rest on the bottom of the holder (in other words, place the tubes into the holder so they stand upright), but then how would I know what the color is without having to remove each tube and inspect the label on the bottom until I find the one I want?</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small enough to put in my cupboard of my nail.</li>
            <li> This starts a domino effect by falling into the other lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Fits all my lipstick and glosses not to big nor to small</li>
            <li> Fits all my lipsticks so far and acrylic is thick !</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not worth it since the tray was $14.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Is very sturdy and expensive looking.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have about this product is that it is part of the add-on program.  </li>
            <li> They are average height, cylindrical, and jiggle/flop all over the place in this organizer, regardless of position of the cap.</li>
            <li> so I turned it upside down</li>
            <li> It holds lipstick and upside down nail polish and keeps it all neat.  </li>
            <li> or if you plan on storing MAC lipsticks upside down (so that that point is facing downward).</li>
            <li> This lets me stand them upside down</li>
            <li> If you want to put the MAC lipsticks down side up</li>
            <li> , I am not one that likes to organize lipstick upside down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MAC lipsticks with the bullet style caps won&#x27;t remain stable when stored upside down in this organizer.</li>
            <li> /flopping goes on when the caps are down.</li>
            <li> I noticed that the MAC Sheen Supreme tubes are not stable in either the up or down position.</li>
            <li> No jiggling or flopping around regardless of whether the cap is up or down.</li>
            <li> When stored with the caps down, they still unstable and floppy.</li>
            <li> I still prefer to store them caps down-&gt;label up, and there is quite a bit of jiggling/flopping when they are stored with the caps down.</li>
            <li> Unless you store those label-side down, they will wobble.  </li>
            <li> A lot of my lipsticks have rounded or embossed tops, and I like to put them in upside down, so I can see the color name on the bottom.</li>
            <li> they all fall to the side slightly.</li>
            <li> The spaces are too shallow and actually a little too big</li>
            <li> Butter lipsticks (it&#x27;s a little tall, so</li>
            <li> I have a lot of lipsticks and little mascaras</li>
            <li> Would like the sides to be a little taller</li>
            <li> In some instances, we have to bend our expectations a little bit.</li>
            <li> fits very tightly upside down, but does not go in all the way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES</li>
            <li> did not fit</li>
            <li> It is surprisingly heavy and sturdy....very well made.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s as heavy as a glass one would be.</li>
            <li> BUT my Burberry lipsticks did not fit and Armani didn&#x27;t either.</li>
            <li> It holds all my buxom lipgloss and the few lipsticks I have.</li>
            <li> It might be A BIT heavy</li>
            <li> however it will not fit Kat Von D lipsticks.</li>
            <li> She loves that it&#x27;s of a heavy quality and stays in place on her vanity.</li>
            <li> I usually store my lipsticks upside down (label facing up).</li>
            <li> Other than that, I have no issues and the material is thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Packs a lot of storage into a small space.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to put my  small sample perfumes  </li>
            <li> I am not sure about the newer Estee Lauder lipsticks.</li>
            <li> small item for the 24 items.</li>
            <li> From the picture, it looks a little thin, but this is a heavy duty organizer.</li>
            <li> however, the plastic is very thick, and heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I am the least qualified person to speak about the functionality of this product.  </li>
            <li> Thick, no cracks.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> the compartments are too shallow,</li>
            <li> Definitely not a good option for these.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very thick and doesn&#x27;t look like it could break.</li>
            <li> It is a very thick and sturdy acrylic which is the norm for u.s. Acrylic products</li>
            <li> Just a little disappointed that the squares are too small for some of my lipsticks</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to sit the lipsticks upright</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will be returning it for the slanted/tilted lipstick stand on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> so I have no idea what went wrong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve a serious attraction to lipstick!!  </li>
            <li> so there&#x27;s no cause to be unhappy.  </li>
            <li> I was worried the quality was going to be bad because of the price</li>
            <li> The price is not that bad either.</li>
            <li> Once again me and that youtube :(</li>
            <li> I hate the hassle of returning an item, but I just can&#x27;t see keeping this one as it serves no purpose.</li>
            <li> This deception was created with the reflective base used in the picture.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed and would like to return this product,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dreadful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love everything I received!</li>
            <li> Love them! Fits perfectly in my Ikea &amp;#34;MICKE&amp;#34; drawers!&lt;br /&gt;(Would not recommend if you want your Mac lipsticks with the label up, as these holders will not support them upside-down. They will topple and lean over. But if you&#x27;re like me who doesn&#x27;t mind having to guess and look at the labels one by one, these are perfect!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I know---&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FITS:&lt;br /&gt;Mac lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;Lancome &#x27;Le Rouge Absolu&#x27; lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;Revlon lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;NYC lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;NYC Expert Last lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;Maybelline Color Whispers&lt;br /&gt;Jordana lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;Love &amp; Beauty lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;Flirt! lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strange Fits:&lt;br /&gt;Nyx Butter lipsticks (it&#x27;s a little tall, so it may lean or topple)&lt;br /&gt;Nyx Diamond Sparkle lipsticks (It&#x27;s chunky... fits very tightly upside down, but does not go in all the way)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT FIT:&lt;br /&gt;American Beauty lipsticks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have lipsticks that are about the same size and diameter of any of the ones that I&#x27;ve listed fits, then you should be good. :)</li>
            <li> I have a Mazda Miata Mx-5 and it doesn&#x27;t work for my vents. I wanted this to work so badly it&#x27;s a super sleek little device that would fit in all of my cubbies for storage.  If any one else has a mx5 please suggest a mount that work for our vehicles and the iPhone 6 Plus. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous!!!</li>
            <li> Well made and very sturdy! Great price for the value too!</li>
            <li> Great lipstick organizer!</li>
            <li> I got this product in the mail ONE DAY after ordering! Could not believe it! I am also very happy with the holder, I think it will hold up for awhile!</li>
            <li> I give this 5 stars because it look just like the picture. It came on time and I would recommend this to anyone</li>
            <li> I Love this. Made well and stores a great deal of lipsticks. Perfect for a makeup hoarder like myself. ;)</li>
            <li> Perfect for my new growing lipstick collection. I love the acrylic part of it, it&#x27;s not the cheapy kind of plastic. Looks great on my new (and growing) vanity table !</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Heavy, solid, clear acrylic.  Wide enough for thicker lipstick cases.  Very useful.  Packs a lot of storage into a small space.</li>
            <li> Very happy with product, quality and pricing.</li>
            <li> This organizer is really sturdy! I was able to fit all my lipsticks as well.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Exactly what I needed it to be. Fits perfectly in an Ikea helmer.</li>
            <li> Fits all my lipsticks so far and acrylic is thick !</li>
            <li> Like it, only thing is some of my mac lip sticks won&#x27;t fit but over all looks great. And has a good price for it</li>
            <li> I actually saw this product listed on a youtube video and thought it would be perfect. Ordered it and I could not be more pleased. Good buy.</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these, as I have a huge lipstick collection.  These are quality units and look nice sitting on my vanity and the shelves of my medicine cabinet.  They also make one with smaller holes for glosses.  These would look great in a retail setting for selling any number of things.</li>
            <li> I bought several of these to house all of my babies and I love them.</li>
            <li> I purchased these after doing some research online as to how to organize watercolor paint tubes.  They are just what I needed to keep my art table clean and organized.  They would work great for lipstick as well.  They are very well made, with a nice heavy feel.  Perfect!</li>
            <li> I was debating between this lipstick holder and the byalegory one that costs more. I took a chance and bought this one and I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The acrylic is thick and nice and it looks amazing filled with my lipsticks. I actually just ordered my third one and can&#x27;t wait to get it in the mail.</li>
            <li> Daughter loves this, sturdy and looks very classy!</li>
            <li> It does a good job at keeping my lipsticks organized but I go wish it was a little taller so that my round lipsticks wouldn&#x27;t lean over as much</li>
            <li> This replaced my old acrylic lipstick holder which would not hold the new larger lipstick cases.  It is very nicely made, thick and sturdy, but I do agree with the other reviews that said the sides should be higher.  Any lipstick cases that are rounded or slanted tend to flop around instead of standing straight in the organizer.</li>
            <li> Love it. I recently had to order another one. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This fits MAC, Revlon, Maybelline and CoverGirl lipsticks. This is phenomenal and I would definitely purchase another in the future.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick organizer...it is not thin plastic, and it fits all my lipsticks, even the ones that aren&#x27;t perfectly round.</li>
            <li> I love it! Arrived super quick, and it just looks soo nice- the look of it and how it looks in your room. It is clear so it&#x27;ll go with anything and only one kind of lipstick did not fit so I turned it upside down and it fit. Whether your lipstick is round or square, they&#x27;ll fit. I am so happy that I bought this, it showcases all the pretty lipsticks you have.</li>
            <li> Nice quality. MAC lipsticks don&#x27;t fit perfectly but still great for necessities</li>
            <li> I love all shades of lipstick. It is very helpful to have them in an organizer. I bought one at first then I bought 2 more for lipstick and other small items.</li>
            <li> item was received timely and was as expected</li>
            <li> Like shoes, a woman can never have too many lipsticks....having purchased the Lipstick Organizer I can now, locate&lt;br /&gt;my lipstick selection without pulling them out of the drawer one at a time.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Love it will be purchasing another 😄</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick organizer! It fits a good amount of shades and it fits in my vanity drawers perfectly and the acrylic doesn&#x27;t look or feel cheap. It&#x27;s a good weight. I only wished the actual dividers were a little longer so I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy a whole seprerate one for my lip glosses and liquid lipsticks.</li>
            <li> High quality for a great price. I will continue to repurchase these. They look a lot more expensive than they really are sitting on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Love this organizer! It is exactly what i was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love it! I have been looking for a lipstick holder that is one size so it fits in my drawer! Finally found one thats cheap and good quality!</li>
            <li> I love this product. My only problem is it cannot holds taller lipsticks or glosses. It hold my avon lipsticks quite nicely. It&#x27;s made of sturdy acrylic that does not look cheap.</li>
            <li> superrrr fast delivery and i love my lipstick holder. I think i will order another one. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very sturdy fit all different types of lipsticks mac, nars, and maybeline.</li>
            <li> Fits almost all lipstick sizes, great for organizing.</li>
            <li> Solid construction. Definitely not made in China. Excellent product at a good price.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. I plan to buy one more as I have more lipstick then I thought. It looks good on top of your vanity and takes up little space.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and did not find in stores.  It holds lipstick and upside down nail polish and keeps it all neat.  Thanks for sending it to me so fast!</li>
            <li> I really like this product! Great quality and no cracks! Just wish the slots were deeper</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this item ! It holds all my lippies in place and I just love it!</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s for lipsticks, but I needed something to contain and organize my essential oil roller bottles (10mL).  This is great.  The rollers would be more stable if the &amp;#34;walls&amp;#34; were taller but it&#x27;s not designed for what I&#x27;m using it for so there&#x27;s no cause to be unhappy.  It even holds a few of my regular 5mL vials.  My bottles stay upright, don&#x27;t fall over and I can organize them, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> Good product which allows for organization of lipsticks &amp; other small,cosmetics.  Don&#x27;t know why Imput up.w/ items falling &amp; rolling around in drawers so long.</li>
            <li> This is a really great holder for my lipsticks.  The only problem is I wish it was a bit higher as I store my mac lipsticks upside down to see the names and due to the tubes design they all fall to the side slightly.</li>
            <li> This is a great lipstick organizer for those who love makeup n cant seem to get it all organize defenitly would recommend this n other acrilic organizers</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very nice holder - not too big and not too small.  It fits any lipstick, lip gloss, chapstick, etc nicely.  I love that I&#x27;m able to see what I have and not have to dig through a makeup bag anymore.  I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great purchase!!!  I was worried the quality was going to be bad because of the price but it is very sturdy and cute.  Sometimes with products like this the material can have an almost cloudy or opaque appearance to it but this is crystal clear and shiny.  A definite must if you have a lot of lip products and want them readily available to choose from!</li>
            <li> 5 starts, it has organized my makeup fantastically!</li>
            <li> Awesome product fits all my lipsticks</li>
            <li> Fit all my lipsticks from multiple different brands...Mac,lime crime,nyx. Will be ordering more as one didn&#x27;t fit my whole collection! Really nice quality as well especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a craft organizer for little bottles, and this looked to fit the bill. However, 1\\&quot;high isn&#x27;t quite as deep as I needed.  It is heavy duty, yet light, so would be perfect as a lipstick holder.  Be sure to pay attention to dimensions if you want it for something else.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is crystal clear and strong and it fits perfectly in my vanity drawer. I would definitely recommend this product, and if I accumulate a few more lipsticks I will repurchase it. Nice, high quality product.</li>
            <li> I love them! I purchased 2 of them because they are so cute and organize my lipsticks very well. They are so cute!</li>
            <li> I work for a small cosmetic company and needed something to keep all our lipsticks in where I could find any color I needed, quickly. This is just what I was looking for, and, best of all, it fits perfectly in my large caboodle! Love it!</li>
            <li> Great product. Amazed how fast it arrived!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased with this tray. It&#x27;s high quality material, fits my 7 different brands of lipstick.</li>
            <li> awesome1 its what i wanted.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of lipsticks and little mascaras and I&#x27;m not a neat freak but actually this is very handy. It was an impulse purchase. Maybe I&#x27;ll get one for upstairs too. I can never find the colors I&#x27;m looking for in a drawer</li>
            <li> I purchased two of this lipstick holder only $13.49 for each.it is pretty much good deal.  when i first open the box, i am so surprise. it is very nice and fit all of my lipsticks! im really liking this holder. definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shopping around for a lipstick holder that can hold numerous lipsticks and is durable. This was exactly what I was looking for!  I&#x27;m soo happy I purchased it. You&#x27;re gonna love it!</li>
            <li> I was very suprised about the quality of this lipstick organizer. It&#x27;s a little heavy to not flop over and holds lipstick very nicely.</li>
            <li> Organization of lipstcks has always been an issue for me.  This tray is perfect.  Would recommend,  I bought 2</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sturdy almost like glass! All of my lipsticks fit great and I  have various sizes.</li>
            <li> This lipstick organizer is identical to the other company who offers the acrylic products for lipstick. Compacts, eyeshadow and lipgloss organizers.  This is the same great product at half the cost.  I wish US Acrylic offered the other organizer to.  Will definitely reorder from this company again.</li>
            <li> Perfect organizer and very sturdy!</li>
            <li> I love it. I received it fast.</li>
            <li> Love this! Perfect for your lipstick and vanity.</li>
            <li> This lipstick holder is fantastic, it is exactly what I wanted. It is a 24 space sturdy clear acrylic lipstick holder. It fits most lipsticks (the Kat Von D studded kiss lipsticks are too big but sit nicely on top of the holder). It arrived nicely packaged in a box and is working great. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This caddy is almost perfect and just what I needed for all my lipsticks of various shapes. My octagon-shaped, square-shaped and rounded lipsticks all fit in here, although some of the non-round ones fit rather snugly. I would recommend this product--I am so glad I bought it! Oh, and it fits in my bathroom vanity drawer even with the lipsticks loaded in it!</li>
            <li> Way nicer than I thought it would be....sturdy and shiny clear. Great purchase,</li>
            <li> Well made and the price tag was better. Received very fast</li>
            <li> This came just as pictured. I use it for my lipsticks and my lip gloss and it works great. It is a very sturdy and well made, which is nice because some organizers I have  had in the past were very flimsy. I love this one, It works perfect!</li>
            <li> This is a very very nice Lipstick organizer. It is compact and looks great. All my lipsticks are now organized. Love it and planning to buy one more for my mom in India.</li>
            <li> Looks nice and it&#x27;s very convienant. I have two of these (the second one has 3 open spots so it&#x27;s almost full) and out of all my lipsticks I&#x27;ve only had one that didn&#x27;t fit! It fits the popular brands like Maybelline, Covergirl, NYX, Revlon, MAC, etc.</li>
            <li> I love it, very practical and sleek</li>
            <li> organized my makeup drawer</li>
            <li> really good prodcut i love it, i will buy another in the future. all my lips stick fit and i love it makes them look neat and organized.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Very good quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a lipstick caddy to organize my lipsticks.  Most of what I find are those that hold maybe 8 lipsticks.  I wanted one to hold many more.  I was so pleased when I found this one.  It is surprisingly heavy and sturdy....very well made.  I am very happy with my purchase and a little more organized too!</li>
            <li> Great product. I have it packaged still because I&#x27;m thinking where to place my vanity, but opening them up they look expensive and great quality!</li>
            <li> because of the price, I expected a cheap thin lipstick organizer. however, the plastic is very thick, and heavy duty. all of my lipsticks (MAC and Nyx) fit perfectly. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of this product! it looks beautiful on my vanity</li>
            <li> These are the best for storing your lippies. Organization is key when it comes to makeup and these do not disappoint 😘</li>
            <li> Love it. My lipsticks look great in it.</li>
            <li> Loved this acrylic storage unit. Made my vanity nd lipsticks come to life. Came carefully packed. Fast shipping, and i&#x27;ll deff order more!</li>
            <li> Overall good ! Just a little disappointed that the squares are too small for some of my lipsticks</li>
            <li> Perfect organizer for lipsticks and doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space! Gonna buy a few more.</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase, looks great on my vanity. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love these acrylic lipstick holders! And the shipping was extremely fast</li>
            <li> Great product! Fair price. My lipstick perfectly. Will probably order some more. Do you also carry one for lipglosses?</li>
            <li> It just what I needed. I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m huge on watching YouTube beauty gurus, and they all seem to have acrylic organizers.  This lipstick organizer was seriously breathtaking when I took it out of the box. It&#x27;s just much prettier in person than a picture.  It fits all of my lipsticks (even the fat maybelline lipsticks), and it will definitely last a very long time.  Very good quality.  It is definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ! Should have bought 2 of these. Very sturdy and holds all my brands. Will definitely reorder !!!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It fits all of my lipstick and the quality of this is amazing. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is so handy to find lipstick shades quickly--I organize mine from light to darks.</li>
            <li> these are super helpful, well made products, incredibly happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I got 2 of them already</li>
            <li> I love it! I will be buying more as I miscalculated the amount of lipsticks I have. Will even buy in bulk. Has some weight to it so no worries of it moving or breaking easily.</li>
            <li> the woman loves it...so do i as there aren&#x27;t lipsticks all over the dressing table. lol probably will be ordering another one of these soon.</li>
            <li> When organizing my lipstick collection I had some empty slots left in the organizer.  I then started sticking my mascara cases and it fits too!  Now I don&#x27;t have mascara tubes rolling around my desk and drawers.  Love this organzier!</li>
            <li> I like this lipstick holder and the price is just right. I just wish that my lipstick didn&#x27;t have so much room in between, but it&#x27;s nice to know that I can put different sizes in it.</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick holder. I was expecting it to be a little flimsy because it was so cheap, but this thing is heavy (for it&#x27;s size). It&#x27;s as heavy as a glass one would be. The only negatives would be the one inch height. All my Revlon, NYC, l&#x27;oreal, and Milani lipstick fit perfectly. My NYX Matte were slightly wobbly, but my Wet n Wild (the long skinny ones) were very wobbly. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one if you have a lot of that style Wet n Wild lipsticks.</li>
            <li> As pictured, came well packaged and as described. Fits most lipsticks!</li>
            <li> So neat and so clean! and good quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be ordering another one soon.</li>
            <li> My wife loves that it has plenty of room for all her lipsticks and glosses, and even her concealer fits in it well.</li>
            <li> I love this. Very worth it!!! The perfect size for the top of the dresser. I wish I bought another one</li>
            <li> I thought it was all flat and not angled, but it did not ultimately make any difference and it works fine for what I needed it to do. Worth it to get especially when it&#x27;s on sale. I might get a few other items from the other styles they have available</li>
            <li> I loved the locket the first time I used it. Once I put oil in it, the locket tarnished and turned colors.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and met my needs.  It arrived unscathed in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This lipstick holder is an affordable option to the some of the more expensive brands of acrylics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It arrived in perfect condition, and it holds almost all my lipsticks, except the full size KVD Studded Lipsticks.  I ended up ordered several more of these because they look so classy on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the dividers aren&#x27;t that tall, it won&#x27;t work well for lipgloss tubes or if you plan on storing MAC lipsticks upside down (so that that point is facing downward).</li>
            <li> I actually used this to organize all my stud earrings and it works great! Made of very thick acrylic and very well. I ordered several other acrylic organizers for jewelry and makeup also. These are fantastic!!</li>
            <li> This organizer exceeded my expectations. It appears to be durable and is great to hold plenty of lipsticks and lip glosses.</li>
            <li> Great quality loved this</li>
            <li> Holds all my mac lipsticks. Doesn&#x27;t feel cheap or flimsy. I love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to put my  small sample perfumes  in and it works great looks real nice and now I can see all the samples that I received and now use them.</li>
            <li> Great, not cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holds many different brands: Mac, YSL, ect...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fits in many drawers, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good idea</li>
            <li> This lipstick holder is very sturdy and well made. It also has a tiny footprint, which is great considering it holds 24 lipsticks (or other similarly-sized items, like mini mascaras).     If I had input on a redesign on this holder, I would make it at least 2 inches high for added stability. Lipstick tubes that are not flat on top (such as MAC, Julie Hewett, Besame Cosmetics, and so on) flop to the side. They stay in place, but they don&#x27;t stand up straight. I realize I could turn the tubes over so their bottoms rest on the bottom of the holder (in other words, place the tubes into the holder so they stand upright), but then how would I know what the color is without having to remove each tube and inspect the label on the bottom until I find the one I want? The whole purpose of organizing my multiple lipsticks is to simplify my routine, and if I wanted to pull each one out to hunt for the right color, I might as well leave the lipsticks in my vanity drawer. I would not repurchase, and I will continue looking for a 5-star lipstick holder.</li>
            <li> Cute and great quality!!</li>
            <li> This organizer is so perfect! I am going to keep restocking this item. It is safe to order this product without worrying about visible glue. It fits most lipsticks and the acrylic is so smooth &amp; thick! Looks perfect in my vanity!</li>
            <li> Good quality acrylic but the compartments are too shallow, all but the shortest lipsticks don&#x27;t stand up straight, bounce around when opening the drawer.</li>
            <li> Plan to order more.  I&#x27;ve a serious attraction to lipstick!!  Nice grade of plastic - not thin or flimsy either.  Perfect way to organize!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this lipstick organizer.&lt;br /&gt;With this, my lipsticks look so organized and easy to grab and find!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> As pictured and it works.</li>
            <li> I am the least qualified person to speak about the functionality of this product.  However; I will say that I was very surprised by the sturdy design of this organizer.  I purchased three of them for my wife and she was extremely happy -- so for this reason, I would say it was a great purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered two, and was very pleased. They came in perfect condition, no scratches like most acrylic cases and they organize my lipsticks perfectly. I&#x27;m so pleased!</li>
            <li> I love this. I had one that was only two rows, and used it in my medicine cabinet. This one is three rows, and longer. I was concerned that it might be too wide to fit on the med cabinet shelf, but it fits perfectly. You can put the taller things like lipgloss in the back, and it&#x27;s large enough that all your brands of lipstick should fit. Some may kind of fall over a little, but they don&#x27;t go all the way over, so I&#x27;m so cool with it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s heavy acrylic, feels nice and smooth and quality, and I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and it hold lipsticks and crayons.</li>
            <li> Considering how inexpensive this is, I was expecting one of those cheap plastic trays you&#x27;d find at Target. Nope!!! Not at all!!! This thing is nice and thick, super cute, and holds all of my lipsticks, lip glosses and liquid lipsticks. I&#x27;d highly recommend this!!!</li>
            <li> If you are a lipstick fanatic, it is a great way to keep the many types of lipsticks together. The slots are the right size for MAC lipsticks. It holds them upright and easier to tell apart a lipstick by the clear bottom of the case.</li>
            <li> I love this. It was fast shipping and very accurate on description. No complaints or anything. Great as gift for my sister. Thankyou!</li>
            <li> Love love these using them to store my lippies and love them!</li>
            <li> The product is a good quality, however it didn&#x27;t fit my need.  I was looking for an organizer that will hold the lipsticks while they are still in their boxes so that I can better organize my Mary Kay inventory.  I will definitely offer them to my customers though!</li>
            <li> This organizer is nice and sturdy and so far fits all of the lipsticks I own.  Would like the sides to be a little taller but a great product overall</li>
            <li> Love this lipstick organizer! Got one as a gift on Christmas, and loved it so much that I ordered another. Looks so nice, not cheap at all.</li>
            <li> very good quality!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my lipstick collection !!</li>
            <li> I love these organizers SO much they don&#x27;t look cheap at all. I was so happy and excited. . My Mac, Tarte, YSL, Dior, and Bobbi Browns all fit nicely. BUT my Burberry lipsticks did not fit and Armani didn&#x27;t either. Other then that it&#x27;s great!!!! I&#x27;m going to buy 2 more.</li>
            <li> I am definitely going to be purchasing more of these soon!</li>
            <li> I have a few &amp;#34;plus sized&amp;#34; lipsticks and this organizer fits them just fine.  The plastic is perfectly clear, sturdy, heavy, and durable.  Consider it a lifetime purchase.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed to organize the lip colors.</li>
            <li> Great  way to organizes lipstick and having it out in the open, easy to look for what you need.</li>
            <li> I actually got this to put my striped polishes in for the salon and it holds them all it&#x27;s small enough to put in my cupboard of my nail. Desk</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas she&#x27;s really into makeup and needs to have a lot of organization this really fit the bill with her lipsticks and her mascaras</li>
            <li> Exactly as described! Love it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using these in my vanity drawer. It holds all my buxom lipgloss and the few lipsticks I have. See my photo!</li>
            <li> This product is great!. I use it for my mac, maybelline and sephora lipsticks. The only lipstick that did not fit was my Laura Mercier. The lipstick was a bit big. Other than that, I have no issues and the material is thick and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Thought these were flat lipstick holders like in the picture but they are staggered which is not what I wanted. Need to update the picture.</li>
            <li> This is my second review and I&#x27;ve been shopping with Amazon for years.  I couldn&#x27;t believe how short the slots are.  The lipsticks wobble when I move the tray.  I have Revlon, MAC, Estée Lauder lipsticks.  Unfortunately, I have to sit the lipsticks upright (so they don&#x27;t wobble as much) and therefore, cannot see the lipstick color names.  If the slots were taller, I could have put other lipsticks (taller sizes) in the slots, but since they are so short, you will be limited to what kind of lipsticks you put in this container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very disappointed and would like to return this product, but it&#x27;s not worth it since the tray was $14.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have one positive feedback; it&#x27;s made very well.</li>
            <li> I am promptly ordering a second after I finish this review! This lipstick organizer is just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s no larger than necessary so it&#x27;s very sleek and stylish for in the drawer or on top of a makeup vanity. Makes all of my make up look like a professional display. Perfect addition to my bathroom studio!</li>
            <li> Came on time, and exactly what i ordered. Loved it!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone with too many lipsticks like myself.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to sit on top of my Muji acrylic drawers and it looks great! It&#x27;s well made and got it very quickly!</li>
            <li> Finally I can organize all my lipsticks instead of just throwing them in my top draw and have to pick up each one when I want a certain color. This lets me stand them upside down so I can easily ready each color and pick the one I want to wear that day.  Love it and I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Its made of very sturdy material;  Feels like high quality;  Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room despite the fact that it has 24 compartments;  Its wide enough to hold various sizes/brands of lipsticks    Cons  The compartments are low, I wish they could be a little higher so that lipsticks with rounded tips (I.e MAC) would fit in without tipping to the side. I guess you could put the Mac lippies in the compartment bottoms down but that defeats the purpose of being able to see the different shades easily.    I do really like the holder, will look for something else to hold my Mac lippies but for the other brands I have (elf, milani, nyx, loreal, Jordana, revlon) this fits perfectly. Will re-purchase!</li>
            <li> This is a gift from the heavens for a lipstick and lipgloss fiend like myself. It&#x27;s sturdy and you can put any type of lipstick in it you want. It&#x27;s a great place to store your extra lipsticks that won&#x27;t fit in your regular makeup organizer. Buy it!</li>
            <li> Fun product!  Cute little way to organize your makeup and display it at the same time.  Glad I bought it!</li>
            <li> Came nicely packaged in its own box. Is very sturdy and expensive looking. It looks like glass. Loving it.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I wanted and fit perfectly in my drawer.  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> beautiful heavy acrylic!  would buy again</li>
            <li> Great product. Great quality. Thick, no cracks.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I would change is make it taller. My taller thinner lippys sit crooked in this and I don&#x27;t like how it looks.</li>
            <li> An easy organization lipstick holder. Does not look cheap, but the price is!</li>
            <li> I love the lipstick organizer so much that I ordered another one! I love that the organizer is so compact and holds all my lipstick in one place.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as expected. No dings, scratches or blemishes. It holds even my fatter tubes of lipstick and looks stylish.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with this lipstick holder, it seems to fit all the lipsticks I own of all brands. It&#x27;s great to display your prettiest lipsticks (packaging-wise).</li>
            <li> Love it. All my brands of lipstick fit</li>
            <li> Perfect for lipsticks, and glosses. Sometimes they do fall over, but they don&#x27;t fall out. I think I may get another one.</li>
            <li> perfect size for any size of lipsticks! Revlon, l&#x27;oreal, MAC, Milani,and etc.</li>
            <li> The organizer has allowed me to organize my lipsticks for the first time ever.  I am delighted with this product.</li>
            <li> Material nice n thick n sturdy.</li>
            <li> Great quality! I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I ordered this acrylic lipstick oranizer for my fiance and she loves me for it!!:) She uses it just for her (M.A.C.) lipstick...They don&#x27;t fit SNUG but it&#x27;s just fine for the price:) I&#x27;d have to say the only bad thing is that i have to fill all 24 spaces!! LOL</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this lipstick organizer. The acrylic looks so much better than plastic organizers, so I highly recommend paying the extra buck because it will really look so much better in your bathroom. The picture doesn&#x27;t even do this acrylic holder justice, it honestly looks so much nicer in person, I was so happy when it arrived and I saw how great it looked!</li>
            <li> I so love this lipstick holder. I have all my fav shade in each little cube and place nicely on my vanity table. If you love lipstick this is a great buy!!!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my growing collection of lipsticks. Only thing is I have Mac lipsticks in narrow tubes and it doesn&#x27;t hold those well but for my Revlon, Nars, and regular Mac it works perfectly and I am definitely buying another one.</li>
            <li> If you are considering buying this I strongly recommend it!! Great quality for a great price and shipped extremely fast! Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Love this product,  it&#x27;s affordable and now my vanity looks very organized.</li>
            <li> Great for the classic lipstick case but not for any unconventional shapes.</li>
            <li> Love it but if there a bigger one will be more helpful</li>
            <li> This is not bad but the size is small.  If you are looking for something simple to hold lipstick on vanity this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I love this so much! It fits all my lipsticks and the quality is very  nice. It&#x27;s sturdy and looks like glass! WIll be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I bought this to put in all of my lipsticks and my Mac ones don&#x27;t stand up so straight.  They wobble a lot and fall at times.  Need to be extra careful.  Clinique ones hold up a lot better, but I really needed them for the Mac ones.</li>
            <li> The plastic is very thick and doesn&#x27;t look like it could break. It holds my lipsticks and lip glosses perfectly. I loved it so much I got two for my sister and two for me.</li>
            <li> This holder fits nicely on my bathroom shelf.  I can finally see exactly how many lipsticks I have and what color they are.  I have a lot of Clinique and Elizabeth Arden lipsticks, and they fit well.</li>
            <li> The organizer is so nice to hold my lipsticks. Fits most lipsticks nicely. I use it to store my MAC lipsticks. If you want to put the MAC lipsticks down side up so you can see the name this isnt for you because they will just fall out.</li>
            <li> This organizer is a lot thicker than the picture shows. From the picture, it looks a little thin, but this is a heavy duty organizer. I&#x27;m sure I can drop it or throw it and it will not break. It&#x27;s great! I bought two and because its sturdy, I can even fit some of my smaller mascaras without them falling out. Worked out really well.</li>
            <li> Is okay-- all squares are not the consistent size and not all my lipstick will fit in all the holes-- lipsticks containers are the same, this is why I know the spaces are not.</li>
            <li> Just as it was described and is a great way to get yourself more organized.  I will order another one once I have more lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Solid, pleasantly looking lipstick organizer. Mostly for square ended lipstick containers. High quality and crystal clear material. Very reasonable pricing.</li>
            <li> perfect size for all lipsticks and this was the biggest that i found.. however i really need more than one of that holder.. i highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lip stick holder, its very sturdy and heavy not made out of cheap plastic like others. Looks very elegant on my vanity</li>
            <li> Love it! Holds regular size Lipsticks. Pretty small in size so it doesn&#x27;t take lots of space. Easier to find lipstick you are looking for rather than going through a drawer.</li>
            <li> I love this organisador, is well suitable and fits perfectly in my vanity drawer, and I like the material.is perfect</li>
            <li> Great for organization , I use mine in my jewelry cabinet to keep earrings,  rings etc. straight.  Works great!</li>
            <li> Was concerned this would be flimsy or cheap but it wasn&#x27;t.  Works perfectly and is made from quality materials.  Much more cost effective than purchasing from local beauty stores.</li>
            <li> Great exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Aesthetically, this is very nice and clean looking. It fits everything nicely. It feels and looks like it is high quality. Perfect way to organize my lipsticks!</li>
            <li> Great product just as described and fast arrival.</li>
            <li> I have purchased a couple of these now.  As others have posted, the holder is not tall, so long, skinny lipsticks will sit at an angle.  However, I have found this height (based on researching different organization options) to be pretty standard for lipstick holders.  To solve the height issue, I purchased a lipgloss holder to house my taller, skinnier lipsticks!  After shopping around for similar acrylic lipstick holders, though, this was my choice as it was a far less expensive way to hold 24 lipsticks in a clear acrylic option.  I find the acrylic to be of great quality and it feels sturdy.  The only negative I have about this product is that it is part of the add-on program.  When I wanted a second one, I had to wait until I had other items on Amazon to purchase.  So, I have this product added to my wishlist and will purchase at least a couple more as I make additional purchases on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I love this Lipstick holder. It looks like glass which makes it look even better! Its so pretty (:&lt;br /&gt;Two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> I just received this today and when I ordered it I honestly thought it was going to be cheap and light considering the price... THEN, when I opened it I was like FOREAL?! It actually had weight in them and was very clean and sleek looking. It looks way better than my other makeup organizer that I got at target years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a variety of different brands of lipsticks/glosses. From Kat von D liquid lipstick, MAC, Urban Decay, a whole bunch of Tarte lipsurgence,  Stila, Melted too faced, Nyx, you know it I love those lip products! It all fit in there nicely and securely. Now mind you, I doubled those kat von d liquid (also some of the skinnier tarte lip pencils) lipsticks in one because they are so skinny and I am in no way wasting that beautiful space!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another note to mention, I am not one that likes to organize lipstick upside down. I just like it the way it is. I do not care to see the labels on top because it is messy looking so the fact that it is not deep enough for actual gloss tubes, or upside down mac lipsticks, does not bother me one bit.</li>
            <li> I love it! Good quality and fast shipment!</li>
            <li> Pefectas condiciones.</li>
            <li> so many lipsticks this really comes in handy of corse it makes everything more organized i love it thank you</li>
            <li> Best thing for holding and displaying your lipsticks. Looks great on a makeup vanity. Very happy with this lipstick holder! I&#x27;ll definitely be getting another one when I fill this one up.</li>
            <li> LOVES IT! Fits my mac lipstick perfectly. Bought one fore my sister too!</li>
            <li> I was trying to find a holder for my essential oil bottles from Young Living.  This lipstick organizer works pretty well for the smaller bottles.  If anyone is interested, please email me at mamalavana@hotmail.com.  There are some great November specials!</li>
            <li> I love this organizer for my lipsticks. Simple and not cheap.</li>
            <li> Its great for lipstics</li>
            <li> For the wife, she liked it.</li>
            <li> Love this lil guy, you can store not only Mac sized lippies but longer Revlon just bitten kissable balm type tubes. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be buying more lipstick just to fill the organizer!!</li>
            <li> Love this...looks great..strudy and holds and organizes all my lipsticks.. im going to get another one for myself aand my friends!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  looks good and is very good quality, I just need more for my whole collection now!</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for.  This feels very solid and like it is high quality  I love the way the clear acrylic looks on my vanity.  I am actually about to purchase another one because I&#x27;ve become a lip product addict and already need more space</li>
            <li> I love product as it met all my expectations.  The design and quality was way above average. I would recommend this product without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Now I can find the color of my lipsticks!! It looks nice on my vanity. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> First of all, this is Robert&#x27;s wife (Cee Cee) writing this review -not Robert. He wanted me to be sure and tell ya&#x27;ll that. lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok...I think this was designed by a person who doesn&#x27;t fully comprehend lipstick obesession. What we really want is an organzier that perfectly fits all lipstick brands. In some instances, we have to bend our expectations a little bit. Prepare to bend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, quality of this organizer was good. It was sturdy, clean, and well-made (five stars for quality). I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to share information about ease of cleaning/maintaining it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem is that the slots are barely over an inch deep. The shallow slots cannot support/hold up most of my lipsticks which makes it a lot less functional for my purposes. I should subtract two stars for functionality, but I won&#x27;t because some people are fine with the shallow slots. I will try to be specific about my brands to help those who are thinking about this as an organizer. I usually store my lipsticks upside down (label facing up). When it comes to specific brands, this is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAC COSMETICS (Not The Right Organizer IMO)&lt;br /&gt;MAC lipsticks with the bullet style caps won&#x27;t remain stable when stored upside down in this organizer. They will flop/roll.  I have to be able to see the labels but I can&#x27;t deal with how much tipping/flopping goes on when the caps are down. It&#x27;s dreadful. However, if you store lippies with the caps up (label down), this organizer works just great. Realistically, is there anyone who can do that? NOTE: I noticed that the MAC Sheen Supreme tubes are not stable in either the up or down position. The MAC Pro Long Wear tubes seem to sit a little more stable and do their best to stay upright, regardless of position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NARS (Perfect)&lt;br /&gt;This organizer is perfect for NARS lipsticks, stored in any postion. My NARS lipsticks (like my fav Niagara) are shorter than average and have square cases, so these fit verynicely. Perfect. No jiggling or flopping around regardless of whether the cap is up or down. Maybe I will collect more NARS so I can use this organizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIPSTICK QUEEN (Good But Not Perfect)&lt;br /&gt;Stored upside down, my Lipstick Queen Medieval rolls and flops around a bit.  When stored with the cap up, it&#x27;s more stable because the weight of the case helps keep it upright in spite of the small case diameter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIP FUSION GLOSSES &amp; CLINIQUE CHUBBY STICKS (No Way!)&lt;br /&gt;My Lip Fusion glosses are square but taller, and these will fall over if the stand is moved or jiggled at all (top heavy). This starts a domino effect by falling into the other lipsticks. The Clinique Chubby Sticks won&#x27;t stand up and stay. Definitely not a good option for these. I don&#x27;t think these would work for any slim shine or gloss in a very skinny tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLINIQUE LIPSTICKS (Got On My Last Little Nerve!)&lt;br /&gt;My Clinique lippies are cylindrical with flat bottoms (light green cases). These are mostly samples I received in gifts with purchase, but I have quite a few. They are average height, cylindrical, and jiggle/flop all over the place in this organizer, regardless of position of the cap. Caps up, they tend to fall over because the case diameter is so skinny. When stored with the caps down, they still unstable and floppy. I am bothered by this. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this organzier with Clinique for this reason unless your Clinique lippies have different cases than mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ULTA LIPSTICKS (Good But Not Perfect)&lt;br /&gt;Ulta brand lipsticks (metallic bronze cases) are shaped like my Clinique cases. They jiggle a bit when stored upside down, BUT actually fit pretty good if stored with the caps up. My ulta lippies have a window on the cap, so this may be helpful.  I still prefer to store them caps down-&gt;label up, and there is quite a bit of jiggling/flopping when they are stored with the caps down. I don&#x27;t like it for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ESTEE LAUDER PURE COLOR LIPSTICK (Great!)&lt;br /&gt;Some of my \\&quot;vintage\\&quot; Estee Lauder Pure Color lipsticks in the square gold cases fit really well upside down in this organizer. The diameter of the case is almost the same size as the slot, so the fit is really good, and there is not much jiggling/moving around. Fit is very similar to NARS, so this organizer would work great with these. *I am not sure about the newer Estee Lauder lipsticks. I havent bought any in a while, so the case design may be different now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVLON MOON DROPS &amp; LIP BUTTERS (Great!)&lt;br /&gt;Moon drops fit great with the tops up or down. You could store either way because the MOON DROPS have a window and BUTTERS have colored cases. So you can see what you&#x27;re reaching for without reading the label. I don&#x27;t have many of these. But if I did, I could see me using this organizer without any problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LIP SMACKERS (No Way!)&lt;br /&gt;Forget it. The tubes are too skinny for the slots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF the slots on this organizer were 2 inches deep instead of 1 inch, this would be a terrific solution to my storage dilemma because it has 24 slots, is well-made, and sturdy.  Unfortunately, I will be returning it for the slanted/tilted lipstick stand on Amazon.  The tilted stand only holds 12 lipsticks, but it is much deeper and I love the tilt because it makes reading the labels much easier.  I wrote a review on the slanted/tilted stand if you think it might work for you. It is also for sale on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**When I purchased this, I also bought the wavy acrylic organizer for lipstick/cosmetic brushes. LOVE LOVE IT. Both of these acrylic items were shipped together in the same box, and arrived in a timely manner with no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hugs&lt;br /&gt;ceecee</li>
            <li> Good Price and looks good :))</li>
            <li> The lipstick holders are beautifully made great quality and already full Im going to have to buy more ans I know where to get them from.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great lipstick holder, works perfectly and makes my vanity look nice and neat now.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I had hoped for!!!</li>
            <li> While I did not need this organizer for lipstick, it works perfectly for organizing my small sample bottles. Good quality and well made</li>
            <li> Great product. Love it</li>
            <li> This Lipstick Organizer is great! I put it in the drawer in my bathroom so I can easily access my lipsticks. It would look great on the counter too.&lt;br /&gt;My only dislike for this product is that the walls are a little low so you can&#x27;t turn MAC lipsticks, etc. over without them tipping over and sitting diagonally. Also, there are a couple of my lipstick tubes that don&#x27;t fit in the slots, such as my YSL lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;Overall though this is a great organizer for regular lipstick tubes.</li>
            <li> This lipstick holder is very sturdy and holds my lipsticks with no problems. I will be purchasing two more so I can hold all the rest of my lippies that are hanging around.</li>
            <li> was looking for a specific one, not exact fron picture. picture is a flat acrylic, mine was elevated a little at the top</li>
            <li> Beautiful! High quality and it holds all of my lipsticks, including the rounder Lime Crime ones. I will definitely be purchasing more of these organizers in the future.</li>
            <li> I love it! It might be A BIT heavy but I think it&#x27;s a good thing so it stays in place!</li>
            <li> The product seems to be very durable and made of high quality acrylic.  It doesn&#x27;t fit all my lipsticks - some of my lipstick tubes are too big (i.e. Marc Jacobs, Givenchy, Dior).  Also, I wish the lipstick slots were deeper.  I invert my lipstick tubes so that I can see what color they are (by reading the name on the bottom) and my MAC lipsticks slant to the side because of their domed top.  If the lipstick slot was deeper, that wouldn&#x27;t happen.  Still, it was the best option on Amazon and I&#x27;m debating on buying a third organizer when I accumulate more lipsticks.</li>
            <li> A wonderful way to display lipsticks and lip glosses! It is inexpensive, slimline and sleek, and allows for easy access to 24 of your favorite lipsticks at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the labels showing the names of the lipsticks is hidden, and with lipsticks such as MAC, you cannot display them bottom up to show the label using this organizer. If only there were a way to make this so...</li>
            <li> fits basic lipstics like M.A.C. and Maybelline but not Kat Von D or something bigger than a regular round M.A.C. or square Maybelline.</li>
            <li> Nice sleek tray, and surprisingly solid. Only drawback is that the slots are not deep enough for lipsticks with rounded or slanted covers(like MAC or Rimmel).  Unless you store those label-side down, they will wobble.  Some lipsticks may be too wide to fit in the slots (like my YSL one).</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  It is very sturdy and well made.  I am loving this great organizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased two organizers from Home and Wire for my daughter&#x27;s Christmas present.  She was thrilled with the products and  has put them to good use on her vanity counter.  All her cosmetics are in a local location and can easily be identified.</li>
            <li> But um, The Container Store has em for $6.99!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for storing MAC lipsticks upside down, yes, they&#x27;ll lean (because of the bullet shaped top) but you can make one row lean in one direction and the next row in the opposite direction. It actually looks pretty cool when done that way. I&#x27;ll post a pic of mine soon.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to receiving this lipstick holder!  However, when I put my lipsticks in the holders, they all fall over to the side (just as many other reviewers have reported.)  I wish I would have paid more attention to the reviews about this product.  It is a great concept, but the sides of the holders need to be higher to prevent the lipsticks from falling over.  I hate the hassle of returning an item, but I just can&#x27;t see keeping this one as it serves no purpose.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and practical for lipstick organizer, I love how neat my lipstick looked in one place, I&#x27;m definitely ordering more, I will go for the bigger size....loved it,,....</li>
            <li> Awesome quality.  I Would recommend this organizer to anyone. A Great storage solution for lipsticks. Makes everything look neat and organized! Product arrived fast and with no issues.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> this is a slanted lip stick hold, the one in the picture is not. was upset that the picture is incorrect</li>
            <li> Perfect lipstick organizer. Fits all my lipsticks, my liquid lipsticks, and lip gloss. Great quality</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m not picky, but I love this lipstick organizer. Width wise, all of my lipsticks fit in the individual slots of this organizer so no complaints there. For reference I have several different brands of lipsticks both square and circular. I also store my lipsticks with the top facing up and not the bottom up. I remember all of my lipsticks and have them arranged so that I know where each one is without having to look at the label on the bottom, which is probably why this organizer works just fine for me. I have stored some MAC lipglasses in this and it doesn&#x27;t work for that purpose since the slots are not deep enough and the lipglasses will lean to the side when moved. But then again, this thing wasn&#x27;t meant for lipglasses. For my 14 MAC, 1 Makeup forever, 2 Lancome, 1 Maybelline, 2 Revlon, 1 Loreal, 1 Wet and Wild, 1 Benefit, 1 YSL lipsticks, this thing works well. It&#x27;s both sturdy, and functional. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> I really love this organizer for holding my lipsticks. The only downside is that the slots aren&#x27;t tall enough to hold MAC lipsticks straight when they are upside down. I just ended up putting them in order by their name so I know which color is which. Other than that, this is perfect and it looks nice!</li>
            <li> Fits all my lipstick and glosses not to big nor to small it&#x27;s perfect</li>
            <li> This item is perfect for lipsticks and lip glosses in tubes. I love mine and the company had super fast shipping. I&#x27;ll be buying more from them as gifts for my girlie friends :)</li>
            <li> Sturdy plastic. Well made. Holds lipsticks so they are easily visible. Very pleased with this product. Well designed and built.</li>
            <li> At last a great make-up organizer that can hold lip products. This is great for me because I have all shapes and sizes of make-up. This keeps my things organized and ready to use when in a rush. The clear design is great for finding things fast.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. The only issue I have is that my MAC lipsticks cannot stand straight because of the bullet shape top.  I don&#x27;t want to have to lift the holder up in the air to see what color I want to where. Better suited for lipsticks with a straight or round flat base. Overall the item is cute. It arrived ontime.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this lipstick organizer and I am so in love with it.😁😍The quality of the acrylic is amazing and doesn&#x27;t look cheap at all. Did I mention how fast the shipping was? It literally took 3 days after placing my order when I received my organizer, which made me super happy. I must say I really really recommend this product.😁</li>
            <li> I liked this so much that I did purchase a second one. Yes, I have a lot of lipstick.  It would be nice if these could be made a little taller, so they can hold longer lipstick tubes better. My shorter tubes like Revlon, Maybelline, etc fit nicely, but the my WNW matte longer tubes do not sit in the holder good. It is so nice to have my lipstick standing up right so I can view the colors better.</li>
            <li> My lipsticks used to live in a drawer and I was forever pulling them out to see the colors.  This organizer solved my problem.  I can see the colors or the names of the colors and decide which lipstick to use.  My only wish is that this came in a taller organizer for my taller glossy lipsticks and lip brushes.</li>
            <li> CANT BEAT THE PRICE! WILL BE GETTING ANOTHER</li>
            <li> So I am becoming a makeup junkie and I found with my limited space I need to organize my item. Once again me and that youtube :( well I purchased this item;which is great and then I purchased another container mentioned on Makegeeks youtube and  I have plenty.&lt;br /&gt;This little item worked well for me, my lipsticks had to be stood upright so the names of them were on the bottom,  and I purchased the clear one. All and All I was satisfied and will purhcase again.</li>
            <li> US Acrylic makes a High Quality Product!  My only concern is the height of the sections on this organizer. A lot of my lipsticks have rounded or embossed tops, and I like to put them in upside down, so I can see the color name on the bottom. When I do this, most of them wobble and fall slightly to the side.  An extra 3/4 inch to an inch of height would make this organizer just perfect!  It does work perfectly for my shorter lip glosses and funnily enough, for my &amp;#34;collection&amp;#34; of perfume sample tubes.  By the way, I also purchased the US Acrylic clear multi tier nail polish organizer. If you love OPI polishes, order it.  Fabulous, five star product.</li>
            <li> I ordered this twice now. In the first order I received what is pictured and what was described on the page. The second order I recieved a different 24 slot holder that was slanted or trapezoidal in shape instead of the flat rectangular one that I got the first time. I reorder it from the link in my &amp;#34;purchased&amp;#34; list so I have no idea what went wrong. I personally didn&#x27;t mind the different item, so I kept it, but years up to those of you ordering currently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to the product(s) itself, they are of a nice, heavy-quality acrylic and I am very pleased with my purchases.</li>
            <li> Excellent Seller. A+++</li>
            <li> Great quality, super fast delivery. This holder will fit: Nyx Matte Lipsticks and Matte Lip Creams, Mac Lipsticks and Lipglass, Maybelline Lipsticks, BH Cosmetics Lipsticks and YSL however it will not fit Kat Von D lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I love my acrylic lipstick holder it&#x27;s beautifully finished with a glossy luster. It&#x27;s not opaque like others.. great quality for such a cheap price! Love.</li>
            <li> high quality plastic.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.  Purchased for a different purpose than makeup and it works great for organization.</li>
            <li> small item for the 24 items. perfect for MAC products. Fast transaction, fast delivery.</li>
            <li> The acrylic is of good quality. It is weighted nicely and is very clear as opposed to being cloudy. It also doesn&#x27;t seem like it would scratch or break easily. It is a chic display that allows me quick access to a specific color, as I store my lipsticks name side up. The only downside is that I&#x27;ve completely validated the idea of buying as many lipsticks as I want. Uh oh.</li>
            <li> This products is exactly what is described. Feels like good quality and looks good on the counter with my lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I love it its beautiful so nice and for the price it great would defiantly recommend</li>
            <li> I use it inside my jewelry box to separate my earrings.  It&#x27;s sturdy, and the perfect size. I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Nice, sturdy construction - thick acrylic.  I bought one of these a couple of months ago and liked it so much, I ordered two more.</li>
            <li> perfect size and it even fits my lip glosses.</li>
            <li> I really like that the organizer is clear, almost like glass vs cloudy clear like other acrylic organizers.</li>
            <li> Great for lipstick. Not for doTERRA oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item is durable too :)</li>
            <li> I love it ! Good quality product !</li>
            <li> Love! Love! Love! Strong sturdy and very pretty! I love this product!</li>
            <li> Great price, nice quality, and does it job! :)</li>
            <li> It holds all Mom&#x27;s lipsticks.  She loves that it&#x27;s of a heavy quality and stays in place on her vanity.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fit all my lipsticks even the larger ones. Looks great and fits in drawer nicely too. Fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fits perfectly inside my drawer.  I expected it to be a tad wider, but this actually works better for my needs.</li>
            <li> Really great product. I have searched far and wide in stores for this kind of item without success. This one was great.</li>
            <li> I have an unhealthy amount of lipsticks and wanted a nice clean orderly way to keep them. The case holds most types of lipstick; unfortunately it cannot hold my Tom Ford&#x27;s, my YSL&#x27;s in the square packaging, or my Clarins lipsticks. Anything with packaging larger that say a Chanel rouge coco will be too big.</li>
            <li> Arrived in perfect condition and it looks like a beautiful piece of crystal. It is a very thick and sturdy acrylic which is the norm for u.s. Acrylic products so I&#x27;m not surprised. I would recommend if you have an abundance of lipsticks you need organized.</li>
            <li> I love the product!!! Perfect!!! I will be ordering another one soon. Thanks :)</li>
            <li> I love this lipstick organizer. I also organize my lip glosses too. Very cute, not to big or to small.</li>
            <li> The spaces are too shallow and actually a little too big so lipsticks don&#x27;t stand up. They were falling all over the place. I returned the organizer.</li>
            <li> The product was exactly as described and now I have a place to store my many lipsticks/glosses.</li>
            <li> This lipstick organizer is very durable. It has a nice sleek look to it, and it serves its purpose to a T.</li>
            <li> I always had all my lipsticks in a makeup bag and now I&#x27;m able to have them all organized. I love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I have all my MAC lipsticks organized.. they look great and my vanity looks so clean and awesome like a dept store!</li>
            <li> I can say enough about this item. I love the size, the finish and the way it looks full of lipsticks :-) I just ordered two more, yes i liked that much.</li>
            <li> As soon as it fills i will buy another one! no problem at all fits perfectly in my vanity just wish i would had gotten a level one.</li>
            <li> This holds my lipsticks perfectly. I&#x27;m going to purchase another one because I have so many. It&#x27;s easy to see what colors you have so you can make the best choice everyday!</li>
            <li> Omg the quality on this is amazing. Thick acrylic and perfect size!!</li>
            <li> So cute and greet price</li>
            <li> I was surprised with the quality of the product it is very nice for the low price. Highly recommed the quality!</li>
            <li> Great for Nars Audacious Lipsticks and most drugstore lippies!</li>
            <li> it fit : MAC, NYX Matte , ELF minerals ,Revlon,SLEEK&lt;br /&gt;it doesn&#x27;t fit some of NYX lipsticks .</li>
            <li> I love this organizer! Fast Shipping, this arrived in  less than  a week. I am impressed with the quality and I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have a collection of Revlon and this works perfectly.  Looks nice on the countertop, too!  Nice quality acrylic, does not look cheap.</li>
            <li> This item is much smaller than it appears. This deception was created with the reflective base used in the picture.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low for a lipstick organizer.  I am so happy I finally found one!  I highly recommend getting one if you have too many colors to choose from, like myself</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE!!!! they are perfect for the deeper Alex shelves. A+++</li>
            <li> Very nice for the price. I will be ordering another one soon. I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is a great product all my lipsticks fit and the quality is great.</li>
            <li> Awesome little lipstick holder. Nice and sturdy! I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future. Great for any vanity.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I love the size and it fits perfectly in my makeup desk!! Can&#x27;t wait to order more!!</li>
            <li> Good quality construction.  Not flimsy</li>
            <li> I love it! Very sturdy and the glass is thick.</li>
            <li> I have never purchased anything acrylic and now i know why everyone perfers this type of plastic. It is great quality almost looking like glass but weighs lighter than glass. This was my second purchase because I love lipsticks and i like this tray because they are all even and not like a hill tray where some lipsticks are higher than the bottom ones. The price is not that bad either. But yea this is great product and is well done and not cheap looking at all.</li>
            <li> The lipsticks dont keep in place</li>
            <li> Fits all my lipsticks perfectly. Love it!</li>
