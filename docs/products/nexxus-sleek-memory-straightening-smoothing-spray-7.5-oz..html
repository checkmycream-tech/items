    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>After hours of meticulous research across quality, price, and results, Nexxus Sleek Memory seemed to be my best bet:</li>
            <li>I was very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>Even my hairdresser was impressed after I had her use it on me in the salon.</li>
            <li>This product is excellent.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly with a hair dryer or lfat iron or both.</li>
            <li>good value for the size too!</li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>lol)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great for not getting any friz</li>
            <li>it also smells great.</li>
            <li>great product.</li>
            <li>All the Nexus products smell great and leave my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>Great product, works amazing and smells good too!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger around.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Amazing product.  </li>
            <li>when it did the results were amazing.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this, it makes my hair feel wonderful, not heavy, smooth, and so great!</li>
            <li>In fact, this product caused hair to be more fly away and exhibit more static.</li>
            <li>it leaves them feeling soft and smelling great!</li>
            <li>I will not go a day without using this now, it has become my fav hair product, I am also using the nexxus frizz defy shampoo and conditioner,but I received this before those, and even using with my old shampoo, it worked great, and after using for a while, I can tell a difference in my hair, it is smother all the time, even if I skip a washing!</li>
            <li>I ordered through Amazon as I thought it was reputable to order from them vs. eBay</li>
            <li>Style, and watch/feel the magic happen to your hair.</li>
            <li>I do not believe that this is an authentic product.</li>
            <li>Save your money and buy anything in the drug store with silicone in it (frizz-ease)or for a bit more money, try Kiehl&#x27;s Silk Groome.</li>
            <li>Aside from the fact that you must pay a shipping fee, I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It seemed to make my hair more frizzy.</li>
            <li>I was so pleased with this product that I bought this for my mom and my sister.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve even been able to skip the use of my flatiron after blowdrying.</li>
            <li>This product works ok.  </li>
            <li>I love this product and I should be buying it by the case.</li>
            <li>This is an OK product for straightening your hair.  </li>
            <li>I have been using Sleek Memory for 3-4 years and my hair has never looked better.  </li>
            <li>As with most products I love, they tend to be discontinued at some point</li>
            <li>This is my favorite straightening product.  </li>
            <li>Not too sure,</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an easy to find item.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this product several times from Amazon and was happy since it has been discontinued.  </li>
            <li>Our local store did not carry it so we came here to Amazon because it is just that good.. :)</li>
            <li>And I do believe that it does create a \\&quot;memory\\&quot; because the times I have not been able to use it, my hair is still pretty frizz-free.</li>
            <li>To me, this stuff is worth its weight in gold!  </li>
            <li>I would still flat iron once a week or so, but I was so happy I didn&#x27;t have to spend as much time on my hair.</li>
            <li>The only positive thing I can say is that the product does smell very nice right out of the bottle, although fragrance did not linger.</li>
            <li>The sprayer on the bottle is nice because it gives an even spritz to your hair, and the smell is a nice subtle scent, it&#x27;s not too scented.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a nice flat iron partner.</li>
            <li>Obviously, this also cuts down on the time I need to spend on fixing my hair...which is priceless!</li>
            <li>I sometimes just towel dry, and this stuff works great either way, and it does not weigh my hair down, it just makes it look so much better, and feel better, and it last!</li>
            <li>He couldn&#x27;t stand spending more than ten bucks for a hair product</li>
            <li>If you want soft, smooth, and bouncy hair, than buy this product.</li>
            <li>It does not smell the same as the authentic product.  </li>
            <li>But nothing seem to work consistently which would make me stick with a product forever.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping this product did exactly what others said it did</li>
            <li>After first use, My hair was shinier and softer.</li>
            <li>We have looked all over for this product as it is the only one we truly love.</li>
            <li>It really truly works!  </li>
            <li>I have fine wavy hair that needs a little help when I use heat on it to keep it straight, and this works better for me than anything else I have tried - even in comparison to salon products.</li>
            <li>Also it had a very strong perfume smell, and felt like I was spraying sticky hairspray on my wet hair.  </li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give Nexxus another chance because not only did this spray protect my hair from heat, it left my hair shiny, smooth, and with no residue.</li>
            <li>My husband apparently was impressed with how straight and shiny my hair was because he started to secretly use this spray himself.</li>
            <li>my hair is usually really frizzy by the time I&#x27;m done blow drying it...</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and since it hadnt been relaxed</li>
            <li>I have straight hair that gets frizzy in summer.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really notice the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; feature yet.  </li>
            <li>It is the only thing that calms my wiry, staticky hair and keeps it smooth.</li>
            <li>and it is so much easier to style, and yes it does what it says it will do, my hair stays the way I want it, and if I decide to put it up, it takes to it and holds that, until I change it again, and it holds whatever look I want, no problem!&lt;br /&gt;very highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Really does make a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the curly-haired women, but it&#x27;s definitely highly recommended if you already have straight hair and want a smoother look and texture.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, it really trains your hair to become straighter.</li>
            <li>It has truly made a huge difference in the time it takes to dry my hair.</li>
            <li>I am simply amazed as how straight my hair was becoming even at this lesser temperature.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it that makes it work so well, but this is highly recommended if you have frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but for this product, I most certainly will...</li>
            <li>I will update the review on my findings after a few more uses.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair, I use a straigtner most the time, if im short on time, I just blow dry, in the summer if short on time</li>
            <li>So much so that I decided to stop flat ironing after the third week or so, and my hair still stayed straight and lustrous!</li>
            <li>It makes it much easier to flat iron, and leaves your hair very soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have straight Asian hair.</li>
            <li>The product claims that it trains your hair to be straight so that maintenance over time gets lesser, which I am yet to test it out.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not messy to use-</li>
            <li>When he spritzed the Daisy Fuentes spray the first day, he noticed it would shoot out in a thin stream and not in a fine mist, like the Nexxus had.</li>
            <li>But before using Sleek Memory, my hair was really poofy and frizzy, so I decided to start using a flat iron.</li>
            <li>However after a few runs, I felt that my hair was becoming too hot, and I had to turn it down to 340-350.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it&#x27;s becoming hard to find, but that surely doesn&#x27;t change the way it works.</li>
            <li>I used this because my hair dresser was using a similar product (a hair straightener spray) and my hair was so smooth after I dried it.  </li>
            <li>I have natural curly hair that I straighten daily.  </li>
            <li>I have been using other brands of straightening sprays which actually worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I was disappointed when this product was discontinued, then happy to find it through Amazon.  </li>
            <li>And the real proof that this spray works is when I went to the salon after about a month and a half of using this spray, the stylist (who never saw me before) thought that I had gotten a Japanese straightening perm.</li>

            <li> And the real proof that this spray works is when I went to the salon after about a month and a half of using this spray, the stylist (who never saw me before) thought that I had gotten a Japanese straightening perm.</li>
            <li> I always use heat protectants when I blow-dry or use a flat iron, which is almost daily.  </li>
            <li> It will be the product I use exclusively from now on just for the absence of fragrance alone.  </li>
            <li> And, I don&#x27;t have to use a flat iron anymore.  </li>
            <li> I needed some kind of heat protectant to go with it because I dreaded badly damaging my virgin hair.</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this product for as long as Nexxus makes it.</li>
            <li> I actually spray this on my hair when its wet out of the shower to give my curls some definition when i dont have time to straighten my hair.</li>
            <li> , I just air dried it and my naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;memory\\&quot; part is a very big added bonus because after using this spray every other day for two weeks, I did indeed start to notice my hair was already quite sleek after air drying.</li>
            <li> Not much different from other straighteners</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to add any type of oils for shine, or moisture for dry scape/hair.</li>
            <li> Wash your hair with nexxus products, apply spray, then roll or blow dry hair.</li>
            <li> I had to blow dry using the spray</li>
            <li> I washed my hair like 4 times this week and did not blow dry it</li>
            <li> so that I could actually leave my hair down all day without worrying about unwanted volume.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a particular fan of Nexxus.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> a while, i needed osmething to help me tame it before flat ironing it.</li>
            <li> Not sure whether anyone had the same experience.    </li>
            <li> Cuts way down on the frizz.</li>
            <li> With this product, I just towel dried, and sprayed over (about 9 times) all over my hair, blow-dried for about 2-3 minutes and started to use my flat iron at my usual temp of 370.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cut drying time in half, and never leaves a tacky, sticky film on my hair.</li>
            <li> This cut my drying time of an hour in half.  </li>
            <li> had a lot less volume</li>
            <li> what is inside so will no be using the product, what a waste.  </li>
            <li> It did not provide any \\&quot;memory\\&quot; of the blow dried style or help seal out humidity to protect the blow dried style, etc.</li>

            <li> I want to give this zero stars...the bottle is the same as I what I use, but the contents have been switched out somehow.  I was disappointed when this product was discontinued, then happy to find it through Amazon.  I have no idea what is inside so will no be using the product, what a waste.  I ordered through Amazon as I thought it was reputable to order from them vs. eBay....lesson learned...no more mail orders for me on this type of product.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend buying this product from this seller. The product in the bottle is not product listed.  The bottle looks the correct but it has been refilled with a different fluid. I have used this product for years. The liquid in these bottles smells and looks very different from the correct product. I will be returning both bottles I purchased from this seller.</li>
            <li> Wish this product was not taken off by Nexus. Great product. I have wavy hair and it has a tendency to get a bit frizzy looking after blow drying. This products smooths my hair out and makes it feel silky.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about curly hair. I have straight Asian hair. But before using Sleek Memory, my hair was really poofy and frizzy, so I decided to start using a flat iron. I needed some kind of heat protectant to go with it because I dreaded badly damaging my virgin hair. After hours of meticulous research across quality, price, and results, Nexxus Sleek Memory seemed to be my best bet: heat protection that encourages straightness.     I&#x27;m not a particular fan of Nexxus. In fact, once I bought my husband some Nexxus gel that didn&#x27;t hold his hair at all, and I had to return it. But I&#x27;m so glad I decided to give Nexxus another chance because not only did this spray protect my hair from heat, it left my hair shiny, smooth, and with no residue. The fragrance is pleasant and doesn&#x27;t linger around. The \\&quot;memory\\&quot; part is a very big added bonus because after using this spray every other day for two weeks, I did indeed start to notice my hair was already quite sleek after air drying. So much so that I decided to stop flat ironing after the third week or so, and my hair still stayed straight and lustrous! I would still flat iron once a week or so, but I was so happy I didn&#x27;t have to spend as much time on my hair. And the real proof that this spray works is when I went to the salon after about a month and a half of using this spray, the stylist (who never saw me before) thought that I had gotten a Japanese straightening perm. And I had virgin hair!     My husband apparently was impressed with how straight and shiny my hair was because he started to secretly use this spray himself. (He has a metro hairstyle.) He used to never use any products in his hair, but I could smell it after he came out of the bathroom. Anyway, when we ran out of the spray, my husband felt bad about using up my product, so he went to the drugstore to pick up some of his own...until he found out the price. He couldn&#x27;t stand spending more than ten bucks for a hair product so he looked around for the cheapest heat protectant and bought the Daisy Fuentes brand heat protect spray, which was on sale. (I salute his security with his manhood. lol) When he spritzed the Daisy Fuentes spray the first day, he noticed it would shoot out in a thin stream and not in a fine mist, like the Nexxus had. He thought it was the bottle, so he put the Daisy Fuentes liquid in the Nexxus bottle, but it still shot out in a thin stream. After close inspection, we realized the Daisy Fuentes was thicker and goo-ey (the smell by the way was fine in the drugstore but sickening in the small space of our bathroom).     We&#x27;ll both be staying with the Nexxus. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> If you want soft, smooth, and bouncy hair, than buy this product. I have thick textured hair and my hair is dyed. This product retains moisture and color longer. I don&#x27;t need to add any type of oils for shine, or moisture for dry scape/hair. Wash your hair with nexxus products, apply spray, then roll or blow dry hair. Style, and watch/feel the magic happen to your hair.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and I thought this product might help but it did nothing to my hair!&lt;br /&gt;If you have curly hair don&#x27;t try this product.</li>
            <li> The product that you receive is not the product pictured here on the website.  It arrives in a white bottle that says \\&quot;New\\&quot; on it.  It does not smell the same as the authentic product.  I do not believe that this is an authentic product.</li>
            <li> Save Your Money. This product neither \\&quot;sleeked\\&quot; nor smoothed my curly, thick hair nor did it diminish frizz, even in conjunction with blow drying. It did not provide any \\&quot;memory\\&quot; of the blow dried style or help seal out humidity to protect the blow dried style, etc. In fact, this product caused hair to be more fly away and exhibit more static. The only positive thing I can say is that the product does smell very nice right out of the bottle, although fragrance did not linger. Save your money and buy anything in the drug store with silicone in it (frizz-ease)or for a bit more money, try Kiehl&#x27;s Silk Groome.</li>
            <li> I bought this online because the stores stopped carrying it. Aside from the fact that you must pay a shipping fee, I am quite satisfied with this product. I have fine wavy hair that needs a little help when I use heat on it to keep it straight, and this works better for me than anything else I have tried - even in comparison to salon products.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, no disappointments.  I have a medium thick wavy hair, and I have tried about a few straightening and smoothing products before this.  But nothing seem to work consistently which would make me stick with a product forever.  With this product, I just towel dried, and sprayed over (about 9 times) all over my hair, blow-dried for about 2-3 minutes and started to use my flat iron at my usual temp of 370. However after a few runs, I felt that my hair was becoming too hot, and I had to turn it down to 340-350.  I am simply amazed as how straight my hair was becoming even at this lesser temperature.  Not sure whether anyone had the same experience.    The product claims that it trains your hair to be straight so that maintenance over time gets lesser, which I am yet to test it out.  I will update the review on my findings after a few more uses.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product did exactly what others said it did but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have natural curly hair that I straighten daily.  It seemed to make my hair more frizzy.</li>
            <li> I apply every time I straighten my hair it&#x27;s great for not getting any friz</li>
            <li> I was very happy with this product! After first use, My hair was shinier and softer. I have african american hair and I dont feel that I need to get it relaxed as often.  I was so pleased with this product that I bought this for my mom and my sister.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it does anything at all to my hair, but I haven&#x27;t notices any difference or improvement with my hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product! No frizz on humid days!</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but for this product, I most certainly will...my hair is usually really frizzy by the time I&#x27;m done blow drying it...but with this...it&#x27;s almost as if I have already flat-ironed it! It works so well. And I do believe that it does create a \\&quot;memory\\&quot; because the times I have not been able to use it, my hair is still pretty frizz-free. I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it that makes it work so well, but this is highly recommended if you have frizzy hair. Obviously, this also cuts down on the time I need to spend on fixing my hair...which is priceless! To me, this stuff is worth its weight in gold!  The sprayer on the bottle is nice because it gives an even spritz to your hair, and the smell is a nice subtle scent, it&#x27;s not too scented.  My only complaint is that it&#x27;s becoming hard to find, but that surely doesn&#x27;t change the way it works.</li>
            <li> Not good!!!!...I bought 2 bottles because I have used it in the past..it is NOT the same..wish I could return it..a lot of money wasted..:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since it came out. I have very thick, wavy, chemically processed hair. It has truly made a huge difference in the time it takes to dry my hair. It&#x27;s cut drying time in half, and never leaves a tacky, sticky film on my hair. It makes it much easier to flat iron, and leaves your hair very soft and silky. Even my hairdresser was impressed after I had her use it on me in the salon. I&#x27;ve even been able to skip the use of my flatiron after blowdrying.</li>
            <li> We have looked all over for this product as it is the only one we truly love. Our local store did not carry it so we came here to Amazon because it is just that good.. :)</li>
            <li> Luv the nexus products...they do what they say!!</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and since it hadnt been relaxed n a while, i needed osmething to help me tame it before flat ironing it. This did nothing except for make my hair smell really bad and make it very frizzy.</li>
            <li> Not much different from other straighteners</li>
            <li> Great product, works amazing and smells good too!</li>
            <li> This product works ok.  I&#x27;m not thrilled aboutMo how it makes my hair feel though.  It makes it feel like a weird texture.</li>
            <li> I saw this product in Allure magazine and waited for it to come out.  I was skeptical having tried millions of other products claiming the same thing.  It really truly works!  I have naturally curly, thick hair.  This cut my drying time of an hour in half.  And, I don&#x27;t have to use a flat iron anymore.  I spray this stuff in after I get out of the shower and it&#x27;s all I need.  I don&#x27;t even need a separate shine serum.  My hair is soft and shiny.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and I can get it at Walgreens.  I hated having to pay a lot AND go to a specialty store.  I love this product and I should be buying it by the case.</li>
            <li> This is an OK product for straightening your hair.  The only plus about this product is that it does not make your hair supper greasy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Sleek Memory for 3-4 years and my hair has never looked better.  It gets easier to straighten every time I use it. It&#x27;s a spray so it&#x27;s not messy to use-it also smells great. As with most products I love, they tend to be discontinued at some point SO I have stocked up on the stuff.  If you can spare a few bucks, give it a try. Think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.  I have straight hair that gets frizzy in summer.  This defrizzes and smoothes hair without any heavyiness or buildup.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite straightening product.  I will continue to purchase this product for as long as Nexxus makes it.</li>
            <li> I actually spray this on my hair when its wet out of the shower to give my curls some definition when i dont have time to straighten my hair. it leaves them feeling soft and smelling great! Cuts way down on the frizz. great product. would re-buy again and again.  good value for the size too!</li>
            <li> I used this because my hair dresser was using a similar product (a hair straightener spray) and my hair was so smooth after I dried it.  It&#x27;s not an easy to find item.  I can&#x27;t speak for the curly-haired women, but it&#x27;s definitely highly recommended if you already have straight hair and want a smoother look and texture.</li>
            <li> I always use heat protectants when I blow-dry or use a flat iron, which is almost daily.  All the Nexus products smell great and leave my hair shiny.  Straightening?  Not too sure, but it&#x27;s a nice flat iron partner.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times from Amazon and was happy since it has been discontinued.  This time I did NOT receive Nexxus Sleek Memory.  The seller had obviosly put something else in these bottles, it was spilled all over the outside.  Also it had a very strong perfume smell, and felt like I was spraying sticky hairspray on my wet hair.  Very disappointed.  Amazon should not use this seller.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent.  I had to blow dry using the spray around 7 times before it finally worked but when it did the results were amazing.  I washed my hair like 4 times this week and did not blow dry it, I just air dried it and my naturally wavy hair had a lot less volume and it was a lot straighter!  It also dried without frizz so that I could actually leave my hair down all day without worrying about unwanted volume. I highly recommend this product, it really trains your hair to become straighter.</li>
            <li> I have been using other brands of straightening sprays which actually worked pretty well.  My only issues with them were the fragrances.  I broke out in a terrible rash all around my neck.  This Nexxus spray does just as well in straightening but it is not overly fragranced.  I don&#x27;t really notice the &amp;#34;memory&amp;#34; feature yet.  It will be the product I use exclusively from now on just for the absence of fragrance alone.  It does have some fragrance but it&#x27;s hardly noticable.  Not enough to break me out anyway!</li>
            <li> Love this product. It is the only thing that calms my wiry, staticky hair and keeps it smooth. Works perfectly with a hair dryer or lfat iron or both.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this, it makes my hair feel wonderful, not heavy, smooth, and so great! I will not go a day without using this now, it has become my fav hair product, I am also using the nexxus frizz defy shampoo and conditioner,but I received this before those, and even using with my old shampoo, it worked great, and after using for a while, I can tell a difference in my hair, it is smother all the time, even if I skip a washing! this is a must have! I have straight hair, I use a straigtner most the time, if im short on time, I just blow dry, in the summer if short on time I sometimes just towel dry, and this stuff works great either way, and it does not weigh my hair down, it just makes it look so much better, and feel better, and it last! and it is so much easier to style, and yes it does what it says it will do, my hair stays the way I want it, and if I decide to put it up, it takes to it and holds that, until I change it again, and it holds whatever look I want, no problem!&lt;br /&gt;very highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Did not straighten my hair in the least. Disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this one, is my opinion.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  I have been using for about 2 years.  Really does make a difference in my hair.</li>
