            <li>I will never use another kind of toothbrush after using these!</li>
            <li>Best toothbrushes available!  </li>
            <li>finer bristles enable superior penetration.  </li>
            <li>A friend recommended this brush and after a month of use, I can say, without a doubt, this is truly a superior toothbrush.</li>

            <li>I love this toothbrush!</li>
            <li>Would have liked more variety in color however..</li>
            <li>My hygienist even thought I was flossing better, which I wasn&#x27;t, it was just that this toothbrush kind of flosses while you brush.  </li>
            <li>In any case I am so happy with this toothbrush that I am writing my first review on Amazon for it.</li>
            <li>I like that they are resistant to germs, but they are very comfortable in my hand and very comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li>You will not find a better toothbrush anywhere</li>
            <li>I absolutely love these toothbrushes.</li>
            <li>all my family love it</li>
            <li>Antimicrobial and fantastic design!</li>
            <li>I buy a ton of them looking for the next latest and greatest.  </li>
            <li>These have become my newest favorite.</li>
            <li>but I wish them came in more color selections.</li>
            <li>She said she could tell that I floss my teeth more than most people when in reality I don&#x27;t floss all that often, as this toothbrush flosses for me.</li>
            <li>Just went for a checkup and my dentist was seriously pleased with how healthy my guys are.</li>
            <li>&#x3D;)  </li>
            <li>Definitely the best toothbrush I have ever had, and</li>
            <li>so I am glad I bought the 6 pack.</li>
            <li>plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li>The bristles of this brush are soft to the gums, but it  does an excellent job of getting the teeth clean, even in between.  </li>
            <li>Dentist clean!  </li>
            <li>It seems to clean my teeth more thoroughly than my sonic care electric toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such great thing that germs do not survive on the brush.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy.</li>
            <li>My teeth feel smooth and my mouth really clean (Just like after a cleaning at the Dentist).  </li>
            <li>I first learned about these toothbrushes based on their antimicrobial feature, but I have to say these are the most comfortable toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Soft but present in your mouth, holds perfectly in your hand.</li>
            <li>She was so right!  </li>
            <li>but i think they are getting a much deeper clean at the gum line than most brushes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them</li>
            <li>I really like the way my mouth feels after using one of these toothbrushes and feel it is much better for my oral health than using my Sonic Care toothbrush.  </li>
            <li>The tapered ends get under the gumline and the natural bristles infused with antimicrobial silver have keep me cavity free and my gums and teeth have never looked better.  </li>
            <li>My dentist gives me a free toothbrush (with his name and phone # emblazoned on it, of course) at each visit, but I give these away and buy my own toothbrushes--these to be specific.</li>
            <li>I also notice a nice flossing quality versus the other name brand brush I was using.</li>
            <li>I can really feel the cleanliness after the first use.</li>
            <li>No other toothbrush has come close to making my teeth feel this clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for the past three months and I am enjoying the clean feel</li>
            <li>I have my whole family hooked on these things</li>
            <li>They almost hurt when you use them straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I expected the bristles to be softer than normal but they&#x27;re still fine.  </li>
            <li>Every time I brush my teeth, it&#x27;s just like having had them professionally cleaned - and they&#x27;re anti-microbial!</li>
            <li>the toothbrushes are soft .</li>
            <li>My teeth are very tight, in fact I have to buy special tooth floss to fit between them, but these bristles get everything, and I mean everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always liked a hard bristle brush which are very hard to find these days this toothbrush gets in between your teeth for real</li>
            <li>Now, the bristles are a strange color because of the imbedded colloidal silver, but the bristles themselves are a micro filament nylon that is far thinner than traditional toothbrushes.  </li>

            <li> I like the idea of the Silver coating since it should be antibacterial, but not sure how real that is.</li>
            <li> Pretty much no better than any other medium quality toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> how long does the anti microbial effect last?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my grandsons used his sick brother&#x27;s brush by mistake and it was nice not to worry that he would be getting the germs.  </li>
            <li> I brush really hard and the bristles are so soft they don&#x27;t irritate my gums and they hold up for a really long time despite my aggressive brushing.</li>
            <li> My only gripe about the package deal is that I wish they were all different colors or at least no more than 2 of each since our family uses 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> Any others seem too harsh.</li>
            <li> The handle is firm .</li>
            <li> Seems no more than an overpriced gimmick to me.</li>
            <li> and they are not considered hard bristle.</li>
            <li> Not because the bristles are hard</li>
            <li> /&gt;Usually, when I get sick, I would throw out the toothbrush so the germs won&#x27;t spread.</li>

            <li> I only use Mouth Watchers now.  Any others seem too harsh.</li>
            <li> DEntist said my teeth and gums never looked so good!</li>
            <li> You will not find a better toothbrush anywhere I have my whole family hooked on these things they are awesome. I&#x27;ve always liked a hard bristle brush which are very hard to find these days this toothbrush gets in between your teeth for real and they are not considered hard bristle.</li>
            <li> finer bristles enable superior penetration.  brush shape is retained enabling continued proficiency over life of toothbrush.  shape, thickness, and raised bands on handle surface enable solid grip.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these toothbrushes. I brush really hard and the bristles are so soft they don&#x27;t irritate my gums and they hold up for a really long time despite my aggressive brushing. I also notice a nice flossing quality versus the other name brand brush I was using. And who can argue with silver? My only gripe about the package deal is that I wish they were all different colors or at least no more than 2 of each since our family uses 4 at a time. My husband had to put a rubber band on his to distinguish it from my son&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I will never use another kind of toothbrush after using these!</li>
            <li> I expected the bristles to be softer than normal but they&#x27;re still fine.  I like the extra-fine tips that help reach into spaces between teeth.</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes.  Have bought two sets already.</li>
            <li> Love these toothbrushes! Never going back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> the toothbrushes are soft . The handle is firm . I feel I am getting the benefits by using this product</li>
            <li> all my family love it</li>
            <li> These brushes are great! Would have liked more variety in color however..</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this toothbrush by my dental hygienist.  She was so right!  Every time I brush my teeth, it&#x27;s just like having had them professionally cleaned - and they&#x27;re anti-microbial!</li>
            <li> Great toothbrushes.  Antimicrobial and fantastic design!</li>
            <li> Admittedly, I am a toothbrush nut.  I buy a ton of them looking for the next latest and greatest.  These have become my newest favorite. Now, the bristles are a strange color because of the imbedded colloidal silver, but the bristles themselves are a micro filament nylon that is far thinner than traditional toothbrushes.  They do an excellent job at getting between my teeth and cleaning the gum line .  My teeth are very tight, in fact I have to buy special tooth floss to fit between them, but these bristles get everything, and I mean everything. Even my two kids with braces have an easier time with these brushes.  Dentist clean!  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about them but I wish them came in more color selections.</li>
            <li> Ingenious idea!  Best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The bristles of this brush are soft to the gums, but it  does an excellent job of getting the teeth clean, even in between.

A friend recommended this brush and after a month of use, I can say, without a doubt, this is truly a superior toothbrush.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist could tell a difference. She said she could tell that I floss my teeth more than most people when in reality I don&#x27;t floss all that often, as this toothbrush flosses for me.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes ever. They almost hurt when you use them straight out of the box. Not because the bristles are hard but i think they are getting a much deeper clean at the gum line than most brushes. Just went for a checkup and my dentist was seriously pleased with how healthy my guys are.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes available!  I have reordered them numerous times.  The only toothbrush I will use!</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever used. It seems to clean my teeth more thoroughly than my sonic care electric toothbrush. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST toothbrush EVER! As nutty as it sounds this toothbrush makes a world of difference. i never thought i would say that I LOVE MY TOOTHBRUSH ! &#x3D;)  I wish I would have known about these things years ago.</li>
            <li> Soft but present in your mouth, holds perfectly in your hand. Definitely the best toothbrush I have ever had, and I&#x27;ve tried them all. I like the idea of the Silver coating since it should be antibacterial, but not sure how real that is. In any case I am so happy with this toothbrush that I am writing my first review on Amazon for it. Enjoy.</li>
            <li> Used for a couple of weeks.  Pretty much no better than any other medium quality toothbrush.  Seems no more than an overpriced gimmick to me.</li>
            <li> I can really feel the cleanliness after the first use. I stopped using my waterpik electric toothbrush and will never go back. I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush for the past three months and I am enjoying the clean feel afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually, when I get sick, I would throw out the toothbrush so the germs won&#x27;t spread. I recently had the flu. This being an anti microbial toothbrush saved me from having to throw it out. My only question being - how long does the anti microbial effect last?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I like to change my toothbrush every season (4 months) so I am glad I bought the 6 pack.</li>
            <li> I really like the way my mouth feels after using one of these toothbrushes and feel it is much better for my oral health than using my Sonic Care toothbrush.  My next dental cleaning will be the proof but I never thought I would prefer a manual toothbrush.</li>
            <li> Great item..plan on ordering more.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrush I have ever used!!  The tapered ends get under the gumline and the natural bristles infused with antimicrobial silver have keep me cavity free and my gums and teeth have never looked better.  My hygienist even thought I was flossing better, which I wasn&#x27;t, it was just that this toothbrush kind of flosses while you brush.  I will be using this brand toothbrush from now on.</li>
            <li> I love these toothbrushes! My dentist gives me a free toothbrush (with his name and phone # emblazoned on it, of course) at each visit, but I give these away and buy my own toothbrushes--these to be specific. I first learned about these toothbrushes based on their antimicrobial feature, but I have to say these are the most comfortable toothbrushes I&#x27;ve ever used. I like that they are resistant to germs, but they are very comfortable in my hand and very comfortable in my mouth. I never use anything else, anymore!</li>
            <li> Great! I love this toothbrush! Can&#x27;t wait til my next dentist appointment to see what he has to say!</li>
            <li> No other toothbrush has come close to making my teeth feel this clean.  I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
