            <li> but I only ordered the grey one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it to help me stretch and to strengthen my feet muscles as I am flat footed.</li>
            <li> The band I received was not six feet long.</li>
            <li> So closer to 5.5 feet long, not six feet.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only resistance band that can withstand my heavy use and not break apart and smack me in the face.</li>
            <li> gold is really more efficient though, cutting doubles all the time kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> This is an upgrade from the black bands.</li>
            <li> It did not break, but it got sticky and not usable after a few months.</li>
            <li> put the band around your foot and do sets of turning in, turning out, dorsi-flexing, plantar-flexing, in addition to your usual ankle routine.  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken yet like my black one did.</li>
            <li> I use it to rehab my weak ankles.  </li>
            <li> However, they do fail after a couple of years, whether you use them or not.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re tired of doubling up the bands so they have some resistance and then they STILL break, this is the band for you!</li>

            <li> makes exercising at the desk easy</li>
            <li> Very durable.  Good for using it for physical therapy.  Most of my other ones break after a while, but this one remains sturdy.  12/26/2015 Update: it did not last after all. It did not break, but it got sticky and not usable after a few months. We live in Southern California so it&#x27;s not very dry or humid.</li>
            <li> Been using it &amp; love it.  I needed something with more ressistance.</li>
            <li> My husband love the bands.  Great for his exercised</li>

            <li> This is an upgrade from the black bands. The added resistance is excellent. I have had those for a couple of week and I have not had to readjust anything. They seem durable and don&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
            <li> Good product. Good customer service. Had a problem receiving the products originally, but the sellers helped resolve it professionally and courteously. Would buy from them again.   Regards,  Stan</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with the product. It served what I wanted it for my rehabilitation after an ankle surgery.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Product is as promised.</li>
            <li> This is a giant rubber band.  The possibilities are endless really.  Thera-band, funnel, sturdy couple of sticks - you got yourself one high-powered slingshot sir.</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken yet like my black one did. Good strength someone working on shoulders.</li>
            <li> I bought this as part of &amp;#34;Damage Control&amp;#34; from 4-Hour Body. I use it for chest pulls. It does exactly what I wanted it to do. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Basic band. Good resistance and quality seems to be good. I&#x27;ve been using it to help me stretch and to strengthen my feet muscles as I am flat footed. I&#x27;ve also been using it in PT for my IT bands.</li>
            <li> These bands are a great, light weight exercise tool.  If you have the right resistance, you can carry your gym with you for a few ounces.  However, they do fail after a couple of years, whether you use them or not.  I&#x27;ve purchased many of these over the years, and if I find an old, unused band (more than two years) and try to use it, it will invariably break. However, given the low cost, this is not a reason not to consider using these as an exercise tool.</li>
            <li> I needed to replace my older ones. These have a good, strong pull resistance. It is what I needed for my PT on knees.</li>
            <li> I am using this to treat my achilles tendonitis with an exercise using the thera-band.  Seems to offer enough resistance to be helpful.</li>
            <li> I use this for slingshot band material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this gives a nice smooth light pull, doubled up(3/4 x 1/2 taper) it zings 3/8&amp;#34; steel quite nicely.  gold is really more efficient though, cutting doubles all the time kinda sucks.</li>
            <li> The band I received was not six feet long. It is about five inches short.  So closer to 5.5 feet long, not six feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the bands for years. And I feel like I get a good workout.  I recommend this product to anyone interested in resistance band exercise.  .</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Shipping was fast. Great!</li>
            <li> Good value, works as intended</li>
            <li> This is the one and only resistance band that can withstand my heavy use and not break apart and smack me in the face. I went for the heavy-duty, and that it is~!  If you&#x27;re tired of doubling up the bands so they have some resistance and then they STILL break, this is the band for you!</li>
            <li> These exercise bands have the perfect resistance/tension.  They have a light vanilla scent to them, as well.  That&#x27;s a bonus :)</li>
            <li> This is heavier than traditionally used in therapy programs but I have had a number of seniors who didn&#x27;t like the thinner bands but thought this gave them a real workout. Popular with my macho patients even into their late nineties!</li>
            <li> Excellent.. and long enough to stretch with. Helps my feet and leg flexibility.</li>
