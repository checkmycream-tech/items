            <li> One of the few products that actually worked on my fine, limp hair!!  </li>
            <li> He has used this for a very long time.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner when I use this shampoo - and I don&#x27;t get split ends or dry scalp!</li>
            <li> I have short, thick hair and my hairdresser recommended this to me years ago.  </li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down or anything.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with it, so that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> What a mess...</li>
            <li> Though the description states that shampoo is organic one, it has all harsh components in it, including SLS and others.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo almost exclusively for the past five years.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a diverted product or not, though.</li>
            <li> He has very thick black hair</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I think the manufacturer has discontinued making it.</li>
            <li> The packaging was bad and the bottles leaked.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is insane!</li>

            <li> So disappointed. Product was opened, leaked out over entire bag it was in, then leaked all over box. I shouldn&#x27;t have to take the time to return this! What a mess...</li>
            <li> Good shampoo. Not need condition. I look everywhere a shampoo with nutrient, but i did not found. Only online.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells amazing!! Love, love, love this product.  I&#x27;ve tried many shampoo&#x27;s and this one is far and away the BEST.</li>
            <li> The smell is good, light not too strong. Feels like it gives a good clean wash...but it is not eye friendly. If you have sensitive eyes I would avoid this product. When I use it I can feel the fumes from it burning my eyes. The shampoo is not in my eyes mind you, its only in my hair but the fumes still burn the eyes a bit. I read many reviews of this shampoo before buying and didn&#x27;t see this type of comment, wish I had.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been using it for about 5 or 6 years now, We both love it. And it makes your hair feel more cleaner than we have ever used.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a shampoo containing more protein to help my damaged color treated hair.  Read about this product and decided to try it out.  It is very gentle on the hair and you don&#x27;t have to use a lot. Almost seems like it leaves something on the hair but it doesn&#x27;t feel weighed down or anything.  Happy with this product but may try one of the other shampoos from this line to compare.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite shampoo and I regularly use many kinds. When I need my hair to feel normal...I use Inergy!</li>
            <li> Had a strange smell to it at first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo almost exclusively for the past five years.  It is the absolute best product out there for my very fine, very thin hair!  It cleanses perfectly without drying my hair out, and gives it great body without the frizz.  Plus, it smells really good!</li>
            <li> He has used this for a very long time.  He has very thick black hair he loves the lather and smell.  It leaves his hair clean and really good condition.</li>
            <li> Ok not bad, but not sure how it&#x27;s different from Fructis or other store brands.</li>
            <li> I like the cleaning process of this shampoo, but, the aroma of this shampoo really does not go well with my body wash aroma.</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I buy over and over again. My hair is color treated and I do wash it almost every day. My stylist just told me that my hair was very healthy....I think in part to using this shampoo. I use it along with the Nexxus Phyto Organics Nectaress conditioner...love that one too!</li>
            <li> I have very thin/fine hair.  Gives amazing body and volume to my hair!  Also hair is more managable.  I highly recommend this shampoo!!</li>
            <li> love love love this product - makes hair so silky and easy to style. smells good but not overpowering like most</li>
            <li> This is a very good shampoo. I have been using it exclusively for 2 years. It is plant based. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair. I don&#x27;t have to use conditioner with it, so that doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. With the price as low as it was on Amazon, I wondered if this was a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34;. Not so. It is the same shampoo I have been buying at the salon. The salon charges the same price for a bottle 1/4 the size. Great bargain - Great product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use conditioner when I use this shampoo - and I don&#x27;t get split ends or dry scalp! Particularly like that it doesn&#x27;t smell sickly sweet like fruit or flowers - scent is more herbal. Unfortunately, I think the manufacturer has discontinued making it.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and was thrilled to find it for so cheap on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.  Never greasy, just right.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for everyday use</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this product for over 15 yrs, average price was $19-$25 love it but I&#x27;m not going to pay $85 for this shampoo or any shampoo. This is insane! What caused the price to go so  dramatically sky high?</li>
            <li> Got here fast. Good shampoo for my husband&#x27;s thick, straight Asian hair.</li>
            <li> The Nexxus Inergy Nutrient Shampoo is wonderful stuff. It keeps my hair clean without stripping it of all my natural oils. I love it and would definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Came in the advertised bottle. Pump works. Not sure if this is a diverted product or not, though. Smells alright.</li>
            <li> Good value. Have been using this shampoo for years. Colorsafe and also gives some volume.</li>
            <li> I have short, thick hair and my hairdresser recommended this to me years ago.  I have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo for 15 years and love it. No need to use a conditioner with it...hair turns out wonderfully clean and soft and manageable. Nice fragrance also.</li>
            <li> Nexxus Inergy leaves hair clean and refreshed without weighing it down with heavy moisturizers. In addition it provides protection for color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Adds moisture and leaves your hair clean with a nice shine and smell. It also give me healthy hair. Will be buying more of this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny and squeaky clean!</li>
            <li> very fragrant shampoo, very gentle on my hair.  I get a permanent every 6 months so it is important that I give back nutrients into my hair.</li>
            <li> The packaging was bad and the bottles leaked. This happened both times that I placed an order for the same thing.</li>
            <li> great for normal hair</li>
            <li> I have used Nexus Inergy Nutrient Shampoo for over 10yrs. now and I love it because it gives my hair a silky shine and does not dry it out either. I don&#x27;t have a build up in it nor do I have a greasy look to it after I shampoo. This product is safe for my color-treated hair and I would recommend it to anyone who has this type of hair or any other for that matter.</li>
            <li> Great product particularly for hair that tends to be dry or brittle.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo (rosemary and mint-ish) and how it cleans.  Great price as well.</li>
            <li> One of the few products that actually worked on my fine, limp hair!!  Then, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere!!  Luckily, I found it here and works as great as ever!!  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Been using for years.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Only gave it a 4 rating because I can&#x27;t figure out how to get the pump to work.</li>
            <li> Though the description states that shampoo is organic one, it has all harsh components in it, including SLS and others.&lt;br /&gt;It is drying out my head awfully.&lt;br /&gt;Besides that packaging was damaged, and was leaking.</li>
