            <li>I just always think they are more for show.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance and it&#x27;s a shame that it was discontinued from Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries this, and the price is about what Bath &amp; Body Works would charge.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite of the Bath &amp; Body Works scents.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells, and the body lotion is smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Others ask what I wear as the fragrance is sweet, not flowery, yet very clean and refreshing.  </li>
            <li>The texture is lovely; the scent even more so - subtle but delicious.</li>
            <li>Moonlight Path moisture body cream is so smooth, making your body radiant.  </li>
            <li>Love this scent, and it is very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>They smell amazing but don&#x27;t really work and have so much fragrance and frill in them that if you use them on your face you may break out.</li>
            <li>I have loved this cream for a very long time.</li>
            <li>This product is worth it.  </li>
            <li>Nice, rich and heavy but absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not going to because I&#x27;m more particular about the lotion I use on my face, but this is a great lotion to use on other parts of your body for dry skin</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon has it since you can only get it here</li>
            <li>It simply smells better on me:~))&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s much more subtle than most,</li>
            <li>but I was very displeased with the amount of s&amp;h charged per tube when they were sent all in one box.</li>
            <li>Smells really good.love it</li>
            <li>My boyfriend absolutely loves it, and the scent lasts so much longer than any of those &#x27;fruitier&#x27; lotions/sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hope B&amp;BW never discontinues this - I&#x27;d be absolutely heartbroken.</li>
            <li>really live itgreat product it last long love the scente it lasts all day combined with the lotion and body butter its swsome i have gotton may compliments on how clean and brisk the smell is.</li>
            <li>Thanks New Dream Factory!</li>
            <li>I am now luxuorating in a large tube and can be a little more liberal.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer stays on pretty much all day long, and the fragrance lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li>I hate a hand or body cream that just sits on your sking, but tis one easily absorbs and leaves you feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but by no means is it barely noticeable.</li>

            <li> , I think it was just severe dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very subtle scent that is positively commented on by coworkers daily.</li>
            <li> It cleared my dry skin irritation in probably 3 days!</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law, Michele, dropped a small tube of Moonlight Path into my stocking several years ago, and I found that I couldn&#x27;t bear not to have it on hand when I ran out.  </li>

            <li> Usually their lotions feel greasy and just aren&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> so I was forced to buy it at quite a discount</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like bath and body works products, and I&#x27;m a woman, so that&#x27;s shocking right?</li>
            <li> The lotion is very thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Bath and Body does not carry Moonlight Path anymore</li>

            <li> very awful fragrance.  </li>

            <li> Unfortunately, Bath and Body does not carry Moonlight Path anymore so I was forced to buy it at quite a discount online but I was very displeased with the amount of s&amp;h charged per tube when they were sent all in one box. I would recommend the product but not the seller. Will not order from them again.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law, Michele, dropped a small tube of Moonlight Path into my stocking several years ago, and I found that I couldn&#x27;t bear not to have it on hand when I ran out.  It&#x27;s quite perfumy, but a like that I like (which are few and far between!)  I am now luxuorating in a large tube and can be a little more liberal.  I hate a hand or body cream that just sits on your sking, but tis one easily absorbs and leaves you feeling nice and soft.</li>
            <li> very awful fragrance.  avoid.</li>
            <li> Works wonders for me.  I get compliments on how good I smell!!!  I use it on my body even my feet.  I love this stuff.....</li>
            <li> It was okay. I like fruity smells &amp; this wasn&#x27;t quite what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I ordered 4 different body creams and received 4 of the same.  Extremely disappointed</li>
            <li> Smells really good.love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this as my &#x27;signature scent&#x27; for the past 8 years or so. My boyfriend absolutely loves it, and the scent lasts so much longer than any of those &#x27;fruitier&#x27; lotions/sprays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much more subtle than most, but by no means is it barely noticeable. It&#x27;s one of those just-right fragrances. Not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope B&amp;BW never discontinues this - I&#x27;d be absolutely heartbroken.</li>
            <li> I use this product on hands, arms and legs daily.  Great texture and great scent. Very subtle scent that is positively commented on by coworkers daily.</li>
            <li> really live itgreat product it last long love the scente it lasts all day combined with the lotion and body butter its swsome i have gotton may compliments on how clean and brisk the smell is.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t like bath and body works products, and I&#x27;m a woman, so that&#x27;s shocking right? I just always think they are more for show. They smell amazing but don&#x27;t really work and have so much fragrance and frill in them that if you use them on your face you may break out. Usually their lotions feel greasy and just aren&#x27;t for me. I got this as a gift and it was lying around not being used. Then I had this skin irritation on my hand, I think it was just severe dry skin. So I decided to use this lotion. It cleared my dry skin irritation in probably 3 days! And it smells great, you can still smell this lotion on your skin the day after you use it. I haven&#x27;t used it on my face and I&#x27;m not going to because I&#x27;m more particular about the lotion I use on my face, but this is a great lotion to use on other parts of your body for dry skin and it smells wonderful. Not to girly smelling or overpowering. LOVE! Will probably buy another when mine runs out.</li>
            <li> Just wasn&#x27;t the scent I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Moonlight Path moisture body cream is so smooth, making your body radiant.  The soles of my feet feels softer and my skin shines, people thought I used oil.  Others ask what I wear as the fragrance is sweet, not flowery, yet very clean and refreshing.  This product is worth it.  Thanks New Dream Factory!</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizing lotion for the winter.  Nice, rich and heavy but absorbs well.  You need to rub it iin and let it set for awhile.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance and it&#x27;s a shame that it was discontinued from Bath &amp; Body Works. I looked on the B&amp;BW website and you can&#x27;t even get this fragrance there, I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon has it since you can only get it here and maybe Ebay. I love the way this smells, and the body lotion is smooth and creamy. The moisturizer stays on pretty much all day long, and the fragrance lasts a very long time. I&#x27;m so glad that Amazon carries this, and the price is about what Bath &amp; Body Works would charge. The seller got this to me very quickly, and I am so happy with my purchase of this great body moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Not only is it thick and luxurious, thus a little goes a long way, the scent itself is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;It does go on a bit strong(scent) but the scent lingers and that I love for hours after! (or days if it touched my clothing)</li>
            <li> I chose this product because my sisters found it years ago, so therefore I will be taking it over as mine.  It simply smells better on me:~))&lt;br /&gt;I love,love,love this body cream!</li>
            <li> Love this scent, and it is very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite of the Bath &amp; Body Works scents. The lotion is very thick and creamy. I find the scent lasts a long-time, as well.</li>
            <li> I did not like the smell</li>
