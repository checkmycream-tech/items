            <li>This evening Moisturizer is definitely rich</li>
            <li>Works great on my cheeks where my skin is dry.  </li>
            <li>I wish they take more consideration toeards a very sensitive skin care people..</li>
            <li>But so far good product for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>so natural ingredients in cream helps my skin look better at winter times.</li>
            <li>This is a thicker cream that does an exceptional job hydrating my overly dry skin.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t seen any results that are better than the Devita&lt;br /&gt;Perfecting</li>

            <li>During the winter, I actually use &#x27;evening rich&#x27; as a daytime moisturizer applied on already water moistened skin.</li>
            <li>but this is a high quality company that uses the finest ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin..</li>
            <li>For someone with EXTREMELY sensitive skin, I am so grateful for all the Devita products.</li>

            <li>I like Devita because it mainly uses products that have low health risk (no parabeans, etc.).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, but moisturizing enough to make my skin feel soft &amp; supple.  </li>

            <li> For someone with EXTREMELY sensitive skin, I am so grateful for all the Devita products. During the winter, I actually use &#x27;evening rich&#x27; as a daytime moisturizer applied on already water moistened skin. It never feels heavy on my skin like some evening moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Exactly as promised. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I bought it in Wholefood as I was looking for paraben free skin mosterizers. It works really well in the winter! and I&#x27;m happily surprised when I wear it under makeup. It makes my skin mosterized and makes it so easy to use foundation. I&#x27;m buying it again.</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my mom who has a very dry skin. She uses it before bed and in the morning and she feels the difference in her skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sold on the Devita brand because of their healthy ingredients.  This evening Moisturizer is definitely rich so it&#x27;s perfect for my dry skin at night.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  It does not break me out or leave any residue.  I&#x27;m able to apply make-up over top within 5-10 minutes after application.  Only a pea size amount is needed.  Last very long</li>
            <li> love this devita product, hope it never changes. Light weight and feel moisturized all night long, goes on smooth and absorbs easily</li>
            <li> My wife uses this.  In fact, she just placed a second order for it, as she really likes it.  Says it does a great job and isn&#x27;t greasy like so many others she&#x27;s tried.  A big plus is that it&#x27;s natural.</li>
            <li> Good one.. I have very sensitive skin.. I wish they take more consideration toeards a very sensitive skin care people.. Also it needs to moisturise more in winter.. But so far good product for sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I like Devita because it mainly uses products that have low health risk (no parabeans, etc.). The quality is very good and it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works great on my cheeks where my skin is dry.  However, it was not moisturizing enough for my eyes.  I ended up with dry patches of skin and had to use a separate eye cream.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that I use now because of its excellence.</li>
            <li> I am 38 with fair/combination skin, weathered by sun.  I bought this cream for nighttime use, but found I like it enough to use also during the day in the Winter.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy, but moisturizing enough to make my skin feel soft &amp; supple.  I also recommend the C Serum, &amp; the Eye Lift Cream to go with it.  I love that this line has all natural ingredients that actually works on my skin!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I have tried it before in test-kit and bought full version after. I have sensitive skin so natural ingredients in cream helps my skin look better at winter times. I shoud say that moisturizer has different packaging from image one, it realy looks like solar protective cream.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and this creme works great - better than most.</li>
            <li> I often tire of moisturizers and before I finish the bottle I forget about using it or toss it out and replace it with another overpriced concoction. Devita is one of the few moisturizers that I continue to use. Unlike other moisturizers, Devita&#x27;s line always absorbs into the skin and leaves it soft for hours.</li>
            <li> This is a thicker cream that does an exceptional job hydrating my overly dry skin. Love most of the DeVita line; they are local, paraben free and a great company. Pricier than other options out there but this is a high quality company that uses the finest ingredients.</li>
            <li> Got it for the ingredients and price-- have only used it a few times but definitely noticed how moisturized my skin felt...Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice creamy moisturizer (not too creamy).  So far I haven&#x27;t seen any results that are better than the Devita&lt;br /&gt;Perfecting Time Moisturizer. I do like this line and will continue to use some of the products.</li>
