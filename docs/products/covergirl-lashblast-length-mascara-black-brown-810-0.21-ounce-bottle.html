            <li>I am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>This I was happy to find and it is even cheaper here!</li>
            <li>Great price!</li>
            <li>Great product, incredible price</li>
            <li>, on the one hand, this product IS quite effective--it does truly do a good job of lengthening and separating lashes.  </li>
            <li>Good length mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it for years now, and I have no intention of switching, so you better keep making it, CoverGirl!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love the brush size and the very easy application!</li>
            <li>Nice application, but flaked after 4 hours</li>
            <li>It takes a couple coats though, but good purchase for the price :)</li>
            <li>Good stuff, love it, will recommend</li>
            <li>Okay, I&#x27;ll admit it--</li>
            <li>, although I still thought that product could be just a bit better.  </li>
            <li>I love this product</li>
            <li>it is my favorite of any that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>The point of makeup is to--in many cases--look like you aren&#x27;t wearing any.</li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>This mascara does a great job at offering definition of my lashes and making them stand out without looking so completely unnatural</li>
            <li>Comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>I have tried Cover Girl&#x27;s original [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>So I expected Lash Blast Length, with its pretty, slim tube, to be the perfect compromise; plus, my own short, stubby lashes are definitely more in need of length than volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
            <li>Although Maybelline&#x27;s [[ASIN:B0000536M4 Maybelline Full</li>
            <li>sure you clean the powder off your lashes, top and bottom, with a clean mascara or brow wand prior to applying mascara.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>This is absolutely the best mascara I have ever tried - natural look, easily removed with water, and doesn&#x27;t end up on my face at the end of the day in the shape of black powder.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and the brush works in place of a curler just fine if you go skillfully over the first coat with a light second coat.</li>
            <li>My favorite CG so far has been [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this mascara for times when I want a fresh, no-makeup look, but I won&#x27;t be re-purchasing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the most natural.</li>
            <li>I love it, it makes my eyelashes look really natural.</li>
            <li>The color is great and the product isn&#x27;t thick or clumpy like other CoverGirl mascaras that I have used, Overall, great product!!!</li>
            <li>I have to face the fact that i&#x27;m pretty judgy about mascara.</li>
            <li>I use this lengthening mascara first, then finish with the CG clump crusher mascara.  </li>
            <li>As I said, this product clearly makes my lashes longer, and if you compared my bare eye to the applied one, you would be able to tell the difference, but otherwise, you would probably NOT know that I was wearing eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>really like how it separates lashes &amp; coats each lash</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly, and my lashes only require one coat.</li>
            <li>I have issues with most mascaras that it drops down onto my eyelid giving me racoon eyes.</li>
            <li>Many of the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; ones still drop down.</li>
            <li>If i want drama i use black brown on my top lashes and brown on the bottom then darken my brows some.....</li>
            <li>I am constantly buying new ones in hopes of finding the perfect product for making my sparse, thin lashes look long, full, and lush.</li>
            <li>I am very picky about my mascara - it has to give natural look, no lumps.</li>
            <li>I have light blue eyes and blonde lashes and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;N Soft Mascara, Dark Brown - .28 oz]] was my go-to product for awhile, more recently, I have been on a Cover Girl kick.</li>
            <li>use brown for a fully natural look.</li>
            <li>Seemed old.</li>
            <li>I could see how this might be useful in some situations (or for those with lighter coloring, such as blonds), but it was not the overall effect that I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li>i had to escape my natural mascaras and come back to this because i am so mascara</li>
            <li>Cover Girl Lash Exact Mascara - Black Brown]]</li>
            <li>Not a long process.&lt;br /&gt;for</li>

            <li> My go to for daytime use.  It is easy to apply and the brush works in place of a curler just fine if you go skillfully over the first coat with a light second coat.</li>
            <li> really like how it separates lashes &amp; coats each lash</li>
            <li> Okay, I&#x27;ll admit it--I think I have a mascara addiction! I am constantly buying new ones in hopes of finding the perfect product for making my sparse, thin lashes look long, full, and lush. Although Maybelline&#x27;s [[ASIN:B0000536M4 Maybelline Full &#x27;N Soft Mascara, Dark Brown - .28 oz]] was my go-to product for awhile, more recently, I have been on a Cover Girl kick. My favorite CG so far has been [[ASIN:B001ESN2M0 Cover Girl Lash Exact Mascara - Black Brown]], although I still thought that product could be just a bit better.  I thought that maybe this product, Lash Blast Length, would meet my needs.  I have tried Cover Girl&#x27;s original [[ASIN:B001BMJPD4 Cover Girl Lash Blast Waterproof Mascara - Very Black]], and found it to be disappointing--although the product itself worked well, I found both the tube and the wand to be much too fat and unwieldy for practical, everyday use.  So I expected Lash Blast Length, with its pretty, slim tube, to be the perfect compromise; plus, my own short, stubby lashes are definitely more in need of length than volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, on the one hand, this product IS quite effective--it does truly do a good job of lengthening and separating lashes.  However, the effect is SO subtle that you can hardly tell that I have mascara on!  As I said, this product clearly makes my lashes longer, and if you compared my bare eye to the applied one, you would be able to tell the difference, but otherwise, you would probably NOT know that I was wearing eye makeup.

            <li> Flakey!  Nice application, but flaked after 4 hours</li>
            <li> This was worthless!  There is so little product in the tube or it is so dry that very little is added to my lashes even with multiple applications.</li>
            <li> I was so upset when I found out they quit selling this product at all of the Walgreens and Walmart&#x27;s in my area. I do not understand why they would do that. I came on here to find it and was so happy! I love this product it is my favorite of any that I have ever used. It goes on smoothly, and my lashes only require one coat. The color is great and the product isn&#x27;t thick or clumpy like other CoverGirl mascaras that I have used, Overall, great product!!!</li>
            <li> best mascara for lengthening</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my lashes appear any longer, which is what I was wanting.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get the desired, long look. I have to use several coats. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend brown-black</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. I&#x27;m not sure why it isn&#x27;t the number one in the world. It&#x27;s the most natural. I have to face the fact that i&#x27;m pretty judgy about mascara. When i see clumps of mascara on the lashes of other women or on their face, i wonder to myself why they put up with that. The point of makeup is to--in many cases--look like you aren&#x27;t wearing any. This mascara is undetectable when applied properly and patiently. UNDETECTABLE! it stays in place unless i cry or rub my eyes. Comes off easily with soap and water. Does not score well on ewg tho. i had to escape my natural mascaras and come back to this because i am so mascara judgy.&lt;br /&gt;I use brown for a fully natural look. If i want drama i use black brown on my top lashes and brown on the bottom then darken my brows some.....i&#x27;m blonde.&lt;br /&gt;Properly applied mascara: One coat at a time. Let dry in between coats. Not a long process.&lt;br /&gt;for a thick look: Wiggle the mascara at the base of the lash then sweep upward. Let dry. repeat.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure you clean the powder off your lashes, top and bottom, with a clean mascara or brow wand prior to applying mascara.</li>
            <li> Great product, incredible price</li>

            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this locally then it was amazon.com to the rescue. I have issues with most mascaras that it drops down onto my eyelid giving me racoon eyes. This does not. Many of the &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; ones still drop down. This I was happy to find and it is even cheaper here!</li>
            <li> Great price! Especially with Amazon coupons!</li>
            <li> Good length mascara. Goes on well and isnt too clumpy. Works well with other mascara also.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, love it, will recommend</li>
            <li> Quick delivery.  Love the brush size and the very easy application!</li>
