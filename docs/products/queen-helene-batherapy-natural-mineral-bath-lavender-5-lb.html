            <li>If you enjoy a relaxing soak in the tub</li>
            <li>and I loved it so much that I bought the huge jug ;-)</li>
            <li>I have been buying this product and the original Batherapy  made by Queen Helene  for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>Fine crystals dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it&#x27;s really hard to find good quality bath minerals in bulk for such a good price, not to mention most of the reviews were pretty good.</li>
            <li>and you will be ready to go again and pain free!</li>
            <li>Not only that, it never smelled as good as the liquid version.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;very bought this a number of times and it&#x27;s a great product for relaxation as well as a big help for muscle soreness.  </li>
            <li>It stains and smells super mediciney.</li>
            <li>I quickly ran out and immediately reordered on Amazon.</li>
            <li>then you are in for a real treat, and of course this product is SAFE for all your plumbing ( I can&#x27;t speak for the true &#x27;Jacuzzi&#x27; outdoor hot tubs...</li>
            <li>Well worth it-</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t even need a fancy-shmancy whirlpool bath, this stuff will turn even a simple warm tub bath into something relaxing and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Buy it if you don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose :)</li>
            <li>My wife does like the product, and for the price, is able to use them frequently without breaking the bank.  </li>
            <li>have tried many expensive bath soaks and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and you enjoy a soft lavender scent, these bath salts are you you.</li>
            <li>It really helps dissolve your stress too!</li>
            <li>Very soothing and relaxing!  </li>
            <li>so I do not have to use so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in love with anything shower/bath related.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing!</li>
            <li>If you want a more relaxing experience, add some pure essential lavender oil from a bottle after drawing the bath and your experience will be ten-fold.</li>
            <li>Soothing bath salts with mild natural smell.</li>
            <li>friend of mine said prolong exposure to sulfate or to a large quantity of it would cause hallucinations.  </li>
            <li>I bought it thinking it would last longer than the liquid, but the powder was so fine that I ended up having to use so much in the bathtub each time.</li>
            <li>Very fragrant and soothing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously though, this is something that is very fragrant.</li>
            <li>The one that I&#x27;ve purchased from Whole Foods had none of</li>
            <li>very \\&quot;picky\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Just too much money for salt.</li>
            <li>My muscles and joints can really hurt.</li>
            <li>It really does make my bathroom smell like a spa.</li>
            <li>Ready to crawl between two sheets for a restful night.</li>
            <li>smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming like other brands.</li>
            <li>I want to believe that this is just an older version(since</li>
            <li>I am getting older and I work out a lot and do a ton of yard work.</li>
            <li>I use this Batherapy to wine down, it makes my body feel very refresh!!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 years now and will continue as well as highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It is so nice to treat yourself to a at-home spa retreat after a hard day at work, and this is the product you want to help you</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of natural spring water (with sulfate) because I always feel very relaxed after.  </li>
            <li>It is great after a long hard day at the office or on the job!</li>
            <li>I have tried hundreds of bath salts and bath aromatherapy products in the past and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>this isnt for you, on the other hand, if you cannot get enough of lavender, then you will love this along with its benefits.</li>
            <li>if mixed with higher quality bath salts.</li>
            <li>This is not at all like the smaller container and envelope batherapy bath salts, which are sodium chloride and magnesium sulfate based bath salts, a higher quality since your skin won&#x27;t prune in those salts, and also contain patchouli oil.  </li>
            <li>This large five pound container is sodium sesquicarbonate, which leaves your bath water feeling soapy, and causes your skin to prune, not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t smell the same (doesn&#x27;t have the patchouli oil) as the 20 oz container.  </li>
            <li>It does not smell natural.</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to that sort of thing</li>
            <li>: This is VERY different from what they sell at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>I found this on a shelf in a local grocery store a few years ago, and fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just have to be careful not to put too much in or it burns!</li>
            <li>I would buy again when this large jar nears empty.</li>
            <li>, if you just have had a long day on your feet, and have hot, tired, achy feet, try putting some of this in a small foot bath or bucket with some hot water and soak your feet for a good half hour</li>
            <li>I am highly allergic to certain types of fragrance and was wary of this at first.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount you get and the delivery is within a week of ordering or less, I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful Lavendar sent!</li>
            <li>How much testing half you done on this?</li>

            <li> this isnt for you, on the other hand, if you cannot get enough of lavender, then you will love this along with its benefits.</li>
            <li> if mixed with higher quality bath salts.</li>
            <li> This is not at all like the smaller container and envelope batherapy bath salts, which are sodium chloride and magnesium sulfate based bath salts, a higher quality since your skin won&#x27;t prune in those salts, and also contain patchouli oil.  </li>
            <li> This large five pound container is sodium sesquicarbonate, which leaves your bath water feeling soapy, and causes your skin to prune, not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t smell the same (doesn&#x27;t have the patchouli oil) as the 20 oz container.  </li>
            <li> It does not smell natural.</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to that sort of thing</li>
            <li> : This is VERY different from what they sell at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> I found this on a shelf in a local grocery store a few years ago, and fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just have to be careful not to put too much in or it burns!</li>
            <li> I would buy again when this large jar nears empty.</li>
            <li> , if you just have had a long day on your feet, and have hot, tired, achy feet, try putting some of this in a small foot bath or bucket with some hot water and soak your feet for a good half hour</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to certain types of fragrance and was wary of this at first.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount you get and the delivery is within a week of ordering or less, I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful Lavendar sent!</li>
            <li> How much testing half you done on this?</li>
            <li> the packaging looks a little older), but it could be a knock-off.</li>
            <li> The price for the amount isn&#x27;t bad, but still, I would rather spend my money on a high quality product with a better scent.</li>
            <li> It is very relaxing and results are usually felt the following day.</li>
            <li> Personally I find the scent of this product unpleasant, generally lavender is a favorite of mine, but I can&#x27;t say that I found the supposed lavender scent in this product pleasing at all.  </li>
            <li> The 5 lb size is a terrific value and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> After soaking in for 20 minutes, no matter what condition my body is in, such as laying in bed and typing away on a laptop, I can fall asleep naturally not knowing what happened.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is extremely oily, which leaves your skin really gross, and the salt in the container is total POWDER not salt.</li>
            <li> My order was received as expected.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone with serious aches and pains!</li>
            <li> The epsom salt in it is relaxing for the muscles and it does have actual lavender essential oil (not the artificial fragrance) to promote deep sleep.</li>
            <li> Just what my tired old body needs when I hit my jet tub after a day in the fields.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why, but it also seems to clean out my jacuzzi tub when it gets dirty as well.  </li>
            <li> I can buy bath salts for much less.  </li>
            <li> It helped with a quite a few of my pain and cramping issues and my gf likes the smell it imparts on the house.</li>
            <li> However, DO NOT get the green one.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, who likes lavender dead sea salts for her bath.  </li>
            <li> Very medicinal smell but not too bad</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a small packet of this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> I used at then end of stressful days or hard workout days.......</li>
            <li> It will be at least &#x60;8 hours before the swelling disappears.  </li>
            <li> When you open the lid it smells like cat litter and weird lavander-ish cleaning chemicals!</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is a product that you will not regret in getting.&lt;br /&gt;Get</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, dead sea salts are rather expensive.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is not at all worth your money and gives you a terrible bath water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have salt chucks sticking to your legs and irritating your skin.</li>
            <li> I have used these slat before and it is relaxing and soothing to tired muscles</li>
            <li> This is seriously my stress relief!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave weird chalky bath rings either.</li>
            <li> The only reason I rated this four stars, instead of five, is because of the horrible smell it has!</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like stuff that smells \\&quot;fakey\\&quot; or \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; and sickening</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Works magic on sprains and aches.  Much better than Epsom salt.</li>
            <li> I got this because I love taking a bath and I love adding lavender Epsom salt to my baths but this stuff stank like sulfur and after using it, I stank like sulfur until I showered again. Don&#x27;t buy unless you want to smell like rotten eggs</li>
            <li> I love this product. The 5 lb size is a terrific value and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Very fragrant and soothing.</li>
            <li> If you ache and need relief, this is the product for you. It is very relaxing and results are usually felt the following day. I&#x27;ve used this product for 3 years now and will continue as well as highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a small packet of this and I loved it so much that I bought the huge jug ;-)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell of this. It does not smell natural.</li>
            <li> I found this on a shelf in a local grocery store a few years ago, and fell in love with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bath salt contains sulfate.  It does have a light smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a fan of natural spring water (with sulfate) because I always feel very relaxed after.  After soaking in for 20 minutes, no matter what condition my body is in, such as laying in bed and typing away on a laptop, I can fall asleep naturally not knowing what happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine said prolong exposure to sulfate or to a large quantity of it would cause hallucinations.  This bath salt has an ingredient that&#x27;s anti hallucinogenic.  I have been using it twice a month at most.  It hasn&#x27;t been a problem at all.</li>
            <li> I have tried hundreds of bath salts and bath aromatherapy products in the past and this is definitely my favorite. It is so nice to treat yourself to a at-home spa retreat after a hard day at work, and this is the product you want to help you unwind.&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t overwhelming like other brands. But it is definitely not unnoticeable either. It dissolves quickly in warm water so you don&#x27;t have salt chucks sticking to your legs and irritating your skin. It doesn&#x27;t leave weird chalky bath rings either. All in all, I am very happy with this product, I would recommend it to friends and I have bought it several times for myself.</li>
            <li> My sister-in-law introduced me to this product and I&#x27;ve now been hooked on it for years. Very relaxing soak with nice scent.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Batherapy.  I have used it for years and now I have a source, AMAZON, for the 5 lb jar.</li>
            <li> Soothing bath salts with mild natural smell. Softens the water and feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;very bought this a number of times and it&#x27;s a great product for relaxation as well as a big help for muscle soreness.  This company does a wonderful job of packaging and timely shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years! Imagine my joy when I found out that I could get 5 lbs of the stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you LOVE lavender, if you LOVE a beautifying soak, and if you LOVE silky skin... This is the stuff for you! They also have a sports one for if you have aches and pains, and I think one for colds as well. Seriously, this is a product that you will not regret in getting.&lt;br /&gt;Get it while you can too... If all goes according to what I want I will be ordering a 5lb container of this every month to stock up LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, this is something that is very fragrant. If you are sensitive to that sort of thing this isnt for you, on the other hand, if you cannot get enough of lavender, then you will love this along with its benefits.</li>
            <li> A friend gave me a sample years ago. It helped with a quite a few of my pain and cramping issues and my gf likes the smell it imparts on the house.</li>
            <li> I have used this stuff for years, and it is the best bath salt that I have found, and the price is really reasonable.  I am not sure why, but it also seems to clean out my jacuzzi tub when it gets dirty as well.  I think it is the abrasive quality of the salt. I personally love the strong lavender smell.  However, DO NOT get the green one.  It stains and smells super mediciney.</li>
            <li> Once I was in a wheelchair and had to get back to my former job as an animal control officer.  My therapist recommended this product and it worked then and continues to work now.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone with serious aches and pains!</li>
            <li> so wonderful. It makes the whole bathroom smell so nice and so relaxing. Well worth it-</li>
            <li> A great therapeutic bath.</li>
            <li> Best bath therapy ever!!</li>
            <li> Helps in sleep and does alleviate my fibromyalgia. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. My order was received as expected. Will order this product again for sure. Will share experience with others.</li>
            <li> Contains Sodium Laurel Suflate</li>
            <li> I use this every day and it is wonderful for stress relief and muscle aches and pain.  Love this product and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best.  If you enjoy a relaxing soak in the tub and you enjoy a soft lavender scent, these bath salts are you you.</li>
            <li> After a day of gardening or a workout at the gym, I use this in my bath. It is not only relaxing, but sooths the sore muscles.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many expensive bath soaks and this is by far the best. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Personally I find the scent of this product unpleasant, generally lavender is a favorite of mine, but I can&#x27;t say that I found the supposed lavender scent in this product pleasing at all.  The price for the amount isn&#x27;t bad, but still, I would rather spend my money on a high quality product with a better scent.</li>
            <li> Alert: This is VERY different from what they sell at Whole Foods. I want to believe that this is just an older version(since the packaging looks a little older), but it could be a knock-off. It is extremely oily, which leaves your skin really gross, and the salt in the container is total POWDER not salt. The one that I&#x27;ve purchased from Whole Foods had none of these features.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to be aware of what you&#x27;re buying!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a GREAT Batherapy Bath, Lavender Bath is the way to go!  You will love everything this product does to you and your body!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years. I am happy that Amazon has it to order. You&#x27;ll fall asleep in the tub when you soak in this batherapy. It&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> This product is great just for relaxing in the tubby!  But even better if you have overworked your muscles a nice soak and you feel wonderful.  Can&#x27;t beat the price for the amount you get and the delivery is within a week of ordering or less, I highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Wonderful Lavendar sent!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! It is soothing, relaxing, refreshing, and revitalizing! This product takes away your daily aches and pains and makes you feel incredibly renewed! It is great after a long hard day at the office or on the job! It really helps dissolve your stress too! It is a great buy for the money and I would recommend it to anyone looking for to turn there tub into a spa experience!</li>
            <li> I use this Batherapy to wine down, it makes my body feel very refresh!!!! I recommend it to anyone that need to have a spa feeling to their body in their baths at home!!!</li>
            <li> I used this once and loved it. No problems, felt great.  The second time I used it my left ankle and foot began spelling. I used it the fourth time this morning. Now it swells up the left  leg about 8 inches up.  It will be at least &#x60;8 hours before the swelling disappears.  I cannot walk on the leg while the allergy persists.  How much testing half you done on this? I am going back  to the Epson salts and lavender the drug stores sell at a fraction of the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virginia T. James,  Litchfield,Ct</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, its soo soothing and relaxing in the tub. I get it a lot.</li>
            <li> Amazing product......I used at then end of stressful days or hard workout days.......it the best!</li>
            <li> Delighted with lavender for a change. Great after housework and yard work. Softening.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years, and it is truly a blessing for sore muscles, arthritis, sore joints or just to treat yourself to a \\&quot;spa day\\&quot; at home. It really DOES relax your muscles and joints and is great to use in your bath before bedtime to relax you. You don&#x27;t even need a fancy-shmancy whirlpool bath, this stuff will turn even a simple warm tub bath into something relaxing and wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very \\&quot;picky\\&quot; when it comes to anything Lavender scented...I don&#x27;t like stuff that smells \\&quot;fakey\\&quot; or \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; and sickening/overpowering. This stuff smells like the Lavender salts I remember from my German grandmother. Very soothing and relaxing!  If you DO have a garden tub or one with built in jets then you are in for a real treat, and of course this product is SAFE for all your plumbing ( I can&#x27;t speak for the true &#x27;Jacuzzi&#x27; outdoor hot tubs...I don&#x27;t think this would be safe for that.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you just have had a long day on your feet, and have hot, tired, achy feet, try putting some of this in a small foot bath or bucket with some hot water and soak your feet for a good half hour and you will be ready to go again and pain free!</li>
            <li> This is seriously my stress relief! I mix this with regular cheaper epsom salt so I do not have to use so much!</li>
            <li> I have a problem with pain in my body. A friend told me about this product 10 years ago, been using it every since.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with this product. I bought it thinking it would last longer than the liquid, but the powder was so fine that I ended up having to use so much in the bathtub each time. Not only that, it never smelled as good as the liquid version. I probably will not buy the powder version again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and turn around delivery time. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Just what my tired old body needs when I hit my jet tub after a day in the fields.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with anything shower/bath related. I bought this product because it&#x27;s really hard to find good quality bath minerals in bulk for such a good price, not to mention most of the reviews were pretty good. The only reason I rated this four stars, instead of five, is because of the horrible smell it has! When you open the lid it smells like cat litter and weird lavander-ish cleaning chemicals! It makes me gag. I almost didn&#x27;t want to use it, but I tried it anyway. It works great in the bath and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and smells fine when in the water, so I guess it&#x27;s a satisfying product. Buy it if you don&#x27;t have a sensitive nose :)</li>
            <li> spa holiday in a jar&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great for skin and body aches&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sent and relaxing good for destressing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keep it coming</li>
            <li> Very medicinal smell but not too bad if mixed with higher quality bath salts.</li>
            <li> Smells great. Works great.</li>
            <li> I can buy bath salts for much less.  guess I shouldn&#x27;t have bought this, opps. Just too much money for salt.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Great scent and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I love these salts. This is a really good deal to be able to get 5lbs for this price.  I am getting older and I work out a lot and do a ton of yard work. My muscles and joints can really hurt. This product helps a lot. And I think it smells delicious. It really does make my bathroom smell like a spa. I have been buying this product and the original Batherapy  made by Queen Helene  for decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  am going to order another 5lbs tonight.</li>
            <li> These bath salts have a great aroma and add a lot to the bath.  Good price as well.  Fine crystals dissolve quickly.</li>
            <li> I am highly allergic to certain types of fragrance and was wary of this at first. It was given to me by a friend.  But it did not affect my skin at all and the smell is heavenly!  I quickly ran out and immediately reordered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used these slat before and it is relaxing and soothing to tired muscles and I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Lavender Batherapy makes me feel silky and relaxed. I&#x27;m not sure if it &amp;#34;takes away&amp;#34; aches and pains, but it sure does a great job of distracting me from them. I just have to be careful not to put too much in or it burns!</li>
            <li> Best product for the price. The epsom salt in it is relaxing for the muscles and it does have actual lavender essential oil (not the artificial fragrance) to promote deep sleep. Best before bed bath remedy. Do moisturize after using this product, especially the soles of your feet as it does have a drying effect like all products that contain epsom salt. If you want a more relaxing experience, add some pure essential lavender oil from a bottle after drawing the bath and your experience will be ten-fold.</li>
            <li> I bought this before but not in lavender and it works so well I wanted to get more. I recommend it for sore achy bodies, I love baths and it takes the aches away</li>
            <li> This product is great for relaxing and soothing away aches and pain. The lavender scent helps me  go to sleep faster.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, who likes lavender dead sea salts for her bath.  Unfortunately, dead sea salts are rather expensive.  These &amp;#34;salts&amp;#34; are a combination of items with a lavender scent.  My wife does like the product, and for the price, is able to use them frequently without breaking the bank.  I would buy again when this large jar nears empty.</li>
            <li> Lower yourself into the relaxing soothing waters scented  with lavender and escape the presses of the day.  Emerge feeling relaxed and skin soothed and softened. Ready to crawl between two sheets for a restful night.</li>
            <li> I already had this product before and needed more. I knew what the product did plus the aroma of Lavender is what I wanted. In reality I had fallen and wanted this on hand if in case I needed it again.</li>
            <li> This is not at all like the smaller container and envelope batherapy bath salts, which are sodium chloride and magnesium sulfate based bath salts, a higher quality since your skin won&#x27;t prune in those salts, and also contain patchouli oil.  This large five pound container is sodium sesquicarbonate, which leaves your bath water feeling soapy, and causes your skin to prune, not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t smell the same (doesn&#x27;t have the patchouli oil) as the 20 oz container.  This stuff is not at all worth your money and gives you a terrible bath water.&lt;br /&gt;i wish I could get my money back.</li>
            <li> Needing to do epsom salt baths for Lyme Disease detox, and this lavender scented one is wonderful! Very relaxing! Enjoy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my girlfriends favorite bath soap.  I have used it too and it&#x27;s fine. And I wish anybody reading this a good day.</li>
