    <ol>
            <li>Great shampoo!</li>
            <li>stuff is awesome!  </li>
            <li>Product is very good...</li>
            <li>I was happy with the color results with these as well, but found I needed to use a conditioner with these colors.  </li>
            <li>on time and just as expected…..very happy with the order and the quality of the product…would happily order this again</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>If I were Tressa, I would market it for that, as it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Well, since it is effective, it will stain caulk, fabric, etc.  </li>
            <li>She hates to dye her hair, yet it&#x27;s been kind of mandatory.</li>
            <li>Does a good job and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Actually Tressa needs to contact me because I have another awesome product idea for them (love this company!)</li>
            <li>It smells nice, feels fine on my hair.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I am bummed that this product didn&#x27;t work out better for me.</li>
            <li>They make so many colors that you are bound to find something you can</li>
            <li>A conditioner will solve this, though :-)</li>
            <li>I love Tressa</li>
            <li>But since my hair is no longer screaming &amp;#34;I am an old lady who colors her hair!&amp;#34; , I am MORE than happy.</li>
            <li>But oooh that Black Coffee on Caramel highlights and blondes, perfect off label use that would make Tressa a mint if they put it out there! :)</li>
            <li>Easy to apply , no stains on clothes.</li>
            <li>It is also important to throughly rinse the shower after use as the shampoo can stain.</li>
            <li>Also love the Crimson Splash shampoo used to keep my reds fresh.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of other color-adding shampoos after starting to color my hair, but it is surprising how many a) are barely effective and b) produce skin</li>
            <li>Adds color, vibrancy, and makes your hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>I tried more than one, hoping that was a problem with only that formula.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t give it an accurate assessment because I only used it for a couple of weeks when I was on vacation and out in the sun and swimming a couple times a day.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work...</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>It is more of a medium brown than a dark &amp;#34;black coffee&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Adds a lovely sheer smoke toner over the blonde parts.</li>
            <li>I love this so much, this is the old packaging by the way, but re: the Tressa Black Coffee Shampoo.</li>
            <li>I placed it in a small bottle with a good, tight screw on top and fortunately, double bagged in a ziplock.</li>
            <li>For whatever reason the product oozes out of the top.</li>
            <li>I also have the Violet Wash and use it occasionally and am planning on using this exclusively when I get more grey.</li>
            <li>though, I can&#x27;t understand the reviews that imply that this also conditions; my hair is super dry after I use this.  </li>
            <li>I do have very fine hair so perhaps for customers with thick hair</li>
            <li>Although it does not deposit a lot of color, partially because I am turning gray, it smells fantastic and actually leaves my hair silky without conditioner.</li>
            <li>I am always trying to enhance the natural color of my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair grows FAST, so the color usually only lasts a couple of weeks.  </li>
            <li>(I have short hair, so needing to use conditioner is unusual).  </li>
            <li>Whether the top is snapped shut, or left open standing straight up it still oozes out.</li>
            <li>I was aware that tinted shampoo tends to dry you out</li>
            <li>It can be very drying however so it can only be used occasionally.</li>
            <li>I only wanted to enhance my natural brown hair.  </li>
            <li>First, the color isn&#x27;t as dark as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Not a fast help, takes two or three shampoos to really see that it&#x27;s helping.</li>
            <li>This product does that, but even though it&#x27;s not supposed to cover the grey, it does deposit some color on the grey and just makes my hair look naturally highlighted and SO shiny!  </li>

            <li> It does not color gray, but it dulls the gray and it completely shuts down the red that pops through.</li>
            <li> I will also add that I cut back to only 1-2 uses per week and was using an extremely moisturizing conditioner along with it.</li>
            <li> so I ordered it in two different dark shades.</li>
            <li> I use this stuff, mixed with the Crimson Splash variant, to both keep my dark brown and add some dark red</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me, but I have naturally blonde hair and decided to go dark for awhile.</li>
            <li> Second, it was extremely drying!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much grey, and am not interested in covering it.  </li>
            <li> I normally have light, dirty blonde hair; which I got tired of after 18 years.  </li>
            <li> So, for a long time I&#x27;ve been dying it dark brown.  </li>
            <li> You have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> In the short time I used it, I would say that I didn&#x27;t notice any of my usual grays appearing, so I think it helped.  </li>
            <li> but this was extreme.</li>
            <li> Be very careful.</li>
            <li> I do not need a conditioner with the Black Coffee.  </li>
            <li> but in the other hand that is hardly a surprise.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t help stop or even slow the fading.</li>
            <li> I came to the conclusion that there is no Shampoo that can do what this one claims and fails to do.</li>
            <li> Packaging is Horrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great shampoo! Helps to go longer between colorings!</li>
            <li> Product is very good...Packaging is Horrible! For whatever reason the product oozes out of the top. Whether the top is snapped shut, or left open standing straight up it still oozes out.I have to leave it standing in the middle of my shower, over the drain so that it doesn&#x27;t ruin my marble floor. Forget about taking it with you on a trip.The product cannot be contained. I placed it in a small bottle with a good, tight screw on top and fortunately, double bagged in a ziplock. Contents leaked out of bottle &amp; I ended up scooping it out of the bag to wash my hair.Be very careful. It doesn&#x27;t matter which color. I tried more than one, hoping that was a problem with only that formula.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Although it does not deposit a lot of color, partially because I am turning gray, it smells fantastic and actually leaves my hair silky without conditioner. I like that it refreshes my brunette color and helps even out prior dye fading.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a year.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo. I don&#x27;t have much grey, and am not interested in covering it.  I only wanted to enhance my natural brown hair.  This product does that, but even though it&#x27;s not supposed to cover the grey, it does deposit some color on the grey and just makes my hair look naturally highlighted and SO shiny!  I do not need a conditioner with the Black Coffee.  I&#x27;ve tried the Crimson Splash, Cocoa, and Mocha Drench. I was happy with the color results with these as well, but found I needed to use a conditioner with these colors.  I also have the Violet Wash and use it occasionally and am planning on using this exclusively when I get more grey.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work... At all.</li>
            <li> It was promptly delivered.  It smells nice, feels fine on my hair. In the short time I used it, I would say that I didn&#x27;t notice any of my usual grays appearing, so I think it helped.  I must confess,  I couldn&#x27;t give it an accurate assessment because I only used it for a couple of weeks when I was on vacation and out in the sun and swimming a couple times a day.</li>
            <li> on time and just as expected…..very happy with the order and the quality of the product…would happily order this again</li>
            <li> I am always trying to enhance the natural color of my hair. I saw this product advertised in a magazine and went to Amazon to look for it. They had it so I ordered it in two different dark shades. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but looking forward to doing that soon.</li>
            <li> I am bummed that this product didn&#x27;t work out better for me. First, the color isn&#x27;t as dark as I thought it would be. It is more of a medium brown than a dark &amp;#34;black coffee&amp;#34; color. Second, it was extremely drying! I do have very fine hair so perhaps for customers with thick hair it will not have this effect. I was aware that tinted shampoo tends to dry you out but this was extreme. My hair didn&#x27;t feel like real human hair. I will also add that I cut back to only 1-2 uses per week and was using an extremely moisturizing conditioner along with it. Take it or leave it but that is my review.</li>
            <li> I normally have light, dirty blonde hair; which I got tired of after 18 years.  So, for a long time I&#x27;ve been dying it dark brown.  My hair grows FAST, so the color usually only lasts a couple of weeks.  I use this stuff, mixed with the Crimson Splash variant, to both keep my dark brown and add some dark red tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awesome!  They make so many colors that you are bound to find something you can use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note though, I can&#x27;t understand the reviews that imply that this also conditions; my hair is super dry after I use this.  A conditioner will solve this, though :-)</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product. Does help with between hair coloring days with gray roots. Not a fast help, takes two or three shampoos to really see that it&#x27;s helping. Not a miracle but definitely &amp;#34;a helper&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. Adds color, vibrancy, and makes your hair super shiny. It can be very drying however so it can only be used occasionally. It is also important to throughly rinse the shower after use as the shampoo can stain.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of other color-adding shampoos after starting to color my hair, but it is surprising how many a) are barely effective and b) produce skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works!  It does not color gray, but it dulls the gray and it completely shuts down the red that pops through. I have had no skin reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons?  Well, since it is effective, it will stain caulk, fabric, etc.  You have to be careful.  And I do have to use just a touch of conditioner afterwards (I have short hair, so needing to use conditioner is unusual).  But since my hair is no longer screaming &amp;#34;I am an old lady who colors her hair!&amp;#34; , I am MORE than happy.</li>
            <li> I have to die  my hair every 3 weeks to cover my grays. When I cant, or towards the end of the third week, I use this to help cover my gray.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT. THANKS</li>
            <li> She hates to dye her hair, yet it&#x27;s been kind of mandatory. She now gets a bit of a break thankfully. I love Tressa</li>
            <li> I came to the conclusion that there is no Shampoo that can do what this one claims and fails to do. So... in sum it does not work but in the other hand that is hardly a surprise.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all for me, but I have naturally blonde hair and decided to go dark for awhile. It didn&#x27;t help stop or even slow the fading.</li>
            <li> I love this so much, this is the old packaging by the way, but re: the Tressa Black Coffee Shampoo. I am a hairdresser and how I use and market this, is as an at-home toner for my blonde friends! Used once per week, it keeps  caramel highlights or ombre from looking brassy. Adds a lovely sheer smoke toner over the blonde parts. I hope it&#x27;s never discontinued. If I were Tressa, I would market it for that, as it&#x27;s amazing! Actually Tressa needs to contact me because I have another awesome product idea for them (love this company!) Also love the Crimson Splash shampoo used to keep my reds fresh. But oooh that Black Coffee on Caramel highlights and blondes, perfect off label use that would make Tressa a mint if they put it out there! :)</li>
            <li> Bought to replace discontinued Artec coloring shampoo.  Easy to apply , no stains on clothes. big variety of shades. Good product.</li>
            <li> Does a good job and easy to use. Used by my husband.</li>
