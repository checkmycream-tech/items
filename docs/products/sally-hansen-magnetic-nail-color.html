    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>And she was very happy with the colors she received.</li>
            <li>Great demo!</li>
            <li>If anybody has any suggestions, I would love to hear them!!!</li>
            <li>Tilting it can give some really beautiful</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also is a very nice nail polish.</li>
            <li>I do recommend using a good topcoat, I use a topcoat on everything.</li>
            <li>Despite this, I absolutely loved the color and how you can style them with the magnets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had my nails looking so good.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and beautiful.</li>
            <li>this nail polish is amazing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They looked AMAZING...</li>
            <li>They looked absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li>You want amazing color, well this is the polish for you.</li>
            <li>To be fair, I didn&#x27;t use a top coat.</li>
            <li>The color is nice on</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own though.</li>
            <li>I liked this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve had no chips, but this is because I used a good top coat, which again is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I thought it was amusing.</li>
            <li>A nice twist on polish.</li>
            <li>I love this color, it is so pretty and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use when you follow the directions</li>
            <li>I saw someone with the most AMAZING nails on Monday afternoon.  </li>
            <li>so sometimes I can&#x27;t get the full wave effects because I didn&#x27;t hold that part of the magnet over the right spot over my nail, but when I do get it at the rigt spot, the effects are awesome!</li>
            <li>A nice easy effect that gives the nails a nice nail art like result.</li>
            <li>may get some more just for myself.</li>
            <li>Bought this nail polish for my grand daughter.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t, however, stick to things, which many people assume when you say magnetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will order more colors,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the better the magnet effect turned out).</li>
            <li>, first off, you NEED a good base/top coat and you need to follow the directions, otherwise this will now work.</li>
            <li>really love the look, and the colors are nice, but if SH wants me to continue to purchase this polish (I&#x27;d already bought 4 colors, hoping ONE of the would be more long-lasting), they&#x27;ll have to improve the wear life.</li>
            <li>This product was so cool!  </li>
            <li>Also, it smudged way to easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Following the instructions was easy.</li>
            <li>And easy to use.</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of work and you definitely need to read the direction, but you end up with a beautiful striation effect on your nails.</li>
            <li>The nail polish is fine though--</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>The color is very opaque and covers nicely.</li>
            <li>:  I wish the the magnet was curved to contor the nail better as I found that while the middle of the nails had a really nice \\&quot;wave\\&quot; affect the sides of the nails remained mostly just the silver color.</li>
            <li>She wants it in every color now! :)</li>
            <li>The first time I used it it worked perfectly and lasted longer than the other polish I was also wearing.</li>
            <li>I love this so much, I can&#x27;t stop looking at my nails.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a good product; it actually works.</li>
            <li>but I found waiting 20-30 seconds gave a more intense affect.</li>
            <li>it looks super cool.  </li>
            <li>They were pretty easy</li>
            <li>This is a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>And I use a lot of nail polish (I own over 100 bottles of various brands).</li>
            <li>The directions are much more complete ands explains how it works.</li>
            <li>Thank you for this colorful product</li>
            <li>Holding the magnet for a bit longer than a ten count created a more interesting and vivid effect.</li>
            <li>It really does work, but you just have to figure out the trick for the full effects.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I really enjoyed this product, it was easily to use, I liked the effect, it dried quickly, and was just overall a fun new item for nails.</li>
            <li>The polish is holding up fine so far</li>
            <li>I was watching a dvd at the same time), and then applied a Sally Hansen top</li>
            <li>and she said, \\&quot;it&#x27;s pretty</li>
            <li>The picture had all the colors, so I thought I was going to get more than one bottle of polish, but it was only one.</li>
            <li>and it works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li>With the raised cuticle part of the magnet it is fairly easy to not actually touch the magnet to the nail</li>
            <li>I am planning to buy a couple bottles of the polish myself simply because of how unique and pretty it looked.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t know how it worked.  </li>
            <li>Very durable.</li>
            <li>This one was much easier to work with, WITH SOME TIME AND PATIENCE.&lt;br</li>
            <li>nail polish is also very robust and forgiving.</li>
            <li>When at first I put on the polish, I was really satisfied because it&#x27;s simple to apply and get the wavy effect, but even before I went to bed that evening (3 hours later), I already had my first chip.</li>
            <li>I had more complements with Sally Hanson polish then any other polish.</li>
            <li>Makes me very sad because they looked incredible!  </li>
            <li>However, we figured out that the magnet has to be close enough to the nail for the cool designs to appear.</li>
            <li>If you are into mettalic looking nail polishes would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I liked the green polish very much however the magnet part was flat and  did not work the way it should.</li>
            <li>Some of the other reviews mention that it chips easily, I didn&#x27;t have this problem.</li>
            <li>the entire nail worth of polish was coming off at once.</li>
            <li>Dries SUPER fast which I was really surprised by considering how thick your second coat is, I waited longer but could have applied my top coat within probably 10 minutes which is extremely fast for majority of nail</li>
            <li>With a little care you can get a very cool effect</li>
            <li>Out of blue, purple, black and brown that I&#x27;ve tried so far, my purple swirls really stand out the most.</li>
            <li>With this stuff, as long as you shake it enough, put on a thick enough coat, and hold the magnet in the right spot, the effects turn out great.</li>
            <li>: I really enjoyed the silver color which essentially turns into black \\&quot;waves\\&quot; once the magnet is used.</li>
            <li>(I normally buy cheap stuff), but this wasn&#x27;t just small chips around the edges,</li>
            <li>yes you will need to move the guide back and forth across your cuticle to get the wave affect across your whole nail like I had to do on my thumbs.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes some time and practice, but the final affect/result is very</li>
            <li>The actual bottle of nail polish is fairly small for a $9.99 or more nail polish</li>
            <li>Once you purchase the product you will see that the actual top of the nail polish is the magnet which once you remove it you will findthat the brush handle (probably around the size of my thumb) is fairly small as is the brush, but I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by this</li>
            <li>A lot of people say it chips easy, but the polish on my nails don&#x27;t start to chip until a week later, even with my job being harsh on my nails.</li>
            <li>first thing I liked before even using it is the big flat magnet and the guide, the other magnetic nail polish I have had a small magnet and no guide.</li>
            <li>I purchased this nail polish at a local drug store for $9.99 so much cheaper than here on Amazon especially when shipping is added.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, if you follow the directions, use a good base AND top coat and have a little patience this will work.</li>
            <li>I was intrigued by it and generally don&#x27;t wear nail polish but decided to try the Silver Elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, I went out and bought it IMMEDIATELY (this coming from someone who only ever wears clear polish).  </li>
            <li>The magnet has a raised ridge to be placed near your cuticle so the magnet doesn&#x27;t touch the actual nail color.</li>
            <li>And when I say that it chips, I mean HUGE chips.  </li>
            <li>The first thin coat was sheer enough that I wondered how well it would work, it dried very quickly.</li>
            <li>Applying the second thick coat to one nail at a time then using the magnet on it took a little more time.</li>

            <li> This polish takes a lot of time, is messy and a lot of work, looks great on a few nails and not so great on others, and chips terribly the next day, even with base and top coats.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The summary does not clearly state that you only get one!  </li>
            <li> She is very meticulous with these things and took at least 30 mins on them.</li>
            <li> but you do have to be careful as you want the magnet as close to your nail color as possible.</li>
            <li> Shake it like it says before putting it on, and put your second coat on really heavy before putting the magnet over it.</li>
            <li> I have another magnetic polish I spent almost $16 dollars on that</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not very noticeable.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing in other colors.</li>
            <li> and I expect I will go through it fairly quickly due to the thick second coat.</li>
            <li> Due to the texture, you can mess up</li>
            <li> I followed directions (including base and top coats) and watched the &#x27;how to&#x27; video on the Sally Hansen website.  </li>
            <li> It also has a slight glitter effect but isn&#x27;t over powering glitter as some polishes have.</li>
            <li> (second coat must be very thick, I found the thicker the coat</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t doing heavy housework or anything like that.</li>
            <li> In addition it took almost 2 weeks to get this when it should have taken less then one!</li>
            <li> It does eventually chip, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be any worse than any other nail polish I have used...</li>
            <li> For less than 24 hours :(  </li>
            <li> But I have never used a base coat.</li>

            <li> this nail polish is amazing. it looks super cool.  i get a lot of complements when i wear it.</li>
            <li> I saw someone with the most AMAZING nails on Monday afternoon.  Asked her about it, and she pointed me to this nail polish.  Of course, I went out and bought it IMMEDIATELY (this coming from someone who only ever wears clear polish).  I followed directions (including base and top coats) and watched the &#x27;how to&#x27; video on the Sally Hansen website.  They were pretty easy (i did accidentally touch the polish with the magnet a couple of times... I was watching a dvd at the same time), and then applied a Sally Hansen top coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They looked AMAZING...For less than 24 hours :(  This stuff chips like you wouldn&#x27;t believe!  Makes me very sad because they looked incredible!  And when I say that it chips, I mean HUGE chips.  If anybody has any suggestions, I would love to hear them!!!</li>
            <li> With a little care you can get a very cool effect BUT I put on 2 coats and it chipped the next day.  I wasn&#x27;t doing heavy housework or anything like that. To be fair, I didn&#x27;t use a top coat. Maybe I&#x27;ll try that next time.</li>
            <li> I liked the green polish very much however the magnet part was flat and  did not work the way it should. Also, it smudged way to easily. The color is nice on it&#x27;s own though. I&#x27;d buy this again if it came with a stronger magnet.</li>
            <li> I got three shades of magnetic polish for my teenage daughter because she loves painting her nails. I was intrigued by it and generally don&#x27;t wear nail polish but decided to try the Silver Elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following the instructions was easy. The first thin coat was sheer enough that I wondered how well it would work, it dried very quickly. Applying the second thick coat to one nail at a time then using the magnet on it took a little more time. The overcap with the magnet has a lip to sit under the cuticle with the magnet over the nail bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so neat seeing the design appear. Holding the magnet for a bit longer than a ten count created a more interesting and vivid effect. The polish is holding up fine so far and I&#x27;m pretty hard on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may get some more just for myself. This is a lot of fun. My daughter likes it a lot too.</li>
            <li> I love this so much, I can&#x27;t stop looking at my nails. It really does work, but you just have to figure out the trick for the full effects. Shake it like it says before putting it on, and put your second coat on really heavy before putting the magnet over it. I don&#x27;t put a third coat on because it just covers up the effects, unless I put the magnet over it again. I have very short nails, so sometimes I can&#x27;t get the full wave effects because I didn&#x27;t hold that part of the magnet over the right spot over my nail, but when I do get it at the rigt spot, the effects are awesome! A lot of people say it chips easy, but the polish on my nails don&#x27;t start to chip until a week later, even with my job being harsh on my nails. Don&#x27;t buy the cheap stuff, it doesn&#x27;t work. My sister has the cheaper stuff and it doesn&#x27;t work at all. With this stuff, as long as you shake it enough, put on a thick enough coat, and hold the magnet in the right spot, the effects turn out great.</li>
            <li> Bought as a stocking stuffer for my wife. She really likes it. Said she bought it before and it didn&#x27;t work for her. However, we figured out that the magnet has to be close enough to the nail for the cool designs to appear. She wants it in every color now! :)</li>
            <li> it didnt work for me at all.</li>
            <li> Bought this nail polish for my grand daughter.  In several colors.  Talked to her after she received it and she said, \\&quot;it&#x27;s pretty cool\\&quot;.  And she was very happy with the colors she received. The reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is I didn&#x27;t use it so I really don&#x27;t know how it worked.  Looked neat though.</li>
            <li> The picture had all the colors, so I thought I was going to get more than one bottle of polish, but it was only one. I could have just bought the damn bottle at Wal-Mart for cheaper than ordering it on here. The nail polish is fine though--it&#x27;s a good product; it actually works.</li>
            <li> Some of the other reviews mention that it chips easily, I didn&#x27;t have this problem. The first time I used it it worked perfectly and lasted longer than the other polish I was also wearing. It does eventually chip, but I didn&#x27;t find it to be any worse than any other nail polish I have used... And I use a lot of nail polish (I own over 100 bottles of various brands). I do recommend using a good topcoat, I use a topcoat on everything. But I have never used a base coat. Just follow the directions and it works exactly as it should.</li>
            <li> I liked this product. The directions are much more complete ands explains how it works. I had more complements with Sally Hanson polish then any other polish.</li>
            <li> My friend purchased a bottle of this and had her nails done. As soon as I saw them, I had her do mine. She is very meticulous with these things and took at least 30 mins on them. They looked absolutely amazing. I had them done on a friday night, this morning (monday) they started chipping. I have nail polish chip a lot for me (I normally buy cheap stuff), but this wasn&#x27;t just small chips around the edges, the entire nail worth of polish was coming off at once. Despite this, I absolutely loved the color and how you can style them with the magnets. I am planning to buy a couple bottles of the polish myself simply because of how unique and pretty it looked.</li>
            <li> This polish takes a lot of time, is messy and a lot of work, looks great on a few nails and not so great on others, and chips terribly the next day, even with base and top coats.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t understand the purpose of Magnetic nail polish but I do like the color. Thank you for this colorful product</li>
            <li> It does take a bit of work and you definitely need to read the direction, but you end up with a beautiful striation effect on your nails. Very durable. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I have another magnetic polish I spent almost $16 dollars on that did NOT work at all, but I saw this one in purple at Wal Mart on sale for about $8 and grabbed it.&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I liked before even using it is the big flat magnet and the guide, the other magnetic nail polish I have had a small magnet and no guide. This one was much easier to work with, WITH SOME TIME AND PATIENCE.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, first off, you NEED a good base/top coat and you need to follow the directions, otherwise this will now work. If you have bigger nails yes you will need to move the guide back and forth across your cuticle to get the wave affect across your whole nail like I had to do on my thumbs.&lt;br /&gt;It takes some time and practice, but the final affect/result is very awesome.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 2 days now for me and I&#x27;ve had no chips, but this is because I used a good top coat, which again is essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you follow the directions, use a good base AND top coat and have a little patience this will work.</li>
            <li> I am a physics professor at West Virginia University who works on magnetism. Someone gave me some of this nail polish for Christmas and I thought it was amusing. Then, I had to do a workshop for middle school girls on magnetism and I thought that painting our nails might interest them. It doesn&#x27;t only interest them. Recently, I gave a talk at a university and had twelve male physics majors crowded around me to watch me paint a nail. Great demo! It doesn&#x27;t, however, stick to things, which many people assume when you say magnetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also is a very nice nail polish. I&#x27;ve never had my nails looking so good. Out of blue, purple, black and brown that I&#x27;ve tried so far, my purple swirls really stand out the most. I suggest you don&#x27;t hold the magnet the way that seems obvious. Tilting it can give some really beautiful effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish is also very robust and forgiving. Due to the texture, you can mess up and it&#x27;s not very noticeable. Or, just apply another coat to cover it up.</li>
            <li> This product was so cool!  Manicure came out just like picture. Easy to use and beautiful. Will be purchasing in other colors. A nice twist on polish.</li>
            <li> I love this color, it is so pretty and the price is perfect. I will order more colors,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;  Sue-z Gullock</li>
            <li> You want amazing color, well this is the polish for you. The magnetic detail is unseen before. I wore it to school got a lot of complements. And easy to use.</li>
            <li> Every picture shows TEN nail polish bottles.  The summary does not clearly state that you only get one!  If I would have known that I was only getting one I would have never bought it!  In addition it took almost 2 weeks to get this when it should have taken less then one!</li>
            <li> Get a lot of comment on my nails</li>
            <li> I purchased this nail polish at a local drug store for $9.99 so much cheaper than here on Amazon especially when shipping is added. I personally consider a $9.99 nail polish to be on the pricer side of nail polishes, but that is just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: I really enjoyed the silver color which essentially turns into black \\&quot;waves\\&quot; once the magnet is used. It also has a slight glitter effect but isn&#x27;t over powering glitter as some polishes have. Very easy to use when you follow the directions (second coat must be very thick, I found the thicker the coat the better the magnet effect turned out). The magnet has a raised ridge to be placed near your cuticle so the magnet doesn&#x27;t touch the actual nail color. The color is very opaque and covers nicely. A nice easy effect that gives the nails a nice nail art like result. Dries SUPER fast which I was really surprised by considering how thick your second coat is, I waited longer but could have applied my top coat within probably 10 minutes which is extremely fast for majority of nail polishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  I wish the the magnet was curved to contor the nail better as I found that while the middle of the nails had a really nice \\&quot;wave\\&quot; affect the sides of the nails remained mostly just the silver color. I attempted to \\&quot;roll\\&quot; the magnet to the sides of my nails but I didn&#x27;t see a big change by doing this. With the raised cuticle part of the magnet it is fairly easy to not actually touch the magnet to the nail but you do have to be careful as you want the magnet as close to your nail color as possible. It is recommended that you hold the magnet over your nail for 10 seconds but I found waiting 20-30 seconds gave a more intense affect. The actual bottle of nail polish is fairly small for a $9.99 or more nail polish and I expect I will go through it fairly quickly due to the thick second coat. Once you purchase the product you will see that the actual top of the nail polish is the magnet which once you remove it you will findthat the brush handle (probably around the size of my thumb) is fairly small as is the brush, but I wasn&#x27;t too bothered by this but some might be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really enjoyed this product, it was easily to use, I liked the effect, it dried quickly, and was just overall a fun new item for nails. If you are into mettalic looking nail polishes would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> When at first I put on the polish, I was really satisfied because it&#x27;s simple to apply and get the wavy effect, but even before I went to bed that evening (3 hours later), I already had my first chip. The second day, I had to carry the bottle with me and constantly touched up chips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love the look, and the colors are nice, but if SH wants me to continue to purchase this polish (I&#x27;d already bought 4 colors, hoping ONE of the would be more long-lasting), they&#x27;ll have to improve the wear life.</li>
