            <li>it is it the best mascara ever!</li>
            <li>This was an excellent find and a perfect replacement.</li>
            <li>Just a great, long-lasting look.</li>
            <li>Not what I previously experienced with Estee Lauder</li>
            <li>This mascara is a great volumuous mascara, it builds thickness and length to the lashes.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara! !</li>
            <li>It does not run or clump and comes off with warm water!</li>
            <li>Loved this mascara and plan to buy again.</li>
            <li>I have used Estee Lauder before and it was OK--not great, but not awful.</li>
            <li>and this mascara is simply AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of this type of product and I am really pleased with this one.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for volume safely this is the go to mascara.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many mascaras and this one doesn&#x27;t flake or clump when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I really love this mascara.</li>
            <li>Then I had to wipe it off and put on more eye shadow and once, start all over again.</li>
            <li>LOVE love LOVE.</li>
            <li>Very rarely do I re-purchase an item.</li>
            <li>I have ordered an original size mascara</li>
            <li>But this is my absolute favorite mascara.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many mascaras of various price rages and have never ever had a reaction before.</li>
            <li>The first time I opened them, they seemed to be many years old.</li>
            <li>They were dry and had many clumps.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product, and I would very much recommend it to anyone, but the order was a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li>packed in a original box and &#x27;not for individual sale&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picking with my make up products, always trying new things.</li>
            <li>No clumping,  just long, full eye lashes.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny, and this is coming from a girl who only buys drug store makeup.</li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I have used many other ones and only this met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li>It leaves the lashes natural feeling and does not smudge.</li>
            <li>and i have payed as an original size costed, but i have received small size item not for individual sale.</li>
            <li>Makes full, thick lashes.  </li>

            <li> Loved this mascara and plan to buy again. I&#x27;m very picking with my make up products, always trying new things. Very rarely do I re-purchase an item. I plan to buy this product again. It also lasted a lot longer than mascaras I usually buy.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara! ! No clumping,  just long, full eye lashes.</li>
            <li> Makes full, thick lashes.  No clumps.  Just a great, long-lasting look.</li>
            <li> clumps every time applied.  Not what I previously experienced with Estee Lauder</li>
            <li> As others mentioned, which I did not heed, this is trial size and not as pictured. Totally false advertising and Amazon should remove them as a vendor.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of this type of product and I am really pleased with this one.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for volume safely this is the go to mascara. I have used it for years and I have sensitive skin! I have less lines underneath my eyes than the majority of women my age. It does not run or clump and comes off with warm water!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product, and I would very much recommend it to anyone, but the order was a complete disappointment. The mascara turned out to be a sample size of 1 oz, without a box, which is not what I wanted. Besides, it looks used! How annoying.</li>
            <li> Veeeeery disappointed! I ordered regular size mascara - 2pc, and received 2 small ones,&lt;br /&gt;not packed in a original box and &#x27;not for individual sale&#x27;. Looks like I&#x27;m a 2nd person&lt;br /&gt;who got wrong item. I don&#x27;t recommend this supplier.</li>
            <li> it is it the best mascara ever! I have used many other ones and only this met all of my expectations.</li>
            <li> Found this brand on a cruise ship when my other mascara that I&#x27;d been reordering for 30+ years suddenly began irritating my eyes. This was an excellent find and a perfect replacement.</li>
            <li> Picture shows regular size mascara ,however what you get is trial size, not for sale. Amazon should not be in buiseness with this retailer. Regular size mascara at Macy&#x27;s store 26 $, this 10 x less 16$. Please do not order from this retailer. I should have read the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many mascaras and this one doesn&#x27;t flake or clump when I use it.  It makes my eyelashes look very long, too.</li>
            <li> Bought this from a department store. But this is my absolute favorite mascara. People have been asking if I am wearing fake eyelashes. It makes my lashes look both thick and long, with no clumping or flaking. I really love this mascara. It is worth every penny, and this is coming from a girl who only buys drug store makeup. I will definitely buy again and again!</li>
            <li> This is the worst mascara I have ever used. I have used Estee Lauder before and it was OK--not great, but not awful. Then I got 2 tubes of this.  The first time I opened them, they seemed to be many years old. They were dry and had many clumps. I couldn&#x27;t get it on without making a big mess on my face. Then I had to wipe it off and put on more eye shadow and once, start all over again. I am taking these back to Estee Lauder and have them throw them away so they get the point. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> I have ordered an original size mascara and i have payed as an original size costed, but i have received small size item not for individual sale. also it has not any invoice indicated size, type and price of the product. very disappointed</li>
            <li> I recieved a sample of this and used it once. The next morning I woke up to discover hives under both set of lashes. I have tried many many mascaras of various price rages and have never ever had a reaction before.</li>
            <li> This mascara is a great volumuous mascara, it builds thickness and length to the lashes. It leaves the lashes natural feeling and does not smudge. I will be a repeat customer!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for awhile for a mascara that stays put, does not fall during the day, lengthens and thickens and this mascara is simply AMAZING. LOVE love LOVE. I will be only using this from now on. I highly recommend!</li>
