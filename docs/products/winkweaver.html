            <li>Honestly one of the best sleep masks ive used.</li>
            <li>Simply amazing!</li>
            <li>but after a couple of nights of good sleep</li>
            <li>But until I got reminded of what good sleep feels like I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good ideas, though.</li>
            <li>Keeps out all the light and appears to be the perfect size.</li>
            <li>Based on the hyped claims of the company and the good reviews I read on Amazon, I purchased the WinkWeaver.</li>
            <li>Good mask, and the earplugs are a plus.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve put them to good use.  </li>
            <li>This mask did the trick at blocking the light distractions and I had probably one of the best night</li>
            <li>product works wonderfully for blocking out light.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very nicely fits to the head, and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I love that it comes paired with earplugs...such a great idea</li>
            <li>i am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with the mask.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>The mask does not let any light through, and the ear plugs are a great feature.</li>
            <li>Nice mask.  </li>
            <li>Nice to have the ear plugs close by in case of that</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a need for the earplugs yet, but I&#x27;ve used this kind before</li>
            <li>Nice product.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried to use the earplugs yet but even if they&#x27;re not for me, it&#x27;s great to have 2 slots for my own earplugs to fit in.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>Great product, will be perfect for travel :) would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>It is super comfortable and does an excellent job of blocking out the light!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much for the great product and for the wonderful service!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug</li>
            <li>You know how it is when all the lights are turned off in your room and your eyes adjust so even the slightest light seems bright.</li>
            <li>The review sample I received is one of the most effective ones I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does a great job of keeping the light out of your eyes, and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Cuts out ALL LIGHT AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t slept with the earplugs for fear of not hearing my child at night, however from trying them on they seem very comfortable.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It was very light weight.</li>
            <li>I am a very light sleeper and</li>
            <li>I love this mask.</li>
            <li>The mask was used nightly but only because I just hadn&#x27;t found the perfect one for me, yet.</li>
            <li>and so do I as I can watch TV with my Sennheiser wireless headphones!!  :-)</li>
            <li>Overall a great mask!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m waking up feeling better.</li>
            <li>She said she has been wearing it and it has helped her sleep better.</li>
            <li>(most others aren&#x27;t and feel rather tight/constricting as a result), and, portable with the built in slots for the ear plugs</li>
            <li>are some reasons why I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll pleased to say that it was totally comfortable and completely effective.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I was glad to have it with all the lights and noise during the night while trying to sleep,  </li>
            <li>But the best part is the total darkness that is acheived when wearing the mask.</li>
            <li>Love it and would recommend it</li>
            <li>There are better sleep masks that don&#x27;t put pressure on your eyes and there are better ear plugs.</li>
            <li>Love them.</li>
            <li>Blocks out all light!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love the material...</li>
            <li>I did not use the earplugs, but i love the fact that there is a place to store them if i needed them.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t wake up at all. :)</li>
            <li>Finally able to sleep while wearing a sleep mask.</li>
            <li>product also included ear plugs - great for blocking out sounds of my roommate getting ready when I can sleep in in the mornings.</li>
            <li>Love that it comes with ear plugs too.</li>
            <li>I have never been able to sleep in the car until now.</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, adjustable (not just a piece of elastic slapped on), and make nighttime nice and dark - ideal for getting a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>So far, so good!  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I loved this mask at first.</li>
            <li>Super product - thank you for bringing him his own \\&quot;sanctuary\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I really liked that it kept out plenty of light and sound.</li>
            <li>Blocks out all the light and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>Keeps out the light and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It works at sealing out the light and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This mask is soft and quite comfortable, and it does a very good job of blocking out light.</li>
            <li>It did as advertised and blocked out the light for a better sleep.  </li>
            <li>Much more comfortable than the others I have tried.</li>
            <li>I did not try these but have used identical ones on rare occasions and they are effective.</li>
            <li>so that makes it easy for me to adjust.</li>
            <li>they are comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>First, it truly is effective at eliminating all light.</li>
            <li>Fits around nose area perfectly, which is usually the problem with most.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>The idea of the holders for the earplugs seems great, but the extra bulk is at the ears when the mask is worn and not so comfortable for side sleepers.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and keeps light out</li>
            <li>Plus, the earplugs don&#x27;t even fit correctly.</li>
            <li>Between that and the earplugs, he sleeps soundly during the busiest of days in our household.  </li>
            <li>Had to take them off the strap to be comfortable.</li>
            <li>This mask is comfortable and keeps out the light well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There&#x27;s a street light that can shine through my window even with a curtain on the window.</li>
            <li>Well that&#x27;s what the street light was doing.</li>
            <li>She asked for it because any light in the room disrupts her sleep.</li>
            <li>Light, but stays in place.</li>
            <li>I did not think a mask could be so comfortable and non detracting.</li>
            <li>I used earplugs once and they were comfortable.</li>
            <li>your mask isn&#x27;t blocking the light as well as you hoped, read their instructions that came with the product, there&#x27;s a tip there that may solve your problem.</li>
            <li>Have tried at home and they seem comfortable and qood quality.</li>
            <li>and they fit snug.</li>
            <li>The mask blocks out almost all light when positioned correctly.</li>
            <li>yet it does the job at blocking out light</li>
            <li>so I can sleep soundly.  </li>
            <li>I also like that mask has adjustable straps, allowing users to enjoy maximum comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The mask was comfortable to wear, and kept %99.99 of light out.  </li>
            <li>the slightest onset of light wakes me up.</li>
            <li>They are also comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>It says what it does, and is comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable, doesn&#x27;t slide off and still blocks almost all the light as a side/stomach sleeper.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time I can nod right off, but when I crash on my sofa with the east sun streaming through the vaulted ceiling window I need a sleep mask.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li>There is a cool built in nose flap that traps out any additional light from peeping in underneath the bottom of the mask.  </li>
            <li>I received this sleep mask and was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>It completely blocks out all light, but it&#x27;s still nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s snug around my head and it is SUPER comfortable.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is far better then any I have tried before!</li>
            <li>complete black out and greatly reduced noise for good rest.</li>
            <li>I sometimes wake up to find the mask has completely come off, but that seems to happen with any mask I try, so it could just be the weirdness of my own head.</li>
            <li>I also loved that there was a place to store the ear plugs on the back strap.</li>
            <li>I have yet to get it to fit even close to right.  </li>
            <li>The mask was very comfortable and completely blocked out all the light.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable and completely blocks out the light.</li>
            <li>I love that feature a lot more than the more common buckle-style straps on most masks.</li>
            <li>It completely eliminates any light which has helped me to fall asleep more quickly.  </li>
            <li>They fit very snug yet comfortable in my ears.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never used a sleep mask before, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m falling to sleep quickly and STAYING asleep all through the night.</li>
            <li>I am such as light sleeper, so this product came in handy for a test run before school.</li>
            <li>Blocks out light very well!  </li>
            <li>The ear plugs are also very soft and they feel like they are made out of memory foam. :)</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li>I toss and turn so much since I work at night sleep during the day and the sun bothers me!!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>soft padding makes it comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The mask itself is very light and soft.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight and comfortable.</li>
            <li>then the Calm Nature sleep</li>
            <li>It completely blocks out the light!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, this product is worth your money.</li>
            <li>The ear plugs fit into slots on the mask for storage which is a nice feature as they are small and would be easy to lose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve experienced total absence of light</li>
            <li>Perhaps right for some people,but not for me.  </li>
            <li>I like the way you can store the included ear plugs right with the mask</li>
            <li>Light shows under the mask, despite the clever configuration of the flap at the bottom, and the material irritates my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I plan on taking this with me during long flights and feel it will come in handy.</li>
            <li>If you need the room to be completely dark to get a good night&#x27;s sleep but can&#x27;t do so (for whatever reason)</li>
            <li>What I love about this sleep mask is it&#x27;s incredibly SOFT and very lightweight.  </li>
            <li>I love it because it blocked out all light, which is a blessing since hubby and others walk past bedroom and turn on bathroom lights at night, it is comfortable and stays in place, and</li>
            <li>Why mess with a good thing?</li>
            <li>This mask is comfortable to wear all night long and is easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>The inner liner of the mask is velvet, which is very comfortable.</li>
            <li>I figured there was no way replacement mask could possibly live up to the original mask, but I read the glowing reviews and went for it.</li>
            <li>Comfortable, large enough to block out light.</li>
            <li>I have slept like a baby from the first night</li>
            <li>Blocks all the light but vey comfy and soft.</li>
            <li>Simply put, I sleep better with this Eye Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is a sleep mask that actually does a better job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also adjustable which is pretty neat</li>
            <li>I would be interested to know where the #1 rating came from.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>Definitely one of the better sleep masks and one that I recommend to my vampire friends.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome my husband can now read or watch TV in our room with out disturbing me.</li>
            <li>After having kids and now in my early forties...I just don&#x27;t sleep soundly like I used to.  </li>
            <li>Love my sleep mask, especially the adjustable band.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I like this better than my Hello Kitty one because it is black and keeps more light out.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They may have not bothered me so much if the straps sat just above my ears instead of right on top.</li>
            <li>live in a quiet apt by myself</li>
            <li>I particularly like the fold near the nose which keeps out all stray light.</li>
            <li>I like that the ear plugs are the standard size and can be replaced easily.</li>
            <li>It blocks out almost all the light and the first time I used it I woke up at 4pm randomly really thinking it was the middle of the night already</li>
            <li>There is just enough elastic to make fine adjustments</li>
            <li>Clever!</li>
            <li>Also, the earplugs are subpar, being much harder foam than most earplugs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use earplugs, so I can&#x27;t comment on their quality or effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Second, it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li>and now I fall asleep much faster.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Very comfy</li>
            <li>I wish the straps were either a bit thinner or a bit higher, as right now they either rest across my ears--causing the mask to slip--or bend them down, which isn&#x27;t comfortable.</li>
            <li>I normally wake up in the middle of the night because of the light from the tv,</li>
            <li>Albeit, they&#x27;re lovely and make the room look nicer and larger, they don&#x27;t completely filter out the street lights like our old, nappy salvia curtains used to.</li>
            <li>I thought I had decent sleep before</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s just what is was, decent sleep.</li>
            <li>I bought this sleep mask for my older &amp;#34;bounce back&amp;#34; son.</li>
            <li>Seemed not bad quality but was too small for me and let light in around the bottom of the mask, so I returned it.</li>
            <li>Instead, it has Velcro attached to nice band that is wide enough not to leave indentations in your head.  </li>
            <li>Clever design with the holders for the ear plugs, but I&#x27;d note that they will slip out if you&#x27;re wearing the mask.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not all loose or cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying.</li>
            <li>lightweight, comfortable and fits as expected.</li>
            <li>We just purchased new blinds for a our bedroom.</li>
            <li>May I purchase a new set and what is the cost.</li>
            <li>Amazing what complete darkness does for your sleep pattern and how deep you go down and get restful</li>
            <li>The inside is soft and comfortable, the outside has a satin feel, and the velcro adjustable strap is wide &amp; stretchy enough to feel secure.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and big enough to block light.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty quiet at night</li>
            <li>Unlike most other masks I have tried, this one actually has an adjustable strap that is not composed of a flimsy elastic band.  </li>
            <li>Also I wish the Velcro went all the way across the straps instead of just on one small section so I could tighten the straps a bit more.</li>
            <li>I confess that so far I am unawed by the mask.  </li>
            <li>We bought this for our 10 year old daughter who likes her sleep masks.  </li>
            <li>The velvet is soft against my eyes and face.</li>
            <li>Upon putting it on I noticed that it was soft</li>
            <li>I guess I have sensitive eyelids.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase, especially given the cost as compared to other masks I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I would wake up with sensitive eyes and major allergy eyes every morning.</li>
            <li>The velcro strap rides low and brings the mask high.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try the ear plugs that came with it, I use another brand, but I have small ear canals and they were HUGE.</li>
            <li>I assume that you chose the as they fit into your integrated plug holders, but they are really terrible plugs, given that there are scads of better choices out there for fit comfort and performance.</li>
            <li>The ear buds seemed cheap, like they had a small crack in it.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I live in a relatively quiet area where they are unneeded.</li>
            <li>I purchased this on recommendation from my niece who has the same trouble as I do with light interrupting my sleep.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually used this style of plug to attenuate the workings of a wild man with a jackhammer and it made the experience bearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The adjustable strap and soft interior add to the Wink Weaver&#x27;s overall comfort.</li>
            <li>I can barely feel it...</li>
            <li>nice mask but not perfect.</li>
            <li>This sleep mask is definitely a step above the free ones I received from the airlines in the past.  </li>
            <li>I had major back surgery and took the sleep mask with me.</li>
            <li>I have never been a big fan of sleep masks as they are generally uncomfortable and for all the potential benefits they bring often add their own issues.</li>
            <li>My old eye masks always had a thin elastic strap that stretched and were hopeless, this eye mask is great with the velcro to expand it plus the thick straps that don&#x27;t stretch!</li>
            <li>The flap over the nose helps eliminate the light you usually still see with other sleep masks.  </li>
            <li>The earplugs are too large for a petite lady as well as being heavy with something like wax.</li>

            <li> Honestly one of the best sleep masks ive used.</li>
            <li> Simply amazing!</li>
            <li> but after a couple of nights of good sleep</li>
            <li> But until I got reminded of what good sleep feels like I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good ideas, though.</li>
            <li> Keeps out all the light and appears to be the perfect size.</li>
            <li> Based on the hyped claims of the company and the good reviews I read on Amazon, I purchased the WinkWeaver.</li>
            <li> Good mask, and the earplugs are a plus.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve put them to good use.  </li>
            <li> This mask did the trick at blocking the light distractions and I had probably one of the best night</li>
            <li> product works wonderfully for blocking out light.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very nicely fits to the head, and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I love that it comes paired with earplugs...such a great idea</li>
            <li> i am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the mask.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> The mask does not let any light through, and the ear plugs are a great feature.</li>
            <li> Nice mask.  </li>
            <li> Nice to have the ear plugs close by in case of that</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a need for the earplugs yet, but I&#x27;ve used this kind before</li>
            <li> Nice product.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to use the earplugs yet but even if they&#x27;re not for me, it&#x27;s great to have 2 slots for my own earplugs to fit in.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> Great product, will be perfect for travel :) would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> It is super comfortable and does an excellent job of blocking out the light!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much for the great product and for the wonderful service!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug</li>
            <li> You know how it is when all the lights are turned off in your room and your eyes adjust so even the slightest light seems bright.</li>
            <li> The review sample I received is one of the most effective ones I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does a great job of keeping the light out of your eyes, and is comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Cuts out ALL LIGHT AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t slept with the earplugs for fear of not hearing my child at night, however from trying them on they seem very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> It was very light weight.</li>
            <li> I am a very light sleeper and</li>
            <li> I love this mask.</li>
            <li> The mask was used nightly but only because I just hadn&#x27;t found the perfect one for me, yet.</li>
            <li> and so do I as I can watch TV with my Sennheiser wireless headphones!!  :-)</li>
            <li> Overall a great mask!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waking up feeling better.</li>
            <li> She said she has been wearing it and it has helped her sleep better.</li>
            <li> (most others aren&#x27;t and feel rather tight/constricting as a result), and, portable with the built in slots for the ear plugs</li>
            <li> are some reasons why I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll pleased to say that it was totally comfortable and completely effective.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I was glad to have it with all the lights and noise during the night while trying to sleep,  </li>
            <li> But the best part is the total darkness that is acheived when wearing the mask.</li>
            <li> Love it and would recommend it</li>
            <li> There are better sleep masks that don&#x27;t put pressure on your eyes and there are better ear plugs.</li>
            <li> Love them.</li>
            <li> Blocks out all light!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love the material...</li>
            <li> I did not use the earplugs, but i love the fact that there is a place to store them if i needed them.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t wake up at all. :)</li>
            <li> Finally able to sleep while wearing a sleep mask.</li>
            <li> product also included ear plugs - great for blocking out sounds of my roommate getting ready when I can sleep in in the mornings.</li>
            <li> Love that it comes with ear plugs too.</li>
            <li> I have never been able to sleep in the car until now.</li>
            <li> They are comfortable, adjustable (not just a piece of elastic slapped on), and make nighttime nice and dark - ideal for getting a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I loved this mask at first.</li>
            <li> Super product - thank you for bringing him his own \\&quot;sanctuary\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I really liked that it kept out plenty of light and sound.</li>
            <li> Blocks out all the light and is very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> Keeps out the light and is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> It works at sealing out the light and it is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This mask is soft and quite comfortable, and it does a very good job of blocking out light.</li>
            <li> It did as advertised and blocked out the light for a better sleep.  </li>
            <li> Much more comfortable than the others I have tried.</li>
            <li> I did not try these but have used identical ones on rare occasions and they are effective.</li>
            <li> so that makes it easy for me to adjust.</li>
            <li> they are comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> First, it truly is effective at eliminating all light.</li>
            <li> Fits around nose area perfectly, which is usually the problem with most.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, and easy to put on.</li>
            <li> The idea of the holders for the earplugs seems great, but the extra bulk is at the ears when the mask is worn and not so comfortable for side sleepers.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and keeps light out</li>
            <li> Plus, the earplugs don&#x27;t even fit correctly.</li>
            <li> Between that and the earplugs, he sleeps soundly during the busiest of days in our household.  </li>
            <li> Had to take them off the strap to be comfortable.</li>
            <li> This mask is comfortable and keeps out the light well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a street light that can shine through my window even with a curtain on the window.</li>
            <li> Well that&#x27;s what the street light was doing.</li>
            <li> She asked for it because any light in the room disrupts her sleep.</li>
            <li> Light, but stays in place.</li>
            <li> I did not think a mask could be so comfortable and non detracting.</li>
            <li> I used earplugs once and they were comfortable.</li>
            <li> your mask isn&#x27;t blocking the light as well as you hoped, read their instructions that came with the product, there&#x27;s a tip there that may solve your problem.</li>
            <li> Have tried at home and they seem comfortable and qood quality.</li>
            <li> and they fit snug.</li>
            <li> The mask blocks out almost all light when positioned correctly.</li>
            <li> yet it does the job at blocking out light</li>
            <li> so I can sleep soundly.  </li>
            <li> I also like that mask has adjustable straps, allowing users to enjoy maximum comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The mask was comfortable to wear, and kept %99.99 of light out.  </li>
            <li> the slightest onset of light wakes me up.</li>
            <li> They are also comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> It says what it does, and is comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable, doesn&#x27;t slide off and still blocks almost all the light as a side/stomach sleeper.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time I can nod right off, but when I crash on my sofa with the east sun streaming through the vaulted ceiling window I need a sleep mask.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> There is a cool built in nose flap that traps out any additional light from peeping in underneath the bottom of the mask.  </li>
            <li> I received this sleep mask and was excited to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> It completely blocks out all light, but it&#x27;s still nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s snug around my head and it is SUPER comfortable.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is far better then any I have tried before!</li>
            <li> complete black out and greatly reduced noise for good rest.</li>
            <li> I sometimes wake up to find the mask has completely come off, but that seems to happen with any mask I try, so it could just be the weirdness of my own head.</li>
            <li> I also loved that there was a place to store the ear plugs on the back strap.</li>
            <li> I have yet to get it to fit even close to right.  </li>
            <li> The mask was very comfortable and completely blocked out all the light.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable and completely blocks out the light.</li>
            <li> I love that feature a lot more than the more common buckle-style straps on most masks.</li>
            <li> It completely eliminates any light which has helped me to fall asleep more quickly.  </li>
            <li> They fit very snug yet comfortable in my ears.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a sleep mask before, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m falling to sleep quickly and STAYING asleep all through the night.</li>
            <li> I am such as light sleeper, so this product came in handy for a test run before school.</li>
            <li> Blocks out light very well!  </li>
            <li> The ear plugs are also very soft and they feel like they are made out of memory foam. :)</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> I toss and turn so much since I work at night sleep during the day and the sun bothers me!!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> soft padding makes it comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The mask itself is very light and soft.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and comfortable.</li>
            <li> then the Calm Nature sleep</li>
            <li> It completely blocks out the light!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, this product is worth your money.</li>
            <li> The ear plugs fit into slots on the mask for storage which is a nice feature as they are small and would be easy to lose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve experienced total absence of light</li>
            <li> Perhaps right for some people,but not for me.  </li>
            <li> I like the way you can store the included ear plugs right with the mask</li>
            <li> Light shows under the mask, despite the clever configuration of the flap at the bottom, and the material irritates my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I plan on taking this with me during long flights and feel it will come in handy.</li>
            <li> If you need the room to be completely dark to get a good night&#x27;s sleep but can&#x27;t do so (for whatever reason)</li>
            <li> What I love about this sleep mask is it&#x27;s incredibly SOFT and very lightweight.  </li>
            <li> I love it because it blocked out all light, which is a blessing since hubby and others walk past bedroom and turn on bathroom lights at night, it is comfortable and stays in place, and</li>
            <li> Why mess with a good thing?</li>
            <li> This mask is comfortable to wear all night long and is easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li> The inner liner of the mask is velvet, which is very comfortable.</li>
            <li> I figured there was no way replacement mask could possibly live up to the original mask, but I read the glowing reviews and went for it.</li>
            <li> Comfortable, large enough to block out light.</li>
            <li> I have slept like a baby from the first night</li>
            <li> Blocks all the light but vey comfy and soft.</li>
            <li> Simply put, I sleep better with this Eye Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is a sleep mask that actually does a better job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also adjustable which is pretty neat</li>
            <li> I would be interested to know where the #1 rating came from.&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> Definitely one of the better sleep masks and one that I recommend to my vampire friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome my husband can now read or watch TV in our room with out disturbing me.</li>
            <li> After having kids and now in my early forties...I just don&#x27;t sleep soundly like I used to.  </li>
            <li> Love my sleep mask, especially the adjustable band.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I like this better than my Hello Kitty one because it is black and keeps more light out.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They may have not bothered me so much if the straps sat just above my ears instead of right on top.</li>
            <li> live in a quiet apt by myself</li>
            <li> I particularly like the fold near the nose which keeps out all stray light.</li>
            <li> I like that the ear plugs are the standard size and can be replaced easily.</li>
            <li> It blocks out almost all the light and the first time I used it I woke up at 4pm randomly really thinking it was the middle of the night already</li>
            <li> There is just enough elastic to make fine adjustments</li>
            <li> Clever!</li>
            <li> Also, the earplugs are subpar, being much harder foam than most earplugs.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use earplugs, so I can&#x27;t comment on their quality or effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Second, it&#x27;s comfortable.</li>
            <li> and now I fall asleep much faster.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Very comfy</li>
            <li> I wish the straps were either a bit thinner or a bit higher, as right now they either rest across my ears--causing the mask to slip--or bend them down, which isn&#x27;t comfortable.</li>
            <li> I normally wake up in the middle of the night because of the light from the tv,</li>
            <li> Albeit, they&#x27;re lovely and make the room look nicer and larger, they don&#x27;t completely filter out the street lights like our old, nappy salvia curtains used to.</li>
            <li> I thought I had decent sleep before</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s just what is was, decent sleep.</li>
            <li> I bought this sleep mask for my older &amp;#34;bounce back&amp;#34; son.</li>
            <li> Seemed not bad quality but was too small for me and let light in around the bottom of the mask, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Instead, it has Velcro attached to nice band that is wide enough not to leave indentations in your head.  </li>
            <li> Clever design with the holders for the ear plugs, but I&#x27;d note that they will slip out if you&#x27;re wearing the mask.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not all loose or cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend buying.</li>
            <li> lightweight, comfortable and fits as expected.</li>
            <li> We just purchased new blinds for a our bedroom.</li>
            <li> May I purchase a new set and what is the cost.</li>
            <li> Amazing what complete darkness does for your sleep pattern and how deep you go down and get restful</li>
            <li> The inside is soft and comfortable, the outside has a satin feel, and the velcro adjustable strap is wide &amp; stretchy enough to feel secure.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and big enough to block light.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty quiet at night</li>
            <li> Unlike most other masks I have tried, this one actually has an adjustable strap that is not composed of a flimsy elastic band.  </li>
            <li> Also I wish the Velcro went all the way across the straps instead of just on one small section so I could tighten the straps a bit more.</li>
            <li> I confess that so far I am unawed by the mask.  </li>
            <li> We bought this for our 10 year old daughter who likes her sleep masks.  </li>
            <li> The velvet is soft against my eyes and face.</li>
            <li> Upon putting it on I noticed that it was soft</li>
            <li> I guess I have sensitive eyelids.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase, especially given the cost as compared to other masks I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I would wake up with sensitive eyes and major allergy eyes every morning.</li>
            <li> The velcro strap rides low and brings the mask high.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try the ear plugs that came with it, I use another brand, but I have small ear canals and they were HUGE.</li>
            <li> I assume that you chose the as they fit into your integrated plug holders, but they are really terrible plugs, given that there are scads of better choices out there for fit comfort and performance.</li>
            <li> The ear buds seemed cheap, like they had a small crack in it.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I live in a relatively quiet area where they are unneeded.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on recommendation from my niece who has the same trouble as I do with light interrupting my sleep.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually used this style of plug to attenuate the workings of a wild man with a jackhammer and it made the experience bearable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The adjustable strap and soft interior add to the Wink Weaver&#x27;s overall comfort.</li>
            <li> I can barely feel it...</li>
            <li> nice mask but not perfect.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is definitely a step above the free ones I received from the airlines in the past.  </li>
            <li> I had major back surgery and took the sleep mask with me.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of sleep masks as they are generally uncomfortable and for all the potential benefits they bring often add their own issues.</li>
            <li> My old eye masks always had a thin elastic strap that stretched and were hopeless, this eye mask is great with the velcro to expand it plus the thick straps that don&#x27;t stretch!</li>
            <li> The flap over the nose helps eliminate the light you usually still see with other sleep masks.  </li>
            <li> The earplugs are too large for a petite lady as well as being heavy with something like wax.</li>
            <li> Extremely useful tool since we don&#x27;t have thick curtains in the bedroom.</li>
            <li> He sleeps on the front room couch and complains about the street lights and the neighbor&#x27;s porch lights making it hard to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;After a period of finding the right tension for the headband</li>
            <li> I usually go to the positive side; however I do have issues with this item..</li>
            <li> Never used before but bought for my upcoming LONG airline flight.  </li>
            <li> sleeps I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> Two essentials for long plane travel!</li>
            <li> I never realized what I was missing out on until I took this mask along with me on a recent road trip.</li>
            <li> Many other masks come with plastic adjustment straps and they can be painful and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As someone who has never had to share a room (only child) who will be sharing a small room with another person this semester, this product is a must.</li>
            <li> With these it&#x27;s darker than the inside of a cow when I have them on.</li>
            <li> In addition, the actual mask portion is slightly too small.</li>
            <li> and they really do help to reduce noise that may be disturbing your sleep.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Will be traveling soon and looking forward to using the ear plugs to keep the noise down in the airplane.  </li>
            <li> but less so.  </li>
            <li> so he takes his masks seriously, and he&#x27;s definitely given approval to this!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tight but not too tight.</li>
            <li> I can see a little bit out of the bottom of it.</li>
            <li> I plan on tucking this little gem into my carry-on bag while flying, to deter the excess noise.</li>
            <li> opening the mask cover, I smelled a faint odor of something like dry cleaning fluid.  </li>
            <li> It is way too thick and makes it impossible to get comfortable.</li>
            <li> but they always felt too heavy for my eyes...</li>
            <li> The mask did not feel heavy.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I work nights, and have trouble sleeping during the day.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this sleeping aid to midnight shift workers trying desperately to get quality sleep during the day.</li>
            <li> I usually would wake up 3 to 5 times a night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t move a lot when I&#x27;m sleeping and usually if I do it&#x27;s to adjust myself once or twice during the night.</li>
            <li> The band can be annoying around the ears, but a little soft material around it helps.</li>
            <li> (My husband stays up late watching tv and sometimes forgets to turn it off.)</li>
            <li> and I was late to work.  </li>
            <li> The loops to hold ear plugs absolutely annoyed me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this mask at all.</li>
            <li> I will be using this mask often since I sleep weird hours.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> The strap is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I confess that so far I am unawed by the mask.  I have yet to get it to fit even close to right.  Light shows under the mask, despite the clever configuration of the flap at the bottom, and the material irritates my eyelashes.  Also, the earplugs are subpar, being much harder foam than most earplugs. I assume that you chose the as they fit into your integrated plug holders, but they are really terrible plugs, given that there are scads of better choices out there for fit comfort and performance.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of keeping the light out of your eyes, and is comfortable.  The band can be annoying around the ears, but a little soft material around it helps.</li>
            <li> Everything was perfect! Thank you so much!!</li>
            <li> Do not like this mask.  It mashes my eyes and does not have a pad to keep it away from the eyes on the bottom.  Am not going to use it at all.</li>
            <li> Nice mask.  Comfortable and keeps light out</li>
            <li> I love this mask. I have slept like a baby from the first night I used it. I usually would wake up 3 to 5 times a night. Not now. I can&#x27;t imagine being without it now. If you are having problems sleeping I encourage you to try this mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with this mask at all. It&#x27;s not the one for me. The loops to hold ear plugs absolutely annoyed me. Plus, the earplugs don&#x27;t even fit correctly. The inside of the mask irritated my eyes and I would wake up with sensitive eyes and major allergy eyes every morning. Then the mask did not stay in position and I don&#x27;t toss and turn as I sleep. I sleep in one position because I have chronic pain. The mask was used nightly but only because I just hadn&#x27;t found the perfect one for me, yet.</li>
            <li> Nice and awesome item</li>
            <li> The Winkweaver sleep mask is a godsend.  I purchased it for my husband who works nights. Between that and the earplugs, he sleeps soundly during the busiest of days in our household.  Super product - thank you for bringing him his own \\&quot;sanctuary\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Best nights sleep I have had in a while.  Blocks out all the light and is very comfortable.  You don&#x27;t even realize your wearing it.</li>
            <li> Great product! Blocks all the light but vey comfy and soft. Excellent customer service and my mask arrived before excepted. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My wife loves it! ...and so do I as I can watch TV with my Sennheiser wireless headphones!!  :-)</li>
            <li> they are comfortable and easy to use. the attached ear plugs are a bonus. complete black out and greatly reduced noise for good rest.</li>
            <li> Very soft and big enough to block light. Mask stays on my face well but the ear plugs tend to fall out. Overall a great mask!</li>
            <li> Simply amazing! You wouldn&#x27;t wanna wake up.</li>
            <li> nice mask but not perfect.</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps out the light and is very comfortable. I didn&#x27;t use the ear plugs that were included. Had to take them off the strap to be comfortable. Great place to store them.</li>
            <li> Product seems great and the quality is excellent. I plan on taking this with me during long flights and feel it will come in handy.</li>
            <li> This mask is comfortable and keeps out the light well. Great for my migraines!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted!! Thanks so much for the great product and for the wonderful service!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug</li>
            <li> Simply put, I sleep better with this Eye Mask.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I might feel bothered by the strap or anything on my face but after a couple of nights of good sleep I&#x27;m waking up feeling better. I thought I had decent sleep before and that&#x27;s just what is was, decent sleep. But until I got reminded of what good sleep feels like I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a street light that can shine through my window even with a curtain on the window. You know how it is when all the lights are turned off in your room and your eyes adjust so even the slightest light seems bright. Well that&#x27;s what the street light was doing. I didn&#x27;t want to tape the curtains to the windows so I found this Eye Mask. Amazing what complete darkness does for your sleep pattern and how deep you go down and get restful sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I live in a quiet apt by myself so it&#x27;s pretty quiet at night but there&#x27;s always a possibility of a neighbor making noise or their pets. Nice to have the ear plugs close by in case of that happening.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product and the addition of the ear plugs.</li>
            <li> I bought this sleep mask for my older &amp;#34;bounce back&amp;#34; son. He sleeps on the front room couch and complains about the street lights and the neighbor&#x27;s porch lights making it hard to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;After a period of finding the right tension for the headband, he now tends to over sleep (gee, thanks)!&lt;br /&gt;Very effective.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this sleeping aid to midnight shift workers trying desperately to get quality sleep during the day.</li>
            <li> It completely blocks out the light! Very pleased. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This mask is comfortable to wear all night long and is easy to put on and take off.  It completely eliminates any light which has helped me to fall asleep more quickly.  The ear plugs fit into slots on the mask for storage which is a nice feature as they are small and would be easy to lose.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s daughter. She really likes it. She asked for it because any light in the room disrupts her sleep. She said she has been wearing it and it has helped her sleep better.</li>
            <li> perfect. soft padding makes it comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is far better then any I have tried before! It is super comfortable and does an excellent job of blocking out the light! The flap over the nose helps eliminate the light you usually still see with other sleep masks.  The mask itself is very light and soft. I haven&#x27;t slept with the earplugs for fear of not hearing my child at night, however from trying them on they seem very comfortable. This is a sleep mask that actually does a better job then all the others I have used over the years.</li>
            <li> Great product. I toss and turn so much since I work at night sleep during the day and the sun bothers me!! It&#x27;s tight but not too tight. It&#x27;s not all loose or cheaply made. Don&#x27;t need the earplugs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on recommendation from my niece who has the same trouble as I do with light interrupting my sleep.  What I love about this sleep mask is it&#x27;s incredibly SOFT and very lightweight.  There is a cool built in nose flap that traps out any additional light from peeping in underneath the bottom of the mask.  It&#x27;s also adjustable which is pretty neat (most others aren&#x27;t and feel rather tight/constricting as a result), and, portable with the built in slots for the ear plugs so you don&#x27;t have to pack them separate when traveling with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrific product and does the job!!</li>
            <li> This mask is soft and quite comfortable, and it does a very good job of blocking out light. I wish the straps were either a bit thinner or a bit higher, as right now they either rest across my ears--causing the mask to slip--or bend them down, which isn&#x27;t comfortable. I sometimes wake up to find the mask has completely come off, but that seems to happen with any mask I try, so it could just be the weirdness of my own head. I don&#x27;t really use earplugs, so I can&#x27;t comment on their quality or effectiveness. Overall I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase, especially given the cost as compared to other masks I&#x27;ve seen on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I usually go to the positive side; however I do have issues with this item.. I would be interested to know where the #1 rating came from.&lt;br /&gt;Upon opening the mask cover, I smelled a faint odor of something like dry cleaning fluid.  I put the mask outside to air until evening, still there, but less so.  The idea of the holders for the earplugs seems great, but the extra bulk is at the ears when the mask is worn and not so comfortable for side sleepers. The earplugs are too large for a petite lady as well as being heavy with something like wax. The velcro strap rides low and brings the mask high.  Perhaps right for some people,but not for me.  Good ideas, though.</li>
            <li> As a musician I sometimes sleep during the day. Most of the time I can nod right off, but when I crash on my sofa with the east sun streaming through the vaulted ceiling window I need a sleep mask. The review sample I received is one of the most effective ones I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some reasons why I love it. First, it truly is effective at eliminating all light. With these it&#x27;s darker than the inside of a cow when I have them on. Second, it&#x27;s comfortable. Light, but stays in place. Finally, it&#x27;s infinitely adjustable with the velcro strap. I love that feature a lot more than the more common buckle-style straps on most masks. There is just enough elastic to make fine adjustments easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These come with foam ear plugs too. Fortunately I live in a relatively quiet area where they are unneeded. They are the fitted type that you insert and they expand to fill your ear canal. I did not try these but have used identical ones on rare occasions and they are effective. Let&#x27;s just say that if you were in a city apartment and there was road construction outside your window, this would be a blessing. I&#x27;ve actually used this style of plug to attenuate the workings of a wild man with a jackhammer and it made the experience bearable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually used the mask last night to determine how well it wears for prolonged periods. I&#x27;ll pleased to say that it was totally comfortable and completely effective. Definitely one of the better sleep masks and one that I recommend to my vampire friends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome my husband can now read or watch TV in our room with out disturbing me.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband, to replace a mask that disappeared during a camping trip that is now a discontinued product. I figured there was no way replacement mask could possibly live up to the original mask, but I read the glowing reviews and went for it. This mask is great!  It completely blocks out all light, but it&#x27;s still nice and lightweight. My husband is a restless sleeper so he takes his masks seriously, and he&#x27;s definitely given approval to this!</li>
            <li> I did not think a mask could be so comfortable and non detracting. I love it.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Awesome delivery just like seller said. I love it because it blocked out all light, which is a blessing since hubby and others walk past bedroom and turn on bathroom lights at night, it is comfortable and stays in place, and I like that the strap is velcro so that makes it easy for me to adjust. I used earplugs once and they were comfortable. Will definitely use regularly. Great product!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 10 year old daughter who likes her sleep masks.  This is her review...&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;It&#x27;s comfy but I don&#x27;t know how to use the nose part.  I can see a little bit out of the bottom of it. The ear buds seemed cheap, like they had a small crack in it.  I am not using them.  Overall, I like this better than my Hello Kitty one because it is black and keeps more light out.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Seemed not bad quality but was too small for me and let light in around the bottom of the mask, so I returned it.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable.  This is my go to sleep mask.  When it wears out I will order another.</li>
            <li> This was a great buy for the price I paid.Keeps out all the light and appears to be the perfect size.I particularly like the fold near the nose which keeps out all stray light.Definitely recommended purchase.</li>
            <li> I received this sleep mask and was excited to give it a try.  I absolutely love it!  Unlike most other masks I have tried, this one actually has an adjustable strap that is not composed of a flimsy elastic band.  Instead, it has Velcro attached to nice band that is wide enough not to leave indentations in your head.  I have not used the ear plugs, which is a wonderful addition.  I plan on tucking this little gem into my carry-on bag while flying, to deter the excess noise.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this just in time for my hospital stay.  I had major back surgery and took the sleep mask with me. I was glad to have it with all the lights and noise during the night while trying to sleep,  The mask was very comfortable and completely blocked out all the light.  I like the way you can store the included ear plugs right with the mask so you have them if needed.  I highly recommend buying.</li>
            <li> This sleep mask is definitely a step above the free ones I received from the airlines in the past.  The inside is soft and comfortable, the outside has a satin feel, and the velcro adjustable strap is wide &amp; stretchy enough to feel secure.  If I wear this one out or lose it I will definitely order another. I haven&#x27;t had a need for the earplugs yet, but I&#x27;ve used this kind before and they really do help to reduce noise that may be disturbing your sleep.  ​&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your mask isn&#x27;t blocking the light as well as you hoped, read their instructions that came with the product, there&#x27;s a tip there that may solve your problem.</li>
            <li> Great for naps! Cuts out ALL LIGHT AND IS VERY COMFORTABLE!</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. I sleep like a baby now. I have an overall sense of peacefullness while wearing this at night. It&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve experienced total absence of light and now I fall asleep much faster. Great purchase and will recommend to others.</li>
            <li> We just purchased new blinds for a our bedroom. Albeit, they&#x27;re lovely and make the room look nicer and larger, they don&#x27;t completely filter out the street lights like our old, nappy salvia curtains used to. Time to invest in sleep masks. Based on the hyped claims of the company and the good reviews I read on Amazon, I purchased the WinkWeaver. They&#x27;re wonderful. They are comfortable, adjustable (not just a piece of elastic slapped on), and make nighttime nice and dark - ideal for getting a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> I bought the mask for darkness and to prevent my eyes from drying out at night. The mask is well made. The velvet is soft against my eyes and face. But the best part is the total darkness that is acheived when wearing the mask. Love it and would recommend it</li>
            <li> Comfortable, large enough to block out light.</li>
            <li> Great product! The adjustable strap and soft interior add to the Wink Weaver&#x27;s overall comfort. The mask does not let any light through, and the ear plugs are a great feature. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I loved this mask at first. Upon putting it on I noticed that it was soft so I wouldn&#x27;t have an issue with any discomfort during the night. After a week the straps began to wear. I don&#x27;t move a lot when I&#x27;m sleeping and usually if I do it&#x27;s to adjust myself once or twice during the night. Week 2: my straps began to bother my ears as they rest upon it to hold my mask in place. Today marks the month mark of receiving this and the thread is falling out.  I don&#x27;t even bother to use the ear plugs so no comment on that.</li>
            <li> Nice product. Never used before but bought for my upcoming LONG airline flight.  Have tried at home and they seem comfortable and qood quality. I don&#x27;t use ear plugs</li>
            <li> Good mask, and the earplugs are a plus.</li>
            <li> The strap is terrible. It is way too thick and makes it impossible to get comfortable. In addition, the actual mask portion is slightly too small. Why mess with a good thing? The best sleep masks are the simplest ones. This is over engineered.</li>
            <li> I loved that the eye mask came with the ear plugs! Two essentials for long plane travel! My old eye masks always had a thin elastic strap that stretched and were hopeless, this eye mask is great with the velcro to expand it plus the thick straps that don&#x27;t stretch!</li>
            <li> lightweight, comfortable and fits as expected.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money. There are better sleep masks that don&#x27;t put pressure on your eyes and there are better ear plugs.</li>
            <li> Very comfy and they fit snug. Love them.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight and comfortable. The mask blocks out almost all light when positioned correctly. I haven&#x27;t tried to use the earplugs yet but even if they&#x27;re not for me, it&#x27;s great to have 2 slots for my own earplugs to fit in. Clever! I will be using this mask often since I sleep weird hours. There was a smell initially but I soaked the mask in water and detergent and it&#x27;s almost gone.</li>
            <li> Very nicely fits to the head, and is very comfortable.  It is adjustable so it can be fitted for any size.  Fits around nose area perfectly, which is usually the problem with most.  Blocks out all light!  Great find for a great price.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this eye sleep mask.  He say&#x27;s it&#x27;s the best!!!  He loves how it has velcro to adjust the tightness.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> This is a great sleep mask. It is adjustable with velcro making it possible to satisfy anyone&#x27;s need for a longer or shorter string. The ear plugs are also very soft and they feel like they are made out of memory foam. :)</li>
            <li> After having kids and now in my early forties...I just don&#x27;t sleep soundly like I used to.  I&#x27;ve tried several sleep masks...but they always felt too heavy for my eyes...if that makes any sense.  I guess I have sensitive eyelids.  Well, when I came across the WinkWeaver...I thought of course I&#x27;ll give it a try.  I am so glad I did.  I love the material...it&#x27;s so lightweight I can barely feel it...yet it does the job at blocking out light so I can sleep soundly.  I love that it comes paired with earplugs...such a great idea and I&#x27;ve put them to good use.  They fit very snug yet comfortable in my ears.  Bottom line...I am extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, will be perfect for travel :) would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> Clever design with the holders for the ear plugs, but I&#x27;d note that they will slip out if you&#x27;re wearing the mask. If you prefer to rest without using the plugs, take them out and set them aside so you don&#x27;t lose them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, this is a great product! I&#x27;ve never used a sleep mask before, but I&#x27;ve noticed that I&#x27;m falling to sleep quickly and STAYING asleep all through the night. The inner liner of the mask is velvet, which is very comfortable. I also like that mask has adjustable straps, allowing users to enjoy maximum comfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product is well made.  It did as advertised and blocked out the light for a better sleep.  I did not use the earplugs, but i love the fact that there is a place to store them if i needed them.  i am very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried out the wink weaver mask and ear plugs last night. I really liked that it kept out plenty of light and sound. The mask did not feel heavy. It was very light weight. I also loved that there was a place to store the ear plugs on the back strap. The only downside is that the straps bothered my ears. They may have not bothered me so much if the straps sat just above my ears instead of right on top. Also I wish the Velcro went all the way across the straps instead of just on one small section so I could tighten the straps a bit more. All in all I liked it. I normally wake up in the middle of the night because of the light from the tv, (My husband stays up late watching tv and sometimes forgets to turn it off.) but I didn&#x27;t wake up at all. :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I work nights, and have trouble sleeping during the day.  The mask was comfortable to wear, and kept %99.99 of light out.  I would recommend this product to anyone who is seeking help sleeping during the daytime.</li>
            <li> Love my sleep mask, especially the adjustable band.  Will be traveling soon and looking forward to using the ear plugs to keep the noise down in the airplane.  Recommend the Sleep Mask with the Ear Plugs.</li>
            <li> Finally able to sleep while wearing a sleep mask. Much more comfortable than the others I have tried. I am a very light sleeper and the slightest onset of light wakes me up. This mask did the trick at blocking the light distractions and I had probably one of the best night sleeps I have had in a long time.</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  It came fasssst and as was described.  Blocks out light very well!  I won&#x27;t use the ear plugs until ...well, as soon as I need them!  Otherwise......quality product .</li>
            <li> I am such as light sleeper, so this product came in handy for a test run before school. As someone who has never had to share a room (only child) who will be sharing a small room with another person this semester, this product is a must. We will be on different schedules, and will have different needs. Sometimes I like to take a nap during the day, and she might want to do some work or have a friend over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works wonderfully for blocking out light. It&#x27;s comfortable, and easy to put on. It&#x27;s snug around my head and it is SUPER comfortable. Many other masks come with plastic adjustment straps and they can be painful and uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product also included ear plugs - great for blocking out sounds of my roommate getting ready when I can sleep in in the mornings. They are also comfortable to use. I actually forgot I had them in when I woke up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this product is worth your money. It says what it does, and is comfortable. They come in a timely matter as well. You will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable and completely blocks out the light. Extremely useful tool since we don&#x27;t have thick curtains in the bedroom. Love that it comes with ear plugs too.</li>
            <li> I have never been a big fan of sleep masks as they are generally uncomfortable and for all the potential benefits they bring often add their own issues. NOT this one. If you need the room to be completely dark to get a good night&#x27;s sleep but can&#x27;t do so (for whatever reason) then the Calm Nature sleep mask is for you. It works at sealing out the light and it is very comfortable. Very impressed with this product. Great when you&#x27;re traveling too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This review is for the sleep mask only as I personally can&#x27;t sleep with anything in my ears.</li>
            <li> It did the trick. I never realized what I was missing out on until I took this mask along with me on a recent road trip. I have never been able to sleep in the car until now. I like that the ear plugs are the standard size and can be replaced easily. It is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Very pleased with the mask. But one of the ear plugs rore while removing it. May I purchase a new set and what is the cost. Thank you for your e-mail.</li>
            <li> I just started working the night shift and was definitely having problems sleeping during the day.  All that changed the very second I used this mask.  It blocks out almost all the light and the first time I used it I woke up at 4pm randomly really thinking it was the middle of the night already and I was late to work.  It&#x27;s comfortable, doesn&#x27;t slide off and still blocks almost all the light as a side/stomach sleeper.  I didn&#x27;t try the ear plugs that came with it, I use another brand, but I have small ear canals and they were HUGE.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Honestly one of the best sleep masks ive used. My husband actually steals this from me sometimes to use himself.</li>
