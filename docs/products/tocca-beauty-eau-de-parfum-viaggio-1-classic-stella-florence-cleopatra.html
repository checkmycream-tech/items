            <li>find all the scents to be nice and wearable for all occasions.</li>
            <li>Nice product to try for the price</li>
            <li>The perfume (scent wise) is lovely.</li>
            <li>This set is nice.  </li>
            <li>They smell great and don&#x27;t fade quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>Stella has more orange roots with floral, while Cleopatra is a spicy, musky scent.</li>
            <li>These are lights scents that will not offend many noses.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was really apprehensive after reading some reviews that the perfume came spilled and the box soggy, but I took the chance and was happy to have none of those</li>
            <li>Cleopatra was my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li>I think they should tape the lids shut on each one to make sure there is no leaking.</li>
            <li>Love this perfume.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>However there needs to be more care give to the packaging of this item.</li>
            <li>They come in a nice little box which would be perfect as a gift for someone.</li>
            <li>the packaging was well done, the bottles are super cute.</li>
            <li>It smells citrusy and light.</li>
            <li>They all smell light.</li>
            <li>I brought it for one scent and now I enjoy Stella and Cleoptra from time to time.</li>
            <li>I just enjoy collecting perfumes, so you may be better off depending on an expert&#x27;s review on the exact makeup of the perfume formulas.</li>
            <li>This set arrived with one of the lids unscrewed, but they were really nice about sending a new one immediately.  </li>
            <li>- Florence is clean and fresh, Stella is sweet and indulgent, Cleopatra is musky and sensual.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heared of Tocca but enjoy fine fragrance especially when packaged in such a beautiful bottle.  </li>
            <li>One of my favorite perfumes is in the set and it&#x27;s cheapest to buy this set than buying my favorite individually.  </li>
            <li>I only really like one of them, but the packaging is very nice.</li>
            <li>My wife loves little special things, and appreciates the Tocca scents (and I benefit as well, smells nice!).</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I recently discovered Tocca and liked the soft floral scent of Florence.</li>
            <li>it is still my favorite Tocca fragrance, but I am pleased with the companion fragrances Cleopatra and Stella; both fragrances are so subtle they may be worn to bed.</li>
            <li>Definitely go for smaller-sized versions and only buy the full sized ones if you truly fall in love with one.</li>
            <li>the perfumes, not so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a sucker for good packaging.</li>
            <li>My wife liked 2 out of the 3 ... one small concern - one of the bottles opened in shipment so there was 20% of one bottle that had spilled in the box.</li>
            <li>I have purchased the little sample kit from Sephora of Tocca and really enjoyed the scents.  </li>
            <li>I love this little set.</li>
            <li>These adorable little bottles come in a really lovely box that I&#x27;m going to have a really hard time getting rid of.</li>
            <li>Be aware that the smaller ones do not come as a spray, but as a dabber.</li>
            <li>and I love the small bottles.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was hoping for...an inexpensive way to test out these three different fragrances by Tocca!</li>
            <li>They smell like perfume that&#x27;s past its age, spoiled or even cheap.  </li>
            <li>Again, Florence is what I imagine to be a soft white floral.</li>
            <li>only thing that I think surprised me is that the bottles have no spray, they are just screw tops.</li>
            <li>Each one smells so unique and complex</li>
            <li>I should have known better and listened to the other negative reviews about receiving items in a similar condition</li>

            <li> Cleopatra is my least fave, but I can&#x27;t say why - sorry.</li>
            <li> The inner packaging is horrible.</li>
            <li> something was wrong.</li>
            <li> I am used to expensive perfume, but am now a fan of Tocca.</li>
            <li> I feel horrible, as this was a present for someone else. :(</li>
            <li> but i have never had a bad experience with amazon</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> so i took a chance at the worst time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> purchased this in order to get Florence.  it is still my favorite Tocca fragrance, but I am pleased with the companion fragrances Cleopatra and Stella; both fragrances are so subtle they may be worn to bed.</li>
            <li> These Tocca perfumes are delicious and the perfect travel size. Each one smells so unique and complex - Florence is clean and fresh, Stella is sweet and indulgent, Cleopatra is musky and sensual. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Definitely a good deal, given the amount you get</li>
            <li> I recently discovered Tocca and liked the soft floral scent of Florence. I decided to buy this smaller sample version. Be aware that the smaller ones do not come as a spray, but as a dabber. Also the topper is not the heavier metal that the full-size version has but is a cheaper plastic version. Just a warning, because that was not what I expected when I received mine.&lt;br /&gt;I find all the scents to be nice and wearable for all occasions. Again, Florence is what I imagine to be a soft white floral. Stella has more orange roots with floral, while Cleopatra is a spicy, musky scent. I am a perfume amateur. I just enjoy collecting perfumes, so you may be better off depending on an expert&#x27;s review on the exact makeup of the perfume formulas. But for my novice nose, those are my impressions.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find the scents very complex and I don&#x27;t think the formulas are worth the expensive price tag of the full-sized version. These are lights scents that will not offend many noses. Definitely go for smaller-sized versions and only buy the full sized ones if you truly fall in love with one.</li>
            <li> My personal fave of this trio is Stella. It smells citrusy and light. They all smell light. Florence is soapy smelling, in a good way. Cleopatra is my least fave, but I can&#x27;t say why - sorry. They are all really beautiful and I recommend the set without reservation. You will be happy and smelling nice, esp. in summer weather.</li>
            <li> These fragrances are amazing! Wish they were in a spray bottle but love them and well priced!</li>
            <li> Great scents, each different,yet subtle...appealing packaging...delightful gift to give or receive...appropriate for all ages and all occasions....how about mother&#x27;s day or birthdays?  or even Dad&#x27;s day?</li>
            <li> Nice product to try for the price</li>
            <li> I have purchased the little sample kit from Sephora of Tocca and really enjoyed the scents.  This set arrived with one of the lids unscrewed, but they were really nice about sending a new one immediately.  The smell of this group was not nearly as nice as the samples set from Sephora.</li>
            <li> The perfume (scent wise) is lovely. The inner packaging is horrible. The bottles came spilled, partially empty, and the alcohol rubbed the gold leafing off the caps. I feel horrible, as this was a present for someone else. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a sucker for good packaging. These adorable little bottles come in a really lovely box that I&#x27;m going to have a really hard time getting rid of. It&#x27;s just too pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really apprehensive after reading some reviews that the perfume came spilled and the box soggy, but I took the chance and was happy to have none of those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I think surprised me is that the bottles have no spray, they are just screw tops. Not really a downside, but I had somehow been expecting tiny little spritzers.</li>
            <li> the packaging was well done, the bottles are super cute. the perfumes, not so much. very ordinary scents.</li>
            <li> i could tell as soon as i got the box something was wrong. yup. the bottles were not broke but all the perfume had leaked out and the lids were very very loose. I should have known better and listened to the other negative reviews about receiving items in a similar condition but i have never had a bad experience with amazon so i took a chance at the worst time. this was to be a birthday gift. buy in store!</li>
            <li> All of the fragrances are not that great, but they&#x27;re not terrible either. I only really like one of them, but the packaging is very nice. They come in a nice little box which would be perfect as a gift for someone.</li>
            <li> Cleopatra was my girlfriend&#x27;s favorite</li>
            <li> My wife loves little special things, and appreciates the Tocca scents (and I benefit as well, smells nice!). Great package and presentation, and will beat flowers as a nice \\&quot;I love  you\\&quot; surprise - Valentine&#x27;s day anyone....</li>
            <li> I ordered these because I was so enamored of an impulse purchase of Giullietta.  I&#x27;d never heared of Tocca but enjoy fine fragrance especially when packaged in such a beautiful bottle.  I will often spray Giullietta on before going to sleep.  This sample collection however is not of comparable quality.  They smell like perfume that&#x27;s past its age, spoiled or even cheap.  I was so disappointed.  I will ask for a refund.</li>
            <li> The bottles are perfect size. The scents are wonderful. I brought it for one scent and now I enjoy Stella and Cleoptra from time to time.</li>
            <li> Smell amazing! Same issue others had with shipping. I think they should tape the lids shut on each one to make sure there is no leaking. But great customer service and great sized scents. I was say about .5 oz each</li>
            <li> I love this little set. I mix the scents or wear them alone.</li>
            <li> My friend talked me into this, and so glad she did! The frangrances vary from each other and can complement your different moods or even outfits.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement for my perfume that was discontinued and someone suggested one of these.  I found theme overly flowery for my taste...the packaging is beautiful though.  If you like flowery scents you should definitely go for these.</li>
            <li> Love this perfume. I get so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with these three fragrances.  They smell great and don&#x27;t fade quickly.  I am used to expensive perfume, but am now a fan of Tocca.</li>
            <li> The perfume was great and I love the small bottles. However there needs to be more care give to the packaging of this item. When I received it and opened the package one of the bottles had leaked out about an 1/8 of the perfume in there.</li>
            <li> This set is nice.  One of my favorite perfumes is in the set and it&#x27;s cheapest to buy this set than buying my favorite individually.  I&#x27;m not as fond as the other two scents.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was hoping for...an inexpensive way to test out these three different fragrances by Tocca!</li>
            <li> My wife liked 2 out of the 3 ... one small concern - one of the bottles opened in shipment so there was 20% of one bottle that had spilled in the box. Not a big deal but needs improved packging.&lt;br /&gt;A bit on the &amp;#34;cheap looking side&amp;#34; but for the price I guess you cannot complain.</li>
