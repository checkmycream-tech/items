            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I got this haircomb as part of my wedding accessories.  </li>
            <li>I am so happy I ordered this-</li>
            <li>and the quality was great.</li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully and looked amazing.</li>
            <li>A great addition to my bridal outfit.</li>
            <li>Its even more beautiful in person!!</li>
            <li>Worked wonderfully with my prom dress and everything :)</li>
            <li>It was beautiful when I received and even more on my wedding day!</li>
            <li>It was the perfect size-- not obnoxiously huge but not insignificantly</li>
            <li>Good grip, but my hair lady used a bobby pin to also hold in place just in case.</li>
            <li>I really loved this hair comb, looks like it does in the picture.</li>
            <li>This hair comb is more beautiful in person.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It looked amazing in her hair.</li>
            <li>It is gorgeous, way better in person even.</li>
            <li>It was also packaged nicely so the comb wouldn&#x27;t get damaged in the mail.</li>
            <li>This item is actually really nice.</li>
            <li>so if you have fine hair it might not stay in very nicely because the item does have some weight to it.</li>
            <li>At first glance, I thought it was quite beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is well worth purchasing and is gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I love it and can&#x27;t wait to wear it for my wedding.</li>
            <li>This is such a beautiful headpiece!</li>
            <li>MUCH MUCH better in person.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>No defects, packaged appropriately to protect the handmade worksmanship.</li>
            <li>It is more stunning in person.</li>
            <li>I am going to use it for my wedding and very excited.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to wear this on my special day!</li>
            <li>I tried it in my hair, and one of the clusters broke right off the comb!!  </li>
            <li>But upon closer inspection, it looked cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Just what I was looking for to fit the style of her wedding.</li>
            <li>So, if you want a super elegant, shiny and fresh detail, this is the one.</li>
            <li>I was assured that this must have been a faulty comb and was asked to return it for a full refund plus funds for free shipping to return the item.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured, but even better in person.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was apprehensive about spending so much money on a hair comb that I hadn&#x27;t even seen first, but so pleased when it arrived!</li>
            <li>I returned the comb and promptly received a full refund as promised.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the perfect mix of delicate and bling.  </li>
            <li>Product was delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>This hair comb is so much prettier in person, I&#x27;m so excited to wear this at my beach wedding.</li>
            <li>The little crystals perfectly complimented the beadwork on my dress, and the pearls add a touch of traditional sophistication.</li>
            <li>it is so pretty</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>Exactly what it said it was and what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This is just much more than I expected..</li>
            <li>The shipping was much faster than anticipated.  </li>
            <li>The jewels on the comb really sparkle.</li>
            <li>SHipped Fast</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how fast I recieved this Item.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t beat the price, I shopped around and this was only half the cost of pieces that weren&#x27;t even as nice!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bit on a smaller side and the comb was a bit flimsy - definitely hand made, but the decorative part is very pretty and good quality.</li>
            <li>long and 4&amp;#34; wide, and it looks very elegant in the hair.</li>
            <li>This really does complete my wedding look.</li>
            <li>Not cheaply made I love it.</li>
            <li>I wanted a simple, but pretty flower comb for my hair.</li>
            <li>Very pretty, and super delicate.</li>
            <li>But after realizing that a real blossom would not last all day-- the petals would probably start falling out within a matter of hours, from being out of water and jostled around while I moved</li>
            <li>Also the white flowers do not look like flowers (at least on mine) its more the a bunch of white peddles that dont really form a flower.</li>
            <li>I did not want anything that is too huge or too small.</li>
            <li>small, very pretty.</li>
            <li>Also, the prongs on the comb are weak and easily bent, not sturdy at all.</li>

            <li> The only reason that it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I was expecting it so be put together on a solid base</li>
            <li> The reason I didn&#x27;t give it all 5 stars is because it is extremely delicate.</li>

            <li> This hair comb is so much prettier in person, I&#x27;m so excited to wear this at my beach wedding. The only reason that it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I was expecting it so be put together on a solid base but it is held together my wiring, just a personal preference. Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this hair comb on Dec 10, got it (across the country) on Dec 12. It is gorgeous, way better in person even. I love it and can&#x27;t wait to wear it for my wedding. Can&#x27;t beat the price, I shopped around and this was only half the cost of pieces that weren&#x27;t even as nice!</li>
            <li> This hair comb is more beautiful in person. The quality of it is superb.  I&#x27;m so happy I got this haircomb as part of my wedding accessories.  The order came earlier than stated. Very happy with everything!!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait for my wedding day so i can wear this it is so pretty and it will go with my dress</li>
            <li> This is just much more than I expected.. So, if you want a super elegant, shiny and fresh detail, this is the one. It has the bling and the flowers. All in one.</li>
            <li> Beautiful details! Matched perfect with my wedding dress. Good grip, but my hair lady used a bobby pin to also hold in place just in case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect.  Exactly as pictured, but even better in person.  Arrived 2 days after my order!  It came faster than my amazon prime orders! I am so happy I ordered this- it&#x27;s the perfect mix of delicate and bling.  Exceeded all my expectations!! Can&#x27;t wait to wear this on my wedding day!</li>
            <li> Beautifully made and looked perfect on my wedding day!! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> This is such a beautiful headpiece! MUCH MUCH better in person. I did not want anything that is too huge or too small. This was the perfect size for me. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my sisters wedding. It looked amazing in her hair. Just what I was looking for to fit the style of her wedding.</li>
            <li> I just received this in the mail today and can I say it&#x27;s absolutely gorgeous! I tried it on and even with my hair in pony tail I looked like a bride already! The shipping was much faster than anticipated.  I can&#x27;t wait to wear this on my special day!</li>
            <li> I opted not to wear a veil for my wedding, instead wanting a simple flower in my hair. But after realizing that a real blossom would not last all day-- the petals would probably start falling out within a matter of hours, from being out of water and jostled around while I moved/ate/danced/etc. So a decorative hair clip/comb seemed like the best solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was apprehensive about spending so much money on a hair comb that I hadn&#x27;t even seen first, but so pleased when it arrived! It was the perfect size-- not obnoxiously huge but not insignificantly puny-- and the quality was great. I didn&#x27;t feel worried at all about pieces breaking off. The little crystals perfectly complimented the beadwork on my dress, and the pearls add a touch of traditional sophistication. It was perfect!</li>
            <li> I wore this with my veil for my wedding.  It worked wonderfully and looked amazing.</li>
            <li> I Loved this! Looked beautiful for my wedding day!!just what I was looking for! This piece has Great quality too!</li>
            <li> Its even more beautiful in person!! Love it. Exactly what it said it was and what I wanted. I would hihhly recommend</li>
            <li> Product was delivered quickly. It was also packaged nicely so the comb wouldn&#x27;t get damaged in the mail. The jewels on the comb really sparkle. The wires on the comb that the pearls are attached to are bendable. The only concern I would mention is the comb itself is pretty small so if you have fine hair it might not stay in very nicely because the item does have some weight to it.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, and super delicate.</li>
            <li> small, very pretty. wish I had another occasion to wear this!</li>
            <li> This item is actually really nice. Not cheaply made I love it. I am going to use it for my wedding and very excited. SHipped Fast</li>
            <li> I purchased this item on monday and it arrived on wednesday. Exceptional turn around! No defects, packaged appropriately to protect the handmade worksmanship. It was beautiful when I received and even more on my wedding day!</li>
            <li> A great addition to my bridal outfit. It&#x27;s not too big, about 4&amp;#34; long and 4&amp;#34; wide, and it looks very elegant in the hair. It stays in well and isn&#x27;t at all heavy.</li>
            <li> I really loved this hair comb, looks like it does in the picture. The reason for my 3 stars instead of 5 is because the big crystal flower next to the silk one fell off when I picked the comb up. I would have returned it but I am wearing it in my wedding which is in a week and a half. I even tried gluing it and nothing will make it stick. Definitely bummed.</li>
            <li> This is the one I used as my hair piece for my wedding. It&#x27;s a little bit on a smaller side and the comb was a bit flimsy - definitely hand made, but the decorative part is very pretty and good quality. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how fast I recieved this Item. I ordered it one day with the standard shipping and I got it the next day. The picture does not do it justice. It is more stunning in person. Absolutely beautiful!!! This really does complete my wedding look. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it all 5 stars is because it is extremely delicate. Handle with care or it will break. Also the white flowers do not look like flowers (at least on mine) its more the a bunch of white peddles that dont really form a flower. Still it is extremely beautiful. If you are picking about that sort of thing just think about it before you purchase.</li>
            <li> Worked wonderfully with my prom dress and everything :) Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;-KS</li>
