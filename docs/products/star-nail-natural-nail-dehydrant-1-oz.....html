            <li>Comes packaged nicely, there is a great amount inside, and can be used for natural nails or acrylic.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping Great Product</li>
            <li>It does help my daughter&#x27;s nail wraps stick better :)</li>
            <li>I am very excited about applying my acrylic nail tips and see the difference in that as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended &amp; good quality love it.</li>
            <li>So far so good :)</li>
            <li>the smell is to strong</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even appy a top coat but was able to wear sandals right away and still look glossy.</li>
            <li>My nails are staying on well, so that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s important.</li>
            <li>It went on very smooth and the color stood out even more because the color stood out with its natural gloss</li>
            <li>This product was way more than what I expected and the smell &amp;#34;what smell&amp;#34; plus I had good ventilation in the room</li>
            <li>Its works quickly, you can tell when it has done it&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>The bottle is a good size and it does what its supposed to if im not mistaken it came earlier or right on time</li>
            <li>It came in nicely wrapped and they even added extra padding in the box</li>
            <li>I use this product for my clients, and I must say, the dehydrant offers a better bonding when working with acrylics.</li>
            <li>Worked perfect for putting it on before setting my acrylic on and it&#x27;s a big bottle compared to how much you actually use on your nails</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>It came good quality and 4 dayd before due daye</li>
            <li>This product works very very well.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>but unfortunately this primer wasn&#x27;t the best....</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it does.</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and I notice right away after the first use the difference when I applied my nail color.</li>
            <li>the shipping was fast....</li>
            <li>Nice hefty jar will last me a long time.</li>
            <li>This is the product I use and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The bottle is glass, and it&#x27;s pretty big!</li>
            <li>the product came earlier than expected and it works very well for me, and it doesn&#x27;t have a powerful odor like i thought it would have.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t offensive, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin (which is incredibly sensitive.)</li>
            <li>Works great, wide base bottle doesn&#x27;t tip easily.</li>
