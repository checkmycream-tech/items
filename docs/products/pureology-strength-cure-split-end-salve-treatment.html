            <li> I could tell the difference in one use. Great product. I love this stuff and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results with this. My hair looked the same with drug store products. Very disappointing for Pureology.</li>
            <li> Great product. Have been using it for several months now. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Smell is annoying seen no difference in my hair after 2 weeks I don&#x27;t recommend.  products &amp;#34;10&amp;#34; works way better</li>
            <li> LOVE this and it smells amazing</li>
            <li> Honestly, ends are still dry and split.  Maybe it&#x27;s just me.  Not as drying as some supposed conditioning products so it gets a just okay rating.</li>
            <li> Dont be silly. Stop reading reviews and buy this product if you know whats good for you. Best hair stuff ever. Your hair will love you forever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the real stuff or that it&#x27;s old or expired..The product has a nasty odor to it. I love Pureology products so I&#x27;m familiar with their scents and how they work. This is a bad one.</li>
            <li> This does what it says. Legit product! Really smooths the splits ends &amp; makes hair look great. Better than any anti frizz product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product..love it. It works great and leaves a shine and softness on the hair.</li>
            <li> I thought it would take a few usages to see a difference, but not so.  After one usage, I could see and feel the difference in my hair, and the ends were not frayed or flyaway.  I almost couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I highly recommend this product, and other products in this line.</li>
            <li> Great product - love how well it works on dry brittle ends.</li>
            <li> I love there products.</li>

            <li> Very good. Leaves hair silky and protects enda. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used pureology products for about 8 years now. So when I tried this line of pureology I was absolutely amazed. In one use my hair was beautifully smooth and my color suddenly popped like I had just been to the salon. Im 100% in love with this product line. It smells great almost like fresh powder too. Awesome product.</li>
