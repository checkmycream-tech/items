            <li>He has fantastic self esteem and a zany sense of humor.</li>

            <li>Leaves hair nice and soft</li>
            <li>Luckily, our midwife turned us onto Baby Don&#x27;t Be Bald.</li>
            <li>We noticed results using this product fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>It is still really curly but because it is much longer the styles hold better.</li>
            <li>No hairstyle would hold because her hair would just curl right up.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll continue to use and I will update my review with future results, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>just wait it out, it&#x27;ll grow in ;)</li>
            <li>whatever makes you as a parent feel better and conceals your shame is the key.  </li>
            <li>So basically, your child hair will grow when it&#x27;s ready!</li>
            <li>I love Baby don&#x27;t be bald; I&#x27;ve bought it several times, and will buy again.</li>
            <li>After applying the cap and whatever accessory you choose, it&#x27;s important to play classical music to stimulate the hair follicles.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It really does work</li>
            <li>I purchased the whole line of products shampoo condition leave in and hair grease...</li>
            <li>Be careful to not use too much because it can be a challenging washing all of it out.</li>
            <li>My other love this product.  </li>
            <li>The product works well for my girls&#x27; hair and does not dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>Your baby will also be a little taller and will weigh more.</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical initially, but this was highly recommeded and the ingredients are all GOOD!</li>
            <li>My wife and I recently had our first baby, and to our horror, he came out completely bald.</li>
            <li>I initially purchased this for my two year old daughter&#x27;s hair; however, I decided to test it out on my hair first.</li>
            <li>I rub it directly onto her scalp and hair, every day.</li>
            <li>I used this on my one year old daughter.</li>
            <li>I like the way it  goes on so far.</li>
            <li>and now she has a full, wavy beard all the way down to her Pampers!</li>
            <li>I hope my hair gets back to normal....</li>
            <li>In case you&#x27;re wondering, they seem to prefer Beethoven&#x27;s fifth symphony, which was clearly written about the grand entrance of a hair follicle sprouting through the skin of a child experiencing infantile pattern baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>( I am guessing it&#x27;s a side effect of the loud classical music).  </li>
            <li>I have recently started my five month old niece using the line as well.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it could be our imagination, but it totally seems like this is working so far.</li>
            <li>Her entire scalp was covered with hair that was so curly and soft, and because of the length, I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it.</li>
            <li>My old age,no I am only 48</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve heard that other parents like to put a wig over the bathing cap while waiting for the real thing,  </li>

            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to see results</li>
            <li> ( We have filed down the edges very carefully, so as not to cause any scalp damage)  </li>
            <li> After a few months I noticed that her hair had grown considerably.</li>
            <li> If you use regular or double strength, you might as well be throwing your money down the drain and waiting in vain for your baby&#x27;s hair to grow in naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My curls are loose and neat when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it is a pretty thick balm and does not easily dissolve into her hair or scalp.  </li>
            <li> Although i wouldnt buy the shampoo or oil products leaves African american hair way to dry and hard.</li>
            <li> Its sold in alot of beauty stores but they have to purchase online due to it not being sold at thier beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works for other but it didn&#x27;t work for my daughter.</li>
            <li> Hairstylist recommended it to me and also used it on my edges which I have had a problem growing back for YEARS , and I now have egdes so I was anxious  to order.  </li>
            <li> not worth the money&lt;br /&gt;Your</li>
            <li> You should slather your baby&#x27;s head with this at least Five times per day, and only the TRIPLE STRENGTH will do.  </li>
            <li> Even though he or she hasn&#x27;t formed words yet, has no true perception of self image or what beauty is...</li>
            <li> Have been applying this to little Abigail&#x27;s head for just over three months</li>
            <li> baby&#x27;s hair will grow in after a few years,</li>
            <li> Shed everyday ..</li>
            <li> I use on my little ones hair at least 4-5 times weekly.</li>
            <li> If I use it before bedtime, I usually put a towel on her pillow to protect her pillowcase.</li>
            <li> I have used this in the past and can&#x27;t believe the price for the size.</li>
            <li> Her hair is thick all over now.</li>
            <li> Our toddler had areas of thin spots in her hair.</li>
            <li> Plus it stinks to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy because just for me wasn&#x27;t for her hair to grow, it was just to keep her hair moisturized.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews on here.</li>
            <li> -breaking-- a parent&#x27;s worst nightmare.</li>
            <li> hair did not improve it became worst...</li>

            <li> My other love this product.  Excellent</li>
            <li> Leaves hair nice and soft</li>
            <li> This product works wonders! I have 3 daughters ages 8,6 and 2. It has made a really big change on my 2 year olds hair! I also used in my 6 year old as a toddler and worked great! Hair grew like a weed! I don&#x27;t believe the bad reviews on here. I even recommended to family members as well and it has worked wonders for them and their children! My mother and my aunt both had severe hairloss donto illness and started using this product and they love it now! Its sold in alot of beauty stores but they have to purchase online due to it not being sold at thier beauty supply store. Although i wouldnt buy the shampoo or oil products leaves African american hair way to dry and hard. Please purchase this product and write a review!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. My wife and I recently had our first baby, and to our horror, he came out completely bald. It was heart-breaking-- a parent&#x27;s worst nightmare. We still loved him, but we weren&#x27;t ready for a special needs child. Luckily, our midwife turned us onto Baby Don&#x27;t Be Bald. We&#x27;ve been rubbing Crispin&#x27;s head with this for three months, and believe it or not, he&#x27;s growing hair. It&#x27;s a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if we can just find something to make him taller.</li>
            <li> Hair is growing waves are on swim!</li>
            <li> not worth the money&lt;br /&gt;Your baby&#x27;s hair will grow in after a few years, just wait it out, it&#x27;ll grow in ;)</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle for babies, which are, of course, miracles themselves. Often bald miracles, but miracles anyway. I guarantee you if you start slathering up your baby&#x27;s noggin with this goop, consistently, for months, at the end of it, your baby will have more hair than when you started. Your baby will also be a little taller and will weigh more.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever had the heartbreak of psoriasis, you likely know the pain and agony that being bald can cause in your newborn.  Even though he or she hasn&#x27;t formed words yet, has no true perception of self image or what beauty is... they still know the meaning of a spiteful glance when they see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has been a Godsend.  The key to it&#x27;s proper use is CONSISTENCY and POTENCY.  You should slather your baby&#x27;s head with this at least Five times per day, and only the TRIPLE STRENGTH will do.  If you use regular or double strength, you might as well be throwing your money down the drain and waiting in vain for your baby&#x27;s hair to grow in naturally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We start as soon as our baby wakes up, applying the &amp;#34;Baby Don&#x27;t Be Bald&amp;#34; with a spackling knife.  ( We have filed down the edges very carefully, so as not to cause any scalp damage)  Then we don a rubber bathing cap to hold it on, this also doubles as a baldness hiding device.  We&#x27;ve heard that other parents like to put a wig over the bathing cap while waiting for the real thing,  we ourselves used a variety of male affirming hats for our son...whatever makes you as a parent feel better and conceals your shame is the key.  After applying the cap and whatever accessory you choose, it&#x27;s important to play classical music to stimulate the hair follicles.  In case you&#x27;re wondering, they seem to prefer Beethoven&#x27;s fifth symphony, which was clearly written about the grand entrance of a hair follicle sprouting through the skin of a child experiencing infantile pattern baldness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We follow with another treatment at breakfast, lunch, dinner and bedtime.  You have to be committed to your child&#x27;s hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our son now looks a lot like Carrot Top, not just his beautiful, bright ginger curls, but also his expression.  ( I am guessing it&#x27;s a side effect of the loud classical music).  He has fantastic self esteem and a zany sense of humor. Even though he has hair, he still loves to wear hats, his father and I think he has a future in show business.  Thanks Baby Don&#x27;t Be Bald!o wear hats, his father and I think he has a future in show business.  Thanks Baby Don&#x27;t Be Bald!</li>
            <li> I use on my little ones hair at least 4-5 times weekly. Although its a bit greasy. It does the job. I have recently started my five month old niece using the line as well.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had this product for just over a month. I am using it on my toddler, who still has sparse spots that never quite grew in. We&#x27;re working on growing her hair out in time for kdg. My husband and I have noticed a difference since we started using this product. I rub it directly onto her scalp and hair, every day. The downfall to this product is it&#x27;s SUPER greasy!!! Moreso than anything I&#x27;ve ever used! Sometimes I&#x27;ll use baby don&#x27;t be bald on her scalp, and a different moisturizer actual hair to get the curls conditioned, because the bdbb is so overly greasy. If I use it before bedtime, I usually put a towel on her pillow to protect her pillowcase. Anyway, it could be our imagination, but it totally seems like this is working so far. Her hair looks thicker and fuller. We&#x27;ll continue to use and I will update my review with future results, but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Great size for the price. I have used this in the past and can&#x27;t believe the price for the size. Very beat deal and great product. It really does work</li>
            <li> I purchased the whole line of products shampoo condition leave in and hair grease...over 6 things..&lt;br /&gt;My hair did not improve it became worst... Shed everyday .. I stopped using after a month... I hope my hair gets back to normal.... Smh</li>
            <li> We noticed results using this product fairly quickly. Our toddler had areas of thin spots in her hair. Her hair is thick all over now.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. Have been applying this to little Abigail&#x27;s head for just over three months and now she has a full, wavy beard all the way down to her Pampers! We tried feeding it to her as well, but she still prefers mashed apple and banana.</li>
            <li> When it arrived it was grease all over the place in my mailbox. It had melted on the way here... Besides that, so far so good</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months now and there is hair growth!  YAY!!!  I was a bit skeptical initially, but this was highly recommeded and the ingredients are all GOOD!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!! It was actually given to me by my sister in law. She loved it and wanted me to try it out. I began using it when my daughter was about 18 months. Her entire scalp was covered with hair that was so curly and soft, and because of the length, I couldn&#x27;t do anything with it. No hairstyle would hold because her hair would just curl right up. After a few months I noticed that her hair had grown considerably. Now she is 28 months and I can do whatever style I like. It is still really curly but because it is much longer the styles hold better.</li>
            <li> I used this on my one year old daughter. I wanted to write a review after I&#x27;ve used it for sometime. My daughter is two and still bald. Maybe it works for other but it didn&#x27;t work for my daughter. Plus it stinks to me. I started using just for me moisturizer and her hair started to grow. It&#x27;s crazy because just for me wasn&#x27;t for her hair to grow, it was just to keep her hair moisturized. So basically, your child hair will grow when it&#x27;s ready!</li>
            <li> Kids hair is growing like a weed.  Have to attribute it to this product.  it is a pretty thick balm and does not easily dissolve into her hair or scalp.  Leaves it looking like she has gray hair and i just wipe off the access.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for my childs hair as well as my own. My curls are loose and neat when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> I initially purchased this for my two year old daughter&#x27;s hair; however, I decided to test it out on my hair first. I put it on my edges every day for about four weeks and saw fullness. works great in my daughter&#x27;s hair too</li>
            <li> I like it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s to greasy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think it was possible but I swear there is some hair growth going on. This stuff works.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used long enough to see results</li>
            <li> Came on time. Hairstylist recommended it to me and also used it on my edges which I have had a problem growing back for YEARS , and I now have egdes so I was anxious  to order.  Do not hesitate to buy . Im happy.</li>
            <li> I like the way it  goes on so far.My hair is thinning in front like my mothers used to.My old age,no I am only 48 but hopefuly this will stop it from breaking.My twin daughters use it on their daughters and love it.Time will tell,I will keep you posted.</li>
            <li> I love Baby don&#x27;t be bald; I&#x27;ve bought it several times, and will buy again.</li>
            <li> The product works well for my girls&#x27; hair and does not dry out quickly. Be careful to not use too much because it can be a challenging washing all of it out.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a change or improvement to my hair.  I purchased this product based on a review I read so it may work for some people.</li>
