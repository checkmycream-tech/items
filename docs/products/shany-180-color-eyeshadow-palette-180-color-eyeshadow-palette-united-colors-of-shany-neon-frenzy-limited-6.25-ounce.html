            <li>I read the reviews before I bought it and honestly was a bit scared with my purchase</li>
            <li>The price is also a good deal :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really loving this palette.</li>

            <li>Great palette with lots of fun colors!</li>
            <li>The quality of this eyeshadow kit is great, all items came without any issues, none of the colors were cracked in any way, was wrapped in bubble wrap,I would highly recommend this product as it is a great value</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li>I keep buying cool stuff from these people and im always so happy</li>

            <li>Comes off easy goes on easy looks great</li>
            <li>Best eye shadow ive owned so far</li>
            <li>There were pictures of shadows completely demolished and cracked all over the place, however I received mine with everything perfectly in tact!</li>
            <li>The palette had Styrofoam surrounding it in it&#x27;s own box, and then there was more bubble wrap after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving how many colors are in this set.</li>
            <li>but when you are getting 180 for $30 you can&#x27;t expect more with this kind of quality.  </li>
            <li>By far the best eyeshadow i have used.</li>
            <li>I needed some wild colors for a bachelorette party and this is perfect.</li>
            <li>As a budding makeup artist, I find these are the best colors to have in any makeup kit!</li>
            <li>The colors are very eye catching and beautiful.</li>
            <li>COME TRUE!!</li>
            <li>Loved it so much !!!</li>
            <li>i wouldl greatly appreciate if amazon would make this right somehow.</li>
            <li>I love love love these eye shadows!</li>
            <li>So many choices, and the colors blend very well --- perfect if you like the bright colors, and still perfect if you want to tone down some of the brights by blending with more neutral colors.</li>
            <li>Over all if your needing a good starting point to venture into experimenting with eye looks this is the ideal purchase.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t the most secure in shipping, so if you want bright colors</li>
            <li>These are bold and very colorful eyeshadows, but they are gorgeous!</li>
            <li>I took pictures as I unpacked it just to be safe, but the seller made the exchange process very easy.</li>
            <li>Everything was in perfect condition, no cracks in the eye shadows, maybe a bit of fall out but nothing too major.</li>
            <li>Happy camper;)</li>
            <li>I also swatch some of the colors and they are beautiful and puck up very well.</li>
            <li>All the colors are beautiful and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I needed a good neon palette for awhile and came arcoss this one for such a good buy!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love the vibrant colors in this set, so many wonderful choices to pick from, it has been used many times for my nieces graduations &amp; proms, love it 💋</li>
            <li>is my first time trying any SHANY product and I am one happy customer :)</li>
            <li>I found that a good primer fixes this issue if you want bold lines, while a medium primer allows for maximum blending,</li>
            <li>I personally love bright and bold colors over neutral ones, so I absolutely love this pallet.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful and decently pigmented.</li>
            <li>ALL THE COLORS ARE VERY VERY VERY PIGMENTED!!!</li>
            <li>i really love the colors they are so beautiful and vibrant.</li>

            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how incredibly pigmented these shadows are.  </li>
            <li>I love all the colors and the intensity</li>
            <li>and i love the way they feel on my eyes.</li>
            <li>I will buy more from this company</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the variety of the product.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works better if you use a primer before applying the shadow.</li>
            <li>boy am i glad i did...</li>
            <li>There needs to be some better way of getting this to customers.</li>
            <li>I will not be purchasing any more Shany products, and will gladly tell others not to.</li>
            <li>This is such a great buy!</li>

            <li>I knew it was going to have plenty of colors, but each pallet I opened, I was more amazed.</li>
            <li>This palette is way more pigmented and saturated in color.</li>

            <li>I will definately purchase more shany cosmetics.</li>
            <li>Shany&#x27;s eye shadows are fantastic!</li>
            <li>even the light pinks show up on me!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect palette if you like experimenting with different eye looks!</li>

            <li>I am hooked on Shany eyeshadows and will purchase more...</li>
            <li>I just received my shadow palette and i love it.  </li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>After reading so many reviews on this product I was worried to get this product through amazon because of the shipping and how so many people have received their products with cracks, so I bought it through the company website itself.</li>
            <li>I would not suggest this for those who don&#x27;t want their eyeshadow to stand out since their aren&#x27;t that many neutral or \\&quot;naked\\&quot; colors.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone who loves to experiment with colors, and even though I love getting my products through amazon, I would recommend getting it through the company because they make sure their products are handled with care.</li>
            <li>It proves you don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune for good product.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I love the case</li>
            <li>Most durable eye makeup everrrrr</li>
            <li>I absolutely love all the colors that came with it.</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li>This palette gives you more choices.</li>
            <li>but I believe that&#x27;s ok since each color is the size of a penny.  </li>
            <li>would recommend this to anyone who loves makeup because you can create so many looks with it.</li>
            <li>there are soo many varieties of colors</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I will def be buying more pallets as Christmas gifts.</li>

            <li>Love my item.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>but I do have to say that the packging has to be done better</li>
            <li>perfect for the current neon trend.</li>

            <li>Well, it seems Amazon listened to its customers and started packaging the box a bit better.</li>
            <li>she runs her own beauty salon and loved this so much</li>
            <li>Soo many beautiful vivid colors to wear.</li>
            <li>it is very useful!</li>
            <li>Great make up, came to us in perfect shape, no broken colors, and it has lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li>I really love this pallet because I like the uncommon colors, like reds and oranges, which this includes, along with all the normal colors everyone else wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and the shadows go on great without having to use a ton to stand out.</li>
            <li>when i ordered it it came in perfect condition non of the eye shadows were mess up and the colors are amazing.</li>
            <li>, these are pretty good for there price and</li>
            <li>so I think it&#x27;s a pretty good deal.</li>
            <li>Thanks :o)</li>

            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>Worth the money!!</li>
            <li>Being a person who indulges in bright &amp;#34;rockstar&amp;#34; eye makeup I purchased this for the fact it seemed like multiple variations of brightly pigmented shadows.</li>
            <li>and this pallet helps you create those super trendy looks.</li>
            <li>I will STRONGLY recommend this product to anyone...give it a try. :-)</li>
            <li>course, these shadows will need you to have a Good set of brushes, which Shaney does make for a more than reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The colors look great and nothing was broken, best part was it came on time.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did because they came just fine</li>
            <li>They are smooth rich colors that can hold there own on your eyes.</li>
            <li>I recieved my palette with no dust and no broken pots, and was completely ecstatic to see how beautiful and bright it truely was.!</li>
            <li>I use many different brands and I can say this eyeshadow is as good as Sleek and my favorite Emani!</li>

            <li>Easy to blend.</li>

            <li>the colors in this palette are so bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The colours stay and are easy to blend.</li>
            <li>:) There&#x27;s no flaw with the cool, warm, or bright eyeshadows except for the double effect shadows.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re highly pigmented, incredibly good quality.  </li>
            <li>it was wrapped in bubble wrap and packaged very nicely, and when i opened it a couple of the pods where cracked and fallen out, so i sent it back and got a new one which came within 2 days and everything was great.</li>
            <li>IT HAS 180 COLORS FROM BRIGHT NEON COLORS TO SOFT NEUTRAL COLORS!!</li>
            <li>I love the bright colors and there are so many different combinations you can achieve with this pallet!</li>
            <li>just have to put on many layers to get full color.</li>
            <li>I would mix and match more then one color on my eye at once for a cool effect.</li>
            <li>Loving this company so far and definitely plan on ordering more make-up from them!!!!</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best palette you could ever find for this price.</li>

            <li>Amazing colors, very high definition.</li>
            <li>I suggest using this with a primer of some kind, most pallette eyeshadows don&#x27;t hold up to natural eye oils (which is no fault of the eyeshadow -</li>

            <li>I use brushes to apply makeup and the colors spread on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, i was thinking it would be cheap and flimsy because of the price, but that&#x27;s not the case here.</li>
            <li>This is such a great investment for any makeup lover.</li>
            <li>Fantastic colors</li>

            <li>this palette is great because it has a variety of colors for a great price, however I noticed that when I. put on some some eyeshadow it didn&#x27;t show up as strong as my other whites from other palettes, it&#x27;s also a bit more powdery than I&#x27;m use to</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product is so vibrant !!</li>
            <li>Overall great product and an incredible price for such high quality and quantity!</li>
            <li>I ordered mine with an Amazon Prime free trial and chose one day shipping for 3.99 I think, which is SUPER cheap</li>

            <li>/&gt;The colors are rich and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>She has used it for a long time now and has nothing but great  things to say about it.</li>
            <li>I am sure she is having a ball getting all pretty with this set.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that my third palette turned out to be a success</li>
            <li>no primer/light primer for a light day time effect with bold colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone from beginners to professional makeup artists will love this!</li>
            <li>I can transfer them too as to not bother the other beautiful shades.</li>
            <li>Smooth not powdery like other brands, colors are vibrant and the casing was great!!</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t need anything else, and the mirror is nice and big, I love it!</li>
            <li>They last and stay bright with no fading.</li>
            <li>pigments are great and there is a wide range of colours on the palette.</li>
            <li>Great for drag Queens, even haunted</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t love the colors so much, I would probably return it and hope for a replacement that is intact, but I&#x27;m also worried that it would just happen again.</li>
            <li>Now the product itself is wonderful, some people complained about the quality, but I don&#x27;t know why?</li>
            <li>Color is true and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Very compact way to have so many colors in one place.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this palette.</li>
            <li>This is a really affordable pallet, it has all the colors that you can use to create many looks with.  </li>
            <li>This is such a good one.</li>
            <li>It has so many colors to choose from and they stay on very well (although, I do use eyeshadow primer).</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant, however, when I read most of the reviews saying their product was damaged.  </li>
            <li>when my mom came to visit and tried this on after hearing my wife rave about it she loved it too and we bought this second set for her.</li>
            <li>Every color is bright and vivid and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>Colors are very bold and pretty..</li>
            <li>The colors are soooooooooooooooo vibrant and pigmented even on my brown complexion and it works well on really dark complextions as well...very very good product!!!</li>
            <li>Still, the value is great &amp; the shadows are true to color, and that is important to me because I&#x27;m very dark skinned.</li>
            <li>Great colors and blend well to make other shades.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still happy, and not gonna complain too hard.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>THIS PALETTE IS VERY AFFORDABLE AND IS WORTH THE PRICE!!</li>
            <li>i got my set at reasonable time since i live in the virgin islands and when i open the palette it was perfect..</li>
            <li>against my dark porcelain skin l love bold colors looks fab!!!</li>
            <li>This collection has great colors that fit everyday life.  </li>
            <li>Luckily it was just into four chunks that I found in the bottom of the tray</li>
            <li>Super upset.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s packaging tremendously.</li>
            <li>If you like BOLD  colors</li>
            <li>All of the colors are vibrant and stunning when applied, and the sparkle shows well with the glittery and metallic shades.</li>
            <li>The colors are as bold as they appear.</li>
            <li>but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t quickly wipe away with my finger.</li>
            <li>and it came really quick.</li>
            <li>I love all the bright beautiful colors in this palette, and when it arrived at my home it only had 2 of the eyeshadows broken</li>
            <li>beautiful vibrant colors, true to color application and long wearing</li>
            <li>Some of the colours are very bright, they are all smooth &amp; has a silky, soft texture to each of them, they are long lasting, easy to blend &amp; most of all</li>
            <li>Now for the fun stuff... this palette has all your fun colors in one place to create bold and fun eye looks!</li>
            <li>I wiped my finger barely across one color and got AMAZING pigmentation.</li>
            <li>Color is great even with my dark chocolate skin.</li>
            <li>and if I get a full refund I&#x27;ll see if purchasing this again will be worth it.</li>
            <li>You would think that a business who is in the retail business and eats of off what your customers purchase from you would care a little more about keeping their customers happy and coming back, but believe me this company will never receive one more penny from me nor will I recommend this company, and I will let everyone know how crappy they do.</li>
            <li>It arrived well before I expected it, it was wrapped and packaged beautifully, it was in perfect condition when I received it (thank you, Flossy!!!), and it looks like professional makeup kits I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>The pigments stick to the brush easily without leaving excess powder - which is something I really appreciate.</li>
            <li>The case itself is very convenient, functional, and it&#x27;s easy to find the colors your looking for.</li>
            <li>When I first tried it on I was ecstatic!</li>
            <li>I really love the colors to this palette and they look great and last long</li>
            <li>When my palette first came in i was so excited and as soon as i opened the box</li>
            <li>It came on time and I loooooooove it so much!!</li>
            <li>You get all of those eyeshaddows in literally any colour you will ever want orneed for such a cheap price!!</li>
            <li>Pretty colors!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to play more with blending them together for new exciting effects.  </li>
            <li>great selection of colrs, lasts long, and same old good moistured texture  </li>
            <li>the colors are absolutely gorgeous and so vibrant and each one is unique no two colors are the same definitely worth buying</li>
            <li>Wow mind blowing!!!!!</li>
            <li>None of them were as vivid, strong and true as what is included</li>
            <li>I ordered directly from Shany and everything arrived perfectly packaged so many of the reviews that have had broken palettes may find it better to buy direct from Shany&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>A few of the colours were spilled but that didn&#x27;t stop a great experience.</li>
            <li>I gave 3 stars because they are not as bright as I expected</li>
            <li>With this your set can look and feel like you just stepped off a runway after having your makeup done by a professional because this set has so many color options!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>There are some issues with how true they are so experiment on your hand first.</li>
            <li>Despite the many negative reviews that I have read about this product&#x27;s shipping, I was delighted to find that Amazon seems to have improved</li>
            <li>But to my luck everything was perfect none were broken.</li>
            <li>Love all the greens and pink my fAvorite two colors.</li>
            <li>but it is was worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li>This product could cost $60 and it would still be worth it.</li>
            <li>This palette is so colorful and a girl could have this forever.</li>
            <li>but this by far is my favorite plus</li>
            <li>Fun colors.</li>
            <li>also it came in perfect condition not one eyeshadow was broken not even cracked.</li>
            <li>It came and it was perfect nothing broken at all.</li>
            <li>i just liked the different color option</li>
            <li>When I got the eye shadow kit it was perfect as none of the colours were broken nor was the kit itself damaged.</li>
            <li>Its a fun pallet</li>
            <li>It was worth it for the price and quality.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadow are pigmented and colorful.</li>
            <li>I give this a 5 star rating because it is worth buying again..</li>
            <li>Other than that, the colors are nice but only if you like bright colors.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this item if you love fun colorful looks!</li>
            <li>So I did what any normal girl would do: I sat at my computer and prayed that no issues would happen!!!  </li>
            <li>It would be a great gift because it&#x27;s very affordable and the quality is comparable to other branded makeup.</li>
            <li>It came in super fast!</li>
            <li>When I got it it was handled with great care and there was not a single crack and there was not a single issue.</li>
            <li>I honestly love this Palette more than any other ones i have right now.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied with this product and I will most definitely buy again if I ever run out.</li>
            <li>and I NEVER got it, so I contacted amazon and they shipped me another one right away no questions asked.</li>
            <li>and it got here right on time,</li>
            <li>and it fell right off now</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s right up my ally.</li>
            <li>One of the plastic windows popped out but I was able to super glue that back in no problem.</li>
            <li>Absolutely in love every last color is super pigmented.</li>
            <li>this pallet is amazing, so many colors for such a low price</li>
            <li>It was a great deal and everyday is a adventure in eyeshadow!</li>
            <li>it has soooo many different shades for the ones that love loud eyeshadow even those who like to keep it neutral.</li>
            <li>this is the first palette I think was actually worth buying....</li>
            <li>Was in-tact and the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li>ALL of the colors are rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li>The new one I got was absolutely perfect, not a single cracked color, all as expected.</li>
            <li>This set has 180 colors and while each one may be rather small, around the size of a nickel, it also takes a whole lot less to apply to my eyes for them to stay bright and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I think that they should put fragile on the box so the shipping people can be nice and gentle.</li>
            <li>The colors go on bold without having to use much powder.</li>
            <li>I will pay a few dollars more for safe products that go around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I used to be very into doing makeup and being wild and creative with it, but as the years went by</li>
            <li>/&gt;Colors are super pigmented and blend really really well.</li>
            <li>Very vibrant and pretty!</li>
            <li>Granted I am very fair skinned so this might not show up the same on other skin tones as well</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li>I was very very upset when I applied this product to myself</li>
            <li>delivery processes was very fast, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t pay very much for this palette either</li>
            <li>I ordered this after having ordered a huge MAC palette, which I usually wear, but I find that I use this palette WAY MORE!</li>
            <li>it was delivered broken, but I took a chance because I heard the product was very good</li>
            <li>Vibrant colors, shiny metallics, brilliant long lasting shades.</li>
            <li>This product is a very good investment for professional and amateur make-up artists.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product! !</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t call you back because I had a flight, but its ok</li>
            <li>Absolutely!</li>
            <li>the next one is much better.</li>
            <li>but this really is!</li>
            <li>I love all the colors especially the neon colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are so pretty and pigmented.</li>
            <li>Too many of the same colors.</li>
            <li>I wish they had more different colors.</li>
            <li>I really love the vast amount of colors in this palette.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li>I have some pretty visible veins without coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>seeing that it was my first and alot of ppl</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more shany products in the future. :)</li>
            <li>could have asked for a more extensive array of colors.</li>
            <li>It has so many different colors</li>
            <li>like i said its my first palette although i have lots of experience with shadows and color</li>
            <li>Has so many different colors.</li>
            <li>COMPLETELY HASSLE FREE.</li>
            <li>She loves that there are so many different choices</li>
            <li>Well first time ever that I buy makeup online</li>
            <li>and really I don&#x27;t have a complaint about it because it has all this beautiful colors in it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the colour options as they give different shades and variety.</li>
            <li>double secure with alot of bubble wrapping inside non of my eyeshadows where broken or cracked amazon did an awesome job in delivering my package</li>
            <li>This is the first time i bought shany products...</li>
            <li>What you see is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li>When I first opened up this pallet it was like a gift that kept on giving.</li>
            <li>and once the top layer wears out there&#x27;s another row next and</li>
            <li>I really suggest checking these out!</li>
            <li>I love using different colors when applying make up</li>
            <li>NO BROKEN SHADOWS!  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, anyone else that orders it will have the same luck! :)</li>
            <li>First it is sooo hard to find bright and bold colors of eyeshadow in the stores.</li>
            <li>But I have high hope that the problem will be resolved quickly an efficiency.</li>
            <li>And most amazing of all, these shadows last and your look doesn&#x27;t fade as with some other pigment shadows.</li>
            <li>It was actually much bigger than I had thought after reading some of the reviews and appeared to be in perfect condition, but upon closer inspection I found that a pretty dusty rose colored eyeshadow on the very last pallet had popped out in shipping.</li>
            <li>I was worried about purchasing because of some previous reviews and to be completely honest they were right.</li>
            <li>It only takes a little dab with one of my brushes to do almost both of my eyes and the color shows up incredibly well.</li>
            <li>This is why I gave it two stars: 2ndthe first layer looked great, but I opened the first right panel and found that it didn&#x27;t connect, it was broken:</li>
            <li>I was so worried when i ordered this cause of some reviews about the shipping, but i my amazing 180 eyeshadow color palette brand Shany came in 3 days early, in a box with about 7 feet of bubble wrap, wrapped around it and when i finally got the bubble wrap off there</li>
            <li>It has good pigment in it only draw back</li>
            <li>I am delighted to say that I was NOT disappointed in the least bit!</li>
            <li>Either one is probably enough on its own, but I think the potion primer is to die for, but I like the natural background color of the Nyx one -</li>
            <li>Make sure you open the very bottom level of shadows, because, guess what?</li>
            <li>The box is very convenient for storage since it comes with so many colors, yet its not to big.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and the product is even better in person if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li>Colors are highly pigmented,none were cracked upon arrival and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li>When I viewed this product online, the super loud colors screamed my name!</li>
            <li>positive u need to work on getting the gift to customers without ruining merchandise</li>
            <li>I also usually have to reapply my eyeshadow throughout the day with other brands, but this stayed on and stayed just as bright and beautiful all day long.</li>
            <li>Love it and the color&#x27;s lost so long</li>
            <li>This set is just as good as Mac if not better.</li>
            <li>So overall review, beautiful high pigment colors, I would say as potent as Mac, I even put a swatch of gold mine and an almost identical color on my wrist and by the end of the day both were going strong,, but the durability of box and shadows were truly a disappointment.</li>
            <li>Wow goes on easy and smooth , and lasts long.</li>
            <li>I have fun mixing the colours &amp; trying new looks on myself and on friends.</li>
            <li>ok or atleast not for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li>The pigments in this palette were okay, not good, not terrible,</li>
            <li>The colors are bright, and long lasting.</li>
            <li>Some kind of pretty green all over the place.</li>
            <li>The pigments of the makeup are very vibrant and rich throughout all of the colors, I would say they are easily comparable to MAC, HIP, or Bare Minerals, and at only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>so i&#x27;m happy and hoping for the same results with other purchases!</li>
            <li>It comes in a large a ray for matte and shimmery colors.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and very high in pigment!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously amazed...and excited! :-)</li>
            <li>The neutral shades are limited, but there&#x27;s a huge selection of fun colors.</li>
            <li>they are so vibrant!</li>
            <li>very high pigmented.</li>
            <li>Very high quality eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>This pallet is fine for every day work and errands and a teen or college student would really like it.</li>
            <li>if you were to buy a cheap palette for a younger girl for the price you cant complain too much though.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s what I really like.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t see me reaching for it much.</li>
            <li>fast shipping from amazon.</li>
            <li>Very pigmented.</li>
            <li>They show up really well.</li>
            <li>and I managed to fit it back together like a puzzle.</li>
            <li>Blends well and is very customizable to every need.</li>
            <li>I received it fast and every thing was bubble wrapped so nothing was shattered.</li>
            <li>I can tell they really tried to protect it though.  </li>
            <li>I was under the impression it would show very well.  </li>
            <li>Almost like there wasn&#x27;t much on my brush.  </li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t showing very well on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I gave it one star because the colors are very prettty...</li>
            <li>I wish that I could write a glowing review but the packaging really failed.had</li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>I really like this kit</li>
            <li>The product itself was free to move around the package because the box it came in was WAY too big.</li>
            <li>Not a speck of eye-shadow out of place, very well packaged.</li>
            <li>Really pigmented lots of colors a couple doubles</li>
            <li>My case arrived 100% intact without so much as a crack.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about makeup</li>
            <li>Baught this for a friend, I sent it as a gift I had no idea how it would show up much to my amazement</li>
            <li>My friend absolutely loves the palette.  </li>
            <li>and she likes so much</li>
            <li>I feel like a real diva.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and not one pastel was damaged.</li>
            <li>i will give it one Star for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Mine was packaged very well with no breaks or problems.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li>It was very well protected.</li>
            <li>I really wish i did not need this item for a vacation that i am taking because i would sooo return it.</li>
            <li>i really luv the product but just think that the shipping needs to be rethought.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pigmented (as everyone admits) &amp; you cannot beat  the price.</li>
            <li>These shadows are very pigmented as well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any from this brand!</li>
            <li>I really like the colors/pigment, I&#x27;m still a beginner and learning to use it.</li>
            <li>I know were supposed to write about this product on behalf of amazon, but I really wanted to write a review for this product even though I didn&#x27;t get it through amazon.</li>
            <li>thank you so much.</li>
            <li>NO BROKEN SHADOWS ECT.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend absolutely loves this makeup set.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I recommend this palette to anyone who wants neon eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>have to admit i was not dissappointed at all even though i was ready for it</li>
            <li>This eye shadow really works.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks again and can&#x27;t wait to buy again.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to get this product</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>And came fast.</li>
            <li>just a few warm colors</li>
            <li>I shall be ordering more of these products in the near future</li>
            <li>I have a 44 color palette from ELF, and I have Naked 2 from Urban Decay, but I can honestly say I don&#x27;t need them now.</li>
            <li>I also love the case they come in which keeps them relatively safe, although one of my blues on the lowest palette was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li>Used it for the first time today and the color pay-off is amazing, but they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li>Point being, the colors are so pure and so vibrant.</li>
            <li>I had to send the original one back.</li>
            <li>I actually love this palette the possibilities are endless when i received mine</li>
            <li>, i read many other reviews</li>
            <li>/&gt;Their durability on the skin (how long they last) is a bit to be desired, but if your just starting out (or experienced), you should already have a Primer for your skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s original packaging, but bubble wrapped as well inside a bigger box.  </li>
            <li>So many colors endless ideas...</li>
            <li>The eye shadows are very pigmented and vibrant.</li>
            <li>show up very well and vibrant.</li>
            <li>im not super concerned, colors still went on smoothly and were pretty!</li>
            <li>Thanks for high quality product.</li>
            <li>There is so much variety in it, and the shadows are long-lasting and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li>I used a wet paper towel to clean it up and pretty much had to go through and \\&quot;detail\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It has Neon&#x27;s, matte finishes, shimmer, finishes, a neutral section of shadows, and a good quality RED shadow as well which is a BIG plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to be buying their brushes and gel liners next!</li>
            <li>The product was packaged beautiful, but I received mine broken!</li>
            <li>consistently sense I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li>get this hands down for top quaility</li>
            <li>Okay now down to the product itself.</li>
            <li>I love &amp; I just purchased 5 of Shany&#x27;s other palettes!</li>
            <li>live in Alaska, and this got here in two days!</li>
            <li>I am a new and up coming make up artist!</li>
            <li>I have paid A LOT less for other eyeshadow palettes I have ordered as gifts and the packaging kept them in great shape</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant,  highly pigmented,  and very soft.  </li>
            <li>I really would like a NEW undamaged one.</li>
            <li>plus, I love to wear black eyeshadow</li>
            <li>This pallet has such fun vibrant colors that really makes me step out of my makeup box.</li>
            <li>Decent colors</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant and i can&#x27;t wait to play in my makeup.</li>
            <li>&amp; They Are Vibrant  </li>
            <li>It stayed vibrant ALL NIGHT (about 6 hours of dancing) without the use of a primer.</li>
            <li>Every color on the pallet was as vibrant as in the picture.</li>
            <li>With or without primer, the eye shadows are vibrant and have staying power for an all day look.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, and packaging was very professional.</li>
            <li>( 3rd then I continued to investigate and found that when I opened the middle section one of the gorgeous, hot pink shadows literally fell out!</li>
            <li>and all my items arrived very well packed and looked so professional!</li>
            <li>I cleaned up the mess and was satisfied with the swatches I did.</li>
            <li>And the one flaw I have found is that when using a thick primer you are going to need a very good eye makeup remover because the pinks (hot pinks) have a tendency to leave a bit of stain (however, I&#x27;m Wednesday Adams pale</li>
            <li>Just be careful you might not be as lucky as me ;)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>The color has a high quality when also apply.</li>
            <li>I have gotten makeup before where the reviews said that it was highly pigmented when it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s so high quality</li>
            <li>I wanted something with high pigment</li>
            <li>I highly recommend all the make up lovers to buy this product.</li>
            <li>As I usually by high end products and pay $15.</li>
            <li>Highly pigmented-</li>
            <li>The pigmentation is so high quality with this palette</li>
            <li>Still reach for this over my high end shadows alot</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>If your like to me and like to paly around with different palate colors this is a great way to learn new and different shades , and mix and have fun with different colors.</li>
            <li>I was extremely nervous because the product had such amazing reviews</li>
            <li>but luckily their was 2 of the same shade , lasts long , would definitely but again ! :)</li>
            <li>The second one arrived the next day and to my great luck it was also a mess.</li>
            <li>Put a little more effort in the packaging tissue, bubble wrap etc.</li>
            <li>It looks like they really fixed the packaging nightmare!!</li>
            <li>Our 11 yr old daughter loves it!!</li>
            <li>They are easily blended with each other to bring your wildest color combos to life.</li>
            <li>It is all intact great colors nothing wrong with the packaging or the product.</li>
            <li>, it stays on the skin for long time (my first use was for a peacock makeup for a belly dancer and it lasted a whole day!</li>
            <li>(once again, just like the picture).&lt;br /&gt;I got this mainly because I wear a lot of black clothes with various,bright colors and wanted a nice range of various colored eyeshadow to match my outfits...</li>
            <li>I was looking for shadows that would be useful for regular makeup as well as fx makeup as well</li>
            <li>and honestly it&#x27;s worth it instead of buying each color individually</li>
            <li>Needed a simple but useful Birthday gift.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love all the colors and the eyeshadow is long lasting</li>
            <li>The four star rating is simply because I have other bright shadows from different makers that seemed to wear brighter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a medium toned African American and the colors show up just fine.</li>
            <li>Pretty vibrant colors that last all day for any occasion.</li>
            <li>I am dark skinned and the color does not last and doesn&#x27;t seem bright enough for me as I hoped it to be.</li>
            <li>The 1st time i got it, about two of the makeup was cracked, had makeup dust everywhere, and it looked already used when i wanted it new.</li>
            <li>Not one shadow broke and I live in Trinidad so it had to go from the seller to Miami then to Trinidad which is alot of movement</li>
            <li>There are no applicators in the package so if this is for a gift for someone new to makeup</li>
            <li>It became new again, so I kept it.</li>
            <li>Main box was filled with that odd mega-bubble stuff.</li>
            <li>So, when I got the urge to get back into things, I went with Shaney products solely because of the price and the vast selection available.</li>
            <li>I have heard that this product was not delivered properly, it was broken before it even shipped, but mine was in great condition.</li>
            <li>These colors are both natural yet vibrant</li>
            <li>I know that some of the reviews said that it was delivered a broken mess but mine came absolutely perfect they must have fixed the shipping problems.</li>
            <li>very professional make up set.</li>
            <li>beight vivid colors</li>
            <li>came two days early!</li>
            <li>I was tempted to buy but being the cautious individual I am, did some research first.  </li>
            <li>I love Shany products and have bought this collection as well as several other products.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>When I first read the reviews on this product I was scared to buy it for the simple fact that I kept reading</li>
            <li>It arrived in prefect condition and a day early!</li>
            <li>he quality of this product FAR exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li>And the Shany Eye Shadows don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>love this kit i use it everyday!</li>
            <li>At first, I was tempted to send it back immediately.</li>
            <li>However, after first opening my shipment and seeing how well packaged it was I decided that it has nothing to do with the shipper, but most likely the shipping company and the fact that with such high amount of pigment and little fillers (which to me is a plus)</li>
            <li>Wow who new that I would be getting all of these colors.</li>
            <li>and they do not show in black light.</li>
            <li>Anyways the eyeshadows in the palette are very soft actually extremely soft</li>
            <li>I got it because I do modeling and it has so many colors that can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li>Yes the white pallet was in 3 chunks but how lucky am I that it was the white??</li>
            <li>I usually use only mac cosmetics and was happily surprised to find the pigment quality with this brand is just as good and last all day.</li>
            <li>The packaging was great, not one single shadow broken.</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how vivid the yellows showed up on my skin, the way the shimmery copper looked absolutely glowing on my complexion and I have never, ever had a truer red shadow.</li>
            <li>original one that I received had a couple of cracked colors, including black - which got destroyed and spread everyyywheeere.</li>
            <li>They really last and the colors are so vibrant!</li>
            <li>I was very happy, like I had won the lottery, when I opened the box and there was not a mess of colorful dust and no colors were broken!!!!</li>
            <li>The color is amazing, but it was almost all broken.</li>
            <li>i was so happy about getting for my friend ( as a gift), but to my disappointment,  sooner i opened the box, the colors felt all over my clothes</li>
            <li>if It wasn&#x27;t broken it would have gotten 5 stars because it is amazing eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>There were also clear plastic covers over the shadows.</li>
            <li>i would not waste your money...</li>
            <li>so i figured the fixed their packaging issue..</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist</li>
            <li>For those panicking about the shipping, they have fixed their problems.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Although the package was greatly wrapped (foam boxing inside the actual retail box along with bubble wrap), I did have one blue pigment that was broken.</li>
            <li>it saved me SOOOO much money from purchasing individual eyeshadow colors.</li>
            <li>, you have straight up sparkly, of all the same color (i.e. matte yellows, glimmer yellows, sparkly/metallic yellows).</li>
            <li>They are very pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, as a disclaimer, I only really use this as supporting colors, or for minor details.</li>
            <li>I should have listened to the reviews about this product as far as what it looked like</li>
            <li>Threw out all my old crappy pallets after a week of using these.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a loud person and sometimes I want my makeup to express that.</li>
            <li>Application is creamy and seamless.</li>
            <li>All parts work properly and the design is very practical and functional.</li>
            <li>All of the youtube reviews stated that the biggest issue was shipping because some colors would be cracked or completely destroyed from handling.</li>
            <li>and they came early but out of the two palettes&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine came bubblewrapped about 15 times, and was completely intact.</li>
            <li>I think that the manufacturer has fixed the shipping since these problems occurred.</li>
            <li>AS MUCH AS THE LAST!</li>
            <li>I was surprised when I opened it.</li>
            <li>Wow.  </li>
            <li>Wow i soo recomend this product.</li>
            <li>My pallet arrived completely intact.</li>
            <li>This is an absolute must have for any makeup user in the entire world!!!</li>
            <li>For brown/dark skinned ladies, as long as you don&#x27;t mind wetting when you want intense color than you should order!</li>
            <li>However, I was pleasantly surprised when i received the package because there was stuffing inside the packaging box to prevent the box of shadows from moving around.</li>
            <li>she said she will even use it professionally.</li>
            <li>Love the variety in blue and green hues</li>
            <li>Overall, you&#x27;ll love the palette and you&#x27;ll find yourself using it everyday because it literally has EVERY color you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li>Wow u got wwwwwwaaay more negative than</li>
            <li>Not bad at all, must use a primer for color to stick and last long, but lots of fall out...</li>
            <li>i love this so much one color came broken</li>
            <li>I do wish that it had a few more matte shadows and a little less of the shimmer ones, but they specified in the description that they&#x27;re would be more shimmers</li>
            <li>Very much worth the $25 I spent!</li>
            <li>and I opened the box, half way expecting it to be in shambles with no protection at all, but they put the big air packets on top and the actual palette was wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>i got my product quickly, but there werre three cracked eyeshadows, one of them being black.</li>
            <li>I was really worried about the reviews I read regarding the item arriving damaged, but I was hoping I&#x27;d be one of the lucky few to receive one that was entirely intact.</li>
            <li>The colors are vibrant they last all day.</li>
            <li>Even without a primer these colors are vibrant and lasting.  </li>
            <li>I voted four stars only because some colors require water to achieve a high definition look.</li>
            <li>The colors are all highly pigmented and last for hours!</li>
            <li>I use a white primer underneath it and it is extremely vivid!</li>
            <li>but it was the only palette I could find that was half way cheap with the colors I wanted.</li>
            <li>These super pigmented colors are my go to for everyday use and for my professional use.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s considerd medium, usually, and sometimes light.  </li>
            <li>so i call up amazon and they shipped me a new palette the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on a serious budget right now and for the first time I can&#x27;t afford all MAC everything...</li>
            <li>well thank goodness because this palette cost as much as one of their individual colors and it&#x27;s the same quality!</li>
            <li>I think that whatever was wrong with the shipping method when those comments were made has been fixed not only because my package was fine, but also the more recent comments from about 2013 on are all good and the bad comments were all made in 2012.</li>
            <li>this is exactly what I wanted and expected!</li>
            <li>A bit shy to order again till the packaging gets better!</li>
            <li>Also another issue is when I first got it i slide the side to get a glimpse of the other colors</li>
            <li>Beautiful, pigmented colors that last all day especially if eyeshadow base is applied first.</li>
            <li>sometimes it is hard for me to find eye shadow that doesn&#x27;t look so cheap and chalky.</li>
            <li>I requested and paid EXTRA for two-day delivery, so I expected a little better handling.</li>
            <li>I knew it was a risk, but i really wanted this palette but to luckily only 4 colors were cracked with minor dusting in the palette.</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t marked fragile or handle with care as it should of been.</li>
            <li>Such a professional feel and look.</li>
            <li>But I did throw away the excess and that pigment is still usable since it was only chipped instead of being destroyed completely.</li>
            <li>That being said, be careful not to drop this palette because the eye shadows are really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much lighter than expected?</li>
            <li>my ten yr old loves it</li>
            <li>This lovely palette arrived completely unblemished without any cracked or broken eye shadows, I didn&#x27;t open the box to find eye shadow all over the packaging like I feared I would, and</li>
            <li>I am 28 now and have only a few times come across shadows this true to color.</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows most of dem were broken up.</li>
            <li>Alot of review said that this item came with several broken palette, mine came perfectly packaged and not a single one broken.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I replaced it, the first time all the little eyeshadows were either completely destroyed or cracked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more tightly packed and less likely to rattle and roll in shipping.</li>
            <li>Unlike other purchasers, my eyeshadow palette was not broken or anything.</li>
            <li>They are very comparable to each other in terms of pigmentation.</li>
            <li>The colors are highly pigmented and long lasting.  </li>
            <li>product blends extremely well and due to the strength of the pigment I am able to use far fewer layers than I typically would.</li>
            <li>The colors are plenty pigmented, not a single shadow or part of the box was cracked/broken when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a beginning makeup artist, and have been using this on clients, and they as well also adore the color selection.</li>
            <li>If I&#x27;m doing a more ridiculous look with dark colors, I&#x27;ll use my normal primers: I do both the potion primer by Urban Decay and a nude eyeshadow primer by Nyx.</li>
            <li>I was fortunate with receiving my order without the contents being broken so as far as that goes</li>
            <li>I got this for halloween, but the colors are so vibrant and every single color choice possible...</li>
            <li>The first issue is that a lot of the little colors fall out when I store them in my closet.</li>
            <li>Was fast and all in one peace but for the price no not worth it</li>
            <li>i read the reviews and noticed the ones who bought it back in oct-dec 2011 all received theirs broken and more of the recent comments</li>
            <li>I highly suggest buying these over any other eye shadow.</li>
            <li>So I opened the palette up, and much to my dismay, it was a mess.</li>
            <li>but you can tell it&#x27;s not good quality as I kept having to clean the makeup from my cheek bones as they kept falling even after I had applied primer.  </li>
            <li>Everything came fine nothing broken.</li>
            <li>in all honesty it&#x27;s a little much for me</li>
            <li>We had a few broken colors but a few drops of rubbing alcohol  and they where good as new the next morning.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my sister as a Christmas present and when she opened the package initially everything looked fine, but when she opened the eyeshadow palette a lot of the colors were broken as if someone had smashed it on the ground or something.</li>
            <li>The good and the bad.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The pigment in these eye shadows is incredible and you should use a concealer on your lid first to prime for best results.</li>
            <li> eyeshadows are easily blended and the color is excellent...</li>
            <li> I began to clean the palette inside out, and whala!!!</li>
            <li> colors are great for summer because they are so bright i&#x27;m in love with them!</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and pigmented.</li>
            <li> Not as bright on skin as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> I use to be scared of bright colors and getting this palette</li>
            <li> These colors are so bright.</li>
            <li> I could believe how bright and pigmented they were.</li>
            <li> it pops up and your rug is now stained with bright eyeshadow colors.</li>
            <li> I was somewhat bummed when I saw that the colors didn&#x27;t have any neon or mega bright shades included.</li>
            <li> So bright.</li>
            <li> The makeup is bright though not as bright as pictured.</li>

            <li> Comes off easy goes on easy looks great</li>
            <li> Best eye shadow ive owned so far</li>
            <li> There were pictures of shadows completely demolished and cracked all over the place, however I received mine with everything perfectly in tact!</li>
            <li> The palette had Styrofoam surrounding it in it&#x27;s own box, and then there was more bubble wrap after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving how many colors are in this set.</li>
            <li> but when you are getting 180 for $30 you can&#x27;t expect more with this kind of quality.  </li>
            <li> By far the best eyeshadow i have used.</li>
            <li> I needed some wild colors for a bachelorette party and this is perfect.</li>
            <li> As a budding makeup artist, I find these are the best colors to have in any makeup kit!</li>
            <li> The colors are very eye catching and beautiful.</li>
            <li> COME TRUE!!</li>
            <li> Loved it so much !!!</li>
            <li> i wouldl greatly appreciate if amazon would make this right somehow.</li>
            <li> I love love love these eye shadows!</li>
            <li> So many choices, and the colors blend very well --- perfect if you like the bright colors, and still perfect if you want to tone down some of the brights by blending with more neutral colors.</li>
            <li> Over all if your needing a good starting point to venture into experimenting with eye looks this is the ideal purchase.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t the most secure in shipping, so if you want bright colors</li>
            <li> These are bold and very colorful eyeshadows, but they are gorgeous!</li>
            <li> I took pictures as I unpacked it just to be safe, but the seller made the exchange process very easy.</li>
            <li> Everything was in perfect condition, no cracks in the eye shadows, maybe a bit of fall out but nothing too major.</li>
            <li> Happy camper;)</li>
            <li> I also swatch some of the colors and they are beautiful and puck up very well.</li>
            <li> All the colors are beautiful and are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I needed a good neon palette for awhile and came arcoss this one for such a good buy!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the vibrant colors in this set, so many wonderful choices to pick from, it has been used many times for my nieces graduations &amp; proms, love it 💋</li>
            <li> is my first time trying any SHANY product and I am one happy customer :)</li>
            <li> I found that a good primer fixes this issue if you want bold lines, while a medium primer allows for maximum blending,</li>
            <li> I personally love bright and bold colors over neutral ones, so I absolutely love this pallet.</li>
            <li> They are beautiful and decently pigmented.</li>
            <li> ALL THE COLORS ARE VERY VERY VERY PIGMENTED!!!</li>
            <li> i really love the colors they are so beautiful and vibrant.</li>
            <li> Vibrant, beautiful, smooth colors!</li>
            <li> The first thing was that the colors were truly amazing, so vibrant and beautiful!</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> I use this pallet for every day and night use I love all the colors.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how incredibly pigmented these shadows are.  </li>
            <li> I love all the colors and the intensity</li>
            <li> and i love the way they feel on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I will buy more from this company</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the variety of the product.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works better if you use a primer before applying the shadow.</li>
            <li> boy am i glad i did...</li>
            <li> There needs to be some better way of getting this to customers.</li>
            <li> I will not be purchasing any more Shany products, and will gladly tell others not to.</li>
            <li> This is such a great buy!</li>
            <li> I have had bought one of the oldest shanyj&#x27;s pallettes \\&quot;48 eyeshadow pallette\\&quot; and I still am satisfied with this product  </li>
            <li> And Once again Im satisfied --&gt;</li>
            <li> The box looks like a chocolate box :)) shick and unigue  </li>
            <li> i figured that was the best they could do but its no big deal.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and ordered more palettes</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I was overall very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This seems to be happening to everyone, so PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check with the seller to see if they have improved their shipping and packaging before you order.</li>
            <li> Not terribly though!  </li>
            <li> I love them</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> the color will stay but pops more with the primer</li>

            <li> I would not suggest this for those who don&#x27;t want their eyeshadow to stand out since their aren&#x27;t that many neutral or \\&quot;naked\\&quot; colors.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone who loves to experiment with colors, and even though I love getting my products through amazon, I would recommend getting it through the company because they make sure their products are handled with care.</li>
            <li> It proves you don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune for good product.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I love the case</li>
            <li> Most durable eye makeup everrrrr</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all the colors that came with it.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE.</li>
            <li> This palette gives you more choices.</li>
            <li> but I believe that&#x27;s ok since each color is the size of a penny.  </li>
            <li> would recommend this to anyone who loves makeup because you can create so many looks with it.</li>
            <li> there are soo many varieties of colors</li>

            <li> I will STRONGLY recommend this product to anyone...give it a try. :-)</li>
            <li> course, these shadows will need you to have a Good set of brushes, which Shaney does make for a more than reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The colors look great and nothing was broken, best part was it came on time.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did because they came just fine</li>

            <li> The colors are beautiful on, especially when applied on top of primer.</li>

            <li> but it&#x27;s nice to have those fun colors.</li>

            <li> the colors in this palette are so bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The colours stay and are easy to blend.</li>
            <li> :) There&#x27;s no flaw with the cool, warm, or bright eyeshadows except for the double effect shadows.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re highly pigmented, incredibly good quality.  </li>
            <li> it was wrapped in bubble wrap and packaged very nicely, and when i opened it a couple of the pods where cracked and fallen out, so i sent it back and got a new one which came within 2 days and everything was great.</li>
            <li> IT HAS 180 COLORS FROM BRIGHT NEON COLORS TO SOFT NEUTRAL COLORS!!</li>
            <li> I love the bright colors and there are so many different combinations you can achieve with this pallet!</li>
            <li> just have to put on many layers to get full color.</li>
            <li> I would mix and match more then one color on my eye at once for a cool effect.</li>
            <li> Loving this company so far and definitely plan on ordering more make-up from them!!!!</li>

            <li> Amazing colors, very high definition.</li>

            <li> I use brushes to apply makeup and the colors spread on smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, i was thinking it would be cheap and flimsy because of the price, but that&#x27;s not the case here.</li>
            <li> This is such a great investment for any makeup lover.</li>

            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t love the colors so much, I would probably return it and hope for a replacement that is intact, but I&#x27;m also worried that it would just happen again.</li>
            <li> Now the product itself is wonderful, some people complained about the quality, but I don&#x27;t know why?</li>

            <li> Very compact way to have so many colors in one place.</li>

            <li> This is such a good one.</li>
            <li> It has so many colors to choose from and they stay on very well (although, I do use eyeshadow primer).</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant, however, when I read most of the reviews saying their product was damaged.  </li>
            <li> when my mom came to visit and tried this on after hearing my wife rave about it she loved it too and we bought this second set for her.</li>
            <li> Every color is bright and vivid and you really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Colors are very bold and pretty..</li>
            <li> The colors are soooooooooooooooo vibrant and pigmented even on my brown complexion and it works well on really dark complextions as well...very very good product!!!</li>
            <li> Still, the value is great &amp; the shadows are true to color, and that is important to me because I&#x27;m very dark skinned.</li>
            <li> Great colors and blend well to make other shades.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still happy, and not gonna complain too hard.  &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> THIS PALETTE IS VERY AFFORDABLE AND IS WORTH THE PRICE!!</li>
            <li> i got my set at reasonable time since i live in the virgin islands and when i open the palette it was perfect..</li>
            <li> against my dark porcelain skin l love bold colors looks fab!!!</li>
            <li> This collection has great colors that fit everyday life.  </li>
            <li> Luckily it was just into four chunks that I found in the bottom of the tray</li>
            <li> Super upset.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s packaging tremendously.</li>
            <li> If you like BOLD  colors</li>
            <li> All of the colors are vibrant and stunning when applied, and the sparkle shows well with the glittery and metallic shades.</li>
            <li> The colors are as bold as they appear.</li>
            <li> but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t quickly wipe away with my finger.</li>
            <li> and it came really quick.</li>
            <li> I love all the bright beautiful colors in this palette, and when it arrived at my home it only had 2 of the eyeshadows broken</li>
            <li> beautiful vibrant colors, true to color application and long wearing</li>
            <li> Some of the colours are very bright, they are all smooth &amp; has a silky, soft texture to each of them, they are long lasting, easy to blend &amp; most of all</li>
            <li> Now for the fun stuff... this palette has all your fun colors in one place to create bold and fun eye looks!</li>
            <li> I wiped my finger barely across one color and got AMAZING pigmentation.</li>
            <li> Color is great even with my dark chocolate skin.</li>
            <li> and if I get a full refund I&#x27;ll see if purchasing this again will be worth it.</li>
            <li> You would think that a business who is in the retail business and eats of off what your customers purchase from you would care a little more about keeping their customers happy and coming back, but believe me this company will never receive one more penny from me nor will I recommend this company, and I will let everyone know how crappy they do.</li>
            <li> It arrived well before I expected it, it was wrapped and packaged beautifully, it was in perfect condition when I received it (thank you, Flossy!!!), and it looks like professional makeup kits I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> The pigments stick to the brush easily without leaving excess powder - which is something I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> The case itself is very convenient, functional, and it&#x27;s easy to find the colors your looking for.</li>
            <li> When I first tried it on I was ecstatic!</li>
            <li> I really love the colors to this palette and they look great and last long</li>
            <li> When my palette first came in i was so excited and as soon as i opened the box</li>
            <li> It came on time and I loooooooove it so much!!</li>
            <li> You get all of those eyeshaddows in literally any colour you will ever want orneed for such a cheap price!!</li>
            <li> Pretty colors!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to play more with blending them together for new exciting effects.  </li>
            <li> great selection of colrs, lasts long, and same old good moistured texture  </li>
            <li> the colors are absolutely gorgeous and so vibrant and each one is unique no two colors are the same definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> Wow mind blowing!!!!!</li>
            <li> None of them were as vivid, strong and true as what is included</li>
            <li> I ordered directly from Shany and everything arrived perfectly packaged so many of the reviews that have had broken palettes may find it better to buy direct from Shany&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> A few of the colours were spilled but that didn&#x27;t stop a great experience.</li>
            <li> I gave 3 stars because they are not as bright as I expected</li>
            <li> With this your set can look and feel like you just stepped off a runway after having your makeup done by a professional because this set has so many color options!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> There are some issues with how true they are so experiment on your hand first.</li>
            <li> Despite the many negative reviews that I have read about this product&#x27;s shipping, I was delighted to find that Amazon seems to have improved</li>
            <li> But to my luck everything was perfect none were broken.</li>
            <li> Love all the greens and pink my fAvorite two colors.</li>
            <li> but it is was worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li> This product could cost $60 and it would still be worth it.</li>
            <li> This palette is so colorful and a girl could have this forever.</li>
            <li> but this by far is my favorite plus</li>
            <li> Fun colors.</li>
            <li> also it came in perfect condition not one eyeshadow was broken not even cracked.</li>
            <li> It came and it was perfect nothing broken at all.</li>
            <li> i just liked the different color option</li>
            <li> When I got the eye shadow kit it was perfect as none of the colours were broken nor was the kit itself damaged.</li>
            <li> Its a fun pallet</li>
            <li> It was worth it for the price and quality.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadow are pigmented and colorful.</li>
            <li> I give this a 5 star rating because it is worth buying again..</li>
            <li> Other than that, the colors are nice but only if you like bright colors.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this item if you love fun colorful looks!</li>
            <li> So I did what any normal girl would do: I sat at my computer and prayed that no issues would happen!!!  </li>
            <li> It would be a great gift because it&#x27;s very affordable and the quality is comparable to other branded makeup.</li>
            <li> It came in super fast!</li>
            <li> When I got it it was handled with great care and there was not a single crack and there was not a single issue.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this Palette more than any other ones i have right now.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied with this product and I will most definitely buy again if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> and I NEVER got it, so I contacted amazon and they shipped me another one right away no questions asked.</li>
            <li> and it got here right on time,</li>
            <li> and it fell right off now</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s right up my ally.</li>
            <li> One of the plastic windows popped out but I was able to super glue that back in no problem.</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love every last color is super pigmented.</li>
            <li> this pallet is amazing, so many colors for such a low price</li>
            <li> It was a great deal and everyday is a adventure in eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> it has soooo many different shades for the ones that love loud eyeshadow even those who like to keep it neutral.</li>
            <li> this is the first palette I think was actually worth buying....</li>
            <li> Was in-tact and the colors are very vibrant!</li>
            <li> ALL of the colors are rich and vibrant.</li>
            <li> The new one I got was absolutely perfect, not a single cracked color, all as expected.</li>
            <li> This set has 180 colors and while each one may be rather small, around the size of a nickel, it also takes a whole lot less to apply to my eyes for them to stay bright and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I think that they should put fragile on the box so the shipping people can be nice and gentle.</li>
            <li> The colors go on bold without having to use much powder.</li>
            <li> I will pay a few dollars more for safe products that go around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I used to be very into doing makeup and being wild and creative with it, but as the years went by</li>
            <li> /&gt;Colors are super pigmented and blend really really well.</li>
            <li> Very vibrant and pretty!</li>
            <li> Granted I am very fair skinned so this might not show up the same on other skin tones as well</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much.</li>
            <li> I was very very upset when I applied this product to myself</li>
            <li> delivery processes was very fast, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t pay very much for this palette either</li>
            <li> I ordered this after having ordered a huge MAC palette, which I usually wear, but I find that I use this palette WAY MORE!</li>
            <li> it was delivered broken, but I took a chance because I heard the product was very good</li>
            <li> Vibrant colors, shiny metallics, brilliant long lasting shades.</li>
            <li> This product is a very good investment for professional and amateur make-up artists.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product! !</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t call you back because I had a flight, but its ok</li>
            <li> Absolutely!</li>
            <li> the next one is much better.</li>
            <li> but this really is!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors especially the neon colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are so pretty and pigmented.</li>
            <li> Too many of the same colors.</li>
            <li> I wish they had more different colors.</li>
            <li> I really love the vast amount of colors in this palette.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting for the price.</li>
            <li> I have some pretty visible veins without coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seeing that it was my first and alot of ppl</li>
            <li> I will definitely be buying more shany products in the future. :)</li>
            <li> could have asked for a more extensive array of colors.</li>
            <li> It has so many different colors</li>
            <li> like i said its my first palette although i have lots of experience with shadows and color</li>
            <li> Has so many different colors.</li>
            <li> COMPLETELY HASSLE FREE.</li>
            <li> She loves that there are so many different choices</li>
            <li> Well first time ever that I buy makeup online</li>
            <li> and really I don&#x27;t have a complaint about it because it has all this beautiful colors in it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the colour options as they give different shades and variety.</li>
            <li> double secure with alot of bubble wrapping inside non of my eyeshadows where broken or cracked amazon did an awesome job in delivering my package</li>
            <li> This is the first time i bought shany products...</li>
            <li> What you see is exactly what you get.</li>
            <li> When I first opened up this pallet it was like a gift that kept on giving.</li>
            <li> and once the top layer wears out there&#x27;s another row next and</li>
            <li> I really suggest checking these out!</li>
            <li> I love using different colors when applying make up</li>
            <li> NO BROKEN SHADOWS!  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, anyone else that orders it will have the same luck! :)</li>
            <li> First it is sooo hard to find bright and bold colors of eyeshadow in the stores.</li>
            <li> But I have high hope that the problem will be resolved quickly an efficiency.</li>
            <li> And most amazing of all, these shadows last and your look doesn&#x27;t fade as with some other pigment shadows.</li>
            <li> It was actually much bigger than I had thought after reading some of the reviews and appeared to be in perfect condition, but upon closer inspection I found that a pretty dusty rose colored eyeshadow on the very last pallet had popped out in shipping.</li>
            <li> I was worried about purchasing because of some previous reviews and to be completely honest they were right.</li>
            <li> It only takes a little dab with one of my brushes to do almost both of my eyes and the color shows up incredibly well.</li>
            <li> This is why I gave it two stars: 2ndthe first layer looked great, but I opened the first right panel and found that it didn&#x27;t connect, it was broken:</li>
            <li> I was so worried when i ordered this cause of some reviews about the shipping, but i my amazing 180 eyeshadow color palette brand Shany came in 3 days early, in a box with about 7 feet of bubble wrap, wrapped around it and when i finally got the bubble wrap off there</li>
            <li> It has good pigment in it only draw back</li>
            <li> I am delighted to say that I was NOT disappointed in the least bit!</li>
            <li> Either one is probably enough on its own, but I think the potion primer is to die for, but I like the natural background color of the Nyx one -</li>
            <li> Make sure you open the very bottom level of shadows, because, guess what?</li>
            <li> The box is very convenient for storage since it comes with so many colors, yet its not to big.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the product is even better in person if that&#x27;s possible.</li>
            <li> Colors are highly pigmented,none were cracked upon arrival and shipping was super fast.</li>
            <li> When I viewed this product online, the super loud colors screamed my name!</li>
            <li> positive u need to work on getting the gift to customers without ruining merchandise</li>
            <li> I also usually have to reapply my eyeshadow throughout the day with other brands, but this stayed on and stayed just as bright and beautiful all day long.</li>
            <li> Love it and the color&#x27;s lost so long</li>
            <li> This set is just as good as Mac if not better.</li>
            <li> So overall review, beautiful high pigment colors, I would say as potent as Mac, I even put a swatch of gold mine and an almost identical color on my wrist and by the end of the day both were going strong,, but the durability of box and shadows were truly a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Wow goes on easy and smooth , and lasts long.</li>
            <li> I have fun mixing the colours &amp; trying new looks on myself and on friends.</li>
            <li> ok or atleast not for a VERY long time.</li>
            <li> The pigments in this palette were okay, not good, not terrible,</li>
            <li> The colors are bright, and long lasting.</li>
            <li> Some kind of pretty green all over the place.</li>
            <li> The pigments of the makeup are very vibrant and rich throughout all of the colors, I would say they are easily comparable to MAC, HIP, or Bare Minerals, and at only a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m happy and hoping for the same results with other purchases!</li>
            <li> It comes in a large a ray for matte and shimmery colors.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and very high in pigment!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously amazed...and excited! :-)</li>
            <li> The neutral shades are limited, but there&#x27;s a huge selection of fun colors.</li>
            <li> they are so vibrant!</li>
            <li> very high pigmented.</li>
            <li> Very high quality eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This pallet is fine for every day work and errands and a teen or college student would really like it.</li>
            <li> if you were to buy a cheap palette for a younger girl for the price you cant complain too much though.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s what I really like.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t see me reaching for it much.</li>
            <li> fast shipping from amazon.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented.</li>
            <li> They show up really well.</li>
            <li> and I managed to fit it back together like a puzzle.</li>
            <li> Blends well and is very customizable to every need.</li>
            <li> I received it fast and every thing was bubble wrapped so nothing was shattered.</li>
            <li> I can tell they really tried to protect it though.  </li>
            <li> I was under the impression it would show very well.  </li>
            <li> Almost like there wasn&#x27;t much on my brush.  </li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t showing very well on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I gave it one star because the colors are very prettty...</li>
            <li> I wish that I could write a glowing review but the packaging really failed.had</li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> I really like this kit</li>
            <li> The product itself was free to move around the package because the box it came in was WAY too big.</li>
            <li> Not a speck of eye-shadow out of place, very well packaged.</li>
            <li> Really pigmented lots of colors a couple doubles</li>
            <li> My case arrived 100% intact without so much as a crack.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about makeup</li>
            <li> Baught this for a friend, I sent it as a gift I had no idea how it would show up much to my amazement</li>
            <li> My friend absolutely loves the palette.  </li>
            <li> and she likes so much</li>
            <li> I feel like a real diva.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and not one pastel was damaged.</li>
            <li> i will give it one Star for the fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Mine was packaged very well with no breaks or problems.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.  </li>
            <li> It was very well protected.</li>
            <li> I really wish i did not need this item for a vacation that i am taking because i would sooo return it.</li>
            <li> i really luv the product but just think that the shipping needs to be rethought.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very pigmented (as everyone admits) &amp; you cannot beat  the price.</li>
            <li> These shadows are very pigmented as well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend any from this brand!</li>
            <li> I really like the colors/pigment, I&#x27;m still a beginner and learning to use it.</li>
            <li> I know were supposed to write about this product on behalf of amazon, but I really wanted to write a review for this product even though I didn&#x27;t get it through amazon.</li>
            <li> thank you so much.</li>
            <li> NO BROKEN SHADOWS ECT.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves this makeup set.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I recommend this palette to anyone who wants neon eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> have to admit i was not dissappointed at all even though i was ready for it</li>
            <li> This eye shadow really works.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks again and can&#x27;t wait to buy again.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get this product</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> And came fast.</li>
            <li> just a few warm colors</li>
            <li> I shall be ordering more of these products in the near future</li>
            <li> I have a 44 color palette from ELF, and I have Naked 2 from Urban Decay, but I can honestly say I don&#x27;t need them now.</li>
            <li> I also love the case they come in which keeps them relatively safe, although one of my blues on the lowest palette was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> Used it for the first time today and the color pay-off is amazing, but they don&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
            <li> Point being, the colors are so pure and so vibrant.</li>
            <li> I had to send the original one back.</li>
            <li> I actually love this palette the possibilities are endless when i received mine</li>
            <li> , i read many other reviews</li>
            <li> /&gt;Their durability on the skin (how long they last) is a bit to be desired, but if your just starting out (or experienced), you should already have a Primer for your skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s original packaging, but bubble wrapped as well inside a bigger box.  </li>
            <li> So many colors endless ideas...</li>
            <li> The eye shadows are very pigmented and vibrant.</li>
            <li> show up very well and vibrant.</li>
            <li> im not super concerned, colors still went on smoothly and were pretty!</li>
            <li> Thanks for high quality product.</li>
            <li> There is so much variety in it, and the shadows are long-lasting and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> I used a wet paper towel to clean it up and pretty much had to go through and \\&quot;detail\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It has Neon&#x27;s, matte finishes, shimmer, finishes, a neutral section of shadows, and a good quality RED shadow as well which is a BIG plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to be buying their brushes and gel liners next!</li>
            <li> The product was packaged beautiful, but I received mine broken!</li>
            <li> consistently sense I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li> get this hands down for top quaility</li>
            <li> Okay now down to the product itself.</li>
            <li> I love &amp; I just purchased 5 of Shany&#x27;s other palettes!</li>
            <li> live in Alaska, and this got here in two days!</li>
            <li> I am a new and up coming make up artist!</li>
            <li> I have paid A LOT less for other eyeshadow palettes I have ordered as gifts and the packaging kept them in great shape</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant,  highly pigmented,  and very soft.  </li>
            <li> I really would like a NEW undamaged one.</li>
            <li> plus, I love to wear black eyeshadow</li>
            <li> This pallet has such fun vibrant colors that really makes me step out of my makeup box.</li>
            <li> Decent colors</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant and i can&#x27;t wait to play in my makeup.</li>
            <li> &amp; They Are Vibrant  </li>
            <li> It stayed vibrant ALL NIGHT (about 6 hours of dancing) without the use of a primer.</li>
            <li> Every color on the pallet was as vibrant as in the picture.</li>
            <li> With or without primer, the eye shadows are vibrant and have staying power for an all day look.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and packaging was very professional.</li>
            <li> ( 3rd then I continued to investigate and found that when I opened the middle section one of the gorgeous, hot pink shadows literally fell out!</li>
            <li> and all my items arrived very well packed and looked so professional!</li>
            <li> I cleaned up the mess and was satisfied with the swatches I did.</li>
            <li> And the one flaw I have found is that when using a thick primer you are going to need a very good eye makeup remover because the pinks (hot pinks) have a tendency to leave a bit of stain (however, I&#x27;m Wednesday Adams pale</li>
            <li> Just be careful you might not be as lucky as me ;)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The color has a high quality when also apply.</li>
            <li> I have gotten makeup before where the reviews said that it was highly pigmented when it wasn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s so high quality</li>
            <li> I wanted something with high pigment</li>
            <li> I highly recommend all the make up lovers to buy this product.</li>
            <li> As I usually by high end products and pay $15.</li>
            <li> Highly pigmented-</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is so high quality with this palette</li>
            <li> Still reach for this over my high end shadows alot</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> If your like to me and like to paly around with different palate colors this is a great way to learn new and different shades , and mix and have fun with different colors.</li>
            <li> I was extremely nervous because the product had such amazing reviews</li>
            <li> but luckily their was 2 of the same shade , lasts long , would definitely but again ! :)</li>
            <li> The second one arrived the next day and to my great luck it was also a mess.</li>
            <li> Put a little more effort in the packaging tissue, bubble wrap etc.</li>
            <li> It looks like they really fixed the packaging nightmare!!</li>
            <li> Our 11 yr old daughter loves it!!</li>
            <li> They are easily blended with each other to bring your wildest color combos to life.</li>
            <li> It is all intact great colors nothing wrong with the packaging or the product.</li>
            <li> , it stays on the skin for long time (my first use was for a peacock makeup for a belly dancer and it lasted a whole day!</li>
            <li> (once again, just like the picture).&lt;br /&gt;I got this mainly because I wear a lot of black clothes with various,bright colors and wanted a nice range of various colored eyeshadow to match my outfits...</li>
            <li> I was looking for shadows that would be useful for regular makeup as well as fx makeup as well</li>
            <li> and honestly it&#x27;s worth it instead of buying each color individually</li>
            <li> Needed a simple but useful Birthday gift.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and the eyeshadow is long lasting</li>
            <li> The four star rating is simply because I have other bright shadows from different makers that seemed to wear brighter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medium toned African American and the colors show up just fine.</li>
            <li> Pretty vibrant colors that last all day for any occasion.</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned and the color does not last and doesn&#x27;t seem bright enough for me as I hoped it to be.</li>
            <li> The 1st time i got it, about two of the makeup was cracked, had makeup dust everywhere, and it looked already used when i wanted it new.</li>
            <li> Not one shadow broke and I live in Trinidad so it had to go from the seller to Miami then to Trinidad which is alot of movement</li>
            <li> There are no applicators in the package so if this is for a gift for someone new to makeup</li>
            <li> It became new again, so I kept it.</li>
            <li> Main box was filled with that odd mega-bubble stuff.</li>
            <li> So, when I got the urge to get back into things, I went with Shaney products solely because of the price and the vast selection available.</li>
            <li> I have heard that this product was not delivered properly, it was broken before it even shipped, but mine was in great condition.</li>
            <li> These colors are both natural yet vibrant</li>
            <li> I know that some of the reviews said that it was delivered a broken mess but mine came absolutely perfect they must have fixed the shipping problems.</li>
            <li> very professional make up set.</li>
            <li> beight vivid colors</li>
            <li> came two days early!</li>
            <li> I was tempted to buy but being the cautious individual I am, did some research first.  </li>
            <li> I love Shany products and have bought this collection as well as several other products.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> When I first read the reviews on this product I was scared to buy it for the simple fact that I kept reading</li>
            <li> It arrived in prefect condition and a day early!</li>
            <li> he quality of this product FAR exceeded my expectations!</li>
            <li> And the Shany Eye Shadows don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> love this kit i use it everyday!</li>
            <li> At first, I was tempted to send it back immediately.</li>
            <li> However, after first opening my shipment and seeing how well packaged it was I decided that it has nothing to do with the shipper, but most likely the shipping company and the fact that with such high amount of pigment and little fillers (which to me is a plus)</li>
            <li> Wow who new that I would be getting all of these colors.</li>
            <li> and they do not show in black light.</li>
            <li> Anyways the eyeshadows in the palette are very soft actually extremely soft</li>
            <li> I got it because I do modeling and it has so many colors that can be used wet or dry</li>
            <li> Yes the white pallet was in 3 chunks but how lucky am I that it was the white??</li>
            <li> I usually use only mac cosmetics and was happily surprised to find the pigment quality with this brand is just as good and last all day.</li>
            <li> The packaging was great, not one single shadow broken.</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how vivid the yellows showed up on my skin, the way the shimmery copper looked absolutely glowing on my complexion and I have never, ever had a truer red shadow.</li>
            <li> original one that I received had a couple of cracked colors, including black - which got destroyed and spread everyyywheeere.</li>
            <li> They really last and the colors are so vibrant!</li>
            <li> I was very happy, like I had won the lottery, when I opened the box and there was not a mess of colorful dust and no colors were broken!!!!</li>
            <li> The color is amazing, but it was almost all broken.</li>
            <li> i was so happy about getting for my friend ( as a gift), but to my disappointment,  sooner i opened the box, the colors felt all over my clothes</li>
            <li> if It wasn&#x27;t broken it would have gotten 5 stars because it is amazing eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> There were also clear plastic covers over the shadows.</li>
            <li> i would not waste your money...</li>
            <li> so i figured the fixed their packaging issue..</li>
            <li> I am a professional makeup artist</li>
            <li> For those panicking about the shipping, they have fixed their problems.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Although the package was greatly wrapped (foam boxing inside the actual retail box along with bubble wrap), I did have one blue pigment that was broken.</li>
            <li> it saved me SOOOO much money from purchasing individual eyeshadow colors.</li>
            <li> , you have straight up sparkly, of all the same color (i.e. matte yellows, glimmer yellows, sparkly/metallic yellows).</li>
            <li> They are very pigmented and last all day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, as a disclaimer, I only really use this as supporting colors, or for minor details.</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviews about this product as far as what it looked like</li>
            <li> Threw out all my old crappy pallets after a week of using these.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loud person and sometimes I want my makeup to express that.</li>
            <li> Application is creamy and seamless.</li>
            <li> All parts work properly and the design is very practical and functional.</li>
            <li> All of the youtube reviews stated that the biggest issue was shipping because some colors would be cracked or completely destroyed from handling.</li>
            <li> and they came early but out of the two palettes&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine came bubblewrapped about 15 times, and was completely intact.</li>
            <li> I think that the manufacturer has fixed the shipping since these problems occurred.</li>
            <li> AS MUCH AS THE LAST!</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Wow.  </li>
            <li> Wow i soo recomend this product.</li>
            <li> My pallet arrived completely intact.</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have for any makeup user in the entire world!!!</li>
            <li> For brown/dark skinned ladies, as long as you don&#x27;t mind wetting when you want intense color than you should order!</li>
            <li> However, I was pleasantly surprised when i received the package because there was stuffing inside the packaging box to prevent the box of shadows from moving around.</li>
            <li> she said she will even use it professionally.</li>
            <li> Love the variety in blue and green hues</li>
            <li> Overall, you&#x27;ll love the palette and you&#x27;ll find yourself using it everyday because it literally has EVERY color you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> Wow u got wwwwwwaaay more negative than</li>
            <li> Not bad at all, must use a primer for color to stick and last long, but lots of fall out...</li>
            <li> i love this so much one color came broken</li>
            <li> I do wish that it had a few more matte shadows and a little less of the shimmer ones, but they specified in the description that they&#x27;re would be more shimmers</li>
            <li> Very much worth the $25 I spent!</li>
            <li> and I opened the box, half way expecting it to be in shambles with no protection at all, but they put the big air packets on top and the actual palette was wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> i got my product quickly, but there werre three cracked eyeshadows, one of them being black.</li>
            <li> I was really worried about the reviews I read regarding the item arriving damaged, but I was hoping I&#x27;d be one of the lucky few to receive one that was entirely intact.</li>
            <li> The colors are vibrant they last all day.</li>
            <li> Even without a primer these colors are vibrant and lasting.  </li>
            <li> I voted four stars only because some colors require water to achieve a high definition look.</li>
            <li> The colors are all highly pigmented and last for hours!</li>
            <li> I use a white primer underneath it and it is extremely vivid!</li>
            <li> but it was the only palette I could find that was half way cheap with the colors I wanted.</li>
            <li> These super pigmented colors are my go to for everyday use and for my professional use.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s considerd medium, usually, and sometimes light.  </li>
            <li> so i call up amazon and they shipped me a new palette the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on a serious budget right now and for the first time I can&#x27;t afford all MAC everything...</li>
            <li> well thank goodness because this palette cost as much as one of their individual colors and it&#x27;s the same quality!</li>
            <li> I think that whatever was wrong with the shipping method when those comments were made has been fixed not only because my package was fine, but also the more recent comments from about 2013 on are all good and the bad comments were all made in 2012.</li>
            <li> this is exactly what I wanted and expected!</li>
            <li> A bit shy to order again till the packaging gets better!</li>
            <li> Also another issue is when I first got it i slide the side to get a glimpse of the other colors</li>
            <li> Beautiful, pigmented colors that last all day especially if eyeshadow base is applied first.</li>
            <li> sometimes it is hard for me to find eye shadow that doesn&#x27;t look so cheap and chalky.</li>
            <li> I requested and paid EXTRA for two-day delivery, so I expected a little better handling.</li>
            <li> I knew it was a risk, but i really wanted this palette but to luckily only 4 colors were cracked with minor dusting in the palette.</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t marked fragile or handle with care as it should of been.</li>
            <li> Such a professional feel and look.</li>
            <li> But I did throw away the excess and that pigment is still usable since it was only chipped instead of being destroyed completely.</li>
            <li> That being said, be careful not to drop this palette because the eye shadows are really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s much lighter than expected?</li>
            <li> my ten yr old loves it</li>
            <li> This lovely palette arrived completely unblemished without any cracked or broken eye shadows, I didn&#x27;t open the box to find eye shadow all over the packaging like I feared I would, and</li>
            <li> I am 28 now and have only a few times come across shadows this true to color.</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows most of dem were broken up.</li>
            <li> Alot of review said that this item came with several broken palette, mine came perfectly packaged and not a single one broken.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I replaced it, the first time all the little eyeshadows were either completely destroyed or cracked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more tightly packed and less likely to rattle and roll in shipping.</li>
            <li> Unlike other purchasers, my eyeshadow palette was not broken or anything.</li>
            <li> They are very comparable to each other in terms of pigmentation.</li>
            <li> The colors are highly pigmented and long lasting.  </li>
            <li> product blends extremely well and due to the strength of the pigment I am able to use far fewer layers than I typically would.</li>
            <li> The colors are plenty pigmented, not a single shadow or part of the box was cracked/broken when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a beginning makeup artist, and have been using this on clients, and they as well also adore the color selection.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m doing a more ridiculous look with dark colors, I&#x27;ll use my normal primers: I do both the potion primer by Urban Decay and a nude eyeshadow primer by Nyx.</li>
            <li> I was fortunate with receiving my order without the contents being broken so as far as that goes</li>
            <li> I got this for halloween, but the colors are so vibrant and every single color choice possible...</li>
            <li> The first issue is that a lot of the little colors fall out when I store them in my closet.</li>
            <li> Was fast and all in one peace but for the price no not worth it</li>
            <li> i read the reviews and noticed the ones who bought it back in oct-dec 2011 all received theirs broken and more of the recent comments</li>
            <li> I highly suggest buying these over any other eye shadow.</li>
            <li> So I opened the palette up, and much to my dismay, it was a mess.</li>
            <li> but you can tell it&#x27;s not good quality as I kept having to clean the makeup from my cheek bones as they kept falling even after I had applied primer.  </li>
            <li> Everything came fine nothing broken.</li>
            <li> in all honesty it&#x27;s a little much for me</li>
            <li> We had a few broken colors but a few drops of rubbing alcohol  and they where good as new the next morning.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister as a Christmas present and when she opened the package initially everything looked fine, but when she opened the eyeshadow palette a lot of the colors were broken as if someone had smashed it on the ground or something.</li>
            <li> The good and the bad.</li>
            <li> The colors had a thin plastic protective sheet over them and the whole thing was nicely packed inside of bubble wrap, which was inside of a thin styrofoam box, which was inside of the Shany box, which was inside of the Amazon box.</li>
            <li> In fact I can use it not only for my eyes but unique features like a broken doll&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> Extremely displeased with this item thus far.</li>
            <li> I was nearly persuaded by the other reviews not to spend my money</li>
            <li> Despite some people receiving broken palettes, I ordered and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> When it was sent to me though, one of the layers had broken off and there was a lot of shimmery colorful dust everywhere!</li>
            <li> the white was broken (not completely, only maybe the top quarter) and the powder was everywhere (..strangely, even on the outside of the case), but I&#x27;m not bothered by little mishaps like that</li>
            <li> I know it will last me a long time as well because you don&#x27;t have to use alot to get the color or shade you desire, one application is enough unlike department store brands.</li>
            <li> Will last a long time I just know it.</li>
            <li> It is long lasting</li>
            <li> You do have to wear an eye primer for long lasting color.</li>
            <li> Color really last long!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future and I&#x27;m dying to try the cream liners and loose powder shadows now!</li>
            <li> That was the absolute only negative that I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> So far I have only tested a few of the shades</li>
            <li> The package came quickly, and none of the eye shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> This will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Spent all night trying to clean off all the 9 broken shadows.</li>
            <li> It was a little dusty but nothing broken like others have said its gonna make a great Xmas gift</li>
            <li> I was really shocked to find that this product is really nice.</li>
            <li> but i dont have to go to the store to buy makeup for a long time.</li>
            <li> well spent, and a necessity for a college student such as myself who goes out a lot!</li>
            <li> and it sticks all day long...</li>
            <li> However, that was not nearly the</li>
            <li> Only thing  , you have to be careful with the eyshadow trays</li>
            <li> The 120 and 180 color eyeshadow pallet is mass-produced in China and contains massive amounts of unknown, eye-damaging chemicals.</li>
            <li> but that doesn&#x27;t excuse the lack of caring and packaging.</li>
            <li> I have a different color for everyday for the entire year, just by simply mixing some colors together!</li>
            <li> and it was a minor crack.</li>
            <li> Only reason that I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because after doing some swatches on my wrist, I realized I had to wet my brushes to get the pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have about 5 of the same pink.  </li>
            <li> Stays on bright even without a primer or base, but twice as good with the base applied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good , but the only bad thing about this ( a big big big negative side) is that it has all this black color all over the box ...</li>
            <li> For those worried about the delivery, there was only one color that was messed up, but not completely though, I&#x27;d say it was 1/4 out of place, plus a little &amp;#34;color dust&amp;#34; on the rest of the case, but that&#x27;s definitely nothing for the amount of eye shadows on this.</li>
            <li> When makeup came was excited to open, dissapointed when half the eyeshadows where broken, the outside black box was covered in eyeshadow as well.</li>
            <li> It was the most dramatic experience I&#x27;ve ever had as I anxiously opened the box.</li>
            <li> I wish I had known about this product prior to my other eyeshadow purchases.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely buying other products of this brand .</li>
            <li> The only reason I gave 4 starts is that i thought the circles of eyeshadow themselves were big like quarter size, but when I recieved the pallete they were more on the side of a dime :(.</li>
            <li> when I opened this one the red eyeshadow was completely crushed and everywhere!</li>
            <li> I had to take a blowdryer and blow the red crumbles out of all the other colors....</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t have to buy anymore eyeshadow for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The worst part was the color that broke off on the top layer was BLACK shadow, so I spent a good half hour cleaning the mess off from the other colors.</li>
            <li> The second layer was the same story, except with orange and green everywhere.</li>
            <li> B005UL1B34 Shany 180 Color Eyeshadow Palette (180 Color Eyeshadow Palette, United Colors of Shany, Neon Frenzy, Limited), 6.35 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Now I have green stained rug in my room when the whole other half is supposed to be beige.</li>
            <li> Not sure where it came from, but it made it all the way to Jersey with no trouble.</li>
            <li> There is only a couple of neutral colors which are like dark brown.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, just not how they arrived in a broken case, with several of the eye shadows broken into unused powder form that got all over my hands and my clothing.  </li>
            <li> , im honestly even to afraid to use this thing because it may just fall apart!</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, but in a FEW DAYS i got a new 1 and this one looks much better!</li>
            <li> When I go to open it in my closet to go bring it down</li>
            <li> Not high pigment at all and too loose will get a lot of the shadow powder in your eyes</li>
            <li> After experimenting with a primer and a white base, I found the shadows themselves to be very easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Every single color Is well pigmented !</li>
            <li> It was a hot mess that evey single eyeshadow was broken and all over the place</li>
            <li> it was ok not that bad</li>
            <li> I have seen so many bad reviews for this pallete.</li>
            <li> Great colors  horrible packaging.</li>
            <li> I was very upset and was unable to get my money back</li>
            <li> The make up palette I recieved was packaged very well, so I thought when I opened it the eyeshadow was broken up all over the place</li>
            <li> It was packaged very well, but one of the colors was broken.</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m a 52 year-old man retired from the military...</li>
            <li> There was absolutely NO damage to the palette, it was perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It arrived alot sooner than I expected, and considering the fact that Im in Germany</li>
            <li> ,  i didn&#x27;t notice there is another pallet under the middle pallet for a few days</li>
            <li> Money well spent..</li>
            <li> Not to mention that they really take pride in packaging the pallet so when it gets to you there aren&#x27;t any broken eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> Second they are upwards of $8 for a few colors.</li>
            <li> so you may not need to wet them with fairer skin tones.</li>
            <li> I opened and I have about 6-7 different colors broken partially or completely.</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong once I opened the box and had a table full of black.</li>
            <li> Also flakes from other colors were mixed in with the few that weren&#x27;t damaged.</li>
            <li> many other people, I read through the reviews and was afraid of buying the product in fear of receiving a broken palette full of broken shadows.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to go from one pallet to the other</li>
            <li> The looks one can create are endless.  </li>
            <li> i was hesitent, but once you add your nyx MILK jumbo pencil or other eye primers, it will be heaven to the lid.</li>
            <li> There is no powdery residue like with other eyeshadows I have tried.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering the other HD Neon mineral colors out there</li>
            <li> The colors were indeed into each other when I opened.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> thats why this gets 4 stars but other than that</li>
            <li> I compared it to the reviews of other palettes as well</li>
            <li> (for that I would check other peoples comments and not just mine).</li>
            <li> The options are just endless.</li>
            <li> I was extremely nervous about buying these after reading the reviews about how damaged the product was during shipping</li>
            <li> I was unsure about making this purchase due to the problems I saw in the reviews regarding the packaging/ shipping issues.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> 3 of the colors where broke and got into all the other colors.</li>
            <li> This came broken and the eyeshadow beneath the top layer was broken and mess up the entire kit and the part to slide came out... was not nice at all</li>
            <li> About 10 of the colors had been cracked, broken off, or completely destroyed and had leaked ALL over the other shadows.</li>
            <li> Being dark skinned</li>
            <li> I decided to get a replacement, because how it looked was not worth the money i paid.</li>
            <li> Dark, but not too dark, and not light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of the colors came cracked but that&#x27;s literally the only complaint I can think of.</li>
            <li> but almost everyone complained about the Shipping, so when mine came I was terrified to open it.</li>
            <li> Not worth going through the hassle of requesting a refund, i will just bite the bullet and take it as a loss,</li>
            <li> I have dark skin and the colors</li>
            <li> Price is good but what I got was terrible !</li>
            <li> and this has 3 individual, very dark, ones!!</li>
            <li> Some of my eye shadows were messed up and the color was completely ruined because of the black dusty powder on the box and the plates ..</li>
            <li> When I opened the box it was shipped in, I was worried because it was not protected by anything other than a little plastic bubble that served no purpose.</li>
            <li> PLUS ILL ADD THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I HAD A BROKEN SHADOW, IT WAS REPLACED.</li>
            <li> Well other than the repeat in a few colors.  </li>
            <li> but cant use half because they fell out and broke.</li>
            <li> So instead of 180 colors I have about half of them.  </li>
            <li> but I think because I did that, it had less chances of getting bumped around and abused.</li>
            <li> I was concern reading previous reviews but didn&#x27;t have any problems with my order.</li>
            <li> i am so mad right now.</li>
            <li> four of the eyeshadows were a little craked with a little mess to wiped down</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous after reading the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> The colors are very intense and pop when applied with an eyelid primer or a white base shadow.</li>
            <li> The second one had about half the eyeshadows broken and a mess</li>
            <li> i was wrong and completely bummed!</li>
            <li> A little pricey</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t believe the quality I got for how little I paid.</li>
            <li> and I was little nervous, but when i opened it everything was bubbled wrapped and in tact.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a little lighter than olive.  </li>
            <li> That scared me a little</li>
            <li> , it is a little.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s even a nifty, little mirror inside.</li>
            <li> i  dont buy other make up no more</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading a few of the reviews</li>
            <li> Most of the bad reviews were because of the shipping (broken case, cracked shadow/plastic, etc) and not the quality of the product itself.</li>
            <li> Will post a picture in a few.</li>
            <li> Over all i got my palette but the fact that i had to go to a UPS office twice to send back their broken palette makes me rate this product at a three star.</li>
            <li> The only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because a couple of the colors were broken.</li>
            <li> Tried out a few of the colors and with the primer</li>
            <li> so now I know she uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> only that i didnt like that one of the color was broken but</li>
            <li> The only small disappointed was that there are 3 and 4 of the same colors, so you don&#x27;t get 180 different colors.</li>
            <li> But after giving it a thought and considering the facts that it as never been use and it&#x27;s only one of the eyeshadows that was broken.</li>
            <li> Last decent amount of time with primer or base.</li>
            <li> it was not easy to spread over eyelid.</li>
            <li> I was worried i wouldn&#x27;t like them because of the high pigmentation, but i was wrong, again!</li>
            <li> I have to say that I read numerous negative reviews about poor packaging and breakage during shipping and it halted me purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Mine arrived in a couple of days and not one single broken color.</li>
            <li> I was a little scared that mine was going to come in broken because of all the other reviews</li>
            <li> I was a little scare to order it thru amazon by reading all the negative packaging reviews</li>
            <li> guess the small size makes it easier to travel.</li>
            <li> I can only guess that packaging was the problem not really sure what went wrong</li>
            <li> Some of the pods were broken or even empty.</li>
            <li> Usually I have to coat on my make-up for it to show up on my tan skin, but this I did not have to do that.</li>
            <li> Used with small brush as eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I lost my interest and of course my products and brushes went to crud in the past decade.</li>
            <li> The packaging was horrible the first time and the second time.</li>
            <li> Depending on the look, I usually just prime these with my concealer, and use the eyeshadow to set it in place.</li>
            <li> I love this kit, but it came horribly damaged.</li>
            <li> The colors are small</li>
            <li> I do have small comtainers</li>
            <li> These shadows could be compared to MAC because of the quality of vibrancy, which I have used over the past 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have started playing with colors everyday!</li>
            <li> The price was reduced because one of the pink colors inside the palette was broken and it spreads all over the palette both inside and out.</li>
            <li> Not okay.</li>
            <li> I did want to comment on the fact that I received the package today and not a single color was broken (I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews saying that theirs came broken).</li>
            <li> This item was very messy.</li>
            <li> I am not even half way through my colors as yet!!</li>
            <li> Package didn&#x27;t come broken like other said.</li>
            <li> Looked at all the other reviews and saw that some people would receive this Item all broken while some would get the item just as is.</li>
            <li> i am so disappointed amazon very.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in time and the kit its just fine,nothing broken even I was afraid of such things due to distance.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect after reading the previous reviews complaining about broken colors, etc.</li>
            <li> Many colors where broken:(  and its unfair.</li>
            <li> It had broken colors and was a mess all over the box.</li>
            <li> I am a makeup artist and a die hard Mac user.</li>
            <li> If i could rate this product a 10, i would, and im a hard woman  </li>
            <li> BUT, in spite of all of the negative feedback I decided to purchase this palette.</li>
            <li> I was really worried about buying this after all the bad reviews saying that the eyeshadows were broken, but I ordered it anyways</li>
            <li> these people really dnt give a crap about your packages just toss them around.</li>
            <li> I just want to use this everyday!!</li>
            <li> but When I got mine it had one color that was broken but other than that its awsome!!!</li>
            <li> or maybe it just a bad product but the Shany, neon, frenzy was a total disaster.</li>
            <li> it is not fair at all.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to be insane to blow your hard-earned money on Mac or Nars when you can get this enormous comprehensive palette for the price of ONE single Mac eyeshadow.  </li>
            <li> It is ridiculous that every product they send out is broken.</li>
            <li> complained about getting broken pallets and the eye shadows themselves would be broken</li>
            <li> mothers day is May 13th &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> and i was wearing white :( ).</li>
            <li> May be sending this back too.  :(</li>
            <li> I was afraid that the eyeshadows were going to get cracked during shipping (because of previous reviews)</li>
            <li> cause they can be very delicate upon opening them .</li>
            <li> Very slow</li>
            <li> , however I was not in the mood to open up my order with broken colors!!!</li>
            <li> didnt receive it broken</li>
            <li> Arrived with about 4 eye shadows broken up.</li>
            <li> None of the shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> the the darn thing was broken up....</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this, I saw reviews saying that all the colors would be shattered when I received it, but I ordered it, thinking that there&#x27;s no way every product could be broken.</li>
            <li> One was broken.  </li>
            <li> I gave the none broken one to my daughter.  </li>
            <li> there were a lot of complaints about broken product.</li>
            <li> I read reviews on how others received their package with broken eyeshadow pigments.</li>
            <li> no shadows were broken it was well protected.</li>
            <li> But it you receive your purchase broken</li>
            <li> I was scared that it would arrive broken up</li>
            <li> it was broken.</li>
            <li> i have broken colors and a broken palette.</li>
            <li> Not one eyeshadow was broken.</li>
            <li> A couple of them arrived broken.</li>
            <li> None were broken.</li>
            <li> Not happy with the way I recieved it.</li>
            <li> I will say when I received it there was one broken eyeshadow</li>
            <li> and I had to glue the base of them back in.</li>
            <li> I was reading everyone&#x27;s review and was terrified that the palette was going to come broken and destroyed.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said that the pots were broken when they recieved the palette, and that there was color everywhere, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> was people&#x27;s pallets arriving broken.</li>
            <li> My package came on time and no palettes were broken.</li>
            <li> none were broken</li>
            <li> Arrived with not one broken color.</li>
            <li> but mine wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> and nothing was broken at all.</li>
            <li> Despite the reviews of broken pots I took a risk on this Palette</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I almost decided not to buy it, as I purchase from Costa Rica, and I thought if the product arrived in such a bad condition to customers in the states, it should be an awful mix of color dust by the time it got to my country, but as the last reviews were from 2011, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was especially unfair when I got new rug.</li>
            <li> It has a lot of variety and you can create lots of dramatic looks.</li>
            <li> but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
            <li> and I know how to mend broken eyeshadows!</li>
            <li> I am so sad...really sad.</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of this, especially about the terrible packaging, I was a bit wary of buying this</li>
            <li> you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> With this palette I won&#x27;t need to spend all of my money on expensive mac shadows and pigments.</li>
            <li> Again, i was wrong.</li>
            <li> NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH MY PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product...</li>
            <li> These are non expensive brands that I compare to, so it&#x27;s not a point of getting what you paid for.</li>
            <li> I ordered this being afraid of my palette being broken.</li>
            <li> the thought of putting color on my eyes was scary</li>
            <li> ,when my package came in it was well secured and nothing was broken!</li>
            <li> The worst is the pink,  </li>
            <li> i was horribly disappointed in the broken ones.</li>
            <li> I was also afraid that this would be that liquid jelly eye makeup stuff...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been recommending these like crazy</li>
            <li> I ordered this product despite some of the bad reviews because I purchased from shany cosmetics before.</li>
            <li> A lot of people complimented the quality of the makeup, but were disappointed with the shipping and how it looked when they had received it.</li>
            <li> I thought I would be disappointed like I was with E.L.F</li>
            <li> so disappointed i have to stay with this one</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t too bad!</li>
            <li> I was terrified to order this item after reading the horrifying reviews.</li>
            <li> and I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed,</li>
            <li> Unsure if eyeshadow itself isnt packed well into the case or if the shipping of this product is horrible.</li>
            <li> but the shipping was horrible.</li>
            <li> saaaaad :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> One eye shadow did fall out but that was the worst of it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s insane.</li>
            <li> That is very annoying when there is company.</li>
            <li> Terrible business!</li>
            <li> But I received my item in a horrible condition.</li>

            <li> I use this pallet for every day and night use I love all the colors. I don&#x27;t have to go from one pallet to the other I can mix colors together and that&#x27;s what I really like. 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading a few of the reviews but I am truly satisfied with the packaging, the arrival time, and the product!!!!! Everything was in place and neat. I am a makeup freak!!! I&#x27;m in love with the colors and how it applies! Definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I was pleasantly surprised at how incredibly pigmented these shadows are.  The looks one can create are endless.  The perfect mix of shimmer and matte. Great product!</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and the intensity</li>
            <li> Very pigmented and nice but I don&#x27;t see me reaching for it much.</li>
            <li> amazing product. beight vivid colors and i love the way they feel on my eyes. I will buy more from this company</li>
            <li> Great deal for what your paying.My sister couldnt been happier with the quality the colors had. would definetly buy from the gift shop again.</li>
            <li> i would not waste your money...i read the reviews and noticed the ones who bought it back in oct-dec 2011 all received theirs broken and more of the recent comments didnt receive it broken so i figured the fixed their packaging issue..i was wrong and completely bummed! I was looking forward to these colors!! they were alll shattered! even the outside of the box was covered in shadow and the sleeve it came in was even destroyed so it definitely didnt happen during shipping!!</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I had never used Shany products before. I absolutely love this palette and the colors blend so well!!!</li>
            <li> In usually happy with shany. This set looks and feels extremely cheap. Arrived with about 4 eye shadows broken up.</li>
            <li> fast shipping from amazon. None of the shadows were broken. The colors in the palette are awesome. Very pigmented. Last decent amount of time with primer or base. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> My fiance bought me this as a holiday gift and its the best eyeshadow ever. Being dark skinned i was hesitent, but once you add your nyx MILK jumbo pencil or other eye primers, it will be heaven to the lid. Best eye shadow ive owned so far and it has beautiful colors! get this hands down for top quaility</li>
            <li> Many colors where broken:(  and its unfair. I couldn&#x27;t call you back because I had a flight, but its ok</li>
            <li> The make up palette I recieved was packaged very well, so I thought when I opened it the eyeshadow was broken up all over the place and the mirror had a crack in it. It looks as if it was tossed around it wasn&#x27;t marked fragile or handle with care as it should of been. I was very upset and was unable to get my money back and it was a Christmas gift my a dear friend of mines. I will never order make up from this site again.</li>
            <li> Great variety and quality!</li>
            <li> I love this palette! The colors are bright and pigmented. They show up really well. The package came quickly, and none of the eye shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the variety of the product. I am dark skinned and the color does not last and doesn&#x27;t seem bright enough for me as I hoped it to be.</li>
            <li> Great product. Soo many beautiful vivid colors to wear. Love it. Will last a long time I just know it.</li>
            <li> i got my product quickly, but there werre three cracked eyeshadows, one of them being black. besides the hassle of cleaning the product, i was extremely happy with the quality of the product and the colors were awesome!!!</li>
            <li> HONESTLY!!! they need to put FRAGILE on the shipment box when sending the product to the customers. I read the reviews before buying, decided to buy it cause of the color feedback and i thought the shipment process might go well the 1st time around. The samething happened to me. The 1st time i got it, about two of the makeup was cracked, had makeup dust everywhere, and it looked already used when i wanted it new. I decided to get a replacement, because how it looked was not worth the money i paid. A little disappointed, but in a FEW DAYS i got a new 1 and this one looks much better! Looks like i bought it in a store and no cracks at all or dust. Color is great even with my dark chocolate skin. Works better if you use a primer before applying the shadow. A little pricey but i dont have to go to the store to buy makeup for a long time. If it doesnt work the 1st time try again..IF the 2nd time it doesnt work try again or just get get your $$$ back.</li>
            <li> i was a bit worried to purchase this palette cuz of all the reviews on shipping but i took a chance anyway and boy am i glad i did... i got my set at reasonable time since i live in the virgin islands and when i open the palette it was perfect.. such nice bright colors AND NOT ONE OF THEM BROKE, SHATTERED, OR MIX... i was happy its really a great set i would recommend this to anyone...</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous after reading the previous reviews. A lot of people complimented the quality of the makeup, but were disappointed with the shipping and how it looked when they had received it. There were pictures of shadows completely demolished and cracked all over the place, however I received mine with everything perfectly in tact! Not sure where it came from, but it made it all the way to Jersey with no trouble. Anyway, I was also gratified with the timely manner in which it was shipped. I ordered it Thursday night/Friday morning and it came on Monday. The pigments of the makeup are very vibrant and rich throughout all of the colors, I would say they are easily comparable to MAC, HIP, or Bare Minerals, and at only a fraction of the price. I would say it was definitely money well spent, and a necessity for a college student such as myself who goes out a lot! Really a great snag!</li>
            <li> I am so upset...the colours are wonderful...the the darn thing was broken up....i am so upset! There needs to be some better way of getting this to customers.</li>
            <li> I was worried about purchasing because of some previous reviews and to be completely honest they were right. However, after first opening my shipment and seeing how well packaged it was I decided that it has nothing to do with the shipper, but most likely the shipping company and the fact that with such high amount of pigment and little fillers (which to me is a plus) it makes the tiny eyeshadow cakes very fragile. When mine arrived I was so excited. It was actually much bigger than I had thought after reading some of the reviews and appeared to be in perfect condition, but upon closer inspection I found that a pretty dusty rose colored eyeshadow on the very last pallet had popped out in shipping. Luckily it was just into four chunks that I found in the bottom of the tray and I managed to fit it back together like a puzzle. That was the absolute only negative that I can say about this product. When I first tried it on I was ecstatic! The colors are so true and bold! I was amazed at how vivid the yellows showed up on my skin, the way the shimmery copper looked absolutely glowing on my complexion and I have never, ever had a truer red shadow. I love love love these eye shadows! I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future and I&#x27;m dying to try the cream liners and loose powder shadows now! Will post a picture in a few. I still can&#x27;t believe the quality I got for how little I paid. Comparable to department store brands. I thought I would be disappointed like I was with E.L.F but I was so wrong. Thank you for the birthday smiles!</li>
            <li> When makeup came was excited to open, dissapointed when half the eyeshadows where broken, the outside black box was covered in eyeshadow as well. Unsure if eyeshadow itself isnt packed well into the case or if the shipping of this product is horrible. Decent colors but cant use half because they fell out and broke. Wouldnt purchase again.</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this, I saw reviews saying that all the colors would be shattered when I received it, but I ordered it, thinking that there&#x27;s no way every product could be broken. About 15 of the colors in this are shattered to the point I can&#x27;t use them at all. It is ridiculous that every product they send out is broken. I expect a refund because I can&#x27;t use these colors. I will not be purchasing any more Shany products, and will gladly tell others not to.</li>
            <li> This is such a great buy! Omg! The colors vary and are so rich! Such a professional feel and look. So many beautiful colors. Easy to store and handle.</li>
            <li> I just received my package in the mail and it was in perfect condition. I seen all  the reviews and I was little nervous, but when i opened it everything was bubbled wrapped and in tact. The colors are vibrant and i can&#x27;t wait to play in my makeup. Happy camper;)</li>
            <li> I have had bought one of the oldest shanyj&#x27;s pallettes \\&quot;48 eyeshadow pallette\\&quot; and I still am satisfied with this product  So after seeing this beautiful box of colors I had to ask my bf to get it for me :D  And Once again Im satisfied --&gt; great selection of colrs, lasts long, and same old good moistured texture  The box looks like a chocolate box :)) shick and unigue  Im happy im recommending shany to ppl   Ps: np w the packaging everything came in good condition</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this palette.  I got one that only has three palettes in it.  It looks nothing like in the picture.  Also, the pigments aren&#x27;t the best when swatching.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors to this palette and they look great and last long but the shipping was horrible. When my palette first came in i was so excited and as soon as i opened the box i was so disapointed. It was a hot mess that evey single eyeshadow was broken and all over the place so i call up amazon and they shipped me a new palette the next day. I had to send the original one back. The second one arrived the next day and to my great luck it was also a mess. The second one had about half the eyeshadows broken and a mess so i called them back and told them i would give it one more try because the colors are beautiful. I&#x27;m happy to say that my third palette turned out to be a success even tho four of the eyeshadows were a little craked with a little mess to wiped down i figured that was the best they could do but its no big deal. I think that they should put fragile on the box so the shipping people can be nice and gentle. Over all i got my palette but the fact that i had to go to a UPS office twice to send back their broken palette makes me rate this product at a three star.</li>
            <li> Great make up, came to us in perfect shape, no broken colors, and it has lasted a really long time.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product on Saturday and I am very happy with the way amazon handled thing. I was supposed to receive the palette yesterday and I NEVER got it, so I contacted amazon and they shipped me another one right away no questions asked. The colors are very bright and are not chalky. I love it so much I went ahead and ordered more palettes</li>
            <li> I had been wanting to try this palette for about a year but kept putting it off until now. I wish I had got this sooner, the color payoff is amazing! The colors are very intense and pop when applied with an eyelid primer or a white base shadow. They last and stay bright with no fading. There is no powdery residue like with other eyeshadows I have tried. I use many different brands and I can say this eyeshadow is as good as Sleek and my favorite Emani! I ordered directly from Shany and everything arrived perfectly packaged so many of the reviews that have had broken palettes may find it better to buy direct from Shany&#x27;s website. I ordered this palette as well as 2 others in different sets and an eyeliner set and all my items arrived very well packed and looked so professional! Blends well and is very customizable to every need. The perfect palette for summer or anytime you need a tropical look. This palette is so customizable you can create any look with flawless ease! Why spend a fortune on indie makeup that is not vegan when Shany has everything you need! With this your set can look and feel like you just stepped off a runway after having your makeup done by a professional because this set has so many color options!&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again when needed!</li>
            <li> Color really last long! Love this!</li>
            <li> I really am enjoying this product. So many bright colors and even nuetral ones towards the bottom. I received it fast and every thing was bubble wrapped so nothing was shattered.</li>
            <li> Comes off easy goes on easy looks great</li>
            <li> i love! i love! i love!! loool. its as good as it looks. also as described. just a few warm colors, so i had to buy the warm color palette too</li>
            <li> I love all shany products and I believe this one is the best. it looks perfect on my skin. the case is so fancy!!!</li>
            <li> When I got this product I was excited like a kid on Christmas Day all those colors my goodness I will not have to buy anymore eyeshadows maybe if I run out lol so ladies if I was you get this product I don&#x27;t care what you wear you can match anything you wear with this product so hey it&#x27;s time to take a chance buy this item or purshase more colors you won&#x27;t go wrong with this</li>
            <li> Omg Absolutely Love This Make-up Set It&#x27;s So Many Colors To Choose From &amp; They Are Vibrant  No Primer Necessary!</li>
            <li> He picture is quite deceiving. It is much smaller than it appears. However, it does have a ton of colors.&lt;br /&gt;I guess the small size makes it easier to travel.</li>
            <li> The pigments in this palette were okay, not good, not terrible, just okay. This pallet is fine for every day work and errands and a teen or college student would really like it.</li>
            <li> The palette didn&#x27;t break on me nor the color didnt crack. It is easy to apply. The color has a high quality when also apply.</li>
            <li> absolutely love love love love..... I am a professional makeup artist this is exactly what I wanted and expected! pigments are great and there is a wide range of colours on the palette. jus awesome</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get them.  I got two.  One for myself, and one for my daughter.  One was broken.  Some kind of pretty green all over the place. I can tell they really tried to protect it though.  I didn&#x27;t send it back.  I gave the none broken one to my daughter.  I was under the impression it would show very well.  Almost like there wasn&#x27;t much on my brush.  There WAS enouph on the brush but it wasn&#x27;t showing very well on my skin.  I&#x27;m Nubian.  Not to considerd my most make up standards, and medium in others.  Dark, but not too dark, and not light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is mixed.  She&#x27;s a little lighter than olive.  She&#x27;s considerd medium, usually, and sometimes light.  It doesn&#x27;t show like we thought it would on her either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the other HD Neon mineral colors out there, these are pretty good for there price and there selection of color. I&#x27;m still happy, and not gonna complain too hard.  &#x3D;)[[ASIN:B005UL1B34 Shany 180 Color Eyeshadow Palette (180 Color Eyeshadow Palette, United Colors of Shany, Neon Frenzy, Limited), 6.35 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> Not as bright on skin as I thought it would be. Got eyeshadow at dollar tree that was wayyy brighter. But still was nice and worth it.</li>
            <li> One of the colors came cracked but that&#x27;s literally the only complaint I can think of. The colors are bright, and long lasting. There are some issues with how true they are so experiment on your hand first. Go on easy, blend well. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> THIS PALETTE IS A MAKEUP OR BEGINNER IN MAKEUP DREAM COME TRUE!! IT HAS 180 COLORS FROM BRIGHT NEON COLORS TO SOFT NEUTRAL COLORS!! ALL TYPES OF FINISHES FROM MATTE TO SHIMMER...ALL THE COLORS ARE VERY VERY VERY PIGMENTED!!! THIS PALETTE IS VERY AFFORDABLE AND IS WORTH THE PRICE!! I WILL TOTALLY RECOMMEND AND REPURCHASE!!!</li>
            <li> Spent all night trying to clean off all the 9 broken shadows. &amp;&amp; The sliders broke so now I have to find something to put it in. I gave it one star because the colors are very prettty...</li>
            <li> Love it. Great color. The pigment is great and the colors are all super bright. Every eye shadow youll likely ever need.</li>
            <li> this palette is perfect!  I use to be scared of bright colors and getting this palette made me want more neon palettes like this.  so many colors for a great prize.  they are all good sizes to. no dime sizes its more a nickel size its bank for your buck!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product! Then I opened the box and noticed three things. The first thing was that the colors were truly amazing, so vibrant and beautiful! Every color imaginable, even a neon orange! This is why I gave it two stars: 2ndthe first layer looked great, but I opened the first right panel and found that it didn&#x27;t connect, it was broken:( 3rd then I continued to investigate and found that when I opened the middle section one of the gorgeous, hot pink shadows literally fell out! So overall review, beautiful high pigment colors, I would say as potent as Mac, I even put a swatch of gold mine and an almost identical color on my wrist and by the end of the day both were going strong,, but the durability of box and shadows were truly a disappointment. Would I buy it again? Absolutely! The colors are fabulous and I know how to mend broken eyeshadows! I wish that I could write a glowing review but the packaging really failed.had it come whole and in tact I would have rated it 5 stars!!!</li>
            <li> Was fast and all in one peace but for the price no not worth it I have all the same colors in my BH pallets.</li>
            <li> perfect for rave make up!!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get my Shany eyeshadow palette! It was packaged tightly in bubblewrap and arrived in perfect condition. That goes to show that the shippers are watching the comments...there were a lot of complaints about broken product. That scared me a little but I had to take a chance. I&#x27;m so glad I did. The colors are absolutely amazing! I just keep opening it up and looking at it not knowing where to start!</li>
            <li> Love the colors, just not how they arrived in a broken case, with several of the eye shadows broken into unused powder form that got all over my hands and my clothing.  So instead of 180 colors I have about half of them.  Really?  Super upset.</li>
            <li> I am inlove with this! It came in super fast! and the colors are beyond pigmented. I was a little scared that mine was going to come in broken because of all the other reviews but it is in great condition!!</li>
            <li> The color is amazing, but it was almost all broken. I am so sad...really sad. I was so excited to get the platte. I am not the only person has this problem. The company needs to improve their packaging!!!!! saaaaad :&#x27;(</li>
            <li> I can only guess that packaging was the problem not really sure what went wrong or maybe it just a bad product but the Shany, neon, frenzy was a total disaster. Once I opened the box eye shadow was everywhere. Some of the pods were broken or even empty. Also flakes from other colors were mixed in with the few that weren&#x27;t damaged. This item was very messy. So I returned it hopefully the next one is much better. I will be uploading some photos of what I was sent. Extremely displeased with this item thus far. But I have high hope that the problem will be resolved quickly an efficiency. The only problem I have is this was a mothers day gift for a friend now she will not be getting it anytime soon seeing as how the replacement will not be here until June 5th through June 15th. Today is May 8th mothers day is May 13th &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I really like this kit and so do my make up artist friends. It has good pigment in it only draw back is that you must use an eyeshadow primer with it. Will buy from Shany again</li>
            <li> I was overall very happy with this product. The only negative thing was one color was broken &amp; was all over the package, good thing it was only white! But besides that it&#x27;s perfect :)</li>
            <li> The only reason why I gave this product 3 stars is that the colors are awesome and highly pigmented, which is great considering the price for the entire palette. It has a lot of variety and you can create lots of dramatic looks. I was really worried about the reviews I read regarding the item arriving damaged, but I was hoping I&#x27;d be one of the lucky few to receive one that was entirely intact. WRONG. I requested and paid EXTRA for two-day delivery, so I expected a little better handling. When I opened the box it was shipped in, I was worried because it was not protected by anything other than a little plastic bubble that served no purpose. The product itself was free to move around the package because the box it came in was WAY too big. So I opened the palette up, and much to my dismay, it was a mess. About 10 of the colors had been cracked, broken off, or completely destroyed and had leaked ALL over the other shadows. This was the case on all but one of the 6 individual palettes. The worst part was the color that broke off on the top layer was BLACK shadow, so I spent a good half hour cleaning the mess off from the other colors. The second layer was the same story, except with orange and green everywhere. I used a wet paper towel to clean it up and pretty much had to go through and \\&quot;detail\\&quot; all 180 colors because they had dust from another color on them. It was a disaster. If I didn&#x27;t love the colors so much, I would probably return it and hope for a replacement that is intact, but I&#x27;m also worried that it would just happen again. This seems to be happening to everyone, so PLEASE PLEASE make sure you check with the seller to see if they have improved their shipping and packaging before you order. As of March 7th, 2012 they have NOT. What a shame. I really would like a NEW undamaged one.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews of this, especially about the terrible packaging, I was a bit wary of buying this but it was the only palette I could find that was half way cheap with the colors I wanted. I got mine today and I opened the box, half way expecting it to be in shambles with no protection at all, but they put the big air packets on top and the actual palette was wrapped in bubble wrap. Everything was in perfect condition, no cracks in the eye shadows, maybe a bit of fall out but nothing too major. One eye shadow did fall out but that was the worst of it. I wiped my finger barely across one color and got AMAZING pigmentation. I ordered mine with an Amazon Prime free trial and chose one day shipping for 3.99 I think, which is SUPER cheap and it got here right on time, but I think because I did that, it had less chances of getting bumped around and abused. Just something to think about if you&#x27;re ordering this product.</li>
            <li> colors appear as in palate</li>
            <li> Amazing pigmentation.</li>
            <li> I have gotten makeup before where the reviews said that it was highly pigmented when it wasn&#x27;t but this really is! I use a white primer underneath it and it is extremely vivid! I was extremely impressed! It was packaged very well, but one of the colors was broken. It&#x27;s not a color I&#x27;ll likely use anyway so I&#x27;m not upset by it. Very much worth the money!</li>
            <li> There are a lot of reviews that say the palette came with broken/ruined eye-shadow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in Alaska, and this got here in two days! Not a speck of eye-shadow out of place, very well packaged. I ordered another item from this seller, so they came in a box together. Main box was filled with that odd mega-bubble stuff. The palette had Styrofoam surrounding it in it&#x27;s own box, and then there was more bubble wrap after that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, its wonderful! Amazing selection of colors, very vivid and strong pigments. This will last a very long time!</li>
            <li> Im so excited to use them. I can;t wait.These colors are so bright.Thank you so very much. I shall be ordering more of these products in the near future</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, and packaging was very professional. Pretty vibrant colors that last all day for any occasion.</li>
            <li> This palette, is so affordable and has every color under the sun. I could believe how bright and pigmented they were. So velvety. Not only is there a color variety, but there is also different types of finishes.    Check out my Youtube Review on it!    [...]</li>
            <li> Package arrived in perfect condition!  Used it for the first time today and the color pay-off is amazing, but they don&#x27;t last very long.  I used an eye shadow primer and about 3 hours later, the colors are already fading.  Not terribly though!  I guess I definitely got the bang for my buck.  Great prices and beautiful colors!</li>
            <li> The colors are soooo bright! There are plenty of shades, tints and colors to choose from! great product if you love eye shadow and just makeup in general !</li>
            <li> Wonderful array of colours! Needs more highlight shades but excellent buy nonetheless!</li>
            <li> This box of eyeshadows is great I have every color I need can mix up colors can wear one color or four at one time ..I love them</li>
            <li> So many colors! And it&#x27;s so high quality it lasts forever</li>
            <li> Despite the many negative reviews that I have read about this product&#x27;s shipping, I was delighted to find that Amazon seems to have improved it&#x27;s packaging tremendously. I was nearly persuaded by the other reviews not to spend my money BUT, in spite of all of the negative feedback I decided to purchase this palette. I am delighted to say that I was NOT disappointed in the least bit! This lovely palette arrived completely unblemished without any cracked or broken eye shadows, I didn&#x27;t open the box to find eye shadow all over the packaging like I feared I would, and YES! I would DEFINITELY buy this product again! The colors that are included in this product are so vibrant and bright. It literally has every color of the rainbow in multiple finishes(51 matte, 117 ultra shimmer, and 12 double effect). This is an AMAZING buy and I give it two thumbs up all the way!</li>
            <li> For those panicking about the shipping, they have fixed their problems. The box was held in place with styrofoam and those bubble pouchs amazon uses to fill up extra space in the shipping boxes. Now the product itself is wonderful, some people complained about the quality, but I don&#x27;t know why? The colors are great and have a good vibrancy, they blend well too. You just can&#x27;t beat this deal, so many colors and such an amazing price! Let those snobs keep their pricey products, we will create magic at a fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> wow. Really pigmented lots of colors a couple doubles but that&#x27;s okay. in all honesty it&#x27;s a little much for me I like to stay towards the neutrals but it&#x27;s nice to have those fun colors. I use with a primer and it sticks all day long... you don&#x27;t have to use a primer the color will stay but pops more with the primer and that goes for any eye shadow</li>
            <li> I was really shocked to find that this product is really nice. The colors are gr8! I have not tried a night out using it yet, but I am sure the pigment will hold.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was gr8 too... came two days early!</li>
            <li> A few of the colours were spilled but that didn&#x27;t stop a great experience. Colours were all bright and lovely.</li>
            <li> The quality of this eyeshadow kit is great, all items came without any issues, none of the colors were cracked in any way, was wrapped in bubble wrap,I would highly recommend this product as it is a great value</li>
            <li> Love this palette! Beautiful, pigmented colors that last all day especially if eyeshadow base is applied first. I read reviews on how others received their package with broken eyeshadow pigments. Although the package was greatly wrapped (foam boxing inside the actual retail box along with bubble wrap), I did have one blue pigment that was broken. But I did throw away the excess and that pigment is still usable since it was only chipped instead of being destroyed completely. Overall, you&#x27;ll love the palette and you&#x27;ll find yourself using it everyday because it literally has EVERY color you&#x27;ll need.</li>
            <li> this pallet is amazing, so many colors for such a low price it&#x27;s insane. every color i can think of. great for makeup artist&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Despite some people receiving broken palettes, I ordered and was not disappointed. My case arrived 100% intact without so much as a crack. The colors go on bold without having to use much powder. Great buy.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!! it saved me SOOOO much money from purchasing individual eyeshadow colors. The colors are wonderful and all came in perfect condition! I especially love the neon they are so vibrant! I would suggest this product to ANYBODY. this is the greatest product i have ever owned! Literally EVERY color you could possibly think of!! And the price is wonderful!! BUY THIS PRODUCT YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!</li>
            <li> love this and it was received in excellent condition</li>
            <li> Such a great value. The colors are awesome!</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this stuff. So many colors and combinations. She goes with a different look every day. I don&#x27;t know much about makeup - I&#x27;m a 52 year-old man retired from the military... But it seems good. And if it were substandard, she would mention it to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these by mistake and kept both.</li>
            <li> The colors are amazing and go on easy and STAY ON! Usually I have to coat on my make-up for it to show up on my tan skin, but this I did not have to do that. I also usually have to reapply my eyeshadow throughout the day with other brands, but this stayed on and stayed just as bright and beautiful all day long.</li>
            <li> I wanted something with high pigment but what I got was something, I probably could&#x27;ve bought from the local beauty supply store. I love the package, however It fell apart soon as I took it out the plastic. I was very very upset when I applied this product to myself</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love the bright colors and the ease of application!</li>
            <li> Baught this for a friend, I sent it as a gift I had no idea how it would show up much to my amazement it was in perfect condition no shadows were broken it was well protected. My friend absolutely loves the palette.  Shipping was pretty fast and all around great did not have any problems.</li>
            <li> Oh I love this palette! I didn&#x27;t know what to expect after reading the previous reviews complaining about broken colors, etc. Mine arrived in a couple of days and not one single broken color. I got this for halloween, but the colors are so vibrant and every single color choice possible... I just want to use this everyday!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best palette you could ever find for this price. It is worth way more. I&#x27;m so in love.  I also swatch some of the colors and they are beautiful and puck up very well. I couldn&#x27;t thank amazon enough.</li>
            <li> I bought these thing for my sister because she likes to be painted and she likes so much, it is a little. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this Palette more than any other ones i have right now. All the colors and shades makes me more creative!</li>
            <li> This product is PHENOMENAL!&lt;br /&gt;Like many other people, I read through the reviews and was afraid of buying the product in fear of receiving a broken palette full of broken shadows. However, that was not nearly the case.&lt;br /&gt;My palette showed up early, in great packaging, there&#x27;s such an amazing variety of colors to create any makeup look you can imagine! The colors are plenty pigmented, not a single shadow or part of the box was cracked/broken when I received it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a beginning makeup artist, and have been using this on clients, and they as well also adore the color selection. It has Neon&#x27;s, matte finishes, shimmer, finishes, a neutral section of shadows, and a good quality RED shadow as well which is a BIG plus for me!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely going to be buying their brushes and gel liners next!</li>
            <li> This is great all the colors it comes with ,I love how you only have to apply it one and the color you see on the kit is the color you get on you skin..i love this product it great...I keep buying cool stuff from these people and im always so happy</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I almost decided not to buy it, as I purchase from Costa Rica, and I thought if the product arrived in such a bad condition to customers in the states, it should be an awful mix of color dust by the time it got to my country, but as the last reviews were from 2011, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m starting to use makeup and this palette is amazing! vibrant colors, nice amount per each color, it stays on the skin for long time (my first use was for a peacock makeup for a belly dancer and it lasted a whole day! rehearsal and 2 functions!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this product. For those worried about the delivery, there was only one color that was messed up, but not completely though, I&#x27;d say it was 1/4 out of place, plus a little &amp;#34;color dust&amp;#34; on the rest of the case, but that&#x27;s definitely nothing for the amount of eye shadows on this.</li>
            <li> Very happy with color selection.  Color is true and lasts all day.  Used with small brush as eyeliner.</li>
            <li> even with using an eyeshadow primer these didnt have dense coverage but for the price im not super concerned, colors still went on smoothly and were pretty!</li>
            <li> Another great Shany product.  I will recommend it to every one because the shadows do not fade through out the day even in the eye lid creases.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews on this I was a bit hesitant on purchasing it. But then I said what they hey, I&#x27;m going for it. I&#x27;m glad I did. I love all the colors especially the neon colors. Unlike other purchasers, my eyeshadow palette was not broken or anything. It came in one piece! I&#x27;d definitely would buy this again. The price wasn&#x27;t too bad!</li>
            <li> Omg awesome product , came in great condition , and has great colors. I&#x27;m like a kid in a eyeshadow store and can&#x27;t get enough of it. Wow goes on easy and smooth , and lasts long. I feel like a real diva. I wish I had known about this product prior to my other eyeshadow purchases. If your like to me and like to paly around with different palate colors this is a great way to learn new and different shades , and mix and have fun with different colors. Only thing  , you have to be careful with the eyshadow trays cause they can be very delicate upon opening them .</li>
            <li> The 120 and 180 color eyeshadow pallet is mass-produced in China and contains massive amounts of unknown, eye-damaging chemicals. After calling one of the Mac stores in my area (on 11/21/2014), I was informed by the saleswoman that Mac actually does NOT carry this product, post doing a web search to see if the Mac carried 120-shadow pallets. Mac builds custom eyeshadow pallets on their website. I will pay a few dollars more for safe products that go around my eyes. My EYES, people. This stuff, I wouldn&#x27;t touch with a ten foot yard stick. I was tempted to buy but being the cautious individual I am, did some research first.  SHANY is not an American brand nit is it manufactured in the United States.</li>
            <li> i love it you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> totally worth it! many many colours and shades! tho the palettes fall out sometimes.</li>
            <li> I actually love this palette the possibilities are endless when i received mine i had no broken shadows everything came in perfect, i read many other reviews i dont think its the company&#x27;s fault but more like the upc or fedex these people really dnt give a crap about your packages just toss them around. But it you receive your purchase broken i recommend you contacting the seller bc it is your money you should get what you pay for. Anyways the eyeshadows in the palette are very soft actually extremely soft the pigmentation is very good i love how it has just about every color you can think of!!!.</li>
            <li> COLORS ARE BEAUTIFUL! PACKAGING WAS FANTASIC ! BUT I DID ORDER IT WITH ANOTHER ITEM SO IT DID HV EXTRA CUSHING :) IF YOU LOVE TO PLAY DRESS UP WITH YOUR EYES THENNN THIS IS A MUST HV !!!! HV FUN!!</li>
            <li> I bought this make up for my girlfriends birthday not knowing anything about makeup and she fell in love with all of the colors. Shipping was fast and not one pastel was damaged. She loves bright colors and this makeup is perfect.</li>
            <li> I used to be very into doing makeup and being wild and creative with it, but as the years went by I lost my interest and of course my products and brushes went to crud in the past decade. So, when I got the urge to get back into things, I went with Shaney products solely because of the price and the vast selection available. Now that you know the background, I&#x27;ll go with the review and recommendation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is perfect for beginners, or those getting back into things. The eyeshadow wells are smaller than you think, but if your just playing around and testing, the size is perfect for it. The range of colors in this pallet is GLORIOUS, you have matte, you have glimmer, you have straight up sparkly, of all the same color (i.e. matte yellows, glimmer yellows, sparkly/metallic yellows). The ranges of the colors is very adequate if your going to be experimenting but don&#x27;t want to invest a lot of money buying MAC products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their durability on the skin (how long they last) is a bit to be desired, but if your just starting out (or experienced), you should already have a Primer for your skin. I found that a good primer fixes this issue if you want bold lines, while a medium primer allows for maximum blending, no primer/light primer for a light day time effect with bold colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, these shadows will need you to have a Good set of brushes, which Shaney does make for a more than reasonable price. And the one flaw I have found is that when using a thick primer you are going to need a very good eye makeup remover because the pinks (hot pinks) have a tendency to leave a bit of stain (however, I&#x27;m Wednesday Adams pale so it may just be me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was good and everything arrived in great condition. The case and eyeshadow holders are sturdy, but you can feel it in them that if your aggressive with them the plastic will shatter. Solid made for a firm but gentle handling.</li>
            <li> Very GOOD quality! a Must have! this is the palette you will need, i use it for everything!&lt;br /&gt;VERY WELL PACKAGED! I RECEIVED IT FLAWLESS! LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> this palette is great because it has a variety of colors for a great price, however I noticed that when I. put on some some eyeshadow it didn&#x27;t show up as strong as my other whites from other palettes, it&#x27;s also a bit more powdery than I&#x27;m use to but I can work with it so, I think I will be buying this again later on..</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this. We had a few broken colors but a few drops of rubbing alcohol  and they where good as new the next morning.</li>
            <li> I have 3 makeup boxes with many eyeshadows. Since i have bought this item theyre collecting dust. These shadows have beautiful vibrance and the pigment is wonderful. Being a person who is picky upon her makeup these shadoes make me happy. The colors you see are how they appear when worn!</li>
            <li> I love this set. It comes in a large a ray for matte and shimmery colors. This is a perfect set for a makeup artist. The eye shadow is a nice quality. its light and silky wears well. Does not flake goes on really smooth. I am a makeup artist and a die hard Mac user. This set is just as good as Mac if not better. I so recommend this product. Very pleased with this set is a understatement.</li>
            <li> If you like BOLD  colors this is the palette for you!! Use a white primer and the colors will POP! Excellent palette you will have so much fun, endless combinations  You have matte, shimmer,satin .  You will feel like a kid in a candystore.  All you makeup junkies, makeup gurus, makeup artists.  this one has your name on it.&lt;br /&gt;Only 4 stars because of the way the product was packed I received my palette intact I was very lucky.  Put a little more effort in the packaging tissue, bubble wrap etc. A bit shy to order again till the packaging gets better!</li>
            <li> I was scared that it would arrive broken up but thankfully nothing was. The colors are so pretty and pigmented. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> i received the eyeshadow palette today. i was so happy about getting for my friend ( as a gift), but to my disappointment,  sooner i opened the box, the colors felt all over my clothes and i was wearing white :( ). it was broken. i am so mad right now. i dont even know what to do about it. i am so disappointed amazon very. you should stop selling this to people. it is not fair at all. i will give it one Star for the fast delivery. but you just lost a customer.</li>
            <li> The product was packaged beautiful, but I received mine broken! A bunch of the colors were ruined and mixed in together. When I opened the package there was makeup dust all over it, yuck! Not to mention the product itself was simply glued together and you could see and feel all of the glue keeping the palette. I havent tried the makeup yet, im honestly even to afraid to use this thing because it may just fall apart! They lost a customer for sure!</li>
            <li> beautiful colors, various combinations, beautiful presentation, creamy, tastefully designed.</li>
            <li> For somebody who loves different colors and who is on a budget, this is perfect. With some primer and good make up brushes these colors show up great and for the price you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this kit the eyeshadows are amazing .money well spent.it got to me before time.I&#x27;m definitely buying other products of this brand .</li>
            <li> Wow who new that I would be getting all of these colors. The pigments are deep and true I&#x27;m very happy that I choose this palette.</li>
            <li> This Shany 180 Color Eyeshadow Palette is very nice! There is some issues with it that I get. The first issue is that a lot of the little colors fall out when I store them in my closet. When I go to open it in my closet to go bring it down it pops up and your rug is now stained with bright eyeshadow colors. That was especially unfair when I got new rug. Now I have green stained rug in my room when the whole other half is supposed to be beige. That is very annoying when there is company. Other than that, the colors are nice but only if you like bright colors. There is only a couple of neutral colors which are like dark brown. I do use it for halloween and it works wonderful. It is nice pigmented color options. Also another issue is when I first got it i slide the side to get a glimpse of the other colors and it fell right off now i have broken colors and a broken palette. Not so good</li>
            <li> I love this kit. The colors are bold and beautiful, they show up on your skin and they don&#x27;t fade away after a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I would like to start off by saying that I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t know anything about makeup..I did want to comment on the fact that I received the package today and not a single color was broken (I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews saying that theirs came broken). The colors had a thin plastic protective sheet over them and the whole thing was nicely packed inside of bubble wrap, which was inside of a thin styrofoam box, which was inside of the Shany box, which was inside of the Amazon box. My girlfriend loves eyeshadow and there seems to be a lot of cool/interesting colors in here so I think it&#x27;s a pretty good deal. It&#x27;s a present for Christmas so I won&#x27;t be able to comment/update this according to if she likes them or not until then - which I won&#x27;t remember to do - so good luck! :D</li>
            <li> I use this product a lot! I got it because I do modeling and it has so many colors that can be used wet or dry I never run out of unique looks. In fact I can use it not only for my eyes but unique features like a broken doll&#x27;s face. Mine was packaged very well with no breaks or problems. One of the plastic windows popped out but I was able to super glue that back in no problem. I can carry it with me to my shoots and haven&#x27;t had an issue. I highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> One of the best sales i ever had</li>
            <li> I was terrified to order this item after reading the horrifying reviews. I was in need of the colors for a bachelorette trip that weekend, however I was not in the mood to open up my order with broken colors!!! If the order was damaged, I wouldn&#x27;t have enough time to return the item for a replacement... So I did what any normal girl would do: I sat at my computer and prayed that no issues would happen!!!  I took a chance and ordered the product. I was nervous until the order arrived at my house. It was the most dramatic experience I&#x27;ve ever had as I anxiously opened the box. I was very happy, like I had won the lottery, when I opened the box and there was not a mess of colorful dust and no colors were broken!!!! Yesssss!!!! Sweet success!!! I was somewhat bummed when I saw that the colors didn&#x27;t have any neon or mega bright shades included. Thankfully I already have shades that help me exhibit my undying love for Lisa Frank and Jem! The colors are beautiful on, especially when applied on top of primer. I&#x27;m a medium toned African American and the colors show up just fine. I always get compliments on my application. I&#x27;m thankful I took the chance to order. Kudos to Amazon&#x27;s packaging! It looks like they really fixed the packaging nightmare!!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love the vibrant colors in this set, so many wonderful choices to pick from, it has been used many times for my nieces graduations &amp; proms, love it 💋</li>
            <li> My co-worker had one of these, and after seeing how pigmented they are, and how many colors, I decided to get rid of my eye shadow clutter and go with this. I was not disappointed! You really don&#x27;t need anything else, and the mirror is nice and big, I love it!</li>
            <li> This came broken and the eyeshadow beneath the top layer was broken and mess up the entire kit and the part to slide came out... was not nice at all bcuz i bought it as a gift. Very disappointing... i shipped outside the us so i cant ship back and i want a refund</li>
            <li> LOVE IT only wish it had blush</li>
            <li> The colors alone made me fall in love with this pallet, even before I used it! All of the colors are vibrant and stunning when applied, and the sparkle shows well with the glittery and metallic shades. So far I have only tested a few of the shades but I can&#x27;t wait to try them all out. Absolutely love this product</li>
            <li> The colors were indeed into each other when I opened.  I took pictures.  It&#x27;s great that there are so many but you can tell it&#x27;s not good quality as I kept having to clean the makeup from my cheek bones as they kept falling even after I had applied primer.  May be sending this back too.  :(</li>
            <li> I love love love this palette. So bright. Not one eyeshadow was broken. Happy!!</li>
            <li> I love to make my makeup match my outfit and with this palette of colors that is never a problem. They are very pigmented and last all day. It was a great deal and everyday is a adventure in eyeshadow!</li>
            <li> Absolutely in love with this! Bright and beautiful!  Arrived very quickly and in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> In person, the colors look exactly like the picture, and, when you apply them, they are very beautiful and vibrant (once again, just like the picture).&lt;br /&gt;I got this mainly because I wear a lot of black clothes with various,bright colors and wanted a nice range of various colored eyeshadow to match my outfits...plus, I love to wear black eyeshadow and this has 3 individual, very dark, ones!! &amp;#60;3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got this in the mail (it&#x27;s been a couple days that I&#x27;ve had it) the white was broken (not completely, only maybe the top quarter) and the powder was everywhere (..strangely, even on the outside of the case), but I&#x27;m not bothered by little mishaps like that (it might have been a mistake made in transit, anyway...who knows).&lt;br /&gt;The delivery processes was very fast, I was impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered (at the same time) &amp;#34;SHANY Eye and Lip Primer/Base&amp;#34; not only to help bring out the vibrancy of the colors but also to keep the eyeshadow on throughout the day. It came in the mail in the same package as this palette. I love the primer as well.&lt;br /&gt;(link to the SHANY primer I bought on Amazon.com):&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OQAUEA6?psc&#x3D;1&amp;redirect&#x3D;true&amp;ref_&#x3D;oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first time trying any SHANY product and I am one happy customer :)</li>
            <li> Great eye shadow pallets. Too many of the same colors. I wish they had more different colors. But over all the eye shadows are pigmented. A couple of them arrived broken. Great customer service from amazon put my heart at ease.</li>
            <li> Best colors! My wife loves these and wears them all the time. :)</li>
            <li> I have heard that this product was not delivered properly, it was broken before it even shipped, but mine was in great condition. I was also afraid that this would be that liquid jelly eye makeup stuff... but it isn&#x27;t and i am very happy with my 180 shades of eyeshadow. The only problem is that there are some colors that I would never get if they were being sold separately.</li>
            <li> I was extremely nervous because the product had such amazing reviews but almost everyone complained about the Shipping, so when mine came I was terrified to open it. But to my luck everything was perfect none were broken. The colors are vibrant they last all day. Love all the greens and pink my fAvorite two colors. I highly recommend all the make up lovers to buy this product. Worth the money!! Love it</li>
            <li> OMG so many colors. Very vibrant and pretty! I am going to enjoy this tremendously! Shipping was fast.  I received it in 2 days. Everything was intact! None were broken. I was concern reading previous reviews but didn&#x27;t have any problems with my order. Will order again!</li>
            <li> I wanted this palette to take on vacation so I paid for expedited shipping.  It arrived very rapidly in perfect condition. I noticed several reviews stated that the shadows were damaged when they received it; I don&#x27;t know how.  The palette was wrapped in bubble wrap then in a styrofoam package package, then in a box then in a shipping box with bubble wrap. It was very well protected. The colors are beautiful and while the product is a powder eyeshadow it has the staying power of a cream. I am very pleased with this palette.  As I usually by high end products and pay $15. to $25. for one eye shadow I found myself extremely pleased with the cost.</li>
            <li> Great collection of makeup.  Lots of nice colors and in a nice case as well with useful mirrors built in.</li>
            <li> I really love the vast amount of colors in this palette. I have been able to achieve many great looks from this product. I voted four stars only because some colors require water to achieve a high definition look. Overall, this is a great product for any girl.</li>
            <li> I love it works great!!!</li>
            <li> The quality was perfect as it whas been during the last couple of years that I have uses Shany products. beatiful case and good colors.</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette as a personal Christmas gift and I was very disappointed. This is the second time I replaced it, the first time all the little eyeshadows were either completely destroyed or cracked. I have paid A LOT less for other eyeshadow palettes I have ordered as gifts and the packaging kept them in great shape, I didn&#x27;t pay very much for this palette either but that doesn&#x27;t excuse the lack of caring and packaging. You would think that a business who is in the retail business and eats of off what your customers purchase from you would care a little more about keeping their customers happy and coming back, but believe me this company will never receive one more penny from me nor will I recommend this company, and I will let everyone know how crappy they do. The packaging was horrible the first time and the second time.</li>
            <li> I really wish i did not need this item for a vacation that i am taking because i would sooo return it. not because i dont like it but because it arrived so damaged there are 8 eyeshadows damaged beyond repair. when i opened this box i already knew that it was damaged because eyeshadow powder fell all over my carpet i really luv the product but just think that the shipping needs to be rethought. im so disappointed i have to stay with this one but i guess its my loss. i wouldl greatly appreciate if amazon would make this right somehow.</li>
            <li> Very nice for any age</li>
            <li> It came on time and I loooooooove it so much!! It&#x27;s so girlie and fancy I will be purchasing for Shany again!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was expecting for the price. I really love this pallet because I like the uncommon colors, like reds and oranges, which this includes, along with all the normal colors everyone else wants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as a disclaimer, I only really use this as supporting colors, or for minor details. I suggest using this with a primer of some kind, most pallette eyeshadows don&#x27;t hold up to natural eye oils (which is no fault of the eyeshadow - I would recommend primer anyway!). Depending on the look, I usually just prime these with my concealer, and use the eyeshadow to set it in place. If I&#x27;m doing a more ridiculous look with dark colors, I&#x27;ll use my normal primers: I do both the potion primer by Urban Decay and a nude eyeshadow primer by Nyx. Either one is probably enough on its own, but I think the potion primer is to die for, but I like the natural background color of the Nyx one - I have some pretty visible veins without coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The original one that I received had a couple of cracked colors, including black - which got destroyed and spread everyyywheeere. I took pictures as I unpacked it just to be safe, but the seller made the exchange process very easy. I didn&#x27;t even need the pictures. The new one I got was absolutely perfect, not a single cracked color, all as expected. Kudos on that!</li>
            <li> Great pigment, variety,last all day. Looks great! I love it!!</li>
            <li> This product took about 6 days to come in; I didnt get an expedited shipping. Was in-tact and the colors are very vibrant! The shape of the box makes for good storage. Very compact way to have so many colors in one place.</li>
            <li> sometimes it is hard for me to find eye shadow that doesn&#x27;t look so cheap and chalky.The colors are well pigmented  on my skin. You might have to put a lot on to see the colors but it is was worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all, must use a primer for color to stick and last long, but lots of fall out...don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll order again tho, because of the fall out...</li>
            <li> The colors look great and nothing was broken, best part was it came on time. Can&#x27;t wait to try it out.</li>
            <li> I was simply amazed when I received this. I knew it was going to have plenty of colors, but each pallet I opened, I was more amazed. It looks like there are duplicate colors, but each pallet is a different shade: glitter, matte, shiny. I love Shany products and have bought this collection as well as several other products. The colors are vibrant and the shadows go on great without having to use a ton to stand out. Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> I never leave reviews but I had to for this! This product could cost $60 and it would still be worth it. The pigment in these eye shadows is incredible and you should use a concealer on your lid first to prime for best results. Although in the picture it looks like your getting the same color over and over again, or repeats, it&#x27;s actually different versions!! You might have a specific shade of blue and then you have it in shimmer and in speckled. I have a 44 color palette from ELF, and I have Naked 2 from Urban Decay, but I can honestly say I don&#x27;t need them now. This palette is way more pigmented and saturated in color. Best investment ever!</li>
            <li> I love it perfect pigments! I read the reviews before I bought it and honestly was a bit scared with my purchase seeing that it was my first and alot of ppl complained about getting broken pallets and the eye shadows themselves would be broken but mine was perfect! Not one shadow broke and I live in Trinidad so it had to go from the seller to Miami then to Trinidad which is alot of movement and it was still perfect and i got my package in about a week&#x27;s time so i&#x27;m happy and hoping for the same results with other purchases!</li>
            <li> I ordered this palette &amp; I adore it! It&#x27;s very pigmented (as everyone admits) &amp; you cannot beat  the price. I ordered this after having ordered a huge MAC palette, which I usually wear, but I find that I use this palette WAY MORE! I love &amp; I just purchased 5 of Shany&#x27;s other palettes! I love Shany products!</li>
            <li> I should have listened to the reviews about this product as far as what it looked like once it was actually received. I have ordered the 120-palette already and it came in perfect condition. When I got this 180 I knew something was wrong once I opened the box and had a table full of black. Once i took it out of the box it was covered in dust....I don&#x27;t understand as a seller...how you can let something like this come to a customer. I opened and I have about 6-7 different colors broken partially or completely. Not worth going through the hassle of requesting a refund, i will just bite the bullet and take it as a loss,</li>
            <li> Only problem is it should have a brush or 2 or place to put brushes</li>
            <li> Loved this. Absolutely in love every last color is super pigmented. Easy to blend. Threw out all my old crappy pallets after a week of using these. I&#x27;ve been recommending these like crazy</li>
            <li> This palette is so colorful and a girl could have this forever. It has so much bright fun colors and these eyeshadows are soo pigmented. The price is also a good deal :)</li>
            <li> Update 8/10/2012 :  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this palette. I love all the nice bright colors and how easy these these are to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 8/3/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loving that dual color shadows in this palette :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This palette is beyond amazing! The shadows are so pigmented... A little goes a long way! With this palette I won&#x27;t need to spend all of my money on expensive mac shadows and pigments.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow is no joke I love make up I&#x27;ve tried them all but this by far is my favorite plus it has soooo many different shades for the ones that love loud eyeshadow even those who like to keep it neutral. I think this is a great product and I won&#x27;t have to buy anymore eyeshadow for a very long time. The packaging was also good no broken shadows or anything this is a must have.&lt;br /&gt;#ImJustSaying</li>
            <li> I love the different array of colors, they all look wonderful on any skin tone and I did not have any problems with the packaging</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a loud person and sometimes I want my makeup to express that. This kit is the perfect job for that. ALL of the colors are rich and vibrant. Application is creamy and seamless. The pigments stick to the brush easily without leaving excess powder - which is something I really appreciate. If you&#x27;re looking to define your style and express yourself this is a must have!</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are beautiful. Every color is bright and vivid and you really can&#x27;t beat the price. I highly suggest buying these over any other eye shadow.</li>
            <li> beautiful vibrant colors, true to color application and long wearing, a must have if you like lots of different looks day by day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving how many colors are in this set. I have a different color for everyday for the entire year, just by simply mixing some colors together! great value!</li>
            <li> A wonderful eyeshadow collection.  This collection fits all skin tones and undertones. This set can be used used for women of all ages, from teen to senior.  This collection has great colors that fit everyday life.  The colors work for home, night out, school, work, shopping, etc.. You get so many and the blending possibilities are mind boggeling. The colors are highly pigmented and long lasting.  I use brushes to apply makeup and the colors spread on smoothly and evenly. A wonderful collection. Linda W.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my color palette. Vibrant colors, shiny metallics, brilliant long lasting shades. Really wonderful for a great price. LOVE. IT.</li>
            <li> I LUV IT I WOULD GET THIS PRODUCT ANYTIME  THE COLORS LAST A WHILE I KNOW U WOULD LUV IT TOO</li>
            <li> Pigment not that great but you get what you pay for. Fun colors. I just wish they were deeper and lasted longer.</li>
            <li> It was a little dusty but nothing broken like others have said its gonna make a great Xmas gift</li>
            <li> Just recieve this palette that my husband purchased for me. I sooooooo love it. The packaging was great, not one single shadow broken. The quality of these shadows is amazing. Great pigmentation! Even better than what I imagined. I will definately purchase more shany cosmetics. I heard their brush sets are great quality as well. Will comment on that once recieved.</li>
            <li> You NEED to have this set for summer! Neons are super trendy right now and this pallet helps you create those super trendy looks. The colors are all highly pigmented and last for hours! Perfect for those hot summer days (and nights!). Create thousands of looks with just this one set!</li>
            <li> When I viewed this product online, the super loud colors screamed my name! So fun for tutorials! When it was sent to me though, one of the layers had broken off and there was a lot of shimmery colorful dust everywhere! I cleaned up the mess and was satisfied with the swatches I did. The pigmentation was excellent, I love the colors for brights and pastels in spring and summer! This is similar to the bh cosmetics and coastal scents palettes. Not one of Shany&#x27;s best palettes, and I might recommend this to a friend. Shany has better shadows though, buy them!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews for this palette. The good and the bad. Most of the bad reviews were because of the shipping (broken case, cracked shadow/plastic, etc) and not the quality of the product itself. I decided to purchase anyways, i can always get a refund, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my package in two days. The palette was wrapped in several layers of  bubble wrap. There was absolutely NO damage to the palette, it was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is very nice and easy to use. I&#x27;ll admit, i was thinking it would be cheap and flimsy because of the price, but that&#x27;s not the case here. The case seems very durable, and of good quality. All parts work properly and the design is very practical and functional. Some palettes come apart and there&#x27;s like a million pieces scattered all over your makeup table, not this one! The case itself is very convenient, functional, and it&#x27;s easy to find the colors your looking for. I give it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now lets talk about the eyeshadows themselves. Again, because of the price, i was expecting a low quality product. Again, i was wrong. The colors are very eye catching and beautiful. Shadows are matte, shimmer, and some are glittery (there&#x27;s no glitter in them that i can see). I was impressed. These shadows are very pigmented as well. The color you see, is what you get. I was worried i wouldn&#x27;t like them because of the high pigmentation, but i was wrong, again! These shadows can go on very light, making it easy to build up your look, and they blend perfectly as well. You can also pack on the color in one swipe too! And most amazing of all, these shadows last and your look doesn&#x27;t fade as with some other pigment shadows. If i could rate this product a 10, i would, and im a hard woman  to please when it comes to makeup!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to everyone! Anyone from beginners to professional makeup artists will love this! I will definitely be buying more shany products in the future. :)</li>
            <li> Shany&#x27;s eye shadows are fantastic! Highly pigmented- I have medium toned skin and even the light pinks show up on me! This is the perfect palette if you like experimenting with different eye looks!</li>
            <li> These super pigmented colors are my go to for everyday use and for my professional use. It has every color I need in an easy to carry pallet that I am sure my makeup is secure in. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this kit, but it came horribly damaged. the remaining shadows were fantastic! i was horribly disappointed in the broken ones. thats why this gets 4 stars but other than that i love using this palette.</li>
            <li> The pigmentation is so high quality with this palette</li>
            <li> Now for the fun stuff... this palette has all your fun colors in one place to create bold and fun eye looks! Love these palettes from Shany!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE EVERYTHING!!! NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH MY PRODUCT AND IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS!!! WILL BUY MORE ONCE NEEDED!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my sister as a Christmas present and when she opened the package initially everything looked fine, but when she opened the eyeshadow palette a lot of the colors were broken as if someone had smashed it on the ground or something. There were colors all over the place. I&#x27;m going to be sending this back and if I get a full refund I&#x27;ll see if purchasing this again will be worth it.</li>
            <li> Came in intant! no colors broke or anything, happy with this poduct</li>
            <li> This is not what I was expecting in the quality of the pigment of the eyeshadow</li>
            <li> I looked for quite awhile trying to make a decision,and buying this set was a great one! Colors are highly pigmented,none were cracked upon arrival and shipping was super fast. I was looking for shadows that would be useful for regular makeup as well as fx makeup as well and these were a great choice. I highly recommend any from this brand!</li>
            <li> I personally love bright and bold colors over neutral ones, so I absolutely love this pallet. It&#x27;s right up my ally. They are beautiful and decently pigmented.</li>
            <li> I was really worried about buying this after all the bad reviews saying that the eyeshadows were broken, but I ordered it anyways and I&#x27;m glad I did because they came just fine and I love the colors and quality of the eyeshadow for a good price!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the colors/pigment, I&#x27;m still a beginner and learning to use it.</li>
            <li> The range of colors is perfect especially the matt colors. It also has a section with mixed colors and i thought that was genius</li>
            <li> I love this product because the price is reasonable for a product that is great in quality. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product...eyeshadows are easily blended and the color is excellent...WOW! I am hooked on Shany eyeshadows and will purchase more...I will STRONGLY recommend this product to anyone...give it a try. :-)</li>
            <li> I just received my shadow palette and i love it.  There are so many colors (180 obviously) and they are all so bright and strong pigmented.  Even without a primer these colors are vibrant and lasting.  I can&#x27;t wait to play more with blending them together for new exciting effects.  The packaging was fine, all my shadows are undamaged and the box is fully functioning.  There are no applicators in the package so if this is for a gift for someone new to makeup you may want to also purchase some brushes or sponge applicators.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase.  The colors are small but when you are getting 180 for $30 you can&#x27;t expect more with this kind of quality.  A must buy :D</li>
            <li> Not happy with the way I recieved it. It had broken colors and was a mess all over the box.</li>
            <li> all the colors are great</li>
            <li> very professional make up set. I had used this brand before and knew how good it was. could have asked for a more extensive array of colors. loved it.</li>
            <li> buy this the colors are gorgeous. I usually use only mac cosmetics and was happily surprised to find the pigment quality with this brand is just as good and last all day. also it came in perfect condition not one eyeshadow was broken not even cracked. I know that some of the reviews said that it was delivered a broken mess but mine came absolutely perfect they must have fixed the shipping problems. the colors are absolutely gorgeous and so vibrant and each one is unique no two colors are the same definitely worth buying</li>
            <li> I love this! When I got it I was like a kid in a candy store! There&#x27;s every color I could ever dream of having and more!</li>
            <li> I was fortunate with receiving my order without the contents being broken so as far as that goes I can say it was a good purchase. Okay now down to the product itself. Being a person who indulges in bright &amp;#34;rockstar&amp;#34; eye makeup I purchased this for the fact it seemed like multiple variations of brightly pigmented shadows. The makeup is bright though not as bright as pictured. I have tried the makeup with two different shadow primers both yielded similar results that was striking color difficult to remove. The four star rating is simply because I have other bright shadows from different makers that seemed to wear brighter. These are non expensive brands that I compare to, so it&#x27;s not a point of getting what you paid for. Over all if your needing a good starting point to venture into experimenting with eye looks this is the ideal purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this being afraid of my palette being broken. It came and it was perfect nothing broken at all. The colors are very bright and they worked well with my primer. The only reason I gave 4 starts is that i thought the circles of eyeshadow themselves were big like quarter size, but when I recieved the pallete they were more on the side of a dime :(. I&#x27;m stil happy though because where can you find bright colors like that at this price??</li>
            <li> I bought this for my god daughter and she loves it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really loving this palette. It has so many different colors and I had no problem with how it was package. I recommend this for anyone wanting to expand their makeup collection.</li>
            <li> I know were supposed to write about this product on behalf of amazon, but I really wanted to write a review for this product even though I didn&#x27;t get it through amazon. After reading so many reviews on this product I was worried to get this product through amazon because of the shipping and how so many people have received their products with cracks, so I bought it through the company website itself. When I got it it was handled with great care and there was not a single crack and there was not a single issue. I love all the colors, great quality and great for the price!!! I would not suggest this for those who don&#x27;t want their eyeshadow to stand out since their aren&#x27;t that many neutral or \\&quot;naked\\&quot; colors. These are bold and very colorful eyeshadows, but they are gorgeous! Love this product! I would recommend this to anyone who loves to experiment with colors, and even though I love getting my products through amazon, I would recommend getting it through the company because they make sure their products are handled with care. Until amazon marks these products with fragile handling, I would suggest buying it through Shany.</li>
            <li> o my goodness. this is the best eyeshadow i have ever purchased. It is long lasting and i promise u its almost waterproof. I recommend this eyeshadow to all the ladies out there. i even got my boss buying it. yea buddy</li>
            <li> I ordered this product despite some of the bad reviews because I purchased from shany cosmetics before. I will say when I received it there was one broken eyeshadow and it was a minor crack. The colors were amazing! So good I just had to test them out. I loved it!! The colors are very well pigmented and bright and the variety was everything I needed. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> THIS EYESHADOWS ARE BESUTIFUL! The colors are amazing! Package was great! I got them on time and no eyeshadow was broke! I love them!</li>
            <li> This is such a great investment for any makeup lover. It proves you don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune for good product. Great pigment in these colors - even the lighter shades are visible with just one swipe! They really last and the colors are so vibrant!</li>
            <li> I was sooo scared when I read these reviews! It seems like everybody got their eyeshadows in a crumbly mess, but I gambled on it and this palette is in perfect shape and its AMAZING!! I&#x27;m on a serious budget right now and for the first time I can&#x27;t afford all MAC everything...well thank goodness because this palette cost as much as one of their individual colors and it&#x27;s the same quality! I&#x27;m seriously amazed...and excited! :-)</li>
            <li> Ordered this Palette after watching a review on youtube! I compared it to the reviews of other palettes as well n i just liked the different color option available!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived alot sooner than I expected, and considering the fact that Im in Germany I was ecstatic! All of the youtube reviews stated that the biggest issue was shipping because some colors would be cracked or completely destroyed from handling. I knew it was a risk, but i really wanted this palette but to luckily only 4 colors were cracked with minor dusting in the palette. None were completely destroyed and i am VERY PLEASED with my purchase. The colors are soooooooooooooooo vibrant and pigmented even on my brown complexion and it works well on really dark complextions as well...very very good product!!! Stays on bright even without a primer or base, but twice as good with the base applied. I know it will last me a long time as well because you don&#x27;t have to use alot to get the color or shade you desire, one application is enough unlike department store brands. I can only imagine the different looks i can acquire with it! like i said its my first palette although i have lots of experience with shadows and color this is the first palette I think was actually worth buying....even given the shipping risks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complain would be that some of the colors come out of the compartment and I had to glue the base of them back in. But no biggie at all! Shany Cosmetics is now on my top list of must haves!!!</li>
            <li> i ordered this last month, it arrived within 5 days. it was wrapped in bubble wrap and packaged very nicely, and when i opened it a couple of the pods where cracked and fallen out, so i sent it back and got a new one which came within 2 days and everything was great. i really love the colors they are so beautiful and vibrant. i would buy it again without second thoughts.(:</li>
            <li> this product is really good considering the range u get. The colors pop out even without a primer. Clearly a good deal.</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!! I love this and I&#x27;ll never purchase another brand again!</li>
            <li> I like the pigments. There is alot of variety!  I love the case also!&lt;br /&gt;I bought this for my cousin and I and they came early but out of the two palettes&lt;br /&gt;we lost three eye-shadows during shipping! I would have given it Five starts if not for that reason!</li>
            <li> Would recommend this product to everyone who likes a variety of shades to choose from, with several shades including a matte and shimmer version of each color.</li>
            <li> Looooove Shany Cosmetics !!! Eye shadows ALWAYS  outlast your 18hr day !!!!!! Most durable eye makeup everrrrr</li>
            <li> I absolutely love all the colors that came with it. When I got it, it was not only in it&#x27;s original packaging, but bubble wrapped as well inside a bigger box.  I did have to dust the inside of it a bit as some of the color \\&quot;Powerdered\\&quot; off, but that&#x27;s to be expected.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are rich and vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;I especially love the mauves and the bright colors.&lt;br /&gt;I get complimented all the time when I use duos w/ whatever color I put on.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve already told several of my girlfriends to check it out.</li>
            <li> These eye shadows are amazing, every color the eye can see! There&#x27;s even a nifty, little mirror inside. Definitely worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> This is a really affordable pallet, it has all the colors that you can use to create many looks with.  The eye shadows are very pigmented and vibrant. The package is well made and sturdy enough for traveling,</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE. I&#x27;ve had the 120 palette for a couple years before I got this. They are very comparable to each other in terms of pigmentation. This palette gives you more choices. There are some duplicates colors but I believe that&#x27;s ok since each color is the size of a penny.  I know some people complain that there came cracked. Mine personally didn&#x27;t shatter in the mail but just be warned there is always that possibility when you are having makeup shipped to you. Not to worry though because you can always repress the shadows and they are as good as new. That being said, be careful not to drop this palette because the eye shadows are really soft.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who loves makeup because you can create so many looks with it.</li>
            <li> i love this palette! the thought of putting color on my eyes was scary but then i started to like it after i kept on using it! there wonderful colors and very pigmented!</li>
            <li> i was recently looking for a really good 180 color palette and when i found this one i was soo excited to try it! there are soo many varieties of colors and i feel like with this palette i won&#x27;t ever have to worry about running out of options.</li>
            <li> I purchased this set for my friend as a gift since she loves using bright colors for her eyes. She absolutely loved it! I checked it before I gave it to her and thankfully none of the eyeshadows weren&#x27;t cracked!! :) There&#x27;s no flaw with the cool, warm, or bright eyeshadows except for the double effect shadows. We didn&#x27;t see the speckle effect at all but the colors are still gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I love it. Although some of the colors repeat themselves.</li>
            <li> I will say i was nervous about buying this kit, however I absolutely love it!!! By far the best eyeshadow i have used. I have dark skin and the colors show up very well and vibrant. This is a pallet that contains colors for every occasion. I encourage you all to buy from Shany Cosmetics it is awesome and no eyeshadow were damaged from delivered. I will def be buying more pallets as Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> It arrived without damage. It&#x27;s lovely! Everything was sufficient. The case is sturdy. The colors are as bold as they appear. I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Colors weren&#x27;t showing up when out on &amp; some where shattered when I recieved it.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeshadow set. I would buy another when over and over. Has so many different colors. It is a definite buy.</li>
            <li> I am very much in love with this product! The only reason I am giving it a 4 star is because a couple of the colors were broken. I do have small comtainers I can transfer them too as to not bother the other beautiful shades. I will purchase from this company again and again...thank you so much.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to be insane to blow your hard-earned money on Mac or Nars when you can get this enormous comprehensive palette for the price of ONE single Mac eyeshadow.  They&#x27;re highly pigmented, incredibly good quality.  Do yourself a favor and buy this NOW.</li>
            <li> I was reading everyone&#x27;s review and was terrified that the palette was going to come broken and destroyed. Mine came bubblewrapped about 15 times, and was completely intact. I think that the manufacturer has fixed the shipping since these problems occurred. I went ahead and did it, because your only out like 30 bucks! Great palette with lots of fun colors! I would order from SHANY again.</li>
            <li> This is such a good one. I like the red colors! it is very useful! and the double-effect colors are all very good!</li>
            <li> When I first read the reviews on this product I was scared to buy it for the simple fact that I kept reading it was delivered broken, but I took a chance because I heard the product was very good,when my package came in it was well secured and nothing was broken! The colors are to die for! Every single color Is well pigmented ! I recommend this product !</li>
            <li> Amazing color selection, amazing variety, gorgeous mirror, very nice see through panels, perfect timing, all in all, I Love it !</li>
            <li> I was so worried when i ordered this cause of some reviews about the shipping, but i my amazing 180 eyeshadow color palette brand Shany came in 3 days early, in a box with about 7 feet of bubble wrap, wrapped around it and when i finally got the bubble wrap off there was another box an in the box another layer of bubble wrap and i was sooo excited!!! It was so greatly packaged not one color was damaged nor the case, and it arrived early, the colors are so amazingly vivid and so many, i cant imagine needing another eyeshadow color. So definately 10 stars from me! Thanks :o)</li>
            <li> This make up is awesome stays on nicely but the best part is how beautiful the color goes on! You get practically every color in the world! Its amazing,  i didn&#x27;t notice there is another pallet under the middle pallet for a few days and it made me so happy!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!! Still reach for this over my high end shadows alot I love so many varieties in one box!!!</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN A SHANY CUSTOMER FOR THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AND I LOVED THIS ORDER AS MUCH AS THE LAST! :) NO BROKEN SHADOWS ECT. PLUS ILL ADD THE FIRST AND LAST TIME I HAD A BROKEN SHADOW, IT WAS REPLACED. COMPLETELY HASSLE FREE.</li>
            <li> I have been using eye shadow consistently sense I was 12 years old. I am 28 now and have only a few times come across shadows this true to color. These shadows could be compared to MAC because of the quality of vibrancy, which I have used over the past 6 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  You know when you buy a really awesome color of shadow and your so excited to use it and you go to apply it and it&#x27;s much lighter than expected? Yea, that wont happen with this palette! When applied, the yellow is YELLOW! The purple is PURPLE!!! I have started playing with colors everyday! I ordered this product for rave make up. It stayed vibrant ALL NIGHT (about 6 hours of dancing) without the use of a primer. After experimenting with a primer and a white base, I found the shadows themselves to be very easy to work with. They will stay put where you want them, and are also easy to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  There are so many shades in this palette I was surprised when I opened it. Make sure you open the very bottom level of shadows, because, guess what? THERE&#x27;S MORE SHADES HIDING!! It is perfect! The case design makes it so easy to store as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Point being, the colors are so pure and so vibrant. I Have never written a product review before, but I just had to for this. This palette is an investment. Incredible shade choices, excellent quality, and fantastic case design.</li>
            <li> Alot of review said that this item came with several broken palette, mine came perfectly packaged and not a single one broken. Tried out a few of the colors and with the primer these were ridiculously bright.</li>
            <li> i love this so much one color came broken but luckily their was 2 of the same shade , lasts long , would definitely but again ! :)</li>
            <li> My girlfriend absolutely loves this makeup set.  She has used it for a long time now and has nothing but great  things to say about it.</li>
            <li> Fun shadow colors and go on nicely.  I gave 3 stars because they are not as bright as I expected and they do not show in black light.</li>
            <li> Lots of bright and vibrant colors! So many looks can be created with this palette, would make for a great gift!</li>
            <li> There are 120 different shades! Perfect for the summer, there will be every shade of color you will need! A good idea for a gift! :)</li>
            <li> I love all the bright beautiful colors in this palette, and when it arrived at my home it only had 2 of the eyeshadows broken and they were colors I will probably never use. But any way I highly suggest getting this palette if you love bright colors. &#x3D;3</li>
            <li> My girlfriend&#x27;s daughter is a makeup artists and says the pigment is amazing.</li>
            <li> The package arrived in time and the kit its just fine,nothing broken even I was afraid of such things due to distance.Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great colors and quality</li>
            <li> Wow.  Great colors and blend well to make other shades.</li>
            <li> I Love the colors that came with this eyeshadow palette. They are bright and very pigmented. I am very pleased with this eyeshadow palette, and the way it is set up. The packaging of this product was excellent. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This was thee perfect birthday gift to give to my best friend! She loves to experiment with colors and such so now I know she uses it everyday. She loves that there are so many different choices and they all stay on her lids! Great product, my best friend adores this!</li>
            <li> Colors aren&#x27;t as bright and vibrant of a pigment as it says. Also when I tried using the eyeshadow it was not easy to spread over eyelid. It left some areas darker than others.</li>
            <li> Love this palette!! It arrived in prefect condition and a day early! It has so many colors to choose from and they stay on very well (although, I do use eyeshadow primer). Very much worth the $25 I spent! I definitely would recommend this product to those who who are looking for a great palette at an affordable price!</li>
            <li> Much bigger then I thought but love it</li>
            <li> Just received mine today. Loved it so much !!!</li>
            <li> All I have to say is awesome! Love this! Fantastic colors great quality makeup!  Would definitely recommend this to makeup lovers</li>
            <li> Love my item. Package didn&#x27;t come broken like other said. I will buy it again. I will give it five.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Fast shipping and everything arrived in perfect condition. All the colors are beautiful and are very pigmented. Definitely would recommend!!</li>
            <li> Well first time ever that I buy makeup online and really I don&#x27;t have a complaint about it because it has all this beautiful colors in it but I do have to say that the packging has to be done better it was ok not that bad but When I got mine it had one color that was broken but other than that its awsome!!!</li>
            <li> these shadows are great! colors are great for summer because they are so bright i&#x27;m in love with them! and the box is so cute!</li>
            <li> the colors in this palette are so bright and vibrant. perfect for the current neon trend. a good price for the amount of eyeshadow you get.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been waiting 5 days later and still haven&#x27;t sent out my order!! Terrible business! Very slow and I emailed 4 times with no espouse!</li>
            <li> These are all GoreJuss and highly pigmented colors, and I love them.! This is a beautiful palette and has a great case. :). I read some reviews that said that the pots were broken when they recieved the palette, and that there was color everywhere, but I didn&#x27;t have that problem. I recieved my palette with no dust and no broken pots, and was completely ecstatic to see how beautiful and bright it truely was.! I recommend this palette to anyone who wants neon eyeshadows. :).</li>
            <li> I bought this as a starter eye shadow kit &amp; it is great! Money well spent.. When I got the eye shadow kit it was perfect as none of the colours were broken nor was the kit itself damaged. I absolutely love the colour options as they give different shades and variety. Some of the colours are very bright, they are all smooth &amp; has a silky, soft texture to each of them, they are long lasting, easy to blend &amp; most of all it provides you with the option of day to night look. I have fun mixing the colours &amp; trying new looks on myself and on friends. I would recommend it to anyone..</li>
            <li> Wow i soo recomend this product. I was a little scare to order it thru amazon by reading all the negative packaging reviews but i took the risk from reviewing the quality of the product n knowing amazon is a secure website to order from i have to admit i was not dissappointed at all even though i was ready for it i was extremely happy to see my product well packaged n double secure with alot of bubble wrapping inside non of my eyeshadows where broken or cracked amazon did an awesome job in delivering my package secure n on time since i choosed nxt day delivery luv it.</li>
            <li> i like this brand alot, i like aLL the nice color &amp; how it just stay on all day. im able to do my rainbow colors:)&lt;br /&gt;the only that i didnt like that one of the color was broken but just one &amp; i can deal with it!&lt;br /&gt;i will be ordering another 1 when im out..</li>
            <li> I love the bright colors and there are so many different combinations you can achieve with this pallet! And it arrived so fast without anything damaged!!! Will be buying from them again</li>
            <li> This has every color under the sun.Smooth not powdery like other brands, colors are vibrant and the casing was great!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time i bought shany products...so i was a bit worried abt the product quality...but it surpriced me...really happy with the product quality...the colours are awesome...very happy customer...</li>
            <li> This pallet a great to use for all the different types of make up that I do. Id recommend to anyone !</li>
            <li> This eye shadow really works. I was a bit hesitant because I read all of the reviews before buying the 180 color pallet and the biggest issue was people&#x27;s pallets arriving broken. However, put all concerns to rest on that score. My pallet arrived completely intact. It had big bubbles in the box so it couldn&#x27;t move with additional double layer of bubble wrap around the package itself. I think that whatever was wrong with the shipping method when those comments were made has been fixed not only because my package was fine, but also the more recent comments from about 2013 on are all good and the bad comments were all made in 2012. As to the quality of the eye shadow it is amazing. Every color on the pallet was as vibrant as in the picture. The size of the individual colors is about the size of a dime, but believe me when I say that will last forever. It only takes a little dab with one of my brushes to do almost both of my eyes and the color shows up incredibly well. Granted I am very fair skinned so this might not show up the same on other skin tones as well (for that I would check other peoples comments and not just mine). Overall I am very satisfied with this product and I will most definitely buy again if I ever run out.</li>
            <li> This pallet has such fun vibrant colors that really makes me step out of my makeup box. They are smooth rich colors that can hold there own on your eyes. What you see is exactly what you get. They are easily blended with each other to bring your wildest color combos to life. Not to mention that they really take pride in packaging the pallet so when it gets to you there aren&#x27;t any broken eyeshadows. When I first opened up this pallet it was like a gift that kept on giving. Its a fun pallet and I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> You will be totally blown away by the colours and the variety in this case. Also, the picture doesn&#x27;t show that in the middle there is another section underneath.....you will fall in love. The colours stay and are easy to blend. The options are just endless. I would recommend the spend. The size for each colour is ok and because it is so bright you don&#x27;t have to use alot for results.</li>
            <li> I was surprised when I recieved this palette and the payoff of pigmention was great. I needed a good neon palette for awhile and came arcoss this one for such a good buy!</li>
            <li> This is an absolute must have for any makeup user in the entire world!!! So many colors that you will never have to buy again...ok or atleast not for a VERY long time. VERY pigmented and go on super smooth!! Very high quality and beautifully packaged!!!</li>
            <li> This comes with 180 colors, for an amazing price. These colors are both natural yet vibrant so you can wear them during the day or at night. The box is very convenient for storage since it comes with so many colors, yet its not to big. I recommend this product to anyone who is just starting with a collection and just by buying this one product has a bunch of colors. This product is also great for someone who is trying to expand their collection, or is a makeup artist as a job, it is great for traveling with.</li>
            <li> this palette is awsome i love it and i will be buying another one. My daughter is trying to claim it. Lol. :-) :-) :-)</li>
            <li> This makeup palette is the best of it&#x27;s kind, and you absolutely can&#x27;t beat this price especially for the great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Colors are super pigmented and blend really really well. I recommend! :)</li>
            <li> these eye shadows are beautiful! every shade is just perfect and great quality! i would definitally reccomend these eye shadows to everyone and anyone.</li>
            <li> he quality of this product FAR exceeded my expectations! It arrived well before I expected it, it was wrapped and packaged beautifully, it was in perfect condition when I received it (thank you, Flossy!!!), and it looks like professional makeup kits I&#x27;ve used in the past. So many choices, and the colors blend very well --- perfect if you like the bright colors, and still perfect if you want to tone down some of the brights by blending with more neutral colors. Since it has EVERYTHING, I&#x27;ll be taking this whenever/wherever I travel, and I&#x27;ll be giving it as gifts to my girlfriends! The seller (Flossy) offers great products at amazing prices, so I&#x27;ll be back soon for more goodies</li>
            <li> I have to say that I read numerous negative reviews about poor packaging and breakage during shipping and it halted me purchasing this item. I only cheated myself! After finally ordering this product, I received it in perfect condition! I did multiple swatches without primer and boy are these colors just as beautiful as they appear in the pictures! 180 colors for this low price is definitely a steal!! I am happy to say that I am very satisfied with my purchase!! Great product and great packaging for shipping!!</li>
            <li> Nice colors and great product. But I received my item in a horrible condition. The eyeshadows most of dem were broken up. I was very disappointed, hence the reason I had ordered it to give as a gift.</li>
            <li> Stays on all day. I needed some wild colors for a bachelorette party and this is perfect. Everyone loves it. Great price too.</li>
            <li> I bought this makeup kit for my sister&#x27;s birthday and she definitely loved it. It was worth it for the price and quality. The eyeshadow are pigmented and colorful. This makeup kit comes with every color that you need! I love the packaging as well!</li>
            <li> The colors are great, but they&#x27;re not for someone looking for office wear. The neutral shades are limited, but there&#x27;s a huge selection of fun colors. It isn&#x27;t the most secure in shipping, so if you want bright colors and you want them to get to you in one piece I&#x27;d suggest their 7 Layer All-in-one Kit. It&#x27;s more tightly packed and less likely to rattle and roll in shipping.</li>
            <li> A dream to have!&lt;br /&gt;Create a variety of looks with this palette! And the Shany Eye Shadows don&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin! As a budding makeup artist, I find these are the best colors to have in any makeup kit!</li>
            <li> Shany cosmetics makes excellent palettes and I have to say that this is one of them! I love the colorful assortment of colors that they have provided within this palette. I definitely recommend this item if you love fun colorful looks!</li>
            <li> Not high pigment at all and too loose will get a lot of the shadow powder in your eyes</li>
            <li> definitely a must buy again!!! I am not even half way through my colors as yet!! i bought this over a year now!!!</li>
            <li> Great for drag Queens, even haunted</li>
            <li> So many beautiful colors!! Has different shades of the colors! Perfect colors to choose from depending what mood you are in. Bright colors! Darker colors! Love it! Just simply amazing!</li>
            <li> i have a shade for every color outfit of clothing in my closet and dresser drawers love it love it love it and once the top layer wears out there&#x27;s another row next and another row after that endless shades of beautiful colors!!!! against my dark porcelain skin l love bold colors looks fab!!!</li>
            <li> First it is sooo hard to find bright and bold colors of eyeshadow in the stores. Second they are upwards of $8 for a few colors. This set has 180 colors and while each one may be rather small, around the size of a nickel, it also takes a whole lot less to apply to my eyes for them to stay bright and beautiful. I also love the case they come in which keeps them relatively safe, although one of my blues on the lowest palette was broken when I received it. Overall great product and an incredible price for such high quality and quantity!</li>
            <li> This is a beautiful make-up case.  It was a gift and she loved it!  I am sure she is having a ball getting all pretty with this set.  I want one myself.</li>
            <li> Only reason that I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is because after doing some swatches on my wrist, I realized I had to wet my brushes to get the pigmentation. However, I am brown skin so you may not need to wet them with fairer skin tones. I was extremely nervous about buying these after reading the reviews about how damaged the product was during shipping but I am happy I purchased mine because all of my shadows were intact! I did have a couple colors that had gotten a speck of another color on it but nothing that I couldn&#x27;t quickly wipe away with my finger. It has almost every color you can imagine (not so many nude/neutral colors) I do wish that it had a few more matte shadows and a little less of the shimmer ones, but they specified in the description that they&#x27;re would be more shimmers so I knew what I was getting into. All in all I would definitely recommend this product. Great buy for the price. For brown/dark skinned ladies, as long as you don&#x27;t mind wetting when you want intense color than you should order!</li>
            <li> I where this makeup all the time it doesnt wear off over time just use a primer on eyelids and you will have longlasting color all day</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are amazing! You do have to wear an eye primer for long lasting color.</li>
            <li> I received the item in good timing and I am enjoying all of the colors. Thanks</li>
            <li> Our 11 yr old daughter loves it!! Thanks for high quality product. We would buy again. Thanks again and can&#x27;t wait to buy again.</li>
            <li> My girlfriends and I ordered one each. The pigmentation is awesome and the color choice is perfect! I really suggest checking these out!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing deal!!!!!! You get all of those eyeshaddows in literally any colour you will ever want orneed for such a cheap price!! The eyeshaddows are nicely pigmented aswell so i woild happily pay more for this set.</li>
            <li> HI&lt;br /&gt;I just loved all the colors!&lt;br /&gt;They went with like every outfit of mine! I had fun mixking colors; the neon ones are my sisters favorite.</li>
            <li> The colors are absolutely beautiful! Very bright and it shows up well on my caramel skin tone. I am completely satisfied! I plan on ordering another one soon!</li>
            <li> Vibrant, beautiful, smooth colors! And so many colors to choose from!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product. My package came on time and no palettes were broken. The colors work great!</li>
            <li> This collection of colors is so awesome. Good quality, affordable price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> when i ordered it it came in perfect condition non of the eye shadows were mess up and the colors are amazing.</li>
            <li> I was unsure about making this purchase due to the problems I saw in the reviews regarding the packaging/ shipping issues. However, I was pleasantly surprised when i received the package because there was stuffing inside the packaging box to prevent the box of shadows from moving around. In addition, there was more protection inside the sleeve of the palette. There were also clear plastic covers over the shadows. There were no cracks, no colors, smudged together. Maybe this is because I ordered through Amazon &amp; not a private seller. Now, I will order another one! The only small disappointed was that there are 3 and 4 of the same colors, so you don&#x27;t get 180 different colors. Still, the value is great &amp; the shadows are true to color, and that is important to me because I&#x27;m very dark skinned.</li>
            <li> i love it it came on time i use it every day itsss light i  dont buy other make up no more</li>
            <li> I recommend this eyeshadow case if you are into multicoloring eyeshadow... I love using different colors when applying make up and honestly it&#x27;s worth it instead of buying each color individually</li>
            <li> Love all the colors all where in tact. Have not used yet</li>
            <li> Needed a simple but useful Birthday gift.&lt;br /&gt;This is the jackpot. Looked at all the other reviews and saw that some people would receive this Item all broken while some would get the item just as is. I gave it a shot anyways and came out on top. Yes the white pallet was in 3 chunks but how lucky am I that it was the white?? LOL. The colors are magnificent and so is the set up. Just be careful you might not be as lucky as me ;)</li>
            <li> Pretty colors! Really bright.</li>
            <li> Great for its value. Amazing colors, very high definition. Came intact. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many bad reviews for this pallete. Honestly I dont know why. there was free shipping, I got my pallete in 5 days. It is all intact great colors nothing wrong with the packaging or the product. I give this a 5 star rating because it is worth buying again.. I would recommend buying this product for yourself or as a gift. So many colors endless ideas...</li>
            <li> when I opened this one the red eyeshadow was completely crushed and everywhere! I had to take a blowdryer and blow the red crumbles out of all the other colors.... if It wasn&#x27;t broken it would have gotten 5 stars because it is amazing eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This product is a very good investment for professional and amateur make-up artists. The colors are very vibrant and have great shade ranges, which make it an awesome tool for blending and creating all types of looks etc. The product arrived in great time, and was very well packaged. My palette was in excellent condition. None of the shadows were cracked or damaged. I give this seller an A+ for a great product, as well as the condition it was received in. Good Job!!!</li>
            <li> the colors are beautiful! Better than i expected...package was great..none were broken</li>
            <li> I really wanted to get this product bc I love bright, vibrant colors.  I was very hesitant, however, when I read most of the reviews saying their product was damaged.  But I decided to give it a try and guess what?  NO BROKEN SHADOWS!  Not even a crack in one.  I absolutely LOVE this eyeshadow palette.  Hopefully, anyone else that orders it will have the same luck! :)</li>
            <li> Wow mind blowing!!!!!</li>
            <li> love this kit i use it everyday! the colors are awesome very bright the case is so cool! and it came really quick.</li>
            <li> Great colors  horrible packaging.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and the palette came well packed. I was afraid that the eyeshadows were going to get cracked during shipping (because of previous reviews) but once I opened the package, they were fine. Thanks.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good , but the only bad thing about this ( a big big big negative side) is that it has all this black color all over the box ... Some of my eye shadows were messed up and the color was completely ruined because of the black dusty powder on the box and the plates .. Price is good but what I got was terrible !</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow palette! There is so much variety in it, and the shadows are long-lasting and highly pigmented.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Fast shipping. Colors are as bright as they appear in photo. Arrived with not one broken color. I am so happy I ordered this! I&#x27;m planning on buying more for my daughters for Christmas!</li>
            <li> I love all the beautiful colors, so many colors to choose from.</li>
            <li> I love it i just love the colors</li>
            <li> Loved it. Everything came fine nothing broken. And came fast. Love the colors. Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> You do get a lot of amazing colors BUT they are not as pigmented as I had hoped they are like if you were to buy a cheap palette for a younger girl for the price you cant complain too much though. just have to put on many layers to get full color.</li>
            <li> It was awesome... my ten yr old loves it 😉💋</li>
            <li> Love it and the color&#x27;s lost so long</li>
            <li> Colors are great and the amount of colors for the money is fantastic</li>
            <li> Wow u got wwwwwwaaay more negative than positive u need to work on getting the gift to customers without ruining merchandise</li>
            <li> I love all the colors and the eyeshadow is long lasting</li>
            <li> Colors are as shown on the internet. Love, love, love!!! Bought this eyeshadow palette for $15.99 + tax + shipping it comes to a total of $22.33, instead of $59.99 which is the regular price. The price was reduced because one of the pink colors inside the palette was broken and it spreads all over the palette both inside and out. At first, I was tempted to send it back immediately. But after giving it a thought and considering the facts that it as never been use and it&#x27;s only one of the eyeshadows that was broken. I began to clean the palette inside out, and whala!!! It became new again, so I kept it.</li>
            <li> Best eyeshadow palette.. Colors are very bold and pretty.. Goes on great</li>
            <li> This is a very nice palette, it comes with every color possible that you could think of, the pigmentation of these eyeshadows are very very good. I&#x27;m happy with everything and the packaging/ palette is very nice.</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful and outstanding !! It would be a great gift because it&#x27;s very affordable and the quality is comparable to other branded makeup.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and I love it!!! I even bought one for my best fried! I am a new and up coming make up artist!</li>
            <li> THIS ITEM IS THE BEST!  I love most Shany products but this is great!  The colors are vibrant and very high in pigment!  I will be ordering again!</li>
            <li> Great price for this many shades of eyeshadow. I would mix and match more then one color on my eye at once for a cool effect. Portable so you could take on vacation with you.</li>
            <li> I love it,  it is perfect!  Well other than the repeat in a few colors.  The worst is the pink,  I have about 5 of the same pink.  Other than that. I can not complain it&#x27;s wonderful!  The colors are very vibrant,  highly pigmented,  and very soft.  They do not need a primer to last all day.  They stay through everything!</li>
            <li> I love it! Came to my door in one piece, I know a lot of people had a problem with shipping but mine wasn&#x27;t broken. The colors are amazing!!! Very high quality eyeshadow. Love, love, love it!!!!</li>
            <li> So when I recieved the package it was in great shape but when I open the package eyeshadow was everywhere. 3 of the colors where broke and got into all the other colors. Not okay.</li>
            <li> BOught it for my wife as a Valentines day gift orginially. she absolutely loved it. when my mom came to visit and tried this on after hearing my wife rave about it she loved it too and we bought this second set for her. she runs her own beauty salon and loved this so much she said she will even use it professionally. lots of colors and nice case.</li>
            <li> Well, it seems Amazon listened to its customers and started packaging the box a bit better. I got mine yesterday (5/30/2013) and nothing was broken at all. There was lots of bubble wrap and so forth. The shipping was fast and the product is even better in person if that&#x27;s possible. With or without primer, the eye shadows are vibrant and have staying power for an all day look. Loving this company so far and definitely plan on ordering more make-up from them!!!! &amp;#60;3 Shany!</li>
            <li> Despite the reviews of broken pots I took a risk on this Palette and I could not be any happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First and foremost, the pigment of this product is of the highest quality. I&#x27;ve used MAC, Bobbi Brown, Ulta, Sephora and L&#x27;Oreal. None of them were as vivid, strong and true as what is included here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product blends extremely well and due to the strength of the pigment I am able to use far fewer layers than I typically would. This leads to no flaking of excess product after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the the price tag this expansive Palette is must have.</li>
