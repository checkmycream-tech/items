            <li>Fast shipment, thank you love the product, will order again in the future, best shampoo for hair treatment which is a plus</li>
            <li>This shampoo &amp; conditioner not only does a great job cleaning and conditioning my hair, but it smells heavenly, too.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Smells great and my keratine treatment last longer.</li>
            <li>The improvement to my hair is significant.  </li>
            <li>very good but not covered well Leaking little</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d give it 4 starts, but to sell used or only partially filled bottles!!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel healthy and soft.  </li>
            <li>but I guess well worth it</li>
            <li>The price was right for the 2 items as well</li>
            <li>Only I kept wanting to have acquired more ounces of shampoo though because I wash my hair every 2 day, I feel that this will be ended soon.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>This was a restock and will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this offsite from a salon and each time the shampoo and/or conditioner always leaks from the top.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off saving your money and buying Suave, or something like that, at the regular store.</li>
            <li>Great for my thick keratin treated hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels very luxurious.</li>
            <li>I got the product, opened it and the bottles were only 2/3 filled.</li>
            <li>fast shipment&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is extremely soft and my keratin treatment has stayed strong for about 5 months using the shampoo and conditioner, the key is not to wash your hair every day!</li>
            <li>It is the true Global products and I will continue to order here.</li>
            <li>this never happens the shampoos usialLet has a different texture I really believe the bottles are filled with different creams</li>
            <li>The product was good but poorly packaged.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy like some high priced brands.  </li>
            <li>Maybe the product is very old.</li>
            <li>It has transformed my frizzy, curly hair and made it manageable, especially during the hot, humid summer weather.  </li>
            <li>I compared to my original bottles and not the same the lettering, etc is different.</li>
            <li>I bought it through her at first for double the price.</li>
            <li>makes my hair feel soft soft soft.</li>
            <li>My hair keep moisture and soft all time.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and shiny and keeps the treatment for 4 months.</li>
            <li>I decided to go natural and</li>
            <li>Conditioner works well, but still had to use GK&#x27;s leave-in conditioner (which is applied separately) to maintain the soft, shiny appearance.</li>
            <li>Caws a mess to clean up once plastic came off.</li>
            <li>the product is fine but the containers are so hard  to use</li>
            <li>This product was recommended to me for use following a professional hair straightening treatment.  </li>
            <li>It costs so much for the keratin treatment, I use this shampoo to make it last as long as possible.</li>

            <li> I use  Global Keratin in conjunction with a flat iron to get the results I want.</li>
            <li> - you have to really squeeze hard to get the shampoo and conditioner out.</li>
            <li> I like the other GK products, but this duo left me flat.</li>
            <li> but I have to give this review a 1 star only because I believe this is a fake the conditioner doesn&#x27;t even smell like my other bottles so far using this copy from Amazon</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that the plastic shampoo bottle was defective and the shampoo leaked all over the place.</li>
            <li> WHAT A MESS.</li>
            <li> It was wrapped tightly so that the leakage stayed within the wrapping.</li>
            <li> the transition for my hair previously was so frustrating that I went back to perms.  </li>
            <li> Lets not say all the dandruff I got a few days after using.</li>
            <li> My scalp was so dried.</li>
            <li> These bottle caps are not secure and when I opened the package I saw that a lot of the product had spilled inside the bag.  </li>
            <li> Waste on money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to get product out without it oozing from under the cap and down the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair to begin with and when using this, my hair wasn&#x27;t greasy in the morning like it usually is.</li>
            <li> Both the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t have the usual fragrance either.</li>
            <li> Much less expensive than if I had bought in the salon.</li>
            <li> BOTH BOTTLES CAME BROKEN</li>
            <li> The shampoo came in with the protection seal broken and the conditioner was used.</li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED MY FIRST TIME ORDERING ONLINE :(</li>
            <li> It is fake.</li>
            <li> its expensive</li>
            <li> Balancing Shampoo was the wrong product for me.  </li>
            <li> Not the usual quality :(</li>
            <li> bad shipping, product damaged</li>
            <li> Omg awful.</li>

            <li> This is a must to use if you have had the keratin treatment done. Store bought shampoo/conditioner does not give the same results!</li>
            <li> I got the product, opened it and the bottles were only 2/3 filled. I actually took pictures of it too. The product itself is really good and I&#x27;d give it 4 starts, but to sell used or only partially filled bottles!! that is not acceptable.</li>
            <li> Timely delivery, great product for the hair. Good price. I buy this product often since I have keratin in my hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent products and service</li>
            <li> Left me with tons of dandruff!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this offsite from a salon and each time the shampoo and/or conditioner always leaks from the top.</li>
            <li> BOTH BOTTLES CAME BROKEN WHAT A MESS. LOST ABOUT A 1/4 OF THE PRODUCT VERY DISAPPOINTED MY FIRST TIME ORDERING ONLINE :(</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year and love it</li>
            <li> The product is great it&#x27;s the container that isn&#x27;t up to par. The shampoo/conditioner comes out all cracks/ crevices when you squeeze the bottle to come out of the cap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line for over a year now, but I&#x27;ve never purchase the duo, Balancing Shampoo &amp; Conditioner; I&#x27;ve always used the Deep Conditioner.  This duo package was excellent; just as good as the other products.</li>
            <li> the product is fine but the containers are so hard  to use - you have to really squeeze hard to get the shampoo and conditioner out.</li>
            <li> Quick efficient and perfect- thank you</li>
            <li> I got this from amazon because I was trying to save money. Well you get what you pay for. It is fake. I compared to my original bottles and not the same the lettering, etc is different. Lets not say all the dandruff I got a few days after using. Omg awful. My scalp was so dried. Never will buy online again will stick to vendor.</li>
            <li> My hair is beautiful, soft, silky very manageable, but best of of not frizzy at all, Its an excellent product.  its expensive but I guess well worth it</li>
            <li> the shampoo and conditioner are good products and good for my hair..fast shipment&lt;br /&gt;am happy with it..i will buy it again..</li>
            <li> I used these products to extend the life of a keratin treatment I had done at a salon. Shampoo has nice scent. Conditioner works well, but still had to use GK&#x27;s leave-in conditioner (which is applied separately) to maintain the soft, shiny appearance.</li>
            <li> Best hair product! Leaves your hair silky.</li>
            <li> Great experience. Great product.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner are good products and really does the job. My only complaint was that the plastic shampoo bottle was defective and the shampoo leaked all over the place. I will purchase at a retail store next time to check for defects.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment, thank you love the product, will order again in the future, best shampoo for hair treatment which is a plus</li>
            <li> I like the other GK products, but this duo left me flat. Literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s the deal here?  I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> The shampoo came in with the protection seal broken and the conditioner was used. Returned.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair feels after this duo. My hairdresser suggested it and I love it!</li>
            <li> These bottle caps are not secure and when I opened the package I saw that a lot of the product had spilled inside the bag.  I will not order again.</li>
            <li> wife says the balancing ones do not work as well as the moisture set</li>
            <li> I am enjoying the produce and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Balancing Shampoo was the wrong product for me.  I might for it to be&lt;br /&gt;GK Color Protection shampoo and conditioner. Please withdraw my claim&lt;br /&gt;with FedStore. My mistake. Thank you.</li>
            <li> i order the Global Keratin Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner every 2-3 months. This time, the product was not the quality it should be. The shampoo is watery when it should have a thicker consistency. Both the shampoo and conditioner don&#x27;t have the usual fragrance either. Maybe the product is very old. Not the usual quality :(</li>
            <li> It is the true Global products and I will continue to order here.</li>
            <li> Love the GK line. My hair stylist recommends this product. I bought it through her at first for double the price. This is a great deal from Amazon. I&#x27;ve been using these products for about 6 months had couldn&#x27;t be happier. My hair is extremely soft and my keratin treatment has stayed strong for about 5 months using the shampoo and conditioner, the key is not to wash your hair every day!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years and love it. Smells great and my keratine treatment last longer. Package was great on arrival, no spilling whatsoever...</li>
            <li> Definitely didn&#x27;t do what it claimed. You&#x27;re better off saving your money and buying Suave, or something like that, at the regular store. Waste on money.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this same product from Amazon over 13 times and never did i have the issues as this last one. When I took it out of the package the shampoo had leaked all over. The lid does not work either.</li>
            <li> SUCH a good deal! compared to the salon..</li>
