            <li>GREAT product!!</li>
            <li>This is the perfect color for my face and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.</li>
            <li>Great product if you need a concealer that STAYS PUT!</li>
            <li>This is probably the best I&#x27;ve used to date.  </li>
            <li>great product, great price</li>
            <li>Works great and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>Great coverage.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>This concealer stays on great.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, blends well, coverage is awesome, lasts most of the day, and can&#x27;t beat the price.  </li>
            <li>My favorite concealer - does a great job hiding under-eye circles!</li>
            <li>Its good for the price.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;light\\&quot; works for me, but \\&quot;cream\\&quot; didn&#x27;t do me any good.  </li>
            <li>If I use a good moisturizer before application, though, I have NO problems, and I don&#x27;t have issues with it</li>
            <li>I also use this to brighten under my eyes, and surprisingly, it works for that too.</li>
            <li>Is a good concealer but highlites wrinkles with powder.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Price is good.</li>
            <li>As a fair person, that would be another desaster for me.</li>
            <li>Looks good but doesn&#x27;t stay on in Florida humidity</li>
            <li>so I tried it again without using powder, this is really the best way to use it.</li>
            <li>This product was a good skin tone match and stays on for most of the day.</li>
            <li>A stippling foundation brush buffs it out so nicely</li>
            <li>Great makeup, stays on and the color blends very well!</li>
            <li>Love it for under eye concealing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others; this is my favorite for covering blemishes as well as the darkened skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>This time I really used it and it covers very nicely, blends well and stay in place.  </li>
            <li>Did settle into fine line, accentuated very fine wrinkles when worn with powder.</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage and long wear.  </li>
            <li>I applied it under my eyes, around my nose, and on some blemishes with a concealer brush (very important for a smooth finish).</li>
            <li>My only wishes are that there were more variety of shades and especially more golden tints.</li>
            <li>I see it is now available from Amazon through Maybeline and much more affordable  </li>
            <li>So easy to use.</li>
            <li>In summer it matches my skin perfectly, but in winter it&#x27;s a little to orange.</li>
            <li>I did order the Light -</li>
            <li>Goes on light and lasts.  </li>
            <li>Next time I won&#x27;t have a deadline need and can be a more intelligent shopper and wait for the right seller.    </li>
            <li>The price of this color, purchased from Soapify,  was more than twice what I paid for the first color.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light, but not fair, and the light color seemed the perfect match.  </li>
            <li>It is full coverage.</li>
            <li>Coverage is initially good but doesn&#x27;t seem to last.</li>
            <li>Spend some serious coin and get the YSL Touche Eclat concealer, which is the very best.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several different types and this seems to be the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Good coverage and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It does a pretty good job at hiding the dark circles &amp; it does stay on without having to add more through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It sets very quickly, doesn&#x27;t require powder over it, is very lightweight &amp; lasts until I take it off.  </li>
            <li>; it&#x27;s not dry or wet, it&#x27;s in between which is perfect.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little to light for me, and I have fair skin.</li>
            <li>That said, if you don&#x27;t get the right color, it won&#x27;t appear to work as well.  </li>
            <li>And because it does set quickly, you won&#x27;t be able to blend it later -</li>
            <li>stays on great, just a bit darker than I usually wear, but will work for summer.</li>
            <li>I like this product very much.    </li>
            <li>The first time I wore it was for a funeral.  </li>
            <li>I could have had a nice latte and a cookie for the money I spent.  </li>
            <li>So reordered even though it was at a significantly higher price than my first order becayse  </li>
            <li>The only thing that bugs me is that it drys quickly when you apply it, so you need to work quickly and it can be tricky to blend when you&#x27;re racing against the clock.</li>
            <li>I really like the texture of this concealer</li>
            <li>I am ready to go.</li>
            <li>Too much hassle to return it though.</li>
            <li>and it STAYS opaque to really cover all blemishes.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes very well, you can still see the redness.</li>
            <li>When they say light, they mean light.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I actually enjoy that it dries sort of fast, there&#x27;s just something about the texture that forms while applying that sets it apart from other concealers for me.</li>
            <li>Covers extremely well and blends easily.</li>
            <li>Have been using this for several years and have tried MANY other concealers, some very expensive, but this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Does fantastic job of concealing dark purple circles.  </li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical â€“ however, I was looking for a cheaper alternative to my Amazing &amp; Smashbox concealers.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t cover anything and certainly didn&#x27;t last</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs real concealer coverage.</li>
            <li>There is SO MUCH usable product left!</li>
            <li>Also, the color of the product was considerably darker than the picture indicated.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and I get better coverage with one application than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with anything else.  </li>
            <li>It doesnt cover my veins alone completely but it does cover my dark circles so the coverage is decent.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t use it under my eyes because it sets kind of thick and it can cake a little bit there.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think when you have the genetic dark circles, there is only so much you can do about it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried expensive department store brands, salon stuff, stuff marketed for post-surgery scar and tattoo covering, waterproof stuff, and pretty much everything I can find.  </li>
            <li> Who wears concealer that long?</li>
            <li> that long â€“ without primer</li>
            <li> It is so dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cakey and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer to wear as little foundation as possible as I don&#x27;t like the way my face feels with a lot of makeup on it.</li>
            <li> The medium beige is a bit too pink for my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Horrible if you have fair, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I will want to try a different shade or not.</li>
            <li> Has a peach undertone, my skin is very pale olive, would&#x27;ve preferred a yellow tone instead.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day to cover blemishes and undereye dark circles.</li>
            <li> I (like someone else that did a review) was born with the dark circles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I had no idea that color  would be soo dark.   </li>
            <li> BUT if forced to, I have a feeling this might last</li>
            <li> I was shocked to look into the mirror a few hours after applying it to discover that it had turned orange beneath my eyes and had caked in the fine lines.  </li>
            <li> I would buy a slightly darker version.</li>
            <li> I use this concealer just around my eyes and with a little mascara and lip gloss</li>
            <li> I inherited VERY dark undereye circles, and have to wear concealer every day or else</li>
            <li> This concealer cakes and turns orange after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your cash.  </li>
            <li> I usually get at Wally World where it is a little cheaper, but can&#x27;t beat shopping at home</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!  </li>
            <li> Hard to match tones over the internet.  </li>
            <li> When they say 24 hours, they mean it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I purchased a color too dark for me.</li>
            <li> Maybeline New York 24/hr  liquid makeup base looked like it would match this product</li>
            <li> There is no way I am going to test to see if this concealer will actually last for 24 hours â€“ bad for my skin, duh!  </li>
            <li> Addicted to this stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this.</li>
            <li> and it makes any little lines show up terribly bad.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t - tons of complaints that the base is too orangey and to dark.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> great product, great price</li>
            <li> Its good for the price.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day to cover blemishes and undereye dark circles. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who needs real concealer coverage.</li>
            <li> It doesnt cover my veins alone completely but it does cover my dark circles so the coverage is decent. I really like the texture of this concealer; it&#x27;s not dry or wet, it&#x27;s in between which is perfect.

            <li> I inherited VERY dark undereye circles, and have to wear concealer every day or else people think I&#x27;ve been in a fist fight.  I&#x27;ve tried expensive department store brands, salon stuff, stuff marketed for post-surgery scar and tattoo covering, waterproof stuff, and pretty much everything I can find.  This stuff is AMAZING!  A little goes a long way, and I get better coverage with one application than I&#x27;ve ever gotten with anything else.  It sets very quickly, doesn&#x27;t require powder over it, is very lightweight &amp; lasts until I take it off.  That said, if you don&#x27;t get the right color, it won&#x27;t appear to work as well.  The \\&quot;light\\&quot; works for me, but \\&quot;cream\\&quot; didn&#x27;t do me any good.  And because it does set quickly, you won&#x27;t be able to blend it later - that&#x27;s the no-transfer part actually doing it&#x27;s job!  Also, it can be drying if you put it on bare/clean skin.  If I use a good moisturizer before application, though, I have NO problems, and I don&#x27;t have issues with it settling in to lines &amp; creases.   GREAT product!!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for several years and have tried MANY other concealers, some very expensive, but this is by far the best.  Not greasy, blends well, coverage is awesome, lasts most of the day, and can&#x27;t beat the price.  I usually get at Wally World where it is a little cheaper, but can&#x27;t beat shopping at home</li>
            <li> This is the perfect color for my face and it lasts all day. So easy to use. Wonderful product. Our store quit selling it so I will be buying this online.</li>
            <li> Works great and lasts all day. I have tried several different types and this seems to be the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Horrible if you have fair, dry skin. I applied moisturizer before and even tried it afterwards. It is so dry and it makes any little lines show up terribly bad. If you have oily skin, this might work for you.</li>
            <li> There is no way I am going to test to see if this concealer will actually last for 24 hours â€“ bad for my skin, duh!  Who wears concealer that long? BUT if forced to, I have a feeling this might last that long â€“ without primer. I was pretty skeptical â€“ however, I was looking for a cheaper alternative to my Amazing &amp; Smashbox concealers. I bought it in medium beige (as close to my skin tone as I could get) and in cream (a shade lighter). I applied it under my eyes, around my nose, and on some blemishes with a concealer brush (very important for a smooth finish). Lasted all day and into the night. I did not have to touch up whatsoever! It is full coverage. My only wishes are that there were more variety of shades and especially more golden tints. The medium beige is a bit too pink for my satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Good coverage and lasts a long time. I also use this to brighten under my eyes, and surprisingly, it works for that too.</li>
            <li> Great makeup, stays on and the color blends very well!</li>
            <li> Purchased for wife she say&#x27;s: &amp;#34;dries to a powder finish, can be worn alone without powder. I applied a rice powder. Did settle into fine line, accentuated very fine wrinkles when worn with powder. Does fantastic job of concealing dark purple circles.  Has a peach undertone, my skin is very pale olive, would&#x27;ve preferred a yellow tone instead. Hard to match tones over the internet.  Is a good concealer but highlites wrinkles with powder.&amp;#34;  UPDATE: so I tried it again without using powder, this is really the best way to use it. I prefer to wear as little foundation as possible as I don&#x27;t like the way my face feels with a lot of makeup on it. I use this concealer just around my eyes and with a little mascara and lip gloss I am ready to go. Great coverage. In summer it matches my skin perfectly, but in winter it&#x27;s a little to orange.</li>
            <li> Love it for under eye concealing. Doesn&#x27;t make me look pasty.</li>
            <li> This product was a good skin tone match and stays on for most of the day. I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> This concealer stays on great. Unfortunately I purchased a color too dark for me. Too much hassle to return it though. I blend it with another color.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase it again, just a lighter color.</li>
            <li> This concealer cakes and turns orange after a few hours.  I&#x27;m light, but not fair, and the light color seemed the perfect match.  The first time I wore it was for a funeral.  I was shocked to look into the mirror a few hours after applying it to discover that it had turned orange beneath my eyes and had caked in the fine lines.  What a waste of money!  I pitched it immediately.  Don&#x27;t waste your cash.  Spend some serious coin and get the YSL Touche Eclat concealer, which is the very best.  Even though this Maybelline concealer was a cheapie, I still don&#x27;t like wasting my money.  I could have had a nice latte and a cookie for the money I spent.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I (like someone else that did a review) was born with the dark circles under the eyes. And now, at 61, I have age added to the element.  It does a pretty good job at hiding the dark circles &amp; it does stay on without having to add more through out the day.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this one again. I did order the Light - I&#x27;m not sure if I will want to try a different shade or not. I think when you have the genetic dark circles, there is only so much you can do about it.</li>
            <li> Tried, dont know that I would get again</li>
            <li> Addicted to this stuff. I actually enjoy that it dries sort of fast, there&#x27;s just something about the texture that forms while applying that sets it apart from other concealers for me. A stippling foundation brush buffs it out so nicely and it STAYS opaque to really cover all blemishes. I forget they&#x27;re there haha. I just don&#x27;t use it under my eyes because it sets kind of thick and it can cake a little bit there.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and when you think you&#x27;re done, use some tweezers or pliers to yank the plastic ring out. There is SO MUCH usable product left!</li>
            <li> Great product if you need a concealer that STAYS PUT!</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer - does a great job hiding under-eye circles!</li>
            <li> When they say light, they mean light. It&#x27;s a little to light for me, and I have fair skin. It doesn&#x27;t cover blemishes very well, you can still see the redness. I would buy a slightly darker version.</li>
            <li> When they say 24 hours, they mean it. Covers extremely well and blends easily. I&#x27;ve tried others; this is my favorite for covering blemishes as well as the darkened skin under my eyes. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Price is good. Coverage is initially good but doesn&#x27;t seem to last. Also, the color of the product was considerably darker than the picture indicated.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this. It&#x27;s cakey and i wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people who have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage and long wear.  I like this product very much.    I bought this in a darker tone and had to chuck it.  I had no idea that color  would be soo dark.   So reordered even though it was at a significantly higher price than my first order becayse  I can&#x27;t find ithis product locally.  This time I really used it and it covers very nicely, blends well and stay in place.  This is probably the best I&#x27;ve used to date.  The price of this color, purchased from Soapify,  was more than twice what I paid for the first color.    I see it is now available from Amazon through Maybeline and much more affordable  Next time I won&#x27;t have a deadline need and can be a more intelligent shopper and wait for the right seller.    Note: Maybeline New York 24/hr  liquid makeup base looked like it would match this product but it doesn&#x27;t - tons of complaints that the base is too orangey and to dark.  As a fair person, that would be another desaster for me.</li>
            <li> stays on great, just a bit darker than I usually wear, but will work for summer.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Goes on light and lasts.  That&#x27;s all I ask for!</li>
            <li> Looks good but doesn&#x27;t stay on in Florida humidity</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s medium coverage and lasts about 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t cover anything and certainly didn&#x27;t last</li>
    </ol>
