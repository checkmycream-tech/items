            <li>This is a very nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I became a fan of L&#x27;Oreal and for me their products are synonymous with great quality and good value.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using my Loreal age perfect night cream.</li>
            <li>believe in using better quality for your face and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love this age perfect system.</li>
            <li>It is great that 1 cream is good for both morning and evening.</li>
            <li>It also has a pleasant fragrance and consistency.  </li>
            <li>it is good for the price</li>
            <li>loved it from the beginning.</li>
            <li>And it was in a restaurant with good lighting.  </li>
            <li>It has no scent, which is great for the morning when I&#x27;m going to work and using my own perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>I find all Loreal products to be good.</li>
            <li>This one is no exception, and it does provide moisture to the skin, and makes it look good.</li>
            <li>I have the fortune of being blessed with good skin even though I abused it in my 20&#x27;s &amp; 30s.  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>If it were a grapefruit scent (love that!)</li>
            <li>goes on smooth not sticky - feels great on skin&lt;</li>
            <li>The cream goes on smoothly and feels great.</li>
            <li>This product is nice, but its best to use during winter months because if at anytime while out in the sun, if your face glistens, you will look very shiney because the product does not absorb well it just sits on the surface of your skin and it will look greasy.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream will give you results</li>
            <li>Still, nice compliment</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream, but</li>
            <li>/&gt;Appreciate that it is nicely affordable as well.  </li>
            <li>It has a really nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Have been working with L&#x27;Oreal ...not thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li>But I do like to use some kind of cream on my face before putting on make-up.</li>
            <li>I like fragranced products, honestly...</li>
            <li>even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t think anyone can expect overnight results from this or any kind of skin cream.</li>
            <li>I was very satisfied with them , so I was also glad to try this \\&quot;Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good part, it was an easy purchase and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li>One of the best deals I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel very smooth and doesn&#x27;t get oily on me.  </li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with make up layered on top.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal creams for years and generally love them.  </li>
            <li>The added calcium nourishes the skin making it firmer, more supple and resilient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When spending several weeks in the sun on a beach vacation, I feel that this is the best treatment for my face after all the sun and sea water</li>
            <li>says you can use this during the day, whenever I tried, my makeup would clump on top of it.</li>
            <li>I love using this cream by L&#x27;Oreal at night before I retire.  </li>
            <li>I love using this on my face.  </li>
            <li>It is so smooth and creamy and use it faithfully every day!  </li>
            <li>As a night cream, it is ok during the summer, but I think something lighter would be a better choice.  </li>
            <li>This item was accidentally sent to me, I ordered and am a regular user of the Age Perfect L&#x27;Oreal neck balm , which I love, but his came instead.</li>
            <li>So I thought I&#x27;d just keep this and try it, glad I did.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream offers a good hydrating formula that does not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the results were good and it&#x27;s always great to find a cream that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I like most L&#x27;oreal products.</li>
            <li>It took a week for my skin to start to feel better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this cream mostly just in the morning</li>
            <li>I love the scent also.  </li>
            <li>Loreal is fabulous!</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels, not at all oily, and perhaps it is diminishing my wrinkles a bit.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS ITEM .&lt;br</li>
            <li>After reading labels on all the various moisturizers in the drug store, I decided on L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>If her opinion changes after a more lengthy trial.</li>
            <li>I have used for most of my life Lancome products.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this product keeps my skin moist under  &#x60;concealer&#x27; and under my face powder.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on L&#x27;Oreal and believe me would not take the time to leave any feed back if the stuff was not truly doing wonderful things for my skin!  </li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer for my face thank you again</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this becasue so many moisturizers irritate my eyes, this one does not irritate them at all.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love how it smells.</li>
            <li>I love how my skin feels and my eyes don&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li>I love the texture and the way my skin feels after applying it.  </li>
            <li>Years ago, I worked for Lancome and had tried many of their products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I was using L&#x27;Oreal day/night cremes &amp; was satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have read the comments about the smell &amp; couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; it seems to have become part of the ritual of using the creme.</li>
            <li>most of their cream kinda glades on  hope  </li>
            <li>Many cosmetics are way over priced and they do not work any better than this product does.  </li>
            <li>I love all the L&#x27;Oreal skin and beauty line.</li>
            <li>My favorite skin care cream.</li>
            <li>Love it..</li>
            <li>Was not that satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>it might be OK</li>
            <li>She says you can count on the L&#x27;Oreal name for good products that are priced right.  </li>
            <li>Many of us are willing to pay good money for a product we believe will make our skin dewy once more.</li>
            <li>Age Perfect may not turn back the hands of time, but it does make your skin look pretty good.</li>
            <li>It is my first time for my wife to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not uncomfortable and does a good job of hydrating skin.  </li>
            <li>If you want a rich cream that does not have a perfumey smell, this is for you !</li>
            <li>It is definitely worth trying!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Found it was very good at moisturizing and moderate firming seen</li>
            <li>I hope that if you do try it you get the same remarkable results that I have seen  in my own</li>
            <li>Wow is it ever a great product all in one jar.  </li>
            <li>This is a good cream that seems to really moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li>air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is reasonably priced and does a good job.  </li>
            <li>Although the packaging is simple, but the product quality is good!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t absorb into the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Living in Arizona, I felt it was important to use a good night moisturizer because of the intense heat in this State.  </li>
            <li>For such a great cream I would expect to pay much more.</li>
            <li>This formula has somewhat of a strong scent.  </li>
            <li>is the strong scent.</li>
            <li>While I use &amp; love the Nightime Age Perfect cream, this one simply was too much.</li>
            <li>It seems to work just fine for others, but for me it was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li>I am sensitive to smells, but this product does not bother me and I find it fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li>This line of creams is nice for us older faced women!</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly</li>
            <li>importantly, avoid the harmful ultraviolet rays (UVA primarily) on your face.  </li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and spreads well.</li>
            <li>free believe it or not.  </li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and</li>
            <li>She is using this product to make her skin softer and smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never thought anything of Loreal before, and can not believe how smooth and even my skin looks in the morning.  </li>
            <li>It may be fabulous for your skin.</li>
            <li>I prefer unscented or lightly scented products and this is neither.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t continue to smell it, fortunately.</li>
            <li>Cannot believe I got this so cheap and</li>
            <li>Oil Of Olay makes a great clear eye cream, and if you want to spend a bit more money on your eye area, Shiseido makes a wonderful, yet more expensive eye cream that does wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>this cream is:  a nicely balanced, non-greasy facial cream, suitable for both day and night use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wash my face with a clean washcloth and apply any cream to a damp face.  </li>
            <li>but I rinse, again with a clean washcloth.  </li>
            <li>This cream is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Like my title says: this cream is wonderful for mature skin; I love the phrase mature skin, rather than old skin.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was the fragrance (quite strong), or maybe some ingredient in the moisturizer, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li>Overall, though, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li>It is smooth, silky, gets quickly absorbed by my skin, and does not leave any greasy residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clearly, this is true in this case.  </li>
            <li>This cream is certainly a good addition to your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product for a full 4 weeks yet, but have about 2 weeks using it.  </li>
            <li>Not a heavy scent either, which is really nice.</li>
            <li>I do feel that my skin is looking much nicer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for around the eyes and above the lip to prevent aging and wrinkles.</li>
            <li>It really is a bath to skin, and safe to use.</li>
            <li>I now have close to their full line of skincare products.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize it when I selected this item, but it&#x27;s made for someone older or with more significant signs of aging than I have.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s a high quality product that has made my skin look better.</li>
            <li>Smooth, gentle, and works!</li>
            <li>I have long respected the L&#x27;Oreal name for producing good quality products.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet good for my skin,I feel much younger,I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I am always glad to try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s new moisturizers.</li>
            <li>This cream made my skin appear smoother and more vibrant right after application, but so does my inexpensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li>After almost four weeks, some firmness can be noticed, so overall the results were pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It seems a bit greasy at first, but absorbs nicely to leave a feeling of soft, moist skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this cream so far and recommend it!</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s price right now is great, but I think if I had to pay full price I would have been a little upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and absorbed easily by skin.</li>
            <li>in all, good for night use, but the lack of SPF, combined with a certain heavy, oily quality, make this a better cream for night than day.</li>
            <li>at the time I write this, its Amazon price is the about the same as it cost in a French supermarket (Carrefour) where I was vacationing, very good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying the golden balm when I ordered this (my fault not theirs).</li>
            <li>This L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream has no vitamin A, but simple basic mineral oils, shea butter, beeswax, apricot kernel oil, corn oil, carnauba wax, paraffin, royal jelly extract, rice bran oil and added calcium.</li>
            <li>I would never use this near my eyes, as I have always used a good eye cream for around the sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li>My skin is more hydrated, smooth and silky, giving me a younger fresh look.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for months and my skin is so much more hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this in the morning because I feel like I have to wait for it to be absorbed before I can put on my makeup.</li>
            <li>Also, the cream goes on smoothly and is good for night as well as day - one less glass jar to store somewhere!</li>
            <li>It is still a nice rich cream but not as thick as the golden balm, so I think it will be an even better choice in the summer months.</li>
            <li>It is rich without leaving your face oily and absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li>think this would be VERY good for the winter months when my skin is extra dry, so I&#x27;m saving it until then.  </li>
            <li>With a thick consistency and a pleasant scent, this eye cream glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li>Skin definitely felt better and more soft.  </li>
            <li>A very good moisturizer, lush and silky but just a little heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>and I have to say I am impressed with how quickly it plumps up skin to hide small line, especially around the lips and eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is good cream especially for mature skin.</li>
            <li>The best long term advice is to always stay out of direct sunlight, wear sunglasses to avoid squinting and avoid making facial expressions.</li>
            <li>instantly makes your face feel very, very smooth, like baby&#x27;s skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cream is very reasonably priced for the quantity you get.  </li>
            <li>Age Perfecting Eye Balm, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]] and this was a great eye cream - nice and thick!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>The cream itself is beautifully soft, silky- not oily and with a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>, it worked pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In addition to this I have tried their wrinkle filler in the Tube and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s works much better than Estee Lauder&#x27;s product that is supposed to do the same thing for 3 times the price.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if this was the cause, but it was enough for me to decide not to use it anymore.</li>
            <li>My wife likes this cream as it is non-greasy and it makes her face feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is good but too heavy for me.</li>
            <li>I thought if it was good for a night cream that it would be too heavy for the morning</li>
            <li>I really like L&#x27;Oreal products &amp; if you read the labels you can find the right product for your age &amp; skin type.</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that it is affordable to use everyday.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to use the cream during the day obviously, since the fragrance is pretty strong, but I wanted to see how it worked on two sets of skin.  </li>
            <li>But I apply it liberally on my face and neck every night before bed and my 51-year-old complexion looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li>The fragrance seems off-puttingly strong at first, but must fade as I&#x27;m not really sensing it once it has absorbed</li>
            <li>It was mild on my sensitive skin, leaving it feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>It is easier to put her foundation over the top of it as her skin is not so dry.  </li>
            <li>That has been my favorite night cream for a while now because I have very dry skin</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s HIGHLY fragranced, and reminds me a lot of the perfume my mom used to wear in the 80s, a lot like Opium.  </li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>Using it during the summer, is a very melting experience during the day though.  </li>
            <li>This has really made a difference on my aging skin.  </li>
            <li>The very world moisturizer indicates moisture.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t let much time pass from when I get out of the shower to getting my face and body moisturized.  </li>
            <li>However, I do not like it at all as it feels very greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li>This works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I find it very hydrating for both day and night.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my cheeks were started to droop and since I have been using this, my skin is much firmer.  </li>
            <li>They also have hydra nutrition that you apply with a eye dropper, much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>It hydrates very well.</li>
            <li>very grease @ does not mix very well with your makeup.  </li>
            <li>I use Oil of Olay then as it is such a light creme &amp; I am a sweater.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t get much product.  </li>
            <li>but I like the effects too much)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products and tend to look towards those intended for mature women because my prematurely-dry skin is similar to that of a post-menopausal woman.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;ve done a good job of taking care off your skin for years, avoided excessive sun exposure (wearing SPF around 45 on your face), refrained from smoking, excessive drinking and high Salt intake, you should be feeling pretty good about your skin in general today.</li>
            <li>My skin is mature, all right.  </li>
            <li>This is a very waxy cream, full of the perfect ingredients that are needed for protection during the cold winter months when heaters draw out what moisture you have left.  </li>
            <li>and I know for sure that I&#x27;m going to use it for a very long time--maybe forever!!!</li>
            <li>It is a great product and only goes to prove that you don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune as I have in the past to keep your skin looking</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something natural, this wouldn&#x27;t be a first choice since there are lots of unpronounceable ingredients.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thicker night cream than I&#x27;m used to and has a definite scent (not necessarily bad, just noticeable).  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;oreal has a reputation for putting out a decent product.</li>
            <li>sail, snorkel, play golf, and cross country ski -- so I&#x27;m outside most of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent fades quickly but the effects of the creme last all day.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, less firm skin due to aging, you will love the results you&#x27;ll get from using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream.</li>
            <li>No need to spend in high cost creams.  </li>
            <li>But using skin cream is definitely a smart thing to do all your adult life.  </li>
            <li>more little note-</li>
            <li>but I wish it blended in my skin a little better.</li>
            <li>This cream is rich, and I use it for night time or for when I&#x27;m home and my skin is dry.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ve just realized this moisturizer is responsible for my skin feeling sore and sensitive.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is thick and creamy, and makes my skin feel nice and</li>
            <li>For a younger person this cream would probably not be right but the label states</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a very rich almost solid cream, that works well with dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and have dry skin and the start of fine lines and decided to try this, even though it&#x27;s meant for older ladies!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Being over 50, I used this very safe cream and found in one month, my skin was noticeably less dry.</li>
            <li>Great texture, and felt lovely on my face, but the smell was cloying and just pretty awful.</li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  </li>
            <li>I live how they feel and nourish skin.</li>
            <li>the real thing!Doesn&#x27;t take much so should last me awhile.</li>
            <li>A lot of people are not aware that many creams contain vitamin A, which when exposed to sunlight can actually cause skin tumors or skin cancer.</li>
            <li>She is a former Mary Kay salesperson and has become pretty selective over the years about her cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>Not a heavy scent either!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seeing the benefit compared to women who do leave lousy feed back when they spent most of their adult years abusing their skin and then expect a remarkable difference from \\&quot;any product\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I am just about through with my first container and have purchased a second one.</li>
            <li>this is a nice, heavy moisturizer, for somewhat dry skin and is especially good for cold weather when the skin becomes a little more dry.  </li>
            <li>A few years ago, a long side to side study of all the popular face creams was done.</li>
            <li>The only thing I dislike about it (and it was nearly a deal-breaker at first</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 55 and have spent most of my life in a sunny and VERY dry location.  </li>
            <li>I use this every day and love it, I just purchased several other of the L&#x27;Oreal products this past week from Amazon because they are always sold out of most of the L&#x27;Oreal products at the local Drug Stores.  </li>
            <li>My complexion has thankfully remained clear and I notice a reduction in lines on my face.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try it during the winter when this type of moisture is really needed and can be used underneath make up for an extra layer of protection.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect miracles because I am really old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before in my life, but 2 days after using the moisturizer, my face became very flushed and very red</li>
            <li>but the smell on this cream rendered it completely unusable.</li>
            <li>it feels soft.  </li>
            <li>I am 63 years old and have been using this product for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>However, I started taking care of my skin in my late teens, so I have many years of exfoliating, moisturizing, etc.</li>
            <li>Of course,I am an old lady.</li>
            <li>(The first one lasted a long time)</li>
            <li>well, I&#x27;d almost call it an Old Lady scent.</li>
            <li>If you want to turn back the hands of time, using safe, natural oils and waxes to re-hydrate your skin and calcium to firm it up, this 4 1/2 STAR</li>
            <li>This cream is substantial, thick, and goes on smoothly, absorbs readily and makes my skin say \\&quot;Ahhhhh....\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>bought 3 of these because they were a good price, sadly I have to give it away</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel &amp; look so soft, not greasy although the creme itself is very rich &amp; thick.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and thick.</li>
            <li>I put it on after my shower at night and it sinks right in, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I just love the consistency of this cream and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I worked in a cosmetic factory for over half a decade, and I found these ingredients in this cream are not only dermatologist tested, but basic and extremely safe to use even outdoors in sunlight.</li>
            <li>This day/night cream is a little heavy for day wear but glides on nicely at night and leaves a soft velvety texture.  </li>
            <li>I used it every night for about two weeks when first received and then couldn&#x27;t stand the greasy feeling any longer, even though I put a minimal amount on my face and neck.</li>
            <li>Even with my dry skin, I found that as a day cream, it was a bit too much.</li>
            <li>Tough to judge for sure,</li>
            <li>The last ones I used were\\&quot; L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Complete Day Cream\\&quot; and \\&quot; Nutrissime Night</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not convinced that there&#x27;s any improvement with looser, sagging skin, but it has left my skin pleasantly soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find any \\&quot;pilling\\&quot; - my skin feels soft and, I think, looks younger!</li>
            <li>It does keep my skin looking hydrated and not only does my skin look soft</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my 71 year old skin.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer I&#x27;d previously been using, actually made my (already dry skin) feel even more dry when I put it on my face.  </li>
            <li>I also noticed  my skin was actually a little more firm.</li>
            <li>though i really like this cream, i felt some kind of disappointment as much as i have ordered a new one but got half-used :( .&lt;br /&gt;but, to those, who wish their complexion always smooth and young, do use it</li>
            <li>In addition, it offers no sun protection, and I definitely want sun protection in a daytime facial lotion.  </li>
            <li>Cream\\&quot; for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I overall do not like the product though I will admit it moisturizes pretty well but feels heavy.</li>
            <li>It seems to moisturize well and while the fragrance isn&#x27;t just terrible, I think it could be made a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li>The smell bothers me a little at first but doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This cream is very nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a very nice moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I became a fan of L&#x27;Oreal and for me their products are synonymous with great quality and good value.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using my Loreal age perfect night cream.</li>
            <li> believe in using better quality for your face and this is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I love this age perfect system.</li>
            <li> It is great that 1 cream is good for both morning and evening.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant fragrance and consistency.  </li>
            <li> it is good for the price</li>
            <li> loved it from the beginning.</li>
            <li> And it was in a restaurant with good lighting.  </li>
            <li> It has no scent, which is great for the morning when I&#x27;m going to work and using my own perfume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I find all Loreal products to be good.</li>
            <li> This one is no exception, and it does provide moisture to the skin, and makes it look good.</li>
            <li> I have the fortune of being blessed with good skin even though I abused it in my 20&#x27;s &amp; 30s.  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> If it were a grapefruit scent (love that!)</li>
            <li> goes on smooth not sticky - feels great on skin&lt;</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smoothly and feels great.</li>
            <li> This product is nice, but its best to use during winter months because if at anytime while out in the sun, if your face glistens, you will look very shiney because the product does not absorb well it just sits on the surface of your skin and it will look greasy.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream will give you results</li>
            <li> Still, nice compliment</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream, but</li>
            <li> /&gt;Appreciate that it is nicely affordable as well.  </li>
            <li> It has a really nice feel to it.  </li>
            <li> Have been working with L&#x27;Oreal ...not thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> But I do like to use some kind of cream on my face before putting on make-up.</li>
            <li> I like fragranced products, honestly...</li>
            <li> even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think anyone can expect overnight results from this or any kind of skin cream.</li>
            <li> I was very satisfied with them , so I was also glad to try this \\&quot;Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good part, it was an easy purchase and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> One of the best deals I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel very smooth and doesn&#x27;t get oily on me.  </li>
            <li> It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with make up layered on top.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal creams for years and generally love them.  </li>
            <li> The added calcium nourishes the skin making it firmer, more supple and resilient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When spending several weeks in the sun on a beach vacation, I feel that this is the best treatment for my face after all the sun and sea water</li>
            <li> says you can use this during the day, whenever I tried, my makeup would clump on top of it.</li>
            <li> I love using this cream by L&#x27;Oreal at night before I retire.  </li>
            <li> I love using this on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is so smooth and creamy and use it faithfully every day!  </li>
            <li> As a night cream, it is ok during the summer, but I think something lighter would be a better choice.  </li>
            <li> This item was accidentally sent to me, I ordered and am a regular user of the Age Perfect L&#x27;Oreal neck balm , which I love, but his came instead.</li>
            <li> So I thought I&#x27;d just keep this and try it, glad I did.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream offers a good hydrating formula that does not leave a greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the results were good and it&#x27;s always great to find a cream that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I like most L&#x27;oreal products.</li>
            <li> It took a week for my skin to start to feel better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream mostly just in the morning</li>
            <li> I love the scent also.  </li>
            <li> Loreal is fabulous!</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels, not at all oily, and perhaps it is diminishing my wrinkles a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve tried it</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM .&lt;br</li>
            <li> After reading labels on all the various moisturizers in the drug store, I decided on L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> If her opinion changes after a more lengthy trial.</li>
            <li> I have used for most of my life Lancome products.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this product keeps my skin moist under  &#x60;concealer&#x27; and under my face powder.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on L&#x27;Oreal and believe me would not take the time to leave any feed back if the stuff was not truly doing wonderful things for my skin!  </li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer for my face thank you again</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this becasue so many moisturizers irritate my eyes, this one does not irritate them at all.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels and my eyes don&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and the way my skin feels after applying it.  </li>
            <li> Years ago, I worked for Lancome and had tried many of their products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I was using L&#x27;Oreal day/night cremes &amp; was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have read the comments about the smell &amp; couldn&#x27;t disagree more.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; it seems to have become part of the ritual of using the creme.</li>
            <li> most of their cream kinda glades on  hope  </li>
            <li> Many cosmetics are way over priced and they do not work any better than this product does.  </li>
            <li> I love all the L&#x27;Oreal skin and beauty line.</li>
            <li> My favorite skin care cream.</li>
            <li> Love it..</li>
            <li> Was not that satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> it might be OK</li>
            <li> She says you can count on the L&#x27;Oreal name for good products that are priced right.  </li>
            <li> Many of us are willing to pay good money for a product we believe will make our skin dewy once more.</li>
            <li> Age Perfect may not turn back the hands of time, but it does make your skin look pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is my first time for my wife to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not uncomfortable and does a good job of hydrating skin.  </li>
            <li> If you want a rich cream that does not have a perfumey smell, this is for you !</li>
            <li> It is definitely worth trying!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Found it was very good at moisturizing and moderate firming seen</li>
            <li> I hope that if you do try it you get the same remarkable results that I have seen  in my own</li>
            <li> Wow is it ever a great product all in one jar.  </li>
            <li> This is a good cream that seems to really moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is reasonably priced and does a good job.  </li>
            <li> Although the packaging is simple, but the product quality is good!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t absorb into the skin very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Living in Arizona, I felt it was important to use a good night moisturizer because of the intense heat in this State.  </li>
            <li> For such a great cream I would expect to pay much more.</li>
            <li> This formula has somewhat of a strong scent.  </li>
            <li> is the strong scent.</li>
            <li> While I use &amp; love the Nightime Age Perfect cream, this one simply was too much.</li>
            <li> It seems to work just fine for others, but for me it was a nightmare.  </li>
            <li> I am sensitive to smells, but this product does not bother me and I find it fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li> This line of creams is nice for us older faced women!</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly</li>
            <li> importantly, avoid the harmful ultraviolet rays (UVA primarily) on your face.  </li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and spreads well.</li>
            <li> free believe it or not.  </li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and</li>
            <li> She is using this product to make her skin softer and smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never thought anything of Loreal before, and can not believe how smooth and even my skin looks in the morning.  </li>
            <li> It may be fabulous for your skin.</li>
            <li> I prefer unscented or lightly scented products and this is neither.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t continue to smell it, fortunately.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe I got this so cheap and</li>
            <li> Oil Of Olay makes a great clear eye cream, and if you want to spend a bit more money on your eye area, Shiseido makes a wonderful, yet more expensive eye cream that does wonders for your skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> this cream is:  a nicely balanced, non-greasy facial cream, suitable for both day and night use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wash my face with a clean washcloth and apply any cream to a damp face.  </li>
            <li> but I rinse, again with a clean washcloth.  </li>
            <li> This cream is great for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Like my title says: this cream is wonderful for mature skin; I love the phrase mature skin, rather than old skin.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was the fragrance (quite strong), or maybe some ingredient in the moisturizer, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> Overall, though, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.  </li>
            <li> It is smooth, silky, gets quickly absorbed by my skin, and does not leave any greasy residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clearly, this is true in this case.  </li>
            <li> This cream is certainly a good addition to your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for a full 4 weeks yet, but have about 2 weeks using it.  </li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent either, which is really nice.</li>
            <li> I do feel that my skin is looking much nicer and more hydrated.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for around the eyes and above the lip to prevent aging and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> It really is a bath to skin, and safe to use.</li>
            <li> I now have close to their full line of skincare products.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it when I selected this item, but it&#x27;s made for someone older or with more significant signs of aging than I have.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s a high quality product that has made my skin look better.</li>
            <li> Smooth, gentle, and works!</li>
            <li> I have long respected the L&#x27;Oreal name for producing good quality products.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet good for my skin,I feel much younger,I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I am always glad to try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s new moisturizers.</li>
            <li> This cream made my skin appear smoother and more vibrant right after application, but so does my inexpensive moisturizer.</li>
            <li> After almost four weeks, some firmness can be noticed, so overall the results were pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It seems a bit greasy at first, but absorbs nicely to leave a feeling of soft, moist skin.  </li>
            <li> I love this cream so far and recommend it!</li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s price right now is great, but I think if I had to pay full price I would have been a little upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and absorbed easily by skin.</li>
            <li> in all, good for night use, but the lack of SPF, combined with a certain heavy, oily quality, make this a better cream for night than day.</li>
            <li> at the time I write this, its Amazon price is the about the same as it cost in a French supermarket (Carrefour) where I was vacationing, very good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying the golden balm when I ordered this (my fault not theirs).</li>
            <li> This L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream has no vitamin A, but simple basic mineral oils, shea butter, beeswax, apricot kernel oil, corn oil, carnauba wax, paraffin, royal jelly extract, rice bran oil and added calcium.</li>
            <li> I would never use this near my eyes, as I have always used a good eye cream for around the sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> My skin is more hydrated, smooth and silky, giving me a younger fresh look.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for months and my skin is so much more hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this in the morning because I feel like I have to wait for it to be absorbed before I can put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, the cream goes on smoothly and is good for night as well as day - one less glass jar to store somewhere!</li>
            <li> It is still a nice rich cream but not as thick as the golden balm, so I think it will be an even better choice in the summer months.</li>
            <li> It is rich without leaving your face oily and absorbs really well.  </li>
            <li> think this would be VERY good for the winter months when my skin is extra dry, so I&#x27;m saving it until then.  </li>
            <li> With a thick consistency and a pleasant scent, this eye cream glides on smoothly.</li>
            <li> Skin definitely felt better and more soft.  </li>
            <li> A very good moisturizer, lush and silky but just a little heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am impressed with how quickly it plumps up skin to hide small line, especially around the lips and eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is good cream especially for mature skin.</li>
            <li> The best long term advice is to always stay out of direct sunlight, wear sunglasses to avoid squinting and avoid making facial expressions.</li>
            <li> instantly makes your face feel very, very smooth, like baby&#x27;s skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cream is very reasonably priced for the quantity you get.  </li>
            <li> Age Perfecting Eye Balm, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]] and this was a great eye cream - nice and thick!</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> The cream itself is beautifully soft, silky- not oily and with a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> , it worked pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In addition to this I have tried their wrinkle filler in the Tube and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s works much better than Estee Lauder&#x27;s product that is supposed to do the same thing for 3 times the price.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if this was the cause, but it was enough for me to decide not to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> My wife likes this cream as it is non-greasy and it makes her face feel smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> This moisturizer is good but too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> I thought if it was good for a night cream that it would be too heavy for the morning</li>
            <li> I really like L&#x27;Oreal products &amp; if you read the labels you can find the right product for your age &amp; skin type.</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that it is affordable to use everyday.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to use the cream during the day obviously, since the fragrance is pretty strong, but I wanted to see how it worked on two sets of skin.  </li>
            <li> But I apply it liberally on my face and neck every night before bed and my 51-year-old complexion looks better than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> The fragrance seems off-puttingly strong at first, but must fade as I&#x27;m not really sensing it once it has absorbed</li>
            <li> It was mild on my sensitive skin, leaving it feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> It is easier to put her foundation over the top of it as her skin is not so dry.  </li>
            <li> That has been my favorite night cream for a while now because I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s HIGHLY fragranced, and reminds me a lot of the perfume my mom used to wear in the 80s, a lot like Opium.  </li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> Using it during the summer, is a very melting experience during the day though.  </li>
            <li> This has really made a difference on my aging skin.  </li>
            <li> The very world moisturizer indicates moisture.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t let much time pass from when I get out of the shower to getting my face and body moisturized.  </li>
            <li> However, I do not like it at all as it feels very greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin.  </li>
            <li> This works very well for me.</li>
            <li> I find it very hydrating for both day and night.  </li>
            <li> I noticed that my cheeks were started to droop and since I have been using this, my skin is much firmer.  </li>
            <li> They also have hydra nutrition that you apply with a eye dropper, much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> It hydrates very well.</li>
            <li> very grease @ does not mix very well with your makeup.  </li>
            <li> I use Oil of Olay then as it is such a light creme &amp; I am a sweater.</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t get much product.  </li>
            <li> but I like the effects too much)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products and tend to look towards those intended for mature women because my prematurely-dry skin is similar to that of a post-menopausal woman.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve done a good job of taking care off your skin for years, avoided excessive sun exposure (wearing SPF around 45 on your face), refrained from smoking, excessive drinking and high Salt intake, you should be feeling pretty good about your skin in general today.</li>
            <li> My skin is mature, all right.  </li>
            <li> This is a very waxy cream, full of the perfect ingredients that are needed for protection during the cold winter months when heaters draw out what moisture you have left.  </li>
            <li> and I know for sure that I&#x27;m going to use it for a very long time--maybe forever!!!</li>
            <li> It is a great product and only goes to prove that you don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune as I have in the past to keep your skin looking</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something natural, this wouldn&#x27;t be a first choice since there are lots of unpronounceable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thicker night cream than I&#x27;m used to and has a definite scent (not necessarily bad, just noticeable).  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;oreal has a reputation for putting out a decent product.</li>
            <li> sail, snorkel, play golf, and cross country ski -- so I&#x27;m outside most of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent fades quickly but the effects of the creme last all day.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, less firm skin due to aging, you will love the results you&#x27;ll get from using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream.</li>
            <li> No need to spend in high cost creams.  </li>
            <li> But using skin cream is definitely a smart thing to do all your adult life.  </li>
            <li> more little note-</li>
            <li> but I wish it blended in my skin a little better.</li>
            <li> This cream is rich, and I use it for night time or for when I&#x27;m home and my skin is dry.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ve just realized this moisturizer is responsible for my skin feeling sore and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick and creamy, and makes my skin feel nice and</li>
            <li> For a younger person this cream would probably not be right but the label states</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a very rich almost solid cream, that works well with dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and have dry skin and the start of fine lines and decided to try this, even though it&#x27;s meant for older ladies!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Being over 50, I used this very safe cream and found in one month, my skin was noticeably less dry.</li>
            <li> Great texture, and felt lovely on my face, but the smell was cloying and just pretty awful.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  </li>
            <li> I live how they feel and nourish skin.</li>
            <li> the real thing!Doesn&#x27;t take much so should last me awhile.</li>
            <li> A lot of people are not aware that many creams contain vitamin A, which when exposed to sunlight can actually cause skin tumors or skin cancer.</li>
            <li> She is a former Mary Kay salesperson and has become pretty selective over the years about her cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> Not a heavy scent either!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing the benefit compared to women who do leave lousy feed back when they spent most of their adult years abusing their skin and then expect a remarkable difference from \\&quot;any product\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I am just about through with my first container and have purchased a second one.</li>
            <li> this is a nice, heavy moisturizer, for somewhat dry skin and is especially good for cold weather when the skin becomes a little more dry.  </li>
            <li> A few years ago, a long side to side study of all the popular face creams was done.</li>
            <li> The only thing I dislike about it (and it was nearly a deal-breaker at first</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 and have spent most of my life in a sunny and VERY dry location.  </li>
            <li> I use this every day and love it, I just purchased several other of the L&#x27;Oreal products this past week from Amazon because they are always sold out of most of the L&#x27;Oreal products at the local Drug Stores.  </li>
            <li> My complexion has thankfully remained clear and I notice a reduction in lines on my face.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try it during the winter when this type of moisture is really needed and can be used underneath make up for an extra layer of protection.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles because I am really old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before in my life, but 2 days after using the moisturizer, my face became very flushed and very red</li>
            <li> but the smell on this cream rendered it completely unusable.</li>
            <li> it feels soft.  </li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have been using this product for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> However, I started taking care of my skin in my late teens, so I have many years of exfoliating, moisturizing, etc.</li>
            <li> Of course,I am an old lady.</li>
            <li> (The first one lasted a long time)</li>
            <li> well, I&#x27;d almost call it an Old Lady scent.</li>
            <li> If you want to turn back the hands of time, using safe, natural oils and waxes to re-hydrate your skin and calcium to firm it up, this 4 1/2 STAR</li>
            <li> This cream is substantial, thick, and goes on smoothly, absorbs readily and makes my skin say \\&quot;Ahhhhh....\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> bought 3 of these because they were a good price, sadly I have to give it away</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel &amp; look so soft, not greasy although the creme itself is very rich &amp; thick.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very rich and thick.</li>
            <li> I put it on after my shower at night and it sinks right in, not greasy.  </li>
            <li> I just love the consistency of this cream and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I worked in a cosmetic factory for over half a decade, and I found these ingredients in this cream are not only dermatologist tested, but basic and extremely safe to use even outdoors in sunlight.</li>
            <li> This day/night cream is a little heavy for day wear but glides on nicely at night and leaves a soft velvety texture.  </li>
            <li> I used it every night for about two weeks when first received and then couldn&#x27;t stand the greasy feeling any longer, even though I put a minimal amount on my face and neck.</li>
            <li> Even with my dry skin, I found that as a day cream, it was a bit too much.</li>
            <li> Tough to judge for sure,</li>
            <li> The last ones I used were\\&quot; L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Complete Day Cream\\&quot; and \\&quot; Nutrissime Night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not convinced that there&#x27;s any improvement with looser, sagging skin, but it has left my skin pleasantly soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find any \\&quot;pilling\\&quot; - my skin feels soft and, I think, looks younger!</li>
            <li> It does keep my skin looking hydrated and not only does my skin look soft</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my 71 year old skin.  </li>
            <li> The moisturizer I&#x27;d previously been using, actually made my (already dry skin) feel even more dry when I put it on my face.  </li>
            <li> I also noticed  my skin was actually a little more firm.</li>
            <li> though i really like this cream, i felt some kind of disappointment as much as i have ordered a new one but got half-used :( .&lt;br /&gt;but, to those, who wish their complexion always smooth and young, do use it</li>
            <li> In addition, it offers no sun protection, and I definitely want sun protection in a daytime facial lotion.  </li>
            <li> Cream\\&quot; for dry and sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I overall do not like the product though I will admit it moisturizes pretty well but feels heavy.</li>
            <li> It seems to moisturize well and while the fragrance isn&#x27;t just terrible, I think it could be made a little more pleasant.</li>
            <li> The smell bothers me a little at first but doesn&#x27;t linger too long.</li>
            <li> I have purchased skin care products that run as much as $500.00 a jar of about this size jar, down to $250.00 a jar, one that I used for a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thick cream formula that moisturizes well and improves skin softness in pretty short order, but I found that I really had to limit its use to nighttime when I wasn&#x27;t going to be active.  </li>
            <li> It is a balm so it is not a lotion which was weird at first, but it works really well for me</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see what results this cream will have and will come back and update this in a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen it at the drug stores, as that&#x27;s where I usually buy cosmetics, but I really like the product.  </li>
            <li> Over the long term it did not rehydrate my skin or make it look any younger.</li>
            <li> It plumps my skin and makes it feel youthful; it gives my skin a nice glow and keeps it from feeling tight and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> All these basic waxes, butters and oils lubricate dry skin.</li>
            <li> buy several at a time, because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, Carol, this product is no better or worse than most facial creams on the market.  </li>
            <li> I just bought this over the past summer and was truly shocked to see a remarkable difference in my skin after just a very short time.  </li>
            <li> It may be a coincidence, but I have also had people remark on how young I look for my age several times in the past 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 53 yrs old &amp; my skin shows few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> and my face continues to feel moist all day long.  </li>
            <li> My wife has some minor wrinkles and it seemed to reduce them over the couple weeks use.</li>
            <li> It is a thick cream but not greasy &amp; absorbs very well.  </li>
            <li> I think this makes it go on even smoother, and makes the product last longer - need less of it as it blends in with the moisture left on your face.</li>
            <li> If you do all these things, you probably won&#x27;t ever need skin cream unless you have acne or other skin medical conditions.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have dry skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> dry skin is feeling softer and not so dry anmore</li>
            <li> My skin takes a beating and I tend to be dry anyway</li>
            <li> I have chronic dry skin</li>
            <li> so I purchase the serum, eye cream, and face cream and my dry skin is gone.</li>
            <li> For those of you who don&#x27;t know, L&#x27;Oreal is owned by Lancome and many of the products are similar, yet much less expensive!</li>
            <li> It is a somewhat heavy cream, heavier than I generally use during the day, but I&#x27;ve been using it during the day anyway.  </li>
            <li> When I did use it, I didn&#x27;t see any marked results compared to my usual L&#x27;Oreal night cream or day cream.  </li>
            <li> I am 60 and have dry sensitive skin with very few wrinkles</li>
            <li> In fact, the super expensive ones (like La Prairie) did not fare as well as Olay.</li>
            <li> I had invasive breast cancer at age 34 and started suffering from very dry skin just before diagnosis.</li>
            <li> value as only a little is needed with each application.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using skin care ever since I was in my early 20&#x27;s and am grateful because I truly do not have hardly any wrinkles AT ALL and am over the 50 mark.  </li>
            <li> found it too heavy for daytime use in the Texas heat, so applied daily at night.&lt;br</li>
            <li> She uses it year round as it helps her skin in the summer when it is dry from the sun and in the winter when it is damaged by the wind and dry</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> people constantly comment that my skin looks like I am in my 40&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve protected myself from the sun and regularly use face products, none of which are crazy department store expensive and most are from L&#x27;Oreal or Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s all due to my skin care.  </li>
            <li> She says it stands up well to the other ones she&#x27;s used.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick, and once on made my skin look very shiny and feel a little stifled.  </li>
            <li> This face cream reminds me of a super expensive face cream a friend of mine bought in a boutique skin care store for triple digits!  </li>
            <li> It smells too much like a perfume which I hate, and it goes on my skin a little to much like a mask.</li>
            <li> Faint lemony aroma and very creamy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to happen for those women who have never cared about their face until \\&quot;it&#x27;s too late&#x27; and the wrinkles are just too deep -  </li>
            <li> This may be somewhat beneficial to those with dry skin, otherwise i would just recommend using a small amount with each application.</li>
            <li> previously lived in France for over 8 years and still return every year for a summer beach holiday.  </li>
            <li> It feels softer and less sagging.  </li>
            <li> However, I found this day/night cream to be a little lacking.</li>
            <li> A little tooo oily on the skin.  </li>
            <li> cream is moist and a little sticky, but not overly greasy.</li>
            <li> I feel it was a little thicker than I like in a cream.</li>
            <li> The box and jar are a little misleading</li>
            <li> very disappointed  been using their creams for years  with good results  this one is way too thick and  </li>
            <li> too heavy and and greasy feeling</li>
            <li> and although this face cream is supposed to be for day and night use, I found it a bit too heavy and oily for daytime use.</li>
            <li> but I found it too heavy for daytime use.</li>
            <li> These washcloths get used once, dried, and then tossed into laundry bag.  </li>
            <li> It was just too heavy to use in</li>
            <li> The heavy perfume of this product made it unusable.</li>
            <li> Although this cream is called Day/Night I have found that it&#x27;s too heavy (for me) to wear in the daytime.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect anything dramatic, but for the cost it meets expectations and will work well enough.</li>
            <li> the smell is sweat, the cream is a little too thick, anyway</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as a night cream for the past three weeks now.  </li>
            <li> Why is the price of this commodity floating so big, I think I buy expensive</li>
            <li> I gota sampleof their face creme which was quadruple the cost if not more.  </li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t outrageous and I&#x27;m so glad I gave this product a try because it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure about erasing wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> She reports that it is soothing and non-greasy, but is hardly the creator of youthful beauty as glorified in its advertising.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hard on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a bad scent, but might be an issue for those that are sensitive.  </li>
            <li> I have faithfully used skin care products since &amp; I am now in my late 50&#x27;s &amp; wrinkle</li>
            <li> If I wore it during the day, the slightest activity would leave me feeling like I had a thick layer of oily and sweat on my face.  </li>
            <li> It is a thick cream and even through the product packaging</li>
            <li> This cream is too thick and too stinky.</li>
            <li> Now I occasionally use it just because I hate to see it go to waste.  </li>
            <li> This cream was not good for me.</li>
            <li> behind me.  </li>
            <li> but I did not see the dramatic effects claimed by this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once and awhile I purchase from another source and then regret it because sometimes the wrong item is sent.</li>
            <li> I am doing the process wrong.</li>
            <li> He hated the smell.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this order.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is nice, but its best to use during winter months because if at anytime while out in the sun, if your face glistens, you will look very shiney because the product does not absorb well it just sits on the surface of your skin and it will look greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using L&#x27;Oreal creams for years and generally love them.  This one, however, is too waxy. My face stays sticky for about 30 minutes after I apply.  I don&#x27;t feel it moisturizes as well as the others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying the golden balm when I ordered this (my fault not theirs). That has been my favorite night cream for a while now because I have very dry skin and it really works. Instead of returning, I decided to give this a try. I really like it! It goes on smoothly and I don&#x27;t have dry skin in the morning. It is still a nice rich cream but not as thick as the golden balm, so I think it will be an even better choice in the summer months.</li>
            <li> Seems to lock in moisture for the day,</li>
            <li> Great! Although the packaging is simple, but the product quality is good!</li>
            <li> the smell is sweat, the cream is a little too thick, anyway it is good for the price</li>
            <li> too heavy and and greasy feeling</li>
            <li> I have normal skin. and although this face cream is supposed to be for day and night use, I found it a bit too heavy and oily for daytime use. In addition, it offers no sun protection, and I definitely want sun protection in a daytime facial lotion.  It&#x27;s a very thick cream formula that moisturizes well and improves skin softness in pretty short order, but I found that I really had to limit its use to nighttime when I wasn&#x27;t going to be active.  If I wore it during the day, the slightest activity would leave me feeling like I had a thick layer of oily and sweat on my face.  I don&#x27;t wear make-up, but if I did, I&#x27;d be concerned that any exertion would result in my make-up running.  Also, it does have a scent.  I didn&#x27;t find the scent objectionable, but some customers might.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, good for night use, but the lack of SPF, combined with a certain heavy, oily quality, make this a better cream for night than day.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth not sticky - feels great on skin&lt;br /&gt;my dry skin is feeling softer and not so dry anmore</li>
            <li> If you have dry, less firm skin due to aging, you will love the results you&#x27;ll get from using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream. I worked in a cosmetic factory for over half a decade, and I found these ingredients in this cream are not only dermatologist tested, but basic and extremely safe to use even outdoors in sunlight. A lot of people are not aware that many creams contain vitamin A, which when exposed to sunlight can actually cause skin tumors or skin cancer. This L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream has no vitamin A, but simple basic mineral oils, shea butter, beeswax, apricot kernel oil, corn oil, carnauba wax, paraffin, royal jelly extract, rice bran oil and added calcium. All these basic waxes, butters and oils lubricate dry skin. The added calcium nourishes the skin making it firmer, more supple and resilient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being over 50, I used this very safe cream and found in one month, my skin was noticeably less dry. I also noticed  my skin was actually a little more firm. The cream itself is beautifully soft, silky- not oily and with a light fragrance. I found that using it overnight when sleeping gave me the best results. I would never use this near my eyes, as I have always used a good eye cream for around the sensitive eye area. Oil Of Olay makes a great clear eye cream, and if you want to spend a bit more money on your eye area, Shiseido makes a wonderful, yet more expensive eye cream that does wonders for your skin. If you want to turn back the hands of time, using safe, natural oils and waxes to re-hydrate your skin and calcium to firm it up, this 4 1/2 STAR L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream will give you results you will notice in just one month and at a great price!</li>
            <li> A very good moisturizer, lush and silky but just a little heavy.&lt;br /&gt;Good value as only a little is needed with each application.&lt;br /&gt;I found it too heavy for daytime use in the Texas heat, so applied daily at night.&lt;br /&gt;Found it was very good at moisturizing and moderate firming seen but I did not see the dramatic effects claimed by this product.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very rich almost solid cream, that works well with dry skin but I found it too heavy for daytime use.</li>
            <li> From my wife:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously lived in France for over 8 years and still return every year for a summer beach holiday.  I became a fan of L&#x27;Oreal and for me their products are synonymous with great quality and good value. I especially love their shampoos and skin care products. I am 60 and have dry sensitive skin with very few wrinkles amd I am always glad to try L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s new moisturizers. The last ones I used were\\&quot; L&#x27;Oreal Revitalift Complete Day Cream\\&quot; and \\&quot; Nutrissime Night Cream\\&quot; for dry and sensitive skin. I was very satisfied with them , so I was also glad to try this \\&quot;Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved it from the beginning. It is smooth, silky, gets quickly absorbed by my skin, and does not leave any greasy residue. I put it on every morning and evening and after 2 weeks I feel my skin is tighter and softer. I also adore its citrus smell.  When spending several weeks in the sun on a beach vacation, I feel that this is the best treatment for my face after all the sun and sea water it endures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more little note- at the time I write this, its Amazon price is the about the same as it cost in a French supermarket (Carrefour) where I was vacationing, very good value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this moisturizer 5 stars.  And yes, I will buy another jar once I finish with this one.</li>
            <li> I believe that all these products do the job.  It&#x27;s a matter of using them correctly and often.  I do both.  And just tonight two 20-somethings told me that I have no wrinkles.  Well, I do, of course.  We all do.  And it was in a restaurant with good lighting.  Still, nice compliment and it&#x27;s all due to my skin care.  I wash my face with a clean washcloth and apply any cream to a damp face.  In the morning, I don&#x27;t wash but I rinse, again with a clean washcloth.  These washcloths get used once, dried, and then tossed into laundry bag.  This is a nice product.  Faint lemony aroma and very creamy.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this order. The goods description online is L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream, but what I received is Hydra Nutrition Day/Night Cream which I already bought in Walmart last month, it is even cheaper than that in Amazon. If I know they are the same things, I would not order it. I am very disappointed with this order.</li>
            <li> this is a nice, heavy moisturizer, for somewhat dry skin and is especially good for cold weather when the skin becomes a little more dry.  It goes on very smoothly and doesn&#x27;t interfere with make up layered on top.  A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using my Loreal age perfect night cream. It is a thick cream and even through the product packaging says you can use this during the day, whenever I tried, my makeup would clump on top of it. I have quit using it during the day and have swtiched to nights only. This is a good cream that seems to really moisturize my skin.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this. It isn&#x27;t greasy and I feel like my skin looks healthier when I use it.</li>
            <li> I love using this cream by L&#x27;Oreal at night before I retire.  It makes my skin feel very smooth and doesn&#x27;t get oily on me.  It&#x27;s a great product and I know for sure that I&#x27;m going to use it for a very long time--maybe forever!!!</li>
            <li> This is good cream especially for mature skin. I see a difference in the skin when I use it when it comes to sagging. It helps ! Thx !</li>
            <li> I love using this on my face.  It is so smooth and creamy and use it faithfully every day!  My face looks and feels great!</li>
            <li> This is a very waxy cream, full of the perfect ingredients that are needed for protection during the cold winter months when heaters draw out what moisture you have left.  If you are looking for something natural, this wouldn&#x27;t be a first choice since there are lots of unpronounceable ingredients.  I have tried it for two weeks now and I have to say I am impressed with how quickly it plumps up skin to hide small line, especially around the lips and eyes.  I can&#x27;t wait to try it during the winter when this type of moisture is really needed and can be used underneath make up for an extra layer of protection.  It also has a pleasant fragrance and consistency.  Using it during the summer, is a very melting experience during the day though.  As a night cream, it is ok during the summer, but I think something lighter would be a better choice.  Even with my dry skin, I found that as a day cream, it was a bit too much.</li>
            <li> This product actually does what it says it will do.  I will definetly continue to use it. I am truly sold on it.</li>
            <li> Once and awhile I purchase from another source and then regret it because sometimes the wrong item is sent. which never happens with Amazon, I&#x27;m a happy camper Prime member. This item was accidentally sent to me, I ordered and am a regular user of the Age Perfect L&#x27;Oreal neck balm , which I love, but his came instead. So I thought I&#x27;d just keep this and try it, glad I did. I&#x27;m in my 60&#x27;s and people constantly comment that my skin looks like I am in my 40&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve protected myself from the sun and regularly use face products, none of which are crazy department store expensive and most are from L&#x27;Oreal or Neutrogena. This cream is rich, and I use it for night time or for when I&#x27;m home and my skin is dry. I don&#x27;t use it under make up for going out during the day because it has no sun screen. If you want a rich cream that does not have a perfumey smell, this is for you !</li>
            <li> This has really made a difference on my aging skin.  It feels softer and less sagging.  I definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream offers a good hydrating formula that does not leave a greasy feeling.  Skin definitely felt better and more soft.  After almost four weeks, some firmness can be noticed, so overall the results were pretty good.  This formula has somewhat of a strong scent.  It wasn&#x27;t a bad scent, but might be an issue for those that are sensitive.  Overall, the results were good and it&#x27;s always great to find a cream that isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I have long respected the L&#x27;Oreal name for producing good quality products.  However, I found this day/night cream to be a little lacking. It seems to moisturize well and while the fragrance isn&#x27;t just terrible, I think it could be made a little more pleasant. Personally, I found the moisturizer to be a tad sticky and only use it for a night cream for that reason. I&#x27;m not convinced that there&#x27;s any improvement with looser, sagging skin, but it has left my skin pleasantly soft.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find any \\&quot;pilling\\&quot; - my skin feels soft and, I think, looks younger! Also, the cream goes on smoothly and is good for night as well as day - one less glass jar to store somewhere! I was once told to leave some water on my face before putting any cream on. I think this makes it go on even smoother, and makes the product last longer - need less of it as it blends in with the moisture left on your face.</li>
            <li> I gave this a chance since the reviews were great and now i know why! I love this moisturizer! I bought myself a 2nd one and my sister too! Smooth, gentle, and works! A must for all ladies!</li>
            <li> I like most L&#x27;oreal products. This one is very good because it provides moisture 4 both day &amp; night. I&#x27;m 53 yrs old &amp; my skin shows few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> A little tooo oily on the skin.  Didn&#x27;t absorb into the skin very quickly.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, a long side to side study of all the popular face creams was done. Price was not an indicator of quality.  In fact, the super expensive ones (like La Prairie) did not fare as well as Olay. (Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream I believe was the winner).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recall how the L&#x27;Oreal products fared or whether or not they were even tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, this is true in this case.  This cream is certainly a good addition to your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Agree-  if you&#x27;ve done a good job of taking care off your skin for years, avoided excessive sun exposure (wearing SPF around 45 on your face), refrained from smoking, excessive drinking and high Salt intake, you should be feeling pretty good about your skin in general today. Skin care is not a flash in the pan.  Your face shows years of your routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, avoid the harmful ultraviolet rays (UVA primarily) on your face.  Keep your skin hydrated and use a well balanced nourishing cream that helps you lock in moisture without adding grease or being comedogenic (causing pimples).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your facial skin care is to the contrary, this cream is NOT a substitute for derm-abrasion or plastic surgery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this cream is:  a nicely balanced, non-greasy facial cream, suitable for both day and night use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Appreciate that it is nicely affordable as well.  (Especially on sale).</li>
            <li> The moisturizer I&#x27;d previously been using, actually made my (already dry skin) feel even more dry when I put it on my face.  I have to be really careful what I use on my sensitive skin. This moisturizer is thick and creamy, and makes my skin feel nice and hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE**&lt;br /&gt;I bought 3 of these because they were a good price, sadly I have to give it away, I&#x27;ve just realized this moisturizer is responsible for my skin feeling sore and sensitive. I&#x27;ve used L&#x27;Oreal products for years, there is something in this, that my skin doesn&#x27;t care for. It took a week for my skin to start to feel better.</li>
            <li> The very world moisturizer indicates moisture. Many of us are willing to pay good money for a product we believe will make our skin dewy once more. Age Perfect may not turn back the hands of time, but it does make your skin look pretty good. I would definitely recommend it. It&#x27;s affordable too. L&#x27;oreal has a reputation for putting out a decent product.</li>
            <li> My skin is mature, all right.  This day/night cream is a little heavy for day wear but glides on nicely at night and leaves a soft velvety texture.  I will definitely buy this cream again.</li>
            <li> This cream is very nice.  It has a really nice feel to it.  I put it on after my shower at night and it sinks right in, not greasy.  It has no scent, which is great for the morning when I&#x27;m going to work and using my own perfume.&lt;br /&gt;It instantly makes your face feel very, very smooth, like baby&#x27;s skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe in using better quality for your face and this is perfect.  I will continue using it morning and night and when I run out, I will be getting more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product for a full 4 weeks yet, but have about 2 weeks using it.  It is a somewhat heavy cream, heavier than I generally use during the day, but I&#x27;ve been using it during the day anyway.  The fragrance seems off-puttingly strong at first, but must fade as I&#x27;m not really sensing it once it has absorbed and my husband hasn&#x27;t commented on the smell (he does sometimes with my face creams.)  It seems a bit greasy at first, but absorbs nicely to leave a feeling of soft, moist skin.  I&#x27;m 55 and have spent most of my life in a sunny and VERY dry location.  My skin takes a beating and I tend to be dry anyway so I don&#x27;t let much time pass from when I get out of the shower to getting my face and body moisturized.  I&#x27;ve been using this cream mostly just in the morning and my face continues to feel moist all day long.  I was worried with the initial heaviness that it would feel \\&quot;melty\\&quot; when I sweated when working in the garden or exercising, but that has not been the case.  Tough to judge for sure, but I think that the skin on my face and neck seems a bit firmer and some of the smaller lines have smoothed and softened a bit.  This is a product that I will be happy to buy and continue to use.</li>
            <li> This face cream reminds me of a super expensive face cream a friend of mine bought in a boutique skin care store for triple digits!  I just love the consistency of this cream and a little goes a long way.  It is rich without leaving your face oily and absorbs really well.  I love the scent also.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see what results this cream will have and will come back and update this in a couple of months.  I love this cream so far and recommend it!</li>
            <li> Like my title says: this cream is wonderful for mature skin; I love the phrase mature skin, rather than old skin. Ha! ha!  It is a thick cream but not greasy &amp; absorbs very well.  For a younger person this cream would probably not be right but the label states that by saying: anti-sagging.  I really like L&#x27;Oreal products &amp; if you read the labels you can find the right product for your age &amp; skin type.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but I wish it blended in my skin a little better. But it&#x27;s a high quality product that has made my skin look better.</li>
            <li> I almost order L&#x27;Oreal products and thought this sounded great.  However, I do not like it at all as it feels very greasy and doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb into the skin.  I used it every night for about two weeks when first received and then couldn&#x27;t stand the greasy feeling any longer, even though I put a minimal amount on my face and neck. Now I occasionally use it just because I hate to see it go to waste.  When I did use it, I didn&#x27;t see any marked results compared to my usual L&#x27;Oreal night cream or day cream.  Wouldn&#x27;t order it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it when I selected this item, but it&#x27;s made for someone older or with more significant signs of aging than I have.  It&#x27;s a thicker night cream than I&#x27;m used to and has a definite scent (not necessarily bad, just noticeable).  Overall, though, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.  It absorbs well into the skin &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave any oily residue.  The next day my face does feel a bit \\&quot;cake-y\\&quot; but after cleaning it off, my face looks/feels healthier.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a day cream for this reason.  I can&#x27;t speak to how well it minimizes wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I picked this up on Vine for my wife.  She loves it and has now become a regular user.  She is a former Mary Kay salesperson and has become pretty selective over the years about her cosmetics.  She says it&#x27;s definitely a 5-star product.  She has also started using the BB cream in the same product line and swears by that as well.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid-30&#x27;s, but have some medical issues that have affected my hormones. I had invasive breast cancer at age 34 and started suffering from very dry skin just before diagnosis. Now, after chemo, my skin is parched and thirsty. I&#x27;ve tried so many products and tend to look towards those intended for mature women because my prematurely-dry skin is similar to that of a post-menopausal woman. This works very well for me. It plumps my skin and makes it feel youthful; it gives my skin a nice glow and keeps it from feeling tight and uncomfortable. It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve tried and I will continue to use this. I am sensitive to smells, but this product does not bother me and I find it fairly pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have always wear Loreal, and this Age Perfect i started using it about 3 months ago.  I have noticed the changed on the elasticity of my skin, and moisture.  My skin is more hydrated, smooth and silky, giving me a younger fresh look.  No need to spend in high cost creams.  Loreal is fabulous!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is good but too heavy for me.</li>
            <li> The price in Amazon is lower than my country&#x27;s..It&#x27;s quiet good for my skin,I feel much younger,I love it so much.</li>
            <li> The cream is very reasonably priced for the quantity you get.  My wife and I both tried out this cream to see how it went.  I&#x27;m not going to use the cream during the day obviously, since the fragrance is pretty strong, but I wanted to see how it worked on two sets of skin.  Result, it worked pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is moist and a little sticky, but not overly greasy. It&#x27;s not uncomfortable and does a good job of hydrating skin.  My wife has some minor wrinkles and it seemed to reduce them over the couple weeks use. She says it stands up well to the other ones she&#x27;s used.  Don&#x27;t expect anything dramatic, but for the cost it meets expectations and will work well enough.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice moisturizer.  Goes on smooth and spreads well. Not a heavy scent either, which is really nice. I would recommend this. L&#x27;Oreal is a great product.</li>
            <li> Have been working with L&#x27;Oreal ...not thrilled with the product.</li>
            <li> With a thick consistency and a pleasant scent, this eye cream glides on smoothly. It was mild on my sensitive skin, leaving it feeling moisturized. The only noticeable drawback was that it was a bit greasy. This may be somewhat beneficial to those with dry skin, otherwise i would just recommend using a small amount with each application.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product as a night cream for the past three weeks now.  My complexion has thankfully remained clear and I notice a reduction in lines on my face.  It may be a coincidence, but I have also had people remark on how young I look for my age several times in the past 2 weeks.  This is a good product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles because I am really old. But I do like to use some kind of cream on my face before putting on make-up. I love the way this feels, not at all oily, and perhaps it is diminishing my wrinkles a bit. It also smells wonderful. I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve tried it and it will now be my skin cream of choice.</li>
            <li> I love this age perfect system. I have chronic dry skin so I purchase the serum, eye cream, and face cream and my dry skin is gone. You can&#x27;t been amazons price and convenience. I will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years</li>
            <li> Why is the price of this commodity floating so big, I think I buy expensive</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd jar.  I find it very hydrating for both day and night.  Not a heavy scent either!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS ITEM .&lt;br /&gt;DEB,</li>
            <li> Living in Arizona, I felt it was important to use a good night moisturizer because of the intense heat in this State.  After reading labels on all the various moisturizers in the drug store, I decided on L&#x27;Oreal Age Perfect Moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve never had an allergic reaction to anything before in my life, but 2 days after using the moisturizer, my face became very flushed and very red and I had no idea why.  It took about 4 days of using the product when it suddenly occurred to me that my red, flushed face started when I began using this moisturizer.  I stopped using it that night and the next day I had no redness and no flushing.  It seems to work just fine for others, but for me it was a nightmare.  Perhaps it was the fragrance (quite strong), or maybe some ingredient in the moisturizer, but it certainly didn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for firming.  I just re-purchased it because it is working so well.  I noticed that my cheeks were started to droop and since I have been using this, my skin is much firmer.  It is a balm so it is not a lotion which was weird at first, but it works really well for me</li>
            <li> I feel it was a little thicker than I like in a cream. They also have hydra nutrition that you apply with a eye dropper, much easier to apply.</li>
            <li> Oh lord THE SMELL. I like fragranced products, honestly... but the smell on this cream rendered it completely unusable. Great texture, and felt lovely on my face, but the smell was cloying and just pretty awful.</li>
            <li> I find all Loreal products to be good. This one is no exception, and it does provide moisture to the skin, and makes it look good.</li>
            <li> According to my wife, Carol, this product is no better or worse than most facial creams on the market.  She reports that it is soothing and non-greasy, but is hardly the creator of youthful beauty as glorified in its advertising.  If her opinion changes after a more lengthy trial. the results will be added to this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schuyler T Wallace</li>
            <li> The cream goes on smoothly and feels great. It is great that 1 cream is good for both morning and evening. I thought if it was good for a night cream that it would be too heavy for the morning but it is not. I do feel that my skin is looking much nicer and more hydrated. For such a great cream I would expect to pay much more.</li>
            <li> This cream is great for dry skin.  It hydrates very well. I&#x27;ve been using it for months and my skin is so much more hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> I have tried just about everything for my skin as the years have passed and basically I have to say that this is some of the  very best skin care product that I have ever found.  I have been using skin care ever since I was in my early 20&#x27;s and am grateful because I truly do not have hardly any wrinkles AT ALL and am over the 50 mark.  I have purchased skin care products that run as much as $500.00 a jar of about this size jar, down to $250.00 a jar, one that I used for a long time was Estee Lauder at $500.00 per jar, to Lancome at the $250.00 per jar.  I have used for most of my life Lancome products.  I just bought this over the past summer and was truly shocked to see a remarkable difference in my skin after just a very short time.  I use this every day and love it, I just purchased several other of the L&#x27;Oreal products this past week from Amazon because they are always sold out of most of the L&#x27;Oreal products at the local Drug Stores.  In addition to this I have tried their wrinkle filler in the Tube and L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s works much better than Estee Lauder&#x27;s product that is supposed to do the same thing for 3 times the price.  I love the way this product keeps my skin moist under  &#x60;concealer&#x27; and under my face powder.  It does keep my skin looking hydrated and not only does my skin look soft it feels soft.  It is a great product and only goes to prove that you don&#x27;t need to spend a fortune as I have in the past to keep your skin looking great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sold on L&#x27;Oreal and believe me would not take the time to leave any feed back if the stuff was not truly doing wonderful things for my skin!  I hope that if you do try it you get the same remarkable results that I have seen  in my own skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that because I have always taken care of my skin I&#x27;m seeing the benefit compared to women who do leave lousy feed back when they spent most of their adult years abusing their skin and then expect a remarkable difference from \\&quot;any product\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not going to happen for those women who have never cared about their face until \\&quot;it&#x27;s too late&#x27; and the wrinkles are just too deep -  This product is a really great skin care product -</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer for my face thank you again</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about getting this becasue so many moisturizers irritate my eyes, this one does not irritate them at all. I love it. I love how it smells. I love how my skin feels and my eyes don&#x27;t burn.</li>
            <li> This cream was not good for me. While I use &amp; love the Nightime Age Perfect cream, this one simply was too much. My face would break out. I have given it to my daughter, however, who like it.This line of creams is nice for us older faced women!</li>
            <li> I am 63 years old and have been using this product for quite a while.  I love the texture and the way my skin feels after applying it.  Years ago, I worked for Lancome and had tried many of their products. For those of you who don&#x27;t know, L&#x27;Oreal is owned by Lancome and many of the products are similar, yet much less expensive! I have noticed some improvement in the overall texture of my skin since using this product.  However, I started taking care of my skin in my late teens, so I have many years of exfoliating, moisturizing, etc. behind me.  I use Olay Pro x 30 SPF Moisturizer during the day and the L&#x27;Oreal Cream at night.  It reminds me of the Lancome Absolue Cream, which runs about $175 as compared to $13 for the L&#x27;Oreal...quite a difference! It is definitely worth trying!!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I&#x27;ve noticed a big difference in my 71 year old skin.  Would like to see it added to subscribe and save</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really hard on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sail, snorkel, play golf, and cross country ski -- so I&#x27;m outside most of the year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried lots of skin care products, and this one is hands-down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy several at a time, because I&#x27;m afraid I won&#x27;t be able to find it.</li>
            <li> very grease @ does not mix very well with your makeup.  I am using it for just a night cream until it is gone.</li>
            <li> I use this cream after I shower at night. It&#x27;s very rich and thick. The smell bothers me a little at first but doesn&#x27;t linger too long. I don&#x27;t use this in the morning because I feel like I have to wait for it to be absorbed before I can put on my makeup.</li>
            <li> I have the fortune of being blessed with good skin even though I abused it in my 20&#x27;s &amp; 30s.  I have faithfully used skin care products since &amp; I am now in my late 50&#x27;s &amp; wrinkle free believe it or not.  I was using L&#x27;Oreal day/night cremes &amp; was satisfied. Then when looking to repurchase my night creme I cam across this product &amp; took a chance.  Wow is it ever a great product all in one jar.  It makes my skin feel &amp; look so soft, not greasy although the creme itself is very rich &amp; thick.  I have read the comments about the smell &amp; couldn&#x27;t disagree more. I love it &amp; it seems to have become part of the ritual of using the creme. The scent fades quickly but the effects of the creme last all day. The creme seems to breathe so my face doesn&#x27;t get shiny or oily. I use this day &amp; night except in the middle of summer.  I use Oil of Olay then as it is such a light creme &amp; I am a sweater. The most important thing is that it is affordable to use everyday.  During Christmas I went to L&#x27;Occitane to buy my friend a gift. I gota sampleof their face creme which was quadruple the cost if not more.  It couldn&#x27;t even compare with this product.</li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal advertises this as a new product and it may be.  I haven&#x27;t seen it at the drug stores, as that&#x27;s where I usually buy cosmetics, but I really like the product.  It goes on so smoothly and even without foundation or mineral powder, it makes the skin look and feel nice.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  it takes time to see if things are working the way they should.  I&#x27;ll be happy to change the rating after I&#x27;ve used it for a month.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff and uses it all the time.  I would recommend to anyone who likes Loreal. kjh</li>
            <li> This cream is too thick and too stinky. It smells too much like a perfume which I hate, and it goes on my skin a little to much like a mask. I read somewhere it is part of a four step regime and I only have this product so it could be I am doing the process wrong. I overall do not like the product though I will admit it moisturizes pretty well but feels heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and have dry skin and the start of fine lines and decided to try this, even though it&#x27;s meant for older ladies!  The first thing I noticed is that it&#x27;s HIGHLY fragranced, and reminds me a lot of the perfume my mom used to wear in the 80s, a lot like Opium.  It&#x27;s very thick, and once on made my skin look very shiny and feel a little stifled.  I used this for 3 days and didn&#x27;t notice any difference, although that amount of time is probably too short to judge.  It was just too heavy to use in the summer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be VERY good for the winter months when my skin is extra dry, so I&#x27;m saving it until then.  I will use it at night because I like to use products with SPF during the day.  The box and jar are a little misleading and you don&#x27;t get much product.  I think using it conservatively, you might get 3 weeks&#x27; use out of this.  Amazon&#x27;s price right now is great, but I think if I had to pay full price I would have been a little upset.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I tried this with L&#x27;Oreal [[ASIN:B0055S4BZ2 Age Perfecting Eye Balm, 0.5 Fluid Ounce]] and this was a great eye cream - nice and thick!</li>
            <li> It is my first time for my wife to use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Age Perfect Intense Nutrition Day/Night Cream. She is using this product to make her skin softer and smooth. She likes the thickness of the cream. It actually does make her skin feel somewhat smoother or softer. She also likes the perfume aroma. However, I don&#x27;t think anyone can expect overnight results from this or any kind of skin cream. But using skin cream is definitely a smart thing to do all your adult life.  The best long term advice is to always stay out of direct sunlight, wear sunglasses to avoid squinting and avoid making facial expressions. Wrinkles are definitely avoidable. If you do all these things, you probably won&#x27;t ever need skin cream unless you have acne or other skin medical conditions.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for around the eyes and above the lip to prevent aging and wrinkles. The price wasn&#x27;t outrageous and I&#x27;m so glad I gave this product a try because it works.</li>
            <li> This cream made my skin appear smoother and more vibrant right after application, but so does my inexpensive moisturizer. Over the long term it did not rehydrate my skin or make it look any younger. I believe this product contains paraffin, which makes it feel heavier than regular moisturizers. I also started to see some blemishes after use. I can&#x27;t say for sure if this was the cause, but it was enough for me to decide not to use it anymore.</li>
            <li> I bought this on a trip as an emergency night cream and have been using it almost every night in between use of my $$$ night cream.  I&#x27;d never thought anything of Loreal before, and can not believe how smooth and even my skin looks in the morning.  I&#x27;m not sure about erasing wrinkles.  It is very moisturizing and absorbed easily by skin.</li>
            <li> very disappointed  been using their creams for years  with good results  this one is way too thick and  sticks to my skin  most of their cream kinda glades on  hope  some one from L&#x27;oreal  is looking</li>
            <li> My wife likes this cream as it is non-greasy and it makes her face feel smooth and soft.  It is easier to put her foundation over the top of it as her skin is not so dry.  It hydrates her skin and helps reduce wrinkles.  She uses it year round as it helps her skin in the summer when it is dry from the sun and in the winter when it is damaged by the wind and dry air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is reasonably priced and does a good job.  She says you can count on the L&#x27;Oreal name for good products that are priced right.  Many cosmetics are way over priced and they do not work any better than this product does.  She recommends it to you.</li>
            <li> I love all the L&#x27;Oreal skin and beauty line. I live how they feel and nourish skin. It really is a bath to skin, and safe to use. I now have close to their full line of skincare products.</li>
            <li> I use this at night and my skin looks great in the morning.Give it a couple of weeks to see the results.Of course,I am an old lady.Maybe you,youngsters in your 50-ies or 60-ies,will see the results sooner !!</li>
            <li> though i really like this cream, i felt some kind of disappointment as much as i have ordered a new one but got half-used :( .&lt;br /&gt;but, to those, who wish their complexion always smooth and young, do use it</li>
            <li> Non greasy, moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> My favorite skin care cream. Love it..</li>
            <li> Arghhhhhh!  The heavy perfume of this product made it unusable. Threw it away after three nights. Just couldn&#x27;t stand the smell.  My husband was stoic the nights I wore it, but literally breathed a sigh of relief when I told him I was tossing it. He hated the smell. It may be fabulous for your skin. I&#x27;ll never know.</li>
            <li> Wonderful moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Was not that satisfied with it. Personally i found the smell to be overpowering. And NOTHING in a jar can do anything about aging. Good part, it was an easy purchase and arrived as promised.</li>
            <li> Although this cream is called Day/Night I have found that it&#x27;s too heavy (for me) to wear in the daytime. But I apply it liberally on my face and neck every night before bed and my 51-year-old complexion looks better than it has in a long time. I am just about through with my first container and have purchased a second one. (The first one lasted a long time) This cream is substantial, thick, and goes on smoothly, absorbs readily and makes my skin say \\&quot;Ahhhhh....\\&quot;  The only thing I dislike about it (and it was nearly a deal-breaker at first but I like the effects too much) is the strong scent. I prefer unscented or lightly scented products and this is neither. If it were a grapefruit scent (love that!) or maybe vanilla it might be OK but this is, well, I&#x27;d almost call it an Old Lady scent. I think it&#x27;s intended to smell upscale and fancy. It&#x27;s perfumey in a way I dislike. Sorry I can&#x27;t be more specific. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it now though and once it&#x27;s on my face I don&#x27;t continue to smell it, fortunately.</li>
            <li> Cannot believe I got this so cheap and the real thing!Doesn&#x27;t take much so should last me awhile. One of the best deals I have gotten so far.</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without feeling greasy.</li>
    </ol>
