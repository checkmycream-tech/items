            <li>I love the lavender aroma.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased that it is antibacterial</li>
            <li>yes, I enjoyed the fragrance and the warmth of the wax.  </li>
            <li>I gave five stars because this product is great, it melted fine and has just a scent of lavender which is very calming.</li>
            <li>It works very well and smells pleasant to.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily as an added benefit to scarring relief and moisturizing after my many hand surgeries.</li>
            <li>The smell is not lavender, it&#x27;s more like cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li>The lavender smell was so strong, it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li>As a first time user, I would have liked a sufficient amount of wax</li>
            <li>I love the values of the price and when I get in I love my foot spa, thank you very much</li>
            <li>But I would recommend you buy 2 packs, 1 is fine for hand use.</li>
            <li>but otherwise fine for the price</li>
            <li>My shoe size is 10 1/2, so my feet do not quite fit the bath.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the aroma of the lavender wax.  </li>
            <li>smells fresh love it///</li>
            <li>Not to worry; I put on my spa and within minutes the warm wax is absorbing all the tension and making even my bones feel as if they have been treated to a day at a spa.</li>
            <li>leave your hands and feet so smooth.</li>
            <li>filled the need .</li>
            <li>Melts to a liquid quickly and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Love this whole line!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is sweet and mild.</li>
            <li>Melts adequately.</li>
            <li>Melts quick.</li>
            <li>I added some more essential oils and now it peals off cleaner and smells better.</li>
            <li>It is mildly scented and covers well.  </li>
            <li>Does better when the temp is not on high</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it melts well, has some nice essential oils in there, and it&#x27;s overall good stuff.</li>
            <li>It came quickly and is economical to buy.</li>
            <li>This item arrived in just a few days, great value for the money.</li>
            <li>It never got warm enough to melt.</li>
            <li>Will buy again and its useful.  </li>
            <li>LOL I did not realized initially how much wax you use each time, so be sure to order extra!</li>
            <li>just right, does the necessary job, smells nice.</li>
            <li>So this is a excellent product as I like to keep the aches of old age awawy from me as long as I can, helps the skin be soft,</li>
            <li>This is not the best deal on Amazon for this wax, and 1lb isn&#x27;t enough to fill my little Conair trueglow up.  </li>
            <li>But I needed twice as much because a kind isn&#x27;t enough</li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast.  </li>
            <li>You really need 3 LB to adequately cover your hands.</li>
            <li>It came in the mail in a plastic envelope, very soft, almost liquid, and it isn&#x27;t scented like a light lavender, it smells like one of those car deodorizers that you hang from the rear-view mirror.</li>
            <li>thank you very much</li>
            <li>I mixed with some unscented wax and love it</li>
            <li>the service is fast!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>just wish I would have known beforehand how much is needed for one use, which is all of it!</li>
            <li>I purchased this to go along with a hot wax bath item for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>I searched for paraffin for my hot wax machine and could not find it in town.  </li>
            <li>Merchandise was received exactly when promised.  </li>
            <li>First of all, you get one &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; of wax, not two.  </li>
            <li>Was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>I have found that the wax melts readily.  </li>
            <li>As described - thanks.</li>
            <li>Cost is  much cheaper than at stores in my area.</li>
            <li>It really soothes her knuckles and softens her skin.</li>
            <li>it was NOT lavendar but peach, it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>She loves it and thinks it left her skin feeling soft and smelling lovely.</li>
            <li>I am the only one that uses it with clean hands</li>
            <li>I have a hot paraffin wax container that I completely forgot about.  </li>
            <li>I needed more Paraffin Wax and the one on line were quite a bid less than if I would buy it in the store.</li>
            <li>Good wax with a delicate scent, leaves my skin soft, I will be reordering when I run out, works with Revlon Paraffin Bath</li>
            <li>Highly recommend a wax with fragrance.  </li>
            <li>wax is high quality and just what we needed......</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for relief of aches and pains in hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I love how leaves your skin, the fragrance, last long, and everything!</li>
            <li>I added the lavender piece to 3 lbs of plain paraffin, and the scent of lavender is lovely.</li>
            <li>Melts quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>When I found it,of course I needed to get new</li>
            <li>The wax has a subtle, nice smell.  </li>
            <li>The way the Paraffin looks after melting is very professional looking.</li>
            <li>But if you want it to last and be deep enough to cover the wrist or better, then 2 lbs.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my hands feel so soft!</li>
            <li>Good relaxing fragrance and does wonders for people with dry or hard skin on their feet.</li>
            <li>Smells perfume like and not like natural lavender.</li>
            <li>Leaves hands and feet soft and perfumed.</li>
            <li>plus is that it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wax for a hot wax therapy bath as long as the machine melts the wax</li>
            <li>Soft fragrance.</li>
            <li>I keep my hands soft with it.</li>
            <li>It also as a bonus makes my hands soft too.</li>
            <li>leaves skin soft and feeling moisturized</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I expected ...</li>
            <li>I will send it back and try for a new one.</li>
            <li>so I let it slide back off into the bath after I am finished, while temp is still on low and reuse it as long as it&#x27;s clean and convenient to put it back in.</li>
            <li>Subtle but enough to be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li>paid half as much for this wax than I pay at a&lt;br /&gt;beauty supply house.  </li>

            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this refill.</li>
            <li> I love paraffin baths, but simply love the baths more in the winter.  </li>
            <li> I love the lavender aroma.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased that it is antibacterial</li>
            <li> yes, I enjoyed the fragrance and the warmth of the wax.  </li>
            <li> I gave five stars because this product is great, it melted fine and has just a scent of lavender which is very calming.</li>
            <li> It works very well and smells pleasant to.</li>
            <li> I use it primarily as an added benefit to scarring relief and moisturizing after my many hand surgeries.</li>
            <li> The smell is not lavender, it&#x27;s more like cheap perfume smell.</li>
            <li> The lavender smell was so strong, it gave me a headache.</li>
            <li> As a first time user, I would have liked a sufficient amount of wax</li>
            <li> I love the values of the price and when I get in I love my foot spa, thank you very much</li>
            <li> But I would recommend you buy 2 packs, 1 is fine for hand use.</li>
            <li> but otherwise fine for the price</li>
            <li> My shoe size is 10 1/2, so my feet do not quite fit the bath.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the aroma of the lavender wax.  </li>
            <li> smells fresh love it///</li>
            <li> Not to worry; I put on my spa and within minutes the warm wax is absorbing all the tension and making even my bones feel as if they have been treated to a day at a spa.</li>
            <li> leave your hands and feet so smooth.</li>
            <li> filled the need .</li>
            <li> Melts to a liquid quickly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Love this whole line!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is sweet and mild.</li>
            <li> Melts adequately.</li>
            <li> Melts quick.</li>
            <li> I added some more essential oils and now it peals off cleaner and smells better.</li>
            <li> It is mildly scented and covers well.  </li>
            <li> Does better when the temp is not on high</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it melts well, has some nice essential oils in there, and it&#x27;s overall good stuff.</li>
            <li> It came quickly and is economical to buy.</li>
            <li> This item arrived in just a few days, great value for the money.</li>
            <li> It never got warm enough to melt.</li>
            <li> Will buy again and its useful.  </li>
            <li> LOL I did not realized initially how much wax you use each time, so be sure to order extra!</li>
            <li> just right, does the necessary job, smells nice.</li>
            <li> So this is a excellent product as I like to keep the aches of old age awawy from me as long as I can, helps the skin be soft,</li>
            <li> This is not the best deal on Amazon for this wax, and 1lb isn&#x27;t enough to fill my little Conair trueglow up.  </li>
            <li> But I needed twice as much because a kind isn&#x27;t enough</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast.  </li>
            <li> You really need 3 LB to adequately cover your hands.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail in a plastic envelope, very soft, almost liquid, and it isn&#x27;t scented like a light lavender, it smells like one of those car deodorizers that you hang from the rear-view mirror.</li>
            <li> thank you very much</li>
            <li> I mixed with some unscented wax and love it</li>
            <li> the service is fast!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> just wish I would have known beforehand how much is needed for one use, which is all of it!</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go along with a hot wax bath item for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> I searched for paraffin for my hot wax machine and could not find it in town.  </li>
            <li> Merchandise was received exactly when promised.  </li>
            <li> First of all, you get one &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; of wax, not two.  </li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> I have found that the wax melts readily.  </li>
            <li> As described - thanks.</li>
            <li> Cost is  much cheaper than at stores in my area.</li>
            <li> It really soothes her knuckles and softens her skin.</li>
            <li> it was NOT lavendar but peach, it was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> She loves it and thinks it left her skin feeling soft and smelling lovely.</li>
            <li> I am the only one that uses it with clean hands</li>
            <li> I have a hot paraffin wax container that I completely forgot about.  </li>
            <li> I needed more Paraffin Wax and the one on line were quite a bid less than if I would buy it in the store.</li>
            <li> Good wax with a delicate scent, leaves my skin soft, I will be reordering when I run out, works with Revlon Paraffin Bath</li>
            <li> Highly recommend a wax with fragrance.  </li>
            <li> wax is high quality and just what we needed......</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for relief of aches and pains in hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I love how leaves your skin, the fragrance, last long, and everything!</li>
            <li> I added the lavender piece to 3 lbs of plain paraffin, and the scent of lavender is lovely.</li>
            <li> Melts quickly and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> When I found it,of course I needed to get new</li>
            <li> The wax has a subtle, nice smell.  </li>
            <li> The way the Paraffin looks after melting is very professional looking.</li>
            <li> But if you want it to last and be deep enough to cover the wrist or better, then 2 lbs.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my hands feel so soft!</li>
            <li> Good relaxing fragrance and does wonders for people with dry or hard skin on their feet.</li>
            <li> Smells perfume like and not like natural lavender.</li>
            <li> Leaves hands and feet soft and perfumed.</li>
            <li> plus is that it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wax for a hot wax therapy bath as long as the machine melts the wax</li>
            <li> Soft fragrance.</li>
            <li> I keep my hands soft with it.</li>
            <li> It also as a bonus makes my hands soft too.</li>
            <li> leaves skin soft and feeling moisturized</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I expected ...</li>
            <li> I will send it back and try for a new one.</li>
            <li> so I let it slide back off into the bath after I am finished, while temp is still on low and reuse it as long as it&#x27;s clean and convenient to put it back in.</li>
            <li> Subtle but enough to be enjoyable.  </li>
            <li> paid half as much for this wax than I pay at a&lt;br /&gt;beauty supply house.  </li>
            <li> Smaller than expected  </li>
            <li> The Size of the block was much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The wax never completely melts...</li>
            <li> Helps with dry skin and joint pain.</li>
            <li> is just one pack you pay less in other places for the same wax .don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> The first time I was going to use my paraffin bath, it was a challenge to get the wax broken, asking dh if he could break it in half.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it helps me with my pain due to join inflammation.</li>
            <li> Even sitting in the plastic, unmelted, beside my computer desk made me slightly nauseous.</li>
            <li> This is not true.</li>
            <li> Not really pleased with the scent</li>
            <li> It stuck to my feet and was hard to remove.</li>
            <li> whos hand are beat from hard work.</li>
            <li> As a writer my hands often get tired and cramp up.</li>
            <li> didnt melt an work well, lousy mix in the wax</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s purplish in color but 10 people blind folded would not smell lavender..disappointed.</li>
            <li> It stinks.</li>
            <li> It stinks going to ask my mother-n</li>
            <li> if the wax dosen&#x27;t melt it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> I had to take it out of the house because the smell was making folks sick.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in the smell</li>
            <li> was disappointed for the price and the deceiving picture.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the picture shows 2 wax refills but when I received the package...</li>
            <li> We are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Smells perfume like and not like natural lavender.</li>
            <li> Does better when the temp is not on high</li>
            <li> I love the lavender aroma in the paraffin bath, very nice.</li>
            <li> This is a reorder to fill up my paraffin wax bath. It works very well and smells pleasant to. I am the only one that uses it with clean hands so I let it slide back off into the bath after I am finished, while temp is still on low and reuse it as long as it&#x27;s clean and convenient to put it back in. If not, I just toss it. But I would recommend you buy 2 packs, 1 is fine for hand use. But if you want it to last and be deep enough to cover the wrist or better, then 2 lbs. Would be needed in many cases. My shoe size is 10 1/2, so my feet do not quite fit the bath. By filling it with more wax, I plan to hopefully cover my feet as well. I use it primarily as an added benefit to scarring relief and moisturizing after my many hand surgeries. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> The wax has a subtle, nice smell.  Leaves hands and feet soft and perfumed. Highly recommend a wax with fragrance.  So much more interesting than odorless. Melts adequately.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Smells nice. Melts quick. &amp; delivered to the door!</li>
            <li> Smaller than expected  but otherwise fine for the price</li>
            <li> The paraffin was as advertised.  It wasn&#x27;t enough to fill the machine.  As a first time user, I would have liked a sufficient amount of wax so I wouldn&#x27;t have to order a second time in order to utilize the paraffin machine,</li>
            <li> The Size of the block was much smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> As advertised.  No issues.</li>
            <li> I have found that the wax melts readily.  I enjoy the aroma of the lavender wax.  I have arthritis in my hands and have found this to be soothing.  A plus is that it makes my skin soft.</li>
            <li> Well, it has a good smell, and...Well, it&#x27;s just excellent. It melted a bit on it&#x27;s way to Russia, but it didn&#x27;t affect the product. What mark can be better for paraffin?</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful. I mixed with some unscented wax and love it</li>
            <li> didnt melt an work well, lousy mix in the wax</li>
            <li> The smell is not lavender, it&#x27;s more like cheap perfume smell. Disappointed in the smell but it was delivered in good condition.</li>
            <li> nice theraputic treatment for my  arthritic  hands!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my paraffin wax bath machine I use for carpal tunnel. The lavender smell was so strong, it gave me a headache. Even sitting in the plastic, unmelted, beside my computer desk made me slightly nauseous. I returned it for a refund.</li>
            <li> It was out of stock when I ordered it, so I canceled the order. I would have enjoyed the scents if I had received/used the wax (for wrist arthritis).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wax for a hot wax therapy bath as long as the machine melts the wax it&#x27;s good if the wax dosen&#x27;t melt it&#x27;s bad.</li>
            <li> The smell is great!  Not overpowering at all.  I received the one block of Lavender, and am waiting on the actual parafin warmer and the accessories.</li>
            <li> this product was as described and very good. wax is high quality and just what we needed......thank you very much</li>
            <li> Item works great as described, smells good and the wife loves it!</li>

            <li> smells fresh love it///</li>
            <li> It was only one bar, that was 1 lb. but when I got my Paraffin bath, it came with three already, so this was just to fill it back up after I had used it a bit. I love the smell of the lavender, and it made the rest of the wax in there smell as well. Good buy.</li>
            <li> The wax has a nice fragrance and arrived quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I paid half as much for this wax than I pay at a&lt;br /&gt;beauty supply house.  Great product.</li>
            <li> It was the product that I ordered and met my expectations. L</li>

            <li> Soft fragrance. Love it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend this product because they show you two pack of paraffin wax and when you receive it is just one pack you pay less in other places for the same wax .don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> Love this Brand of paraffin wax refill melts softly and smells wonderfully. Rolls off your skin very nice and leaves a smooth moisturizer to the touch.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. Love this whole line! Melts quickly and lasts a long time. Helps with dry skin and joint pain.</li>
            <li> I received the item, opened it, put wax in and turned it on for overnight melting. It never got warm enough to melt. I will send it back and try for a new one.</li>
            <li> From the look of the picture you would think you get both pieces shown. This is not true. You only get one ...was disappointed for the price and the deceiving picture. Will definitely review closer next time I make a purchase.</li>
            <li> Good, should have read fine print. The picture shows two bars you only receive one, which was not enough.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful.  I added the lavender piece to 3 lbs of plain paraffin, and the scent of lavender is lovely.</li>
            <li> This paraffin is perfectly acceptable for my hand spa. It came quickly and is economical to buy. You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed the paraffin wax aroma.  Subtle but enough to be enjoyable.  I would recommend this product to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> Nice scent, melts fast, good quality.&lt;br /&gt;I just wish I would have known beforehand how much is needed for one use, which is all of it! I would have purchased more.</li>
            <li> decades ago I used a paraffin wax bath with gymnasts&#x27; hands. Recently got this &#x27;lavender&#x27; scented wax that is oh my goodness - the smell fills the room with the wax bath - leaves the great smell when used -</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Lavender&amp;#34; wax does not smell like lavender.  It smells horrible.  I had to take it out of the house because the smell was making folks sick.  Don&#x27;t buy this stuff.  It stinks.</li>
            <li> I like the smell, it helps me with my pain due to join inflammation.</li>
            <li> Good relaxing fragrance and does wonders for people with dry or hard skin on their feet. Amen to the comfort.</li>
            <li> I needed more Paraffin Wax and the one on line were quite a bid less than if I would buy it in the store.</li>
            <li> I I will order again.wanted something that smelled good because I leave it on all winter. It smells wonderful. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to go along with a hot wax bath item for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Nice scent and good quality.</li>

            <li> As described - thanks.</li>
            <li> Not really pleased with the scent</li>
            <li> I gave five stars because this product is great, it melted fine and has just a scent of lavender which is very calming. I use my hand spa for osteo arthritis and it makes my hands feel so great and eases the inflammation with the heat of the wax. It also as a bonus makes my hands soft too.</li>
            <li> Good scent. But I needed twice as much because a kind isn&#x27;t enough</li>
            <li> The wax was not the same quality as others I have tried. It stuck to my feet and was hard to remove. I added some more essential oils and now it peals off cleaner and smells better. If you get this wax be prepared to add to it. The price is good.</li>
            <li> Great product and smells great too.  Merchandise was received exactly when promised.  My sore aching hands feel wonderful after I used this wax and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for relief of aches and pains in hands and feet.</li>
            <li> smells amazing!  Love the lavendar!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s purplish in color but 10 people blind folded would not smell lavender..disappointed. It stinks going to ask my mother-n</li>
            <li> love the product. leaves skin soft and feeling moisturized</li>
            <li> I love the soothing smell of the refill as well as the relaxing sensation I get from soaking my hands in my spa</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using this product, it is as it says, it does work to my satisfaction, Has a nice smell an it is of the best product an glad to find tha Amazon is selling this, for the price to purchase else where, is way too expensive.  So this is a excellent product as I like to keep the aches of old age awawy from me as long as I can, helps the skin be soft, Can tell difference in using this product over others....an you can not beat the price either.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know about this product till I saw it on Amazon. Works great at healing and smells good. This is my second time ordering this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Good wax with a delicate scent, leaves my skin soft, I will be reordering when I run out, works with Revlon Paraffin Bath</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a tad too strong, so it&#x27;s perfect if you like strong perfume,  otherwise it&#x27;s a good products.</li>
            <li> Good price and good product.  No problem with it at all.  Will buy again and its useful.  Thank you for this item</li>
            <li> Love the frangrance and ease of use. This item arrived in just a few days, great value for the money.</li>
            <li> I got the lavender and it smells great. It also moisturizes well. Melts to a liquid quickly and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I love it. I am using it to help relieve joint pain.</li>
            <li> This is not the best deal on Amazon for this wax, and 1lb isn&#x27;t enough to fill my little Conair trueglow up.  So keep that in mind when you&#x27;re purchasing this wax!  Otherwise, it melts well, has some nice essential oils in there, and it&#x27;s overall good stuff.</li>
            <li> Prefer the unscented but it is okay.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product that leaves your hands and feet feeling so smooth and healthier. The fragrance is sweet and mild. Good product, would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Smells very pretty and feels real good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it, because it looks watery @room temperature.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous parafin wax. The lavender fills the room with warm, inviting aroma. Would recommend you purchase a couple. I have a big spa and one package was not enough. As a writer my hands often get tired and cramp up. Not to worry; I put on my spa and within minutes the warm wax is absorbing all the tension and making even my bones feel as if they have been treated to a day at a spa. Afterwards, my hands feel so soft! My husband loves to caress them.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed.  Cost is  much cheaper than at stores in my area. Love the lavender aroma. I use this in my wax pot for arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> She love how it helps her hand with arthritis.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if she has used the lavendar wax, though.</li>
            <li> i chose this rating because the product is really good. I like everything about it leave your hands and feet so smooth. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> I have a hot paraffin wax container that I completely forgot about.  When I found it,of course I needed to get new&lt;br /&gt;paraffin for it. I find that I live Lavender scented the best.</li>
            <li> Great for my spa. It smells great too.</li>
            <li> Bought this as part of a gift for my wife. She loves it and thinks it left her skin feeling soft and smelling lovely.</li>
            <li> This is a great item.  Works wonderfully.  It arrived quickly and was in great shape.  Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I Wish I would have known I needed 3 lbs at a time. Now I have to place another order.</li>
            <li> This product was like it was averticed</li>
            <li> I got this for a gift for my daughter whos hand are beat from hard work. She loves it. It really soothes her knuckles and softens her skin. It&#x27;s larger than some I seen while shopping so she can get her hand in good over her wrist, she can even dip her foot.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed that the picture shows 2 wax refills but when I received the package... there was only one.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this refill. This is a great product that I will re-order for my massage business.</li>
            <li> Me &amp; my daughter love this wax &amp; it smells GREAT!!! It&#x27;s exactly what I expected ... I&#x27;m very happy</li>
            <li> I love the values of the price and when I get in I love my foot spa, thank you very much</li>
            <li> Works well.  Great relief for arthritic hands.</li>
            <li> The lavender wax smells great. Love it!</li>
            <li> This wax is incredible.  It is mildly scented and covers well.  I love paraffin baths, but simply love the baths more in the winter.  The service was impeccable.  The shipping was super fast.  A+</li>
            <li> Yuck!  My wife asked for this for Christmas.  First of all, you get one &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; of wax, not two.  It came in the mail in a plastic envelope, very soft, almost liquid, and it isn&#x27;t scented like a light lavender, it smells like one of those car deodorizers that you hang from the rear-view mirror.</li>
            <li> It had leaked on the packaging</li>
            <li> The wax never completely melts...even when we have the spa turned on for weeks.  We are very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love the lavender aroma.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that it is antibacterial</li>
            <li> it was NOT lavendar but peach, it was reasonably priced. melted nicely. would order again in the future. filled the need .</li>
            <li> My spouse has pains in her hands she uses this in her wax machine and this product makes her smell delightful and her hands soft.&lt;br /&gt;PS  it also helps her manage the pain in her hands.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for and the fragrance is nice.</li>
            <li> My Clients like the way it makes their hands feel and smell.  The way the Paraffin looks after melting is very professional looking.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> Above says it all! Using for my hands with osteo arthritis. Feels so good &amp; smells even better. Works great in my paraffin bath.</li>
            <li> yes, I enjoyed the fragrance and the warmth of the wax.  thank you</li>
            <li> just right, does the necessary job, smells nice. VG</li>
            <li> I think the value is very good. You do need to keep the block(s) in a zip lock bag. And you do need to pay attention to the fact that you are ordering ONE block. Always read the entire description. Mine have arrived still sealed and intact. The first time I was going to use my paraffin bath, it was a challenge to get the wax broken, asking dh if he could break it in half. When he went at it with a hammer, we did just fine! LOL I did not realized initially how much wax you use each time, so be sure to order extra! You really need 3 LB to adequately cover your hands. Smells really nice!</li>
