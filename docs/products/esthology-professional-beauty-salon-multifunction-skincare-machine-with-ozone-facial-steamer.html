            <li>The tool&#x27;s on this unit are all nice and functioning except</li>
            <li>It did not come with any kind of instructions or manual either.</li>
            <li>( the light is bright).   </li>
            <li>But so far I&#x27;m impressed .</li>
            <li>and it took me a while to find a suitable package to put it inside.</li>

            <li>If you are new to the biz its a great startup machine.  </li>
            <li>So far I and my family are happy with my purchase</li>
            <li>but so far works great.</li>
            <li>antibacterial, galvanic machine works just fine, there 5 different attachments for a brush, the magnifying lamp works ideal to make a skin analysis</li>
            <li>other than that very happy!</li>
            <li>but for the money I would get something that is a bit more user friendly.</li>
            <li>It was a huge piece</li>
            <li>I can fit 4 15\\&quot;x24\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This unit was very simple to assemble and the instuctions on why you use the tools seem to be a very nice addition.</li>
            <li>Love the hot towel caddie.</li>
            <li>I told myself this unit would surely get me through the first couple of years until I could upgrade.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when it arrived.</li>
            <li>This was my first purchase for my new buisness and to be totally honest, It could be better .The</li>
            <li>One of the best features of this unit is the fact that It came in only three pieces!It was  easy to figure out where everything went but a little paperwork would have been nice</li>
            <li>This machine looked fine, but it broke out the first time we used it.</li>
            <li>Remember: the control panel got burned the FIRST time we started using it!</li>
            <li>I recently finished an esthetic course, and really needed a good machine to perform facials at home.</li>
            <li>I recently opened my own one-person spa &amp; was trying to keep costs to a minimum.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;dislikes: the high frequency takes awhile to light up.</li>
            <li>Everything is working just fine so far</li>
            <li>is getting a separate steamer that&#x27;s quiet :).</li>
            <li>everything else is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the steamer sprays out hot water droplets, thus making this unit not useble</li>
            <li>Will know better next time.</li>
            <li>We bought this machine a few months ago and it arrived in good shape.  </li>
            <li>The towel warmer works great but is very small.</li>
            <li>I bought this machine with one of the main reasons being that it had a mini hot towel warmer in which I was going to use for my hot stones.</li>
            <li>so I hope my review was helpful for anyone who wants to buy a machine but still hesitates.</li>
            <li>machiene was packed very well and did have instructions.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t too much I had to set up.</li>
            <li>It was very scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Then I started waiting for a shipping label from Amazon.com  or from the seller while the machine was sitting there, occupying an already very crowded space.</li>
            <li>Hot cabi can hold around 8-10 small towels, the steamer comes with ozone which much better cause ozone is</li>
            <li>I am returning it for a full refund &amp; Buying a new unit from a different maker asap...</li>
            <li>This is a great machine if you are just starting out as an esthetician (like me!), but I will definitely be saving up for different equipment in the future.</li>
            <li>Originally my idea was to buy only a steamer and magnifying lamp, however, when I saw the machine comes not only with these but a hot cabi, I made up my mind.</li>
            <li>I have seen a lot of facial machines, and in my opinion this one is really worth buying.</li>
            <li>Just a steamer and lamp normally costs what this machine did.</li>
            <li>so now im out the six hundred that this machine cost, plus another fourteen hundred on a new machine, and I had to cancel an entire weeks worth of work while I wait for the new machine.</li>
            <li>It is not ridiculously expensive, but it does its job quiet decent.</li>
            <li>Moreover shipping is free when other companies charge almost $100.</li>
            <li>My purchase arrived very fast like in 4 business days which is a big plus.</li>
            <li>it usually takes me longer then most</li>
            <li>I have been emailing back and forth about a replacement, I sent in pictures and also reminded the seller  (which they of course have no record of) of the first incident.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>to top it all off, today during a facial with my client in the room, all of a sudden there was a loud popping noise, and blue volts shooting out of the bottom of the machine, followed by a buring smell....</li>
            <li>I have been a Medical Esthetician for years &amp; this is literally the worse machine/unit of any kind that i have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>rolled facial towels comfortably, 6 if I really stuff them in there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done three treatments with it this far.</li>
            <li>My gut instinct told me to purchase a multi-function facial machine that cost three times as much, and had a well respected recognized name, but I was on a budget.  </li>
            <li>is to short, so short that you cant even turn the unit into the right position to deliver steam to your client.</li>
            <li>, I was really excited about this machine, too bad its so cheaply made &amp; put together, I expected alot more for $650.00.</li>
            <li>Small drawback is there is no any manual, however it was not a problem as it is really easy to assemble the machine.</li>
            <li>I bought 2of them didn&#x27;t even last 1year, started problem high frequency and tower warmer ,</li>
            <li>Well i do, a major disaster.</li>
            <li>I put it together for my first use, I filled the water bowl a little less than mid way with water...</li>
            <li>Complete, same the pic</li>
            <li>I think the machine was used the magnifying lamp is loose, the mushroom electrode of the high frequency is not working.</li>
            <li>The space where we provide services is small and confining, but this machine in size and price fits just right to provide quality service that both we and they can afford.</li>

            <li> just received an email back saying, &amp;#34;We apologize, but this order is from 10/25/11, so we are unable to ship the part for free since the unit only comes with a 60 day</li>
            <li> It took them a long time to get back with me and they have no way of getting the manual from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> The mobility of the steam arm is very limited so if you have a client that is on the larger side the steam arm is not high enough and you can burn their chest.</li>
            <li> We just opened a small skin care salon in Old Elk Grove CA.</li>
            <li> The bowls are black (not white as pictured) but that&#x27;s not a problem.  </li>
            <li> I wish I would have known warranty info before purchasing, it is not clearly stated like on some other products.  </li>
            <li> and i only give 3 facials a week on average!  </li>
            <li> I spent around 25 minutes on it.</li>
            <li> Broken damaged.item not worth the price made of very pooor quality.</li>
            <li> High frequency was broken.</li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lack of instuctions...</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this machine is that the timer on the steamer ticks and dings, which is disturbing to clients during a facial.</li>
            <li> Half of the equipment functions half of the time, and the towel warmer just quit working after 7 months..</li>
            <li> (the little metal piece at the end of the instrument you plug into the front of the machine).</li>
            <li> The instructions were missing but the supplier sent them by email as soon as he was contacted.  </li>
            <li> packing slip...all missing).</li>
            <li> few months ago my plugs broke</li>
            <li> (whixh is a few sheets of computer paper stapled together) and nothing.</li>
            <li> This machine is a joke, dont waste your time.</li>
            <li> All of the outlets on the side of this machine are dead.  </li>
            <li> They have a product person who writes a manual themselves, and it is lacking to say the least.</li>
            <li> It is already too late!</li>
            <li> steamer is poorly designed.  </li>
            <li> It is leaking/pouring water out of the square base on the left steamer side &amp; its not coming from the seal on the beaker.</li>
            <li> I tried unplugging it, plugging it back in, don&#x27;t understand and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> , I bought it the wrong way so after that I had to change the bed to diferent way for use the lamp</li>
            <li> This  is an expensive item It should come with a manual.</li>
            <li> It is useless........</li>
            <li> Bad business~</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed</li>
            <li> I hate putting things together</li>
            <li> The electrical cord on the steamer side, that plugs into the base to give it power</li>

            <li> I bought 2of them didn&#x27;t even last 1year, started problem high frequency and tower warmer ,</li>
            <li> We bought this machine a few months ago and it arrived in good shape.  The instructions were missing but the supplier sent them by email as soon as he was contacted.  The bowls are black (not white as pictured) but that&#x27;s not a problem.  Everything is working just fine so far and we are happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> If you are a person who looking for something like me take a look whitch way do you think to use, I bought it the wrong way so after that I had to change the bed to diferent way for use the lamp is better possition... it is a great maquine! Complete, same the pic</li>
            <li> This is a great machine for doing facials.  this model was one of the inexpensive ones, but its nice that there is a hottowel cabbie attached.  If you are new to the biz its a great startup machine.  only complaint i would have liked to had a owners manual.  other than that very happy!</li>
            <li> I bought this machine with one of the main reasons being that it had a mini hot towel warmer in which I was going to use for my hot stones. IT DOES NOT WORK!!!! I tried unplugging it, plugging it back in, don&#x27;t understand and very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This  is an expensive item It should come with a manual. It is still siting here I have not used it No manual  What next.</li>
            <li> This is a great machine if you are just starting out as an esthetician (like me!), but I will definitely be saving up for different equipment in the future. All the functions work perfectly and the machine arrived in great shape, but the company is hard to deal with. They sent no paperwork (manual, warranty, packing slip...all missing). It took them a long time to get back with me and they have no way of getting the manual from the manufacturer. They have a product person who writes a manual themselves, and it is lacking to say the least. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this machine is that the timer on the steamer ticks and dings, which is disturbing to clients during a facial. The towel warmer works great but is very small. I can fit 4 15\\&quot;x24\\&quot; rolled facial towels comfortably, 6 if I really stuff them in there. All in all, its a great deal and a fine machine, but the first thing I&#x27;ll be doing is getting a separate steamer that&#x27;s quiet :).</li>
            <li> I think the machine was used the magnifying lamp is loose, the mushroom electrode of the high frequency is not working.</li>
            <li> I recently finished an esthetic course, and really needed a good machine to perform facials at home. After having done probably 1000 researchers I finally decided to order the machine. Originally my idea was to buy only a steamer and magnifying lamp, however, when I saw the machine comes not only with these but a hot cabi, I made up my mind. My purchase arrived very fast like in 4 business days which is a big plus. All parts were properly wrapped so all glass, fragile items came unbroken. Small drawback is there is no any manual, however it was not a problem as it is really easy to assemble the machine. I spent around 25 minutes on it. I like that machine has a lot of additional function and they all work perfectly. Hot cabi can hold around 8-10 small towels, the steamer comes with ozone which much better cause ozone is antibacterial, galvanic machine works just fine, there 5 different attachments for a brush, the magnifying lamp works ideal to make a skin analysis( the light is bright).   I have seen a lot of facial machines, and in my opinion this one is really worth buying. It is not ridiculously expensive, but it does its job quiet decent. Moreover shipping is free when other companies charge almost $100. So far I and my family are happy with my purchase so I hope my review was helpful for anyone who wants to buy a machine but still hesitates.</li>
            <li> High frequency was broken.</li>
            <li> I love it. Ok I just bought it and was so scared after hearing the mix reviews. I&#x27;ve done three treatments with it this far. But everything is working well! My hot towel warmer works excellent.... If anything changes will let you know lol. But so far I&#x27;m impressed . No manual and believe me not needed. It&#x27;s three pieces and you stick in hole and plug. I hate putting things together it usually takes me longer then most but it took me maybe 10 min .</li>
            <li> We just opened a small skin care salon in Old Elk Grove CA. The space where we provide services is small and confining, but this machine in size and price fits just right to provide quality service that both we and they can afford.</li>
            <li> steamer is poorly designed.  everything else is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the steamer sprays out hot water droplets, thus making this unit not useble</li>
            <li> Broken damaged.item not worth the price made of very pooor quality.I would recommend staying away from this manufacturer at all cost.</li>
            <li> this machine is awsome, consisder the amount I paid.  the only draw back is it doesnot have a intruction booklet on how to install. I have to search the internet on some of the item.  But manage to put everything together and still work like a champ.</li>
            <li> Even though I just got the machine, it&#x27;s everything I hoped for. Just a steamer and lamp normally costs what this machine did. My only complaint is the lack of instuctions...it has been a while since my inital training</li>
            <li> I have not use this machine personally, I bought it for my Aunt hair salon, and it has been about 5 months or so, she have not yet complain once. I guess, it&#x27;s working good.</li>
            <li> Great starter machine. Only had a week but so far works great. Love the hot towel caddie.</li>
            <li> Tiene todo lo basico que se necesita para el uso en la cosmetica y al precio de venta es muy barato.  De construccion muy solida.  Lo recomiendo altamente.</li>
            <li> I recently opened my own one-person spa &amp; was trying to keep costs to a minimum. My gut instinct told me to purchase a multi-function facial machine that cost three times as much, and had a well respected recognized name, but I was on a budget.  I told myself this unit would surely get me through the first couple of years until I could upgrade.  I should have trusted my 23 years of experience-you get what you pay for! Half of the equipment functions half of the time, and the towel warmer just quit working after 7 months..and i only give 3 facials a week on average!  I am hoping the company will replace or refund for the item. I wish I would have known warranty info before purchasing, it is not clearly stated like on some other products.  Will know better next time.</li>
            <li> This was my first purchase for my new buisness and to be totally honest, It could be better .The machiene was packed very well and did have instructions. This unit was very simple to assemble and the instuctions on why you use the tools seem to be a very nice addition. Now the could be better part, The set up of this unit is kind of backwards when you have it set up and have the steam on you can&#x27;t reach the bowls so if you want to use them for your water forget it! The mobility of the steam arm is very limited so if you have a client that is on the larger side the steam arm is not high enough and you can burn their chest. The tool&#x27;s on this unit are all nice and functioning except the skin roller on my unit does not work at all. All in all the unit is okay but for the money I would get something that is a bit more user friendly.</li>
            <li> Started my Grand daughter&#x27;s career.</li>
            <li> I received it totally broke &amp; dysfunctional. The flap on the mag lite is broke. It is leaking/pouring water out of the square base on the left steamer side &amp; its not coming from the seal on the beaker. The steamer does not put out any steam. The electrical cord on the steamer side, that plugs into the base to give it power is to short, so short that you cant even turn the unit into the right position to deliver steam to your client. Do you know what you get when you mix water with electricity? Well i do, a major disaster. It did not come with any kind of instructions or manual either. I am so disappointed, I was really excited about this machine, too bad its so cheaply made &amp; put together, I expected alot more for $650.00. I am returning it for a full refund &amp; Buying a new unit from a different maker asap...I have been a Medical Esthetician for years &amp; this is literally the worse machine/unit of any kind that i have ever purchased!</li>
            <li> So I purchased this machine in 2011 for almost 800.00 dollars. I was so excited when it arrived. There wasn&#x27;t too much I had to set up. One I put it together for my first use, I filled the water bowl a little less than mid way with water...the metal that holds the bowl broke off immediately. I then placed the bowl on the bottom rack where the second bar snapped and water was everywhere again. I called to complain and I never heard back.&lt;br /&gt;A few months ago my plugs broke (the little metal piece at the end of the instrument you plug into the front of the machine). I have been emailing back and forth about a replacement, I sent in pictures and also reminded the seller  (which they of course have no record of) of the first incident.&lt;br /&gt;I just received an email back saying, &amp;#34;We apologize, but this order is from 10/25/11, so we are unable to ship the part for free since the unit only comes with a 60 day guarantee.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;My advice is don&#x27;t spend all your $$$ money on a machine that only has a 60 day guarantee. Bad business~</li>
            <li> This machine looked fine, but it broke out the first time we used it. The control panel seemed to have a circuit shortage and burned out with a big bang and almost hurt my employee. Remember: the control panel got burned the FIRST time we started using it! It was very scary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Amazon.com about it and intended to return it. It was a huge piece and it took me a while to find a suitable package to put it inside. Then I started waiting for a shipping label from Amazon.com  or from the seller while the machine was sitting there, occupying an already very crowded space. I had to move it to our backroom. Then I forgot about it until I started sorting out my expenses. then I realized I had not returned the stuff. It is already too late! I simply trashed it! No rep from the seller has ever contacted me about the incident.</li>
            <li> I bought this machine for my esthetics business a year ago.  about seven months in, several of the functions stopped working, and the towel cabbie leaked water everywhere all the time. a couple months after that the steamer quit working out of the blue. to top it all off, today during a facial with my client in the room, all of a sudden there was a loud popping noise, and blue volts shooting out of the bottom of the machine, followed by a buring smell....and then...nothing. the whole machine was dead.  I tried to contact the manufacturer, but guess what? YOU CANT! I looked in the so called \\&quot;operater manual\\&quot; (whixh is a few sheets of computer paper stapled together) and nothing. I tried to contact amazon for help but they said there was nothing I could do. so now im out the six hundred that this machine cost, plus another fourteen hundred on a new machine, and I had to cancel an entire weeks worth of work while I wait for the new machine. This machine is a joke, dont waste your time.</li>
            <li> I love the steamer, the preheated towel cabinet and the rotating brushes&lt;br /&gt;dislikes: the high frequency takes awhile to light up.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my esthetics practice and the lamp, steamer and towel heater do not work at all.  All of the outlets on the side of this machine are dead.  It is useless........</li>
            <li> One of the best features of this unit is the fact that It came in only three pieces!It was  easy to figure out where everything went but a little paperwork would have been nice</li>
