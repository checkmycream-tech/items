            <li> love it. I use this for the Aztec Bentonite clay (as it has to be mixed together) and this works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Took forever to get, but that&#x27;s ok.  Plastic, like a child&#x27;s play toy, but does what you bought it for.  Not what I had hoped for.  The price is what you get.</li>
            <li> I bought this bowl set for my Aztec Secret clay mask and it works perfectly! The bowl is definitely smaller than I expected, it is really a mini bowl, but it is actually the perfect size for the amount of clay you need to make. The mixing tool, brush, and measuring spoons work great too. Overall, it is a perfect facial mixing bowl set!</li>
            <li> It is small, and the cheap look, of course, as it is made of plastic. But it does the job for what i need. Facial mask. I recommend this product for you if , you are going to use for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Cheap and works great for mixing my face masks, I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size. I bought another brand and the bowl was too small. I highly recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I got this to mix my mud mask up in.  I thought it would be bigger, but it turns out to be a pretty good size.  I just thought everything would be a little bigger from the pics, but it works out okay.</li>
            <li> Too small, on the picture I thought was bigger, it&#x27;s like a toy dish.</li>
            <li> Great mixing and applying set for my clay mask. The bowl falls over when I try to store all the tools in it but that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Excellent!  It is exactly what I needed to mix the face max.  At first when I saw it it was small and I thought this will never work, but after I used it, I saw that it was the prefect size.  The fact that it is small makes it easier for me to travel with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to mix my Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay in and it works great. Perfect size, great utensils that come with it, would recommend this product to someone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s smaller than I thought but still works</li>
            <li> cheap like dime store cheap and took a month to get to us</li>
            <li> unbelievably usless, tacky, cheap thing from china&lt;br /&gt;just don&#x27;t buy this crap</li>
