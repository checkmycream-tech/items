            <li> I ordered this product in conjunction with a face peel and eye cream of the same brand. The peel is awesome. This cream is ok, moisturizing but not greasy. However, the smell is way too strong. It&#x27;s pleasant but way too strong...</li>
            <li> Ugh I hated the smell of it, it smells like an old women perfume very very very very sweet. I then thought well if it works and hydrates I can get passed the smell but nope doesn&#x27;t even hydrate better than a drug store body lotion</li>
