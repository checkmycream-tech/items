            <li>I did look at the art of shaving though to get an idea of what I wanted size wise.</li>
            <li>This brush is a good one.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush itself is extremely good.</li>
            <li>Good sized grip for me.</li>
            <li>Good investment.  </li>

            <li>Very good product, price is sweet.</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>I was at that point looking at pure and best badger brushes when I came across this brush.</li>
            <li>It has a large fan surface with a perfect cut.  </li>
            <li>But if you squish the tip this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>If you were thinking about it, I&#x27;m here to tell you mine is amazing.</li>
            <li>In summary I still use both brushes, but probably am using this one a bit more good product/value</li>
            <li>Washed it out with dish soap and warm water 2-3 times followed with  hair shampoo and a over-night soak in conditioner</li>
            <li>but my own backyard.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li>Great lather and full apply when used.  </li>
            <li>It does look nice and the handle is fine, but performance wise</li>
            <li>Very fine.</li>
            <li>In general, the best, most sought-after brushes are made from badger hair.</li>
            <li>many years.</li>
            <li>I did lots of research and read many reviews about brushes but in the end I purchased my brush based on price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve enjoyed it, and recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li>This brush lathered up the soap better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>The top separated from the bottom.  </li>
            <li>I will be repairing it soon, however was under the impression that a better quality brush would not break in this manner.</li>
            <li>Really impressed with what you get with the low price of this badger brush.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this brush for 2 weeks now, and it keeps getting better....  </li>
            <li>Brush has short Stubby  Handle that is very attractive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for many years and have been through a number of brushes.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Just love this brush.</li>
            <li>it just doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Update July 2017.</li>
            <li>You may find that a 20 or 21mm suits you even better.  </li>
            <li>Read reviews on shaving sites like Badger&amp;Blade, The Shaving Den, and The Shaving Nook for more information.  </li>
            <li>and Id say most of the reasons I bought I got.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>The more I think about it...</li>
            <li>The faux Silvertip brush is even better after a month of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will see plenty of use.  </li>
            <li>i think mines more like 27 or 28 mm if you can find a better silver tip brush for this price buy it</li>
            <li>I could not ask for more in a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a Semouge 620 (20mm) boar that has bloomed perfectly, has great backbone, works with hard soaps or creams, is comfortable on my face, and cost $22.  </li>
            <li>As good as brushes that cost twice as much!</li>
            <li>Everyone says this is a good brush for the money, this is a good brush for big money.  </li>
            <li>I have used it 3 times and it seems great so far.</li>
            <li>You might think it&#x27;s too much for a shaving brush, but believe me, I had one that costs ~$14 with good rating in Amazon,</li>
            <li>This is a great quality brush and was able to get the job done better that another even higher quality brush that I own, however it broke way to easily when I finally accidentally dropped it.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderfully made, elegant, and is used everyday.  </li>
            <li>FS silvertip still going strong.</li>
            <li>Love the rich lather, although it does take a bit more coaxing to get the shaving soap to a full rich lather.</li>
            <li>Good luck in your search for a new brush.</li>
            <li>His was fine upon delivery</li>
            <li>Kent makes some good brushes but the super large is over $300 if I&#x27;m not mistaken.</li>
            <li>The brush is very full and creates a rich lather.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s huge, and densly packed and is silvertip hair.</li>
            <li>That is one huge chunk of badger hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much i bought another for my travel kit.</li>
            <li>Makes for a fabulous shaving experience</li>
            <li>I just enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li>Important to wash it well for 3 or 4 days to get the funk out.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I imagine it wont stay this cheap for long(60).  </li>
            <li>this doesn&#x27;t even fit the brush.</li>
            <li>I just received this brush today and was excited to try it out, however; the smell off this thing is unbearable.</li>
            <li>This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used and for the money it is worth literally 2-3 times if not more.</li>
            <li>This brush is really good, especially considering it costs just $60.</li>
            <li>I through it away after 3 weeks of use, it was just not working good enough even for $14.</li>
            <li>The quality of the hair is very good and stiff, over time the stiffness will condition to perfection if treated with respect.</li>
            <li>I find it a little large for face lathering, but perfect for bowl or scuttle lathering.</li>
            <li>Definitely a super full brush.  </li>
            <li>Makers like Vulfix, Edwin Jaeger, Whipped Dog, The Golden Nib and many other name brands have better brushes in the $50-$80 range, maybe not a silvertip, maybe finest badger, but it would definitely be a better performing brush--a brush you could use for a lifetime.  </li>
            <li>This brush is similar to that in size and density but is also made better, and is better hair.</li>
            <li>Instead of buying a $200 medium-sized  super quality brush just buy 3 of these.</li>
            <li>Hope this helps someone wanting to purchase such an awesome brush for a third of the price.</li>
            <li>I used a cheap brush that came w/ a soap bowl for the first 18 months of using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li>(Wash and treat it first!)</li>
            <li>Well it has been a few months and the brush is as great as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li>Worth far more than the price.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t softer than my old brush, but holds a lot more water and builds lather like a champ.  </li>
            <li>This is a rare exception.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>You can swipe once in a TOBS, gives you three shaves worth with a ton to squeeze out at the end for whatever else</li>
            <li>Honestly you do not need any &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;, if there is better, nor is it likely your shave will be better than with any other brush.</li>
            <li>It is easy to build a good lather but the handle can be a bit slick at times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bristles are moderately stiff, and work up a great lather.  </li>
            <li>and I ordered this brush on my phone right after I walked out of their store.</li>
            <li>I started wet shaving 2 years ago and with this brush I enjoy my straight razor even more!</li>
            <li>Anyhow, this brush is very large, about 3&amp;#34; in diameter after unboxing....</li>
            <li>In the 35 years that I have shaved using a mug, soap and a Shaving Brush to make lather for my breard; I have never had a brush that loaded up and produced the thickest, slickest lather that I have ever shaved with until I used  this Super Large Silvertip Badger brush.  </li>
            <li>Its is by no means a super large brush</li>
            <li>So if you want a Brush well worth the cost  and want the best shave of your life I would encourage you to envest in this Brush, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li>B002RJC1HC Parker Safety Razor Handmade &amp;#34;Long Loft&amp;#34; 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand]]</li>
            <li>It holds a lot of lather, and has not reall shed very much.</li>
            <li>The logo did rub off within the first three shaves but who cares.</li>
            <li>If you start with this as your first brush you are way ahead of the learning curve.</li>
            <li>Great to keep at the office for late dinners or meetings.</li>
            <li>The quality of the brush is what I noticed first.</li>
            <li>had to get used to shaking out more water because this brush is so big.  </li>
            <li>He hand-made the knots himself, so I felt as if I was supporting an artisan rather than underpaid labor.</li>
            <li>[I still have the first brush I bought 46 years ago], I went ahead and bought the silvertip badger quality.</li>
            <li>Finally decided to go to the top of the choices and settled on this Frank Shaving silvertip.</li>
            <li>This may be my first review</li>
            <li>This is my first brush, didn&#x27;t know what to expect...</li>
            <li>This is not my first badger hair shaving brush and bought this one after using my roommate&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>That one is worth every penny of your investment: very thick, very dense, looks nice, soft and most important</li>
            <li>you wanted to compare this to something, there is a large brush at Art of Shaving that has a black handle, very similar except it is not silvertip, only best badger (I think they call it fine), and that brush was I think $140 or so.</li>
            <li>The plastic stand that comes with it, went straight to the trash can, because the brush handle is far too fat to fit the stand.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to get a better shaving brush, especially wanted silvertip badger, and couldn&#x27;t find anything that was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very large dense head, mine had a slight chemical smell, so put some shampoo in a 4&amp;#34; bowl, wet the brush and worked up a very good lather.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;In fact this brush when properly loaded makes so much lather that my bowl is full of lather when I clean out my brush  </li>
            <li>However, before spending around $60 on a new brush when the old one was working fine, I also went online looking for &amp;#34;best shaving soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>As soon as I picked up the large one, I knew that was the size I wanted</li>
            <li>it being a large 26 millimeter brush</li>
            <li>This is a large brush and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I shave head as well as face, so I have a large area to cover with lather.</li>
            <li>.almost too large.</li>
            <li>It holds a large amount of water.</li>
            <li>I purchased this particular brush, which I love, but then I also went to their website and ordered a custom brush with a larger knot and a fan-shaped top for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li>Most other brushes at this price point will suck in comparison, remember I warned you ;-)</li>
            <li>The brush holds a lot of water and loads nicely with little effort.</li>
            <li>This brush is very well made too, has yet to shed 1 hair</li>
            <li>so much so, that I&#x27;m going to gift one to a friend of mine.  </li>
            <li>Very dense brush.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>Thought it had a bit of a very &amp;#34;old dog&amp;#34</li>
            <li>If I had it to do over I would add $10 to the price of this FS and buy a much nicer brush from Simpson like the Commodore or Colonel for $65.</li>
            <li>The included stand is also very useful for proper drying.</li>
            <li>strongly recommend to carefully wash it with hair shampoo before the first use.</li>
            <li>it only takes a minute to cover your face in rich lather.</li>
            <li>High quality, real Silvertip badger.</li>
            <li>My parker brush cost half the price of this one and it can produce much thicker lather and more of it in shorter time.  </li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to buy a brush this large, but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>Great Brush for about half the price of other silvertip brushes.  </li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband along with a new straight razor.</li>
            <li>It holds and and distributes water well and holds more than enough lather for a second pass.  </li>
            <li>On top of the aforementioned issues, the knot is much smaller than is depicted in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Horn Handle was of extremely high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for the price.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you for sure that he actually sat down at a workbench and put together each individual knot, but he seemed genuine, and he seemed to know the product very well.</li>
            <li>with this brush you get a little bit more.</li>
            <li>The Silvertip brush really is a step above the pure badger brush I had before from The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Considering the huge price difference between this silvertip and other name brands.</li>
            <li>Fantastic brush creates very thick creamy lather huge knot</li>
            <li>Note that after 5 or 6 uses the new brush smell disappeared</li>
            <li>Until I hear from FS and get some guidance on what type of glue I should use to do a permanent repair my new rating is 3 stars.</li>
            <li>Frank Shaving acknowledged my e-mail and will send me a new brush to take the place of the one that &amp;#34;fell out&amp;#34; of its handle.</li>
            <li>The pure thickness of an extra large shaving brush is 1000 times greater then a small brush.</li>
            <li>Hang it tips down in the included stand and get years of service with this fine</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft and have continued to soften with each use.</li>
            <li>A dark brown silt like sediment filled the bowl. .  </li>
            <li>Purchased for husband and son - first time shavers with double edge razors.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve rinsed the brush under a running hot tap for about ten minutes to no improvement in smell.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Grossly overpriced really.</li>
            <li>I was looking for some time to find a reasonably priced silver tip Badger brush like this to replace a low end bristle brush.</li>
            <li>I used Duro superglue to repair this problem and so far it&#x27;s holding</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised at the difference.  </li>
            <li>but what I care about is those soft bristles massaging the lather into my beard.</li>
            <li>Be aware that it is not super large at all.</li>
            <li>With the right soap, it will whip up enough lather to last through three passes.</li>
            <li>I have needed a new brush for a while and decided to get this due to the high quality and decent price.</li>
            <li>Obviously if you are using ANY other brush than a Silvertip Badger you are probably getting a far less luxurious and effective shave.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend THIS brush (not the smaller ones, trust me).</li>
            <li>I have tried a few soaps and creams and it generates lather so quickly you will be surprised.  </li>
            <li>Also, the stand that came with this brush is too small and the brush doesn&#x27;t fit in it.  </li>
            <li>I rinsed and re-lathered with fresh soap several times, and while the lather gradually lightened in color, it never got back to white and the smell persists.</li>
            <li>If you spend the extra money to buy a really quality soap and this brush you&#x27;ll actually look forward to shaving in the morning.</li>
            <li>I tried something to make it last forever, I drilled a small hole in the handle right into the knot and inserted a stainless screw.</li>
            <li>Buy one and the only thing I can suggest is lather it up a couple of times with a strong scented soap ( I used Stirling&#x27;s Sharp Dressed Man) which knocked out the wet dog scent for me.</li>
            <li>The last one I had for 15 years until my 8 year old granddaughter decided that it needed a haircut.lol.</li>
            <li>, the knot is somewhere in the 28mm range and barely squeezes into any of my brush holders.</li>
            <li>It is barely acceptable at building a lather with a cream and not acceptable at all with a soap.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this Frank Shave brush unless you are a fan of big brushes and use creams and even then it would be a soft recommendation.</li>
            <li>and it looks like I&#x27;ll be continuing to use it for the near future.</li>
            <li>Once broken in, the brush is visibly larger than the Parker, and has more density.</li>
            <li>I installed ahook on my shower wall and drilled a small hole in the handle to store this brush bristles down without pinching the hairs as most stands do.</li>
            <li>If you are new to wet shaving and buying your first badger brush I would suggest a brush in the 22-24mm size for a start--bigger is not necessarily better, it is a personal preference since it is harder to control a large brush</li>
            <li>I read some reviews that said the bristles became hard when my brushes do that I wash them with my shampoo and conditioner and it makes them as soft as the day I whipped up my first lather.</li>
            <li>The dense nap quickly provides a thick lather.  </li>
            <li>I then lathered it with my daily use shaving soap and it turned my normally pure white suds to a dark tan/grey color.</li>

            <li> Great brush.</li>
            <li> Works and feels great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for over a month now and it is great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great buy,</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a great buy on a badger Silvertip brush</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a great quality brush at a great price point.</li>
            <li> also gets a great lather going with shaving cream</li>
            <li> The price from the seller is great for a silvertip badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> and it should make a great long-term brush.</li>
            <li> Works well with this brush and keeps the lather very warm.</li>
            <li> Very nice. .</li>
            <li> I am glad that this is what I settled on, very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Feels out of this world, but CLEAN AND TREAT IT before using it on your face!!!  </li>
            <li> I did look at the art of shaving though to get an idea of what I wanted size wise.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good one.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush itself is extremely good.</li>
            <li> Good sized grip for me.</li>
            <li> Good investment.  </li>
            <li> loved it, holds water well</li>
            <li> I also received the huge 30mm one too and it is incredible as well.</li>
            <li> Very good product, price is sweet.</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li> I was at that point looking at pure and best badger brushes when I came across this brush.</li>
            <li> It has a large fan surface with a perfect cut.  </li>
            <li> But if you squish the tip this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> If you were thinking about it, I&#x27;m here to tell you mine is amazing.</li>
            <li> In summary I still use both brushes, but probably am using this one a bit more good product/value</li>
            <li> Washed it out with dish soap and warm water 2-3 times followed with  hair shampoo and a over-night soak in conditioner</li>
            <li> but my own backyard.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush</li>
            <li> Great lather and full apply when used.  </li>
            <li> It does look nice and the handle is fine, but performance wise</li>
            <li> Very fine.</li>
            <li> In general, the best, most sought-after brushes are made from badger hair.</li>
            <li> many years.</li>
            <li> I did lots of research and read many reviews about brushes but in the end I purchased my brush based on price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve enjoyed it, and recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush lathered up the soap better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> The top separated from the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I will be repairing it soon, however was under the impression that a better quality brush would not break in this manner.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with what you get with the low price of this badger brush.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this brush for 2 weeks now, and it keeps getting better....  </li>
            <li> Brush has short Stubby  Handle that is very attractive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for many years and have been through a number of brushes.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> Just love this brush.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Update July 2017.</li>
            <li> You may find that a 20 or 21mm suits you even better.  </li>
            <li> Read reviews on shaving sites like Badger&amp;Blade, The Shaving Den, and The Shaving Nook for more information.  </li>
            <li> and Id say most of the reasons I bought I got.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> The more I think about it...</li>
            <li> The faux Silvertip brush is even better after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will see plenty of use.  </li>
            <li> i think mines more like 27 or 28 mm if you can find a better silver tip brush for this price buy it</li>
            <li> I could not ask for more in a shaving brush.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a Semouge 620 (20mm) boar that has bloomed perfectly, has great backbone, works with hard soaps or creams, is comfortable on my face, and cost $22.  </li>
            <li> As good as brushes that cost twice as much!</li>
            <li> Everyone says this is a good brush for the money, this is a good brush for big money.  </li>
            <li> I have used it 3 times and it seems great so far.</li>
            <li> You might think it&#x27;s too much for a shaving brush, but believe me, I had one that costs ~$14 with good rating in Amazon,</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush and was able to get the job done better that another even higher quality brush that I own, however it broke way to easily when I finally accidentally dropped it.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderfully made, elegant, and is used everyday.  </li>
            <li> FS silvertip still going strong.</li>
            <li> Love the rich lather, although it does take a bit more coaxing to get the shaving soap to a full rich lather.</li>
            <li> Good luck in your search for a new brush.</li>
            <li> His was fine upon delivery</li>
            <li> Kent makes some good brushes but the super large is over $300 if I&#x27;m not mistaken.</li>
            <li> The brush is very full and creates a rich lather.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s huge, and densly packed and is silvertip hair.</li>
            <li> That is one huge chunk of badger hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much i bought another for my travel kit.</li>
            <li> Makes for a fabulous shaving experience</li>
            <li> I just enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li> Important to wash it well for 3 or 4 days to get the funk out.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> I imagine it wont stay this cheap for long(60).  </li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t even fit the brush.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush today and was excited to try it out, however; the smell off this thing is unbearable.</li>
            <li> This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used and for the money it is worth literally 2-3 times if not more.</li>
            <li> This brush is really good, especially considering it costs just $60.</li>
            <li> I through it away after 3 weeks of use, it was just not working good enough even for $14.</li>
            <li> The quality of the hair is very good and stiff, over time the stiffness will condition to perfection if treated with respect.</li>
            <li> I find it a little large for face lathering, but perfect for bowl or scuttle lathering.</li>
            <li> Definitely a super full brush.  </li>
            <li> Makers like Vulfix, Edwin Jaeger, Whipped Dog, The Golden Nib and many other name brands have better brushes in the $50-$80 range, maybe not a silvertip, maybe finest badger, but it would definitely be a better performing brush--a brush you could use for a lifetime.  </li>
            <li> This brush is similar to that in size and density but is also made better, and is better hair.</li>
            <li> Instead of buying a $200 medium-sized  super quality brush just buy 3 of these.</li>
            <li> Hope this helps someone wanting to purchase such an awesome brush for a third of the price.</li>
            <li> I used a cheap brush that came w/ a soap bowl for the first 18 months of using a safety razor.  </li>
            <li> (Wash and treat it first!)</li>
            <li> Well it has been a few months and the brush is as great as the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> Worth far more than the price.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t softer than my old brush, but holds a lot more water and builds lather like a champ.  </li>
            <li> This is a rare exception.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> You can swipe once in a TOBS, gives you three shaves worth with a ton to squeeze out at the end for whatever else</li>
            <li> Honestly you do not need any &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;, if there is better, nor is it likely your shave will be better than with any other brush.</li>
            <li> It is easy to build a good lather but the handle can be a bit slick at times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles are moderately stiff, and work up a great lather.  </li>
            <li> and I ordered this brush on my phone right after I walked out of their store.</li>
            <li> I started wet shaving 2 years ago and with this brush I enjoy my straight razor even more!</li>
            <li> Anyhow, this brush is very large, about 3&amp;#34; in diameter after unboxing....</li>
            <li> In the 35 years that I have shaved using a mug, soap and a Shaving Brush to make lather for my breard; I have never had a brush that loaded up and produced the thickest, slickest lather that I have ever shaved with until I used  this Super Large Silvertip Badger brush.  </li>
            <li> Its is by no means a super large brush</li>
            <li> So if you want a Brush well worth the cost  and want the best shave of your life I would encourage you to envest in this Brush, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> B002RJC1HC Parker Safety Razor Handmade &amp;#34;Long Loft&amp;#34; 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand]]</li>
            <li> It holds a lot of lather, and has not reall shed very much.</li>
            <li> The logo did rub off within the first three shaves but who cares.</li>
            <li> If you start with this as your first brush you are way ahead of the learning curve.</li>
            <li> Great to keep at the office for late dinners or meetings.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is what I noticed first.</li>
            <li> had to get used to shaking out more water because this brush is so big.  </li>
            <li> He hand-made the knots himself, so I felt as if I was supporting an artisan rather than underpaid labor.</li>
            <li> [I still have the first brush I bought 46 years ago], I went ahead and bought the silvertip badger quality.</li>
            <li> Finally decided to go to the top of the choices and settled on this Frank Shaving silvertip.</li>
            <li> This may be my first review</li>
            <li> This is my first brush, didn&#x27;t know what to expect...</li>
            <li> This is not my first badger hair shaving brush and bought this one after using my roommate&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> That one is worth every penny of your investment: very thick, very dense, looks nice, soft and most important</li>
            <li> you wanted to compare this to something, there is a large brush at Art of Shaving that has a black handle, very similar except it is not silvertip, only best badger (I think they call it fine), and that brush was I think $140 or so.</li>
            <li> The plastic stand that comes with it, went straight to the trash can, because the brush handle is far too fat to fit the stand.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to get a better shaving brush, especially wanted silvertip badger, and couldn&#x27;t find anything that was reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very large dense head, mine had a slight chemical smell, so put some shampoo in a 4&amp;#34; bowl, wet the brush and worked up a very good lather.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;In fact this brush when properly loaded makes so much lather that my bowl is full of lather when I clean out my brush  </li>
            <li> However, before spending around $60 on a new brush when the old one was working fine, I also went online looking for &amp;#34;best shaving soap&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> As soon as I picked up the large one, I knew that was the size I wanted</li>
            <li> it being a large 26 millimeter brush</li>
            <li> This is a large brush and just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I shave head as well as face, so I have a large area to cover with lather.</li>
            <li> .almost too large.</li>
            <li> It holds a large amount of water.</li>
            <li> I purchased this particular brush, which I love, but then I also went to their website and ordered a custom brush with a larger knot and a fan-shaped top for nearly the same price.</li>
            <li> Most other brushes at this price point will suck in comparison, remember I warned you ;-)</li>
            <li> The brush holds a lot of water and loads nicely with little effort.</li>
            <li> This brush is very well made too, has yet to shed 1 hair</li>
            <li> so much so, that I&#x27;m going to gift one to a friend of mine.  </li>
            <li> Very dense brush.</li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> Thought it had a bit of a very &amp;#34;old dog&amp;#34</li>
            <li> If I had it to do over I would add $10 to the price of this FS and buy a much nicer brush from Simpson like the Commodore or Colonel for $65.</li>
            <li> The included stand is also very useful for proper drying.</li>
            <li> strongly recommend to carefully wash it with hair shampoo before the first use.</li>
            <li> it only takes a minute to cover your face in rich lather.</li>
            <li> High quality, real Silvertip badger.</li>
            <li> My parker brush cost half the price of this one and it can produce much thicker lather and more of it in shorter time.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy a brush this large, but I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> Great Brush for about half the price of other silvertip brushes.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband along with a new straight razor.</li>
            <li> It holds and and distributes water well and holds more than enough lather for a second pass.  </li>
            <li> On top of the aforementioned issues, the knot is much smaller than is depicted in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Horn Handle was of extremely high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for the price.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you for sure that he actually sat down at a workbench and put together each individual knot, but he seemed genuine, and he seemed to know the product very well.</li>
            <li> with this brush you get a little bit more.</li>
            <li> The Silvertip brush really is a step above the pure badger brush I had before from The Art of Shaving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Considering the huge price difference between this silvertip and other name brands.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush creates very thick creamy lather huge knot</li>
            <li> Note that after 5 or 6 uses the new brush smell disappeared</li>
            <li> Until I hear from FS and get some guidance on what type of glue I should use to do a permanent repair my new rating is 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Frank Shaving acknowledged my e-mail and will send me a new brush to take the place of the one that &amp;#34;fell out&amp;#34; of its handle.</li>
            <li> The pure thickness of an extra large shaving brush is 1000 times greater then a small brush.</li>
            <li> Hang it tips down in the included stand and get years of service with this fine</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft and have continued to soften with each use.</li>
            <li> A dark brown silt like sediment filled the bowl. .  </li>
            <li> Purchased for husband and son - first time shavers with double edge razors.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve rinsed the brush under a running hot tap for about ten minutes to no improvement in smell.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Grossly overpriced really.</li>
            <li> I was looking for some time to find a reasonably priced silver tip Badger brush like this to replace a low end bristle brush.</li>
            <li> I used Duro superglue to repair this problem and so far it&#x27;s holding</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised at the difference.  </li>
            <li> but what I care about is those soft bristles massaging the lather into my beard.</li>
            <li> Be aware that it is not super large at all.</li>
            <li> With the right soap, it will whip up enough lather to last through three passes.</li>
            <li> I have needed a new brush for a while and decided to get this due to the high quality and decent price.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you are using ANY other brush than a Silvertip Badger you are probably getting a far less luxurious and effective shave.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend THIS brush (not the smaller ones, trust me).</li>
            <li> I have tried a few soaps and creams and it generates lather so quickly you will be surprised.  </li>
            <li> Also, the stand that came with this brush is too small and the brush doesn&#x27;t fit in it.  </li>
            <li> I rinsed and re-lathered with fresh soap several times, and while the lather gradually lightened in color, it never got back to white and the smell persists.</li>
            <li> If you spend the extra money to buy a really quality soap and this brush you&#x27;ll actually look forward to shaving in the morning.</li>
            <li> I tried something to make it last forever, I drilled a small hole in the handle right into the knot and inserted a stainless screw.</li>
            <li> Buy one and the only thing I can suggest is lather it up a couple of times with a strong scented soap ( I used Stirling&#x27;s Sharp Dressed Man) which knocked out the wet dog scent for me.</li>
            <li> The last one I had for 15 years until my 8 year old granddaughter decided that it needed a haircut.lol.</li>
            <li> , the knot is somewhere in the 28mm range and barely squeezes into any of my brush holders.</li>
            <li> It is barely acceptable at building a lather with a cream and not acceptable at all with a soap.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this Frank Shave brush unless you are a fan of big brushes and use creams and even then it would be a soft recommendation.</li>
            <li> and it looks like I&#x27;ll be continuing to use it for the near future.</li>
            <li> Once broken in, the brush is visibly larger than the Parker, and has more density.</li>
            <li> I installed ahook on my shower wall and drilled a small hole in the handle to store this brush bristles down without pinching the hairs as most stands do.</li>
            <li> If you are new to wet shaving and buying your first badger brush I would suggest a brush in the 22-24mm size for a start--bigger is not necessarily better, it is a personal preference since it is harder to control a large brush</li>
            <li> I read some reviews that said the bristles became hard when my brushes do that I wash them with my shampoo and conditioner and it makes them as soft as the day I whipped up my first lather.</li>
            <li> The dense nap quickly provides a thick lather.  </li>
            <li> I then lathered it with my daily use shaving soap and it turned my normally pure white suds to a dark tan/grey color.</li>
            <li> but I like a brush a little less full</li>
            <li> It lathers faster than any of the other brushes I have and it feels as soft as my most expensive brush.    </li>
            <li> and I thought if it&#x27;s not as soft as my other brushes, I&#x27;ll just return it.</li>
            <li> and I have no idea how long the brush will last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost convinced that this was made from a piece of roadkill left too long in the sun.</li>
            <li> will be buying Frank Shaving brushes for as long as they make them now, although I fully expect this brush to last a very long time....</li>
            <li> the only draw back and the reason it did not get 5 stars is because it is a little big</li>
            <li> The hairs on this brush are not soft at all, but they work well.</li>
            <li> Brush was soft before washing, will see how it holds up after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Between hanging it face down from the wall instead of pinching the hairs in a too small &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34; and having the knot secured with a stainless screw</li>
            <li> but it is not a high quality silver tip.  </li>
            <li> The tips are definitely not nearly as soft as the Parker, to the point where I thought I must have not washed the product properly and dried product was causing the issue.</li>
            <li> Curiously, the brush still had the peculiar animal smell common to all new badger brushes.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, I was enjoying the brush but don&#x27;t trust it to stay together.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My problem was that after only a few months, the brush part fell out of the handle.</li>
            <li> I have glued it a few times with different kinds of glue, and it keeps falling out.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re into wet shaving, look into the Georgetown Pottery 20 oz.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I was curious.</li>
            <li> This is a mans brush, thick, soft, and stout.</li>

            <li> Great brush. Works and feels great. My problem was that after only a few months, the brush part fell out of the handle. I have glued it a few times with different kinds of glue, and it keeps falling out. For the price, it should have lasted longer.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get a better shaving brush, especially wanted silvertip badger, and couldn&#x27;t find anything that was reasonably priced. I was at that point looking at pure and best badger brushes when I came across this brush. I researched brushes for about a week before ordering this one. I am glad that this is what I settled on, very happy with this purchase. Do not let the lower price sway you from purchasing this or one of their other brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For what this brush is priced at, it&#x27;s a very good bargain. It&#x27;s huge, and densly packed and is silvertip hair. This brush is very well made too, has yet to shed 1 hair and I have used it 5 times already. I was a little hesitant to buy a brush this large, but I am glad I did. I was also looking at their smaller version of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you wanted to compare this to something, there is a large brush at Art of Shaving that has a black handle, very similar except it is not silvertip, only best badger (I think they call it fine), and that brush was I think $140 or so. Grossly overpriced really. This brush is similar to that in size and density but is also made better, and is better hair. I did look at the art of shaving though to get an idea of what I wanted size wise. The one I am referring to is not listed on their web page. As soon as I picked up the large one, I knew that was the size I wanted and I ordered this brush on my phone right after I walked out of their store. It&#x27;s too bad their prices are so high, b/c I would have purchased their brush if it wasn&#x27;t so grossly over priced since I got to look at it in person.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying Frank Shaving brushes for as long as they make them now, although I fully expect this brush to last a very long time....many years. I just hope that they are still in business when I need another!</li>
            <li> I did lots of research and read many reviews about brushes but in the end I purchased my brush based on price. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much, however when I received my FS brush I was happily shocked. Everyone says this is a good brush for the money, this is a good brush for big money.  The logo did rub off within the first three shaves but who cares. Do yourself a favor and pick one of these brushes up before they double the price!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was looking for some time to find a reasonably priced silver tip Badger brush like this to replace a low end bristle brush. I&#x27;ve had mine for over a month now and it is great. It is easy to build a good lather but the handle can be a bit slick at times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it so much i bought another for my travel kit. I am a road warrior and figured I would pamper myself while traveling as well.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a much larger item based on the description of being &amp;#34;Super Large&amp;#34;. It is no bigger than the comparably priced Parker I am already using.  UPDATE - I am going to change my review from 3 to 4 stars.. Once broken in, the brush is visibly larger than the Parker, and has more density. It holds a massive amount of water. The tips are definitely not nearly as soft as the Parker, to the point where I thought I must have not washed the product properly and dried product was causing the issue. Definitely an edge to the Parker there.  In summary I still use both brushes, but probably am using this one a bit more good product/value</li>
            <li> ...Great Brush for about half the price of other silvertip brushes.  Yeah yeah, it&#x27;s from China, but so is my iPad, and nobody complains about those.  Anyhow, this brush is very large, about 3&amp;#34; in diameter after unboxing....it&#x27;s a Beast, and smells like one as well.  I&#x27;ve been using mine regularly for over a month and the beastly odor is almost gone, but not entirely.  The plastic stand that comes with it, went straight to the trash can, because the brush handle is far too fat to fit the stand.  The bristles are moderately stiff, and work up a great lather.  I&#x27;ve had a few hairs shed, but nothing out of the ordinary for a shaving brush.  It&#x27;s a great buy, so much so, that I&#x27;m going to gift one to a friend of mine.  Cheers Frank Shaving!</li>
            <li> Luxurious shaving brush. Makes for a fabulous shaving experience</li>
            <li> Holy crow folks!!! You truly can&#x27;t beat this deal... Beautifully performing brush and letme tell you, IT IS HUGE!!! Whips up a luxurious lather in about 6 seconds! Truly blown away!!!! Broke it in with the usual dish soap/coconditioner method and the smell(which i personally dont mind) was gone!! Cant wait to shave with it today!</li>
            <li> This brush is a good one. It is perfect for face shaving with plenty of backbone to it. The hairs on this brush are not soft at all, but they work well. Very dense brush. I&#x27;ve enjoyed it, and recommend it for the price.</li>
            <li> That is one huge chunk of badger hair.  I have used it 3 times and it seems great so far. I will keep posting.   Well it has been a few months and the brush is as great as the day I bought it. This is no Simpson Chubby 2 but it is as close as you will ever get for this price. Do yourself a favor and add it to your collection. If you start with this as your first brush you are way ahead of the learning curve. Most other brushes at this price point will suck in comparison, remember I warned you ;-)</li>
            <li> Better than expected. Great to keep at the office for late dinners or meetings.</li>
            <li> big bristle brush.  works very well.</li>
            <li> This brush lathered up the soap better than any brush I&#x27;ve ever used.  It has a large fan surface with a perfect cut.  I just enjoy using this brush.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for and with this brush you get a little bit more.Wirh it being a large 26 millimeter brush it only takes a minute to cover your face in rich lather.If you&#x27;re looking for a great buy on a badger Silvertip brush this is it.The last one I had for 15 years until my 8 year old granddaughter decided that it needed a haircut.lol.</li>
            <li> The quality of the brush is what I noticed first. The Horn Handle was of extremely high quality. The quality of the brush itself is extremely good. The pure thickness of an extra large shaving brush is 1000 times greater then a small brush. Lathering the face is quicker, easier, and ultimately easier I believe on a larger brush. Obviously if you are using ANY other brush than a Silvertip Badger you are probably getting a far less luxurious and effective shave. The quality of the hair is very good and stiff, over time the stiffness will condition to perfection if treated with respect. This is the best brush I&#x27;ve ever used and for the money it is worth literally 2-3 times if not more. Kent makes some good brushes but the super large is over $300 if I&#x27;m not mistaken. Instead of buying a $200 medium-sized  super quality brush just buy 3 of these. Honestly you do not need any &amp;#34;better&amp;#34;, if there is better, nor is it likely your shave will be better than with any other brush. I highly recommend THIS brush (not the smaller ones, trust me). Worth far more than the price.</li>
            <li> I like this shaving brush the only draw back and the reason it did not get 5 stars is because it is a little big maybe it is just me but I like a brush a little less full</li>
            <li> Make no mistake about it. This is a large brush and just what I wanted. It takes a few weeks to break in and then it lathers extremely well. I find it a little large for face lathering, but perfect for bowl or scuttle lathering. If you&#x27;re into wet shaving, look into the Georgetown Pottery 20 oz. scuttle. Works well with this brush and keeps the lather very warm. With the right soap, it will whip up enough lather to last through three passes. Good sized grip for me. I&#x27;ve used this over three weeks now and it&#x27;s only shed one hair.</li>
            <li> I have used a shaving brush for the last 30 years.  This is the largest brush I have ever used.  Great lather and full apply when used.  I highly recommend it for the price.  I when to the mall retail store and almost passed out after hearing the price for a brush with half the hair.  Note that after 5 or 6 uses the new brush smell disappeared</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband along with a new straight razor. The bristles are very soft and have continued to soften with each use. The brush is very full and creates a rich lather. The handle is aesthetically pleasing. All in all, it&#x27;s a great quality brush at a great price point. The included stand is also very useful for proper drying.</li>
            <li> This is a great quality brush and was able to get the job done better that another even higher quality brush that I own, however it broke way to easily when I finally accidentally dropped it.  It is essentially just two pieces glued together with the hairs already attached to a separate base rather than the hairs being tightly packed into it directly.  The top separated from the bottom.  I will be repairing it soon, however was under the impression that a better quality brush would not break in this manner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 and have been using a cup and brush since I was a teen.  This brush is without a doubt, the best lathering, softest brush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It holds and and distributes water well and holds more than enough lather for a second pass.  It took about a week to break it in.  Important to wash it well for 3 or 4 days to get the funk out.&lt;br /&gt;Only hair loss was the first couple of times it was used and that was only a few hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This brush is really good, especially considering it costs just $60. You might think it&#x27;s too much for a shaving brush, but believe me, I had one that costs ~$14 with good rating in Amazon, I through it away after 3 weeks of use, it was just not working good enough even for $14. That one is worth every penny of your investment: very thick, very dense, looks nice, soft and most important it works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend to carefully wash it with hair shampoo before the first use.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with what you get with the low price of this badger brush. The Silvertip brush really is a step above the pure badger brush I had before from The Art of Shaving. Love the rich lather, although it does take a bit more coaxing to get the shaving soap to a full rich lather. Might not be the experience by everybody, but the stiff bristles on the pure badger brush seems to dig into the soap harder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be using this hopefully for years to come. I bought one for my brother as well.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this brush for 2 weeks now, and it keeps getting better....  It holds a ton of water so you have to shake it out quite a bit to pick up soap.  then a baby dip with the tips into water and lather seems to explode onto your face.  it isn&#x27;t softer than my old brush, but holds a lot more water and builds lather like a champ.  had to get used to shaking out more water because this brush is so big.  I imagine it wont stay this cheap for long(60).  I hope it lasts forever!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product, price is sweet. Be aware that it is not super large at all. I would qualify it of &amp;#34;standard size&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Brush has short Stubby  Handle that is very attractive.  Knot is 26mm and the Brush stand is designed for a 23mm knot, so you need to get a Kent Stand  VSB6 or VSB2 to hold brush.  Very large dense head, mine had a slight chemical smell, so put some shampoo in a 4&amp;#34; bowl, wet the brush and worked up a very good lather.  No brush hairs came out.  I did it again and now drying brush in my VSB2.  Compare this brush to an Erwin Jagger brush for $130-140, same shape and size of head, but a shorter 3.5&amp;#34; total height.  Brush was soft before washing, will see how it holds up after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> In life, you usually get what you pay for. This is a rare exception. In general, the best, most sought-after brushes are made from badger hair. Almost all of the badger hair in the world comes from China. Even the famous (and expensive) British companies that make badger brushes get their badger hair from China. There are brushes (not on Amazon) that regularly sell for $300 and up. Frank Shaving is located in China, so it makes sense that they can obtain the stuff cheaper. Not to mention the lower labor costs. I purchased this particular brush, which I love, but then I also went to their website and ordered a custom brush with a larger knot and a fan-shaped top for nearly the same price. The gentleman I traded emails with actually knew the farmer who harvested the badger hair. (officially the world&#x27;s worst job) He hand-made the knots himself, so I felt as if I was supporting an artisan rather than underpaid labor. I can&#x27;t tell you for sure that he actually sat down at a workbench and put together each individual knot, but he seemed genuine, and he seemed to know the product very well.</li>
            <li> I shave head as well as face, so I have a large area to cover with lather. That&#x27;s why I bought the &amp;#34;super large.&amp;#34; And, since these things last forever if you take care of them [I still have the first brush I bought 46 years ago], I went ahead and bought the silvertip badger quality. The fake horn handle? Ehh. Plastic is plastic. But at least it won&#x27;t get nasty, as wood would. This is a reasonably-priced quality brush. I recommend it if you are serious about your shaving routine.</li>
            <li> This brush will NOT disappoint.  It is a bit fragrant to start, but that goes away after a few shaves.  I have tried a few soaps and creams and it generates lather so quickly you will be surprised.  Don&#x27;t hesitate if you are considering this brush.</li>
            <li> Husband says he can&#x27;t believe the difference in the lather this brush provides.......will order another when this wears out.</li>
            <li> Best brush I&#x27;ve ever owned. This is a mans brush, thick, soft, and stout. Hugh knot.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considering the huge price difference between this silvertip and other name brands. Would make a sceptic simply, wonder...</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful.  Feels out of this world, but CLEAN AND TREAT IT before using it on your face!!!  Thought it had a bit of a very &amp;#34;old dog&amp;#34; smell.  When I washed it, the water looked like the run off from a car wash!  A dark brown silt like sediment filled the bowl. .  Washed it out with dish soap and warm water 2-3 times followed with  hair shampoo and a over-night soak in conditioner and I now have one of the nicest shaving tools I&#x27;ve seen!  I LOVE IT!  Good investment.  (Wash and treat it first!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving in the shower for many years and have been through a number of brushes. Finally decided to go to the top of the choices and settled on this Frank Shaving silvertip. However, before spending around $60 on a new brush when the old one was working fine, I also went online looking for &amp;#34;best shaving soap&amp;#34;. If you spend the extra money to buy a really quality soap and this brush you&#x27;ll actually look forward to shaving in the morning. The brush holds a lot of water and loads nicely with little effort. When you finish lathering on your face, the silvertip density becomes noticable over the other grades of badger. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month, the odor was gone after about a week of use and I have no idea how long the brush will last. As tempting as it is to squeeze the lather off the brush, I try not to &amp;#34;test&amp;#34; the knot that way. Hang it tips down in the included stand and get years of service with this fine product.&lt;br /&gt;29 May 2014: Update on this brush. About three weeks ago the entire knot just fell out of the handle. I used Duro superglue to repair this problem and so far it&#x27;s holding okay. I also sent an e-mail to Frank Shaving customer service alerting them to this problem. As of today, I&#x27;ve not had a reply from them. Until I hear from FS and get some guidance on what type of glue I should use to do a permanent repair my new rating is 3 stars. Too bad, I was enjoying the brush but don&#x27;t trust it to stay together.&lt;br /&gt;11 June 2014 update. Frank Shaving acknowledged my e-mail and will send me a new brush to take the place of the one that &amp;#34;fell out&amp;#34; of its handle. When it was working correctly this was a very impressive brush and I assume the replacement will be the same.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 15 February 2015: Frank Shaving&#x27;s replacement brush has now been in service for about 7 months. It&#x27;s holding together well, no problems with knot/handle coming apart. A pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;Update December 2016 Just love this brush. I installed ahook on my shower wall and drilled a small hole in the handle to store this brush bristles down without pinching the hairs as most stands do. No hair fallout after two years. Used with the custom soap you can get online from Ann Arbor Michigan it just doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.&lt;br /&gt;Update July 2017. FS silvertip still going strong. I tried something to make it last forever, I drilled a small hole in the handle right into the knot and inserted a stainless screw. I&#x27;m confident now that violent shaking off water or aggressive lathering won&#x27;t have any negative effect on the brush. Between hanging it face down from the wall instead of pinching the hairs in a too small &amp;#34;holder&amp;#34; and having the knot secured with a stainless screw it just might last me forever (I hope).</li>
            <li> I used a cheap brush that came w/ a soap bowl for the first 18 months of using a safety razor.  Wish I knew earlier that there were different types of badger hair quality.  Just got this in, used it this morning and I was pleasantly surprised at the difference.  Well worth the cost.  The only issue I had is the stand that came w/ this doesn&#x27;t even fit the brush.</li>
            <li> Purchased for husband and son - first time shavers with double edge razors.  This brush exudes quality.  It is wonderfully made, elegant, and is used everyday.  Excellent product and purchase.</li>
            <li> You can pay over $ 300 for silver tip badger hair brushes.  This one has the quality without the price.  The lather is exquisite.  Very fine.</li>
            <li> I think that I got what I paid for--I just didn&#x27;t get a bargain. In all honesty I don&#x27;t care for the size. While it is not described by knot size and I have no way to measure it, the knot is somewhere in the 28mm range and barely squeezes into any of my brush holders. It does look nice and the handle is fine, but performance wise I find it to be a brush that doesn&#x27;t release the lather well. It is barely acceptable at building a lather with a cream and not acceptable at all with a soap.  It may be silver tip but it is not a high quality silver tip.  If I had it to do over I would add $10 to the price of this FS and buy a much nicer brush from Simpson like the Commodore or Colonel for $65. Makers like Vulfix, Edwin Jaeger, Whipped Dog, The Golden Nib and many other name brands have better brushes in the $50-$80 range, maybe not a silvertip, maybe finest badger, but it would definitely be a better performing brush--a brush you could use for a lifetime.  To tell the truth, I like my least expensive brush better than this one. It&#x27;s a Semouge 620 (20mm) boar that has bloomed perfectly, has great backbone, works with hard soaps or creams, is comfortable on my face, and cost $22.  I would not recommend this Frank Shave brush unless you are a fan of big brushes and use creams and even then it would be a soft recommendation. If you are new to wet shaving and buying your first badger brush I would suggest a brush in the 22-24mm size for a start--bigger is not necessarily better, it is a personal preference since it is harder to control a large brush and you end up with lather everywhere. Start with a medium size and see how you like it. You may find that a 20 or 21mm suits you even better.  Read reviews on shaving sites like Badger&amp;Blade, The Shaving Den, and The Shaving Nook for more information.  Good luck in your search for a new brush.</li>
            <li> In the 35 years that I have shaved using a mug, soap and a Shaving Brush to make lather for my breard; I have never had a brush that loaded up and produced the thickest, slickest lather that I have ever shaved with until I used  this Super Large Silvertip Badger brush.  The lather this brush produces in less than 30 second of loading it is so thick and slick you don&#x27;t have to worry about it drying out befor you finish shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact this brush when properly loaded makes so much lather that my bowl is full of lather when I clean out my brush  once I have finished shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am suprised that a brush like this is only $60.00. I don&#x27;t believe that one of the $300.00 Silver Badger Shaving Brush could out perform this brush.  So if you want a Brush well worth the cost  and want the best shave of your life I would encourage you to envest in this Brush, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am not impressed.  I did give it what I considered ample time for a break-in period.  After six weeks or so the bristles were still harsh and stiff.  Curiously, the brush still had the peculiar animal smell common to all new badger brushes.  This one didn&#x27;t seem to want to leave the odor behind.  In the past I&#x27;ve purchased my brushes from a one-man operation where personal skills and TLC went into every brush he produces.  I should not have looked anywhere else but my own backyard.  A learned lesson.</li>
            <li> Very nice. . .almost too large. It holds a lot of lather, and has not reall shed very much. As good as brushes that cost twice as much!</li>
            <li> This may be my first review and Id say most of the reasons I bought I got. Definitely a super full brush.  This is my first brush, didn&#x27;t know what to expect... But if you squish the tip this is amazing.  You can swipe once in a TOBS, gives you three shaves worth with a ton to squeeze out at the end for whatever else you missed</li>
            <li> loved it, holds water well and I like the weight also gets a great lather going with shaving cream yay!</li>
            <li> It works ok but I&#x27;m disappointed because, for the price, I expected much better performance.  My parker brush cost half the price of this one and it can produce much thicker lather and more of it in shorter time.  Also, the stand that came with this brush is too small and the brush doesn&#x27;t fit in it.  The more I think about it...I think I&#x27;m being generous with 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I just received this brush today and was excited to try it out, however; the smell off this thing is unbearable. This is not my first badger hair shaving brush and bought this one after using my roommate&#x27;s. His was fine upon delivery and I&#x27;ve used it without incident. I&#x27;ve rinsed the brush under a running hot tap for about ten minutes to no improvement in smell. I then lathered it with my daily use shaving soap and it turned my normally pure white suds to a dark tan/grey color. I&#x27;m almost convinced that this was made from a piece of roadkill left too long in the sun. I rinsed and re-lathered with fresh soap several times, and while the lather gradually lightened in color, it never got back to white and the smell persists. On top of the aforementioned issues, the knot is much smaller than is depicted in the pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the[[ASIN:B002RJC1HC Parker Safety Razor Handmade &amp;#34;Long Loft&amp;#34; 100% Pure Badger Shaving Brush with Black Deluxe Handle &amp; Free Stand]] daily since 2012 and it looks like I&#x27;ll be continuing to use it for the near future.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and I was curious. I thought I have paid over 250.00 for a silvertip badger brush with a 24 mm knot with a nickel plated handle and I thought if it&#x27;s not as soft as my other brushes, I&#x27;ll just return it. Wow! I&#x27;m not sending this one back. It holds a large amount of water. It lathers faster than any of the other brushes I have and it feels as soft as my most expensive brush.    Buy one and the only thing I can suggest is lather it up a couple of times with a strong scented soap ( I used Stirling&#x27;s Sharp Dressed Man) which knocked out the wet dog scent for me. I have ordered the 30mm brush now and I can&#x27;t wait to receive that one too. I will not buy another expensive brush again I know the handles aren&#x27;t horn, fancy wood or nickel but what I care about is those soft bristles massaging the lather into my beard. I started wet shaving 2 years ago and with this brush I enjoy my straight razor even more! If you were thinking about it, I&#x27;m here to tell you mine is amazing. Give it a try and if it&#x27;s not what you think send it back.      Update! The faux Silvertip brush is even better after a month of use. I also received the huge 30mm one too and it is incredible as well. I read some reviews that said the bristles became hard when my brushes do that I wash them with my shampoo and conditioner and it makes them as soft as the day I whipped up my first lather. Hope this helps someone wanting to purchase such an awesome brush for a third of the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice brush I&#x27;m sure it will see plenty of use.  Its is by no means a super large brush in fact it is no larger than the mid sized brush I was replacing it with.  The hairs in the brush have some long runners that stick out up to an inch and a half they can be trimmed up in seconds.  The smell isn&#x27;t to bad and should be gone within a couple of shaves.  I gave it three stars because the brush wasn&#x27;t larger then the one I had which is not a large brush.</li>
            <li> Fantastic brush creates very thick creamy lather huge knot i face lather with mine and its incrediable 60.00 dollers for this quality brush is hard to beleive i get 2 or 3 latherings with a almond size dollop i use proraso menthol in the green tub the soap and have a tube of the sandalwood cream i cant tell the differance between which ones the cream and which ones the soap it says 26mm knot i think mines more like 27 or 28 mm if you can find a better silver tip brush for this price buy it but i dont think you will. lather on</li>
            <li> I could not ask for more in a shaving brush.  The dense nap quickly provides a thick lather.  The price from the seller is great for a silvertip badger shaving brush.</li>
            <li> High quality, real Silvertip badger. I have needed a new brush for a while and decided to get this due to the high quality and decent price. After a few uses I can feel it breaking in well and it should make a great long-term brush.</li>
