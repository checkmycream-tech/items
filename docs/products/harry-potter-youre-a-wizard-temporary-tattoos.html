            <li>Bought them for my son, a huge Harry Potter fan.</li>

            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Once it&#x27;s on it looks so real and detailed.</li>
            <li>and we had fun with these tattoos.</li>
            <li>Useful for up coming Nebraska con.</li>
            <li>I just hope the product is worth it.</li>
            <li>This will be fun prop for our HP party.</li>
            <li>They are great and cost a lot less than a real tattoo!</li>
            <li>The tattoos are perfect - no, they are not huge but they&#x27;re not supposed to take your entire arm.</li>
            <li>Product as advertised, super fast delivery</li>
            <li>It looked very real.</li>
            <li>and I bought 5 more after for future events!</li>
            <li>but I preferred it smaller and if used on a child&#x27;s arm it will look more to scale.</li>
            <li>so I can use this costume again for Comic Con, etc.</li>
            <li>Almost inspired him to get a real tattoo!</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I used these for Comic Con in San Diego with my sister.  </li>
            <li>They do look exactly like the picture.</li>
            <li>I ordered these first before I ordered a large one on etsy for $4</li>
            <li>The tattoo is large enough to see the details and has clear edges, really nice tattoo.</li>
            <li>Very easy to put on, stayed perfect for a few days, even with regular scrubbing (I only needed it to last 12 hours).  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;issue,&amp;#34; however, is very minor and in the end you will be satisfied with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li>Very clever idea.</li>
            <li>They lasted for about a week ...looked real.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Everyone asked if it was a real tattoo.</li>
            <li>These are high quality temporary tattoos!</li>
            <li>I loved them so much I would put them on for random special occasions</li>
            <li>This is such a cool tattoo for any fan of Harry Potter.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to anyone who needs a Death Eater tattoo.</li>
            <li>Small then expected but there great haven&#x27;t put them on yet</li>
            <li>Very good for the price, only gave four stars as there was a bit of inconsistency with the sizing, and they don&#x27;t last quite as long as other temporary tattoos.</li>
            <li>So, that tattoo looked great, but compared to the large ones in the movies, it was a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li>It stayed on for 5 days (even though I tried to scrub it off in the shower) and looked like new on day 5.  </li>
            <li>My initial reaction was that they would be too small, but once they were on, I really liked the size.</li>
            <li>Started to fade after that...but wouldn&#x27;t expect them to last longer or really want them to.</li>
            <li>I was Bellatrix Lestrange for Halloween and ordered these tattoos to complete my costume.</li>
            <li>I am 23 years old, 5&#x27;2, 115 lbs, and petite.</li>
            <li>If you are only a Harry Potter movie fan, you may not like them as much as those who have read the books.</li>
            <li>The tattoo itself is less than 2 full inches.</li>
            <li>Some of the workers played a long as if we were really death eaters.</li>
            <li>Last a long time and healthier than a real tattoo!</li>
            <li>People are saying it&#x27;s small, but as an adult needing a costume addition, I thought it was just the right size.  </li>
            <li>It looks very realistic, not like a typical temporary tattoo.</li>
            <li>I am very petite yet the tattoo covered less of my arm than shown in the photo.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to other Death Eaters!</li>

            <li> They really last a long time!</li>
            <li> bigger than expected, applied well onto the skin.</li>
            <li> It also stayed on my skin for longer that I expected it to and had to remove it with rubbing alcohol.</li>

            <li> I was worried from some of the other reviews about the size</li>

            <li> They do not stay on for as long as they say, but they stay on for at least 3 days depending on how rough you are on it.</li>
            <li> but I kept mine for a few days unscathed.</li>
            <li> I finally went out and bought baby oil to take it off and still had to do some serious scrubbing!  </li>

            <li> People are saying it&#x27;s small, but as an adult needing a costume addition, I thought it was just the right size.  Lasted all day and night, easy to apply, arrived on time with Prime.  :)</li>
            <li> This is such a cool tattoo for any fan of Harry Potter. Once it&#x27;s on it looks so real and detailed. It only last a day before it started flaking off.</li>
            <li> My students loved these!</li>
            <li> These temporary tattoos are great. They go on super easily and I got many complements from friends about how real it looked. It also stayed on my skin for longer that I expected it to and had to remove it with rubbing alcohol.</li>
            <li> I would have given them 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that they are so small. I am very petite yet the tattoo covered less of my arm than shown in the photo. So, that tattoo looked great, but compared to the large ones in the movies, it was a bit disappointing. I wish they would make a larger version of these, even if it meant raising the price.</li>
            <li> Used these for a Harry Potter (tween) birthday party.  The kids loved these.  Easy to apply and eerily authentic.  Great value for these and a great novelty for the kids.  They lasted for about a week ...looked real. Started to fade after that...but wouldn&#x27;t expect them to last longer or really want them to.</li>
            <li> These tattoos look amazing!! They stay on beautifully. Some of them came off with some vigorous rubbing after 48hrs others have been more stubborn.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for a Harry Potter themed party. I was Bellatrix Lestrange, and my husband was a death eater. The tattoos are perfect - no, they are not huge but they&#x27;re not supposed to take your entire arm. They took a good amount of my forearm and we both felt happy with these tattoos! It looked very real. His started peeling the next day but I kept mine for a few days unscathed. Love this product.</li>
            <li> Son LOVED being a &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; Death Eater with an authentic Dark Mark. Very clever idea. Lasted quite a while too.</li>
            <li> These things are pretty close to perfect! They are, as I read in the reviews, a tad bit smaller than one would like. This &amp;#34;issue,&amp;#34; however, is very minor and in the end you will be satisfied with the quality of the product. I bought 5 of these for two Harry Potter events and Halloween and I bought 5 more after for future events!</li>
            <li> Stay pretty long, easy to apply to your skin, looks cool :D</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted to be Bellatrix Lestrange for Halloween so I bought these tattoos. We used one on Halloween and I finally had to use baby oil to remove it a week later. They really last a long time! Nice size, too. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> These were perfect. I was concerned about the quality of temp tattoos from seller I&#x27;d not used before. These were great.&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for costume.</li>
            <li> bigger than expected, applied well onto the skin.</li>
            <li> Yes yes yes. I&#x27;m nerding out. Lasted a day or two on my arm! Don&#x27;t judge my coolness.</li>
            <li> Loved this item but smaller than I anticpated. Fast delivery. Comes in a regular envelope.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t catch that the photo provided is a very small child&#x27;s arm.  The tattoo itself is less than 2 full inches.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect addition to my Halloween costume.  It stayed on for 5 days (even though I tried to scrub it off in the shower) and looked like new on day 5.  I finally went out and bought baby oil to take it off and still had to do some serious scrubbing!  It is smaller than the actual &amp;#34;dark mark&amp;#34; in the movies but I preferred it smaller and if used on a child&#x27;s arm it will look more to scale.</li>
            <li> These work great and look great. Loved them!</li>
            <li> These tattoos were great, easy to use, lasted and looked authentic too!!!&lt;br /&gt;Were perfect for our wizard gone bad costume!!!</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on, stayed perfect for a few days, even with regular scrubbing (I only needed it to last 12 hours).  Good quality.  Last remnants lasted over a week.</li>
            <li> My daughter wore these with her Harry Potter Slytherin clothes to Universal studios and they were perfect. She got so many comments from characters &amp;#34;Nothing to see here, no reason to tell the Ministry&amp;#34; from Stan Shunpike, etc.</li>
            <li> My friends and I are admittedly in the 25yo + age group, but we recently had a HP birthday party and we had fun with these tattoos. Went on as easily as any temporary tattoos I&#x27;ve used and lasted 1-2 days.  If you are going for details, these are a great and fun addition!</li>
            <li> Good quality temporary tatoo that lasted a long time</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Bellatrix Lestrange costume. Went on easily and stayed on. It looks very realistic, not like a typical temporary tattoo. The size is right on, and the best part is there are 5 of them so I can use this costume again for Comic Con, etc. Love it.</li>
            <li> Lasts about a week even with a daily shower and has fantastic detail - maybe even better detail than what you see in the movies! Had no irritation redness.&lt;br /&gt;Any Harry Potter fan will love this.</li>
            <li> My son and his friends loved these. Almost inspired him to get a real tattoo! Me too!</li>
            <li> It went on easy, and looked great. It doesn&#x27;t flake off or look fake. My initial reaction was that they would be too small, but once they were on, I really liked the size.</li>
            <li> Not as detailed as the ones used in the movies.</li>
            <li> The tattoo is large enough to see the details and has clear edges, really nice tattoo.</li>
            <li> These work great. I bought them for my trip to Orlando Harry Potter World and it was a hoot. Some of the workers played a long as if we were really death eaters. Hilarious. And it&#x27;s way cheaper to buy it here than it is to buy temporary tats at universal.</li>
            <li> Good size and looked great</li>
            <li> Useful for up coming Nebraska con.</li>
            <li> I was Bellatrix Lestrange for Halloween and ordered these tattoos to complete my costume. They were perfect. The order arrived quickly, was easy to apply, stayed on well (I had to scrub for a few days in the shower to get it all off) and the seller provided several tattoos so I have some for the next time I decide to wear the costume again. It wasn&#x27;t too small at all and everyone complimented me on the detail of it. Highly recommended to anyone who needs a Death Eater tattoo.</li>
            <li> Good toy/gag gift for any Harry Potter lover</li>
            <li> I received only 3pcs instead of 5!</li>
            <li> They are awesome. ...going to Diagon Alley Orlando this weekend and they are Perfect!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got these to wear at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal, Orlando, FL. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I got a pack of these for my nephew who is a Harry Potter fanatic. Anyone else would have thought it was a regular goth tattoo. But my nephew loved it! He even asked me to buy more. There were 5 in the pack as stated and they looked just like in the picture.</li>
            <li> Going to Universal..can&#x27;t wait to put on</li>
            <li> It said it would arrive by February 7th at the latest. It&#x27;s march 6th and it&#x27;s still not here. I just hope the product is worth it.</li>
            <li> These work very well and stay on a long time, great value for the price and goes well with Halloween costumes</li>
            <li> This will be fun prop for our HP party.</li>
            <li> I was worried from some of the other reviews about the size but they are PERFECT for adults. To anyone else thinking about purchasing these, don&#x27;t hesitate. They are great and cost a lot less than a real tattoo! LOL</li>
            <li> Used these over the summer for a theme at the camp I work at. We had a Harry Potter theme, and I was on Slytherin. These tattoos made were perfect</li>
            <li> I ordered these for a Harry Potter picnic.  The tattoo is very easy to apply and the design has crisp lines.  The ink is extremely durable even after getting my arm wet.  I would definitely get these again.</li>
            <li> Worked out great for Harry Potter trivia night! Easy to apply and stayed on great.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and they look great too! Everyone asked if it was a real tattoo. A must have for every Slytherin and Death Eater out there!</li>
            <li> I went as Bellatrix Lestrange for Halloween this year, and the costume just wasn&#x27;t complete without the Dark Mark. These are high quality temporary tattoos!</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I bought these to use for Halloween, which isn&#x27;t here yet.. but they look awesome and I can&#x27;t wait to use them!!</li>
            <li> was perfect for my halloween costume. I loved them so much I would put them on for random special occasions</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, and speedy delivery!  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Product as advertised, super fast delivery</li>
            <li> Tattoo is actually not that small on my arm. I am 23 years old, 5&#x27;2, 115 lbs, and petite. Good thing I ordered these first before I ordered a large one on etsy for $4 and I would have only gotten one as opposed to five. It has lasted a couple days and gotten compliments while at my universal studios trip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping and handling was perfect. Arrived on time with no defects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase again and recommend these!</li>
            <li> Looks great, easy to use</li>
            <li> Bought them for my son, a huge Harry Potter fan. They are perfect. Last a long time and healthier than a real tattoo!</li>
            <li> Perfect for our Harry Potter themed Halloween party. Who knew there were so many Death Eaters on the invite list? These gave a disproportionate amount of delight to our guests for the price.</li>
            <li> i have small arms and these looked great and fit perfectly</li>
            <li> I used these for Comic Con in San Diego with my sister.  They were easy to use and looked very real and many people said that too.  :)</li>
            <li> I bought these for a friend who&#x27;s a HP fan. These will be great for her fandom and they seem like they&#x27;ll last a while when they&#x27;re on.</li>
            <li> Tattoo is a bit smaller than I would like, but very nice. I got these as a precursor to an actual tat just to acclimate myself and see if I could stand having something on my arm for that long. Wears of quickly, but looks great before it does. Make your mom panic, buy it!</li>
            <li> Very good for the price, only gave four stars as there was a bit of inconsistency with the sizing, and they don&#x27;t last quite as long as other temporary tattoos.</li>
            <li> Worked great for the Harry Potter themed birthday party I attended. They stayed on all night, and my friend (Bellatrix) won the costume contest!</li>
            <li> Awesome! Better than the picture!</li>
            <li> I absolutely, 100% LOVE these! I wear them just because. So cool. Highly recommend to other Death Eaters!</li>
            <li> The tattoos were awesome! I bought these for a Halloween costume and they were a perfect addition to it. They do not stay on for as long as they say, but they stay on for at least 3 days depending on how rough you are on it. Everyone at school loved it. I do recommend buying these and I would buy them again. Note: They do look exactly like the picture. If you are only a Harry Potter movie fan, you may not like them as much as those who have read the books. (these are more based off the books.)</li>
            <li> Small then expected but there great haven&#x27;t put them on yet but they look great.</li>
            <li> My son loves being one of the death eatters...</li>
            <li> I ordered these to go to the Wizarding World in Orlando with a friend. They looked great and held very well.</li>
            <li> My family wore these to Harry Potter at Universal. It was fun!</li>
