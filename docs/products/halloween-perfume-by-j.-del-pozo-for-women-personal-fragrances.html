            <li>i would say this perfume is ok in that way.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s a great scent but also because it is a rare and original perfume.</li>

            <li>excellent product quality, responsible vendors recommend them thank you very much</li>
            <li>good stuff have been wearing this very one for many many many many years</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this because the reviews were so great.</li>
            <li>I have ordered this for my wife several times, great smelling stuff, and take it from a guy, this stuff is sexy on a woman!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell good at first spray, or after it has sat awhile.  </li>
            <li>I just love it to pieces, it has a light spirited water-y floral feel that is not too strong or cloying.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this in high school before, loved it then, love it now.</li>
            <li>It really does smell that good.</li>
            <li>PEOPLE REALLY THINK THEY SMELL GOOD...</li>
            <li>Luckily, when I called Amazon, they were wonderful and gave me a refund without requiring that I send it back..</li>
            <li>It is light but very unique and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m from Spain, so I&#x27;m perfectly familiar with the original scent, and Halloween by Jesus del Pozo is one of my top 3 favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li>It was shipped out very quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li>So buying this product is easy for me every Xmas, birthday, and anniversary.</li>
            <li>THIS HAS A STRONG STINCHE WHEN SETTLES.</li>
            <li>Have worn this for many years and nobody who&#x27;s asked about it has ever heard of before, it&#x27;s like a great perfume secret, lol.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll smell so cool for many time.</li>
            <li>Quick shipping!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy this perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, but has lavender and violet notes, which are not for everyone.  </li>
            <li>They said this was a light floral scent.</li>
            <li>So light, fresh, crisp, and lovely!</li>
            <li>It is very clean and fresh smelling(on</li>
            <li>If you are looking for something different and not too strong this is a good one.</li>
            <li>has me doubting if its original.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying and lasts all day!</li>
            <li>This is a sweet and light women perfume.</li>
            <li>You will love the fragrance, and it came the next day with free shipping on my Amazon Prime account !!</li>

            <li>Just right for summer!  </li>
            <li>I read the notes on it as to what the fragrance was supposed to smell like, and it is right on target!</li>
            <li>This is one of the best smelling ladies perfumes on the market, at least on my wife that is.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see it was available at such a cheap price on Amazon....</li>
            <li>This one is for fans of Cool Water, Aqua Di Gio and maybe even CK Escape?  </li>
            <li>If you like cool water, you might like this one too.</li>
            <li>Great fresh scent and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li>I live in the US, so I was very excited to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The scent is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>I have several of the Del Pozo fragrances and would recommend any of them - they&#x27;re all awesome and uniquely different.  </li>
            <li>5 stars, Extraordinary value for money.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery,,my wife loves this perfume</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t fade too quick.</li>
            <li>It has fantastic staying power and the bottle is pretty, too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet, fruity/flowery and fresh.  </li>
            <li>and again it smells so sweet and fresh ...</li>
            <li>This has become my #1 choice since I first smelled it!</li>
            <li>Its great for a night out or just to use when you wanna smell a little sweeter on your days off.</li>
            <li>This is an amazingly subtle fragrance, perfect for someone who wants to be radiate fragrance but not overwhelm people around with their scent!</li>
            <li>The smell is so pretty, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li>so worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fresh, you can smell it all day and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li>orchid fresh, I have been wearing this for years now, and always get compliments.</li>
            <li>So fresh, sweet, and crisp.</li>
            <li>not only was this item fairly priced,it shipped fast</li>
            <li>but it is a nice one to throw on for something different.</li>
            <li>but my advice for all perfumes is TRY IT ON YOUR OWN SKIN because perfume smells different on everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A sweet, but not overly sweet perfume that if very floral in fragrance.</li>
            <li>If you spray it twice, unlike most other perfumes I&#x27;ve had, you will be okay.  </li>
            <li>when you buy perfume at an outlet, it doesn&#x27;t smell quite right.</li>
            <li>So glad I found this perfume online since it has disappeared from most stores for a few years now.</li>
            <li>and I love the smell actually!.</li>
            <li>Fast arrival!</li>
            <li>Extremely fast!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s SO much cheaper here too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others but always come back to Halloween.</li>
            <li>but as I sniffed, the aroma was so hot</li>
            <li>I am a guy with allergies and am not a big fan of many perfumes but I like the scent of this one too.  </li>
            <li>This is my daughters favorite perfume and the only place I could find it was from Amazon !!</li>
            <li>exactly what I was expecting to get</li>
            <li>She had this when we first met</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a light, young scent, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Such an amazing, light, flowery scent smell for daily wear!</li>
            <li>she absolutely  LOVES it!</li>
            <li>I found this fragrance to be rather mature and strong, so I&#x27;d advise young people to avoid unless they have a marked preference for strong florals.</li>
            <li>The packaging was nice, it was brand new and the scent lasts so long</li>
            <li>Smells good but lastes very little time.</li>
            <li>There was so much of it flying around my home the first week that I could smell it all over the house.</li>
            <li>It smells very formal, and pretty, I would not describe it as &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too flowery or sweet, nor too masculine.  </li>
            <li>I like Halloween so much that I decided to send it to my sister for her birthday.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li>A very noticable perfume.</li>
            <li>However too much of it would be overkill.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend !</li>
            <li>hope you guys like it to its very floral if you like that type frage</li>
            <li>very helpful thank you all  recommended in date required</li>
            <li>After applying the scent, it took about 5 minutes for the scent to really develop.  </li>
            <li>It is very inexpensive and affordable.  </li>
            <li>my sister really likes it as well.</li>
            <li>good product I have nin type of complaint</li>
            <li>and I love that the price is much lower than other perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I just received this perfume and was so excited to use it because I had just used up the last bit of Halloween</li>
            <li>I did not find this perfume to be anything special or present itself as described.</li>
            <li>It is not a fake, as its sold directly by Amazon and fulfilled too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li>Several years ago our local perfume store was out of my favorite perfume and the clerk offered Halloween instead.</li>
            <li>This product fulfilled all my expectations and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>We were at a Mexican grocery store and smelled a nice scent on one of the other shoppers.  </li>
            <li>it is very light and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Not a complaint at all...</li>
            <li>Does not smell like this fragrance normally does on me.</li>
            <li>This is one of my new fragrances.</li>
            <li>I have been wearing a lot of Paris Hilton perfumes for a few months now, however Halloween is very sweet smelling.</li>
            <li>Actually I love it all year round!  </li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Although when you first spray it, I can smell the lime notes, but they do not last.  </li>
            <li>and it smells wonderful.its noticable ,but not an over powering scent,it also last all day.its true to its key noted scents as well.</li>
            <li>exactly describe the smell other than a gentle floral scent</li>
            <li>Very ordinary and cheap smelling, luckily the fragrance disappeared in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>I knew the second I opened the box that it was the real thing.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li>Overpowering floral scent that I have trouble understanding how some could find it to be light, but that&#x27;s the beauty of individuality</li>
            <li>Nothing else to add just complete required words on this message.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my old faithful.  </li>
            <li>They are surprised</li>
            <li>I expected this to smell really good from the great reviews, I was a little disappointed with the smell</li>
            <li>When it arrived she was surprised, the last time she bought halloween she got a small bottle for more than what I paid for the 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
            <li>This is a perfume very appreciated in Europe, and virtually unknown in the United States.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t speak english because I live in Venezuela.</li>
            <li>It brought back memories of when I used it back in high school.</li>
            <li>Mainly because it&#x27;s light and subtle -- not one of the overpoweringly strong scented perfumes that you can smell long after a women walks past you!  </li>
            <li>the soft and romantic smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I was a bit skeptical of a purple perfume called Halloween, but my boyfriend liked the smell and wanted me to buy it.  </li>
            <li>It is indeed subtle, somewhat sweet, and mainly preferred by younger women.</li>
            <li>This is not for me don&#x27;t like the scent but on the other hand Amazon rocks on there products and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the real deal, but at least the bottle I received smelled past its prime.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not sure – and I do not mean this to be offensive – but this perfume had a very &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; smell to it.</li>
            <li>I will never go to the mall again just to try to find a parking space, wait in line to be serviced by a rude salesperson who tells me that there is only one product size available.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit too floral when you first apply it</li>
            <li>Its a mature scent, not young and girly like some juicy or celebrity perfumes.</li>

            <li> good stuff have been wearing this very one for many many many many years</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this because the reviews were so great.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this for my wife several times, great smelling stuff, and take it from a guy, this stuff is sexy on a woman!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell good at first spray, or after it has sat awhile.  </li>
            <li> I just love it to pieces, it has a light spirited water-y floral feel that is not too strong or cloying.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in high school before, loved it then, love it now.</li>
            <li> It really does smell that good.</li>
            <li> PEOPLE REALLY THINK THEY SMELL GOOD...</li>
            <li> Luckily, when I called Amazon, they were wonderful and gave me a refund without requiring that I send it back..</li>
            <li> It is light but very unique and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Spain, so I&#x27;m perfectly familiar with the original scent, and Halloween by Jesus del Pozo is one of my top 3 favorite perfumes.</li>
            <li> It was shipped out very quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> So buying this product is easy for me every Xmas, birthday, and anniversary.</li>

            <li> you&#x27;ll smell so cool for many time.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this perfume.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, but has lavender and violet notes, which are not for everyone.  </li>
            <li> They said this was a light floral scent.</li>
            <li> So light, fresh, crisp, and lovely!</li>
            <li> It is very clean and fresh smelling(on</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something different and not too strong this is a good one.</li>
            <li> has me doubting if its original.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> This is a sweet and light women perfume.</li>
            <li> You will love the fragrance, and it came the next day with free shipping on my Amazon Prime account !!</li>

            <li> I love this perfum, I really recommed it, pleasant scent that lasts all day especially if you work in office or indoors!!</li>
            <li> Just right for summer!  </li>
            <li> I read the notes on it as to what the fragrance was supposed to smell like, and it is right on target!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best smelling ladies perfumes on the market, at least on my wife that is.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see it was available at such a cheap price on Amazon....</li>
            <li> This one is for fans of Cool Water, Aqua Di Gio and maybe even CK Escape?  </li>
            <li> If you like cool water, you might like this one too.</li>
            <li> Great fresh scent and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> I live in the US, so I was very excited to see it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The scent is clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> I have several of the Del Pozo fragrances and would recommend any of them - they&#x27;re all awesome and uniquely different.  </li>
            <li> 5 stars, Extraordinary value for money.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery,,my wife loves this perfume</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t fade too quick.</li>
            <li> It has fantastic staying power and the bottle is pretty, too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet, fruity/flowery and fresh.  </li>
            <li> and again it smells so sweet and fresh ...</li>
            <li> This has become my #1 choice since I first smelled it!</li>
            <li> Its great for a night out or just to use when you wanna smell a little sweeter on your days off.</li>
            <li> This is an amazingly subtle fragrance, perfect for someone who wants to be radiate fragrance but not overwhelm people around with their scent!</li>
            <li> The smell is so pretty, fresh, and clean.</li>
            <li> so worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fresh, you can smell it all day and is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> orchid fresh, I have been wearing this for years now, and always get compliments.</li>
            <li> So fresh, sweet, and crisp.</li>
            <li> not only was this item fairly priced,it shipped fast</li>
            <li> but it is a nice one to throw on for something different.</li>
            <li> but my advice for all perfumes is TRY IT ON YOUR OWN SKIN because perfume smells different on everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A sweet, but not overly sweet perfume that if very floral in fragrance.</li>
            <li> If you spray it twice, unlike most other perfumes I&#x27;ve had, you will be okay.  </li>
            <li> when you buy perfume at an outlet, it doesn&#x27;t smell quite right.</li>
            <li> So glad I found this perfume online since it has disappeared from most stores for a few years now.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell actually!.</li>
            <li> Fast arrival!</li>
            <li> Extremely fast!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s SO much cheaper here too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others but always come back to Halloween.</li>
            <li> but as I sniffed, the aroma was so hot</li>
            <li> I am a guy with allergies and am not a big fan of many perfumes but I like the scent of this one too.  </li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite perfume and the only place I could find it was from Amazon !!</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting to get</li>
            <li> She had this when we first met</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a light, young scent, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Such an amazing, light, flowery scent smell for daily wear!</li>
            <li> she absolutely  LOVES it!</li>
            <li> I found this fragrance to be rather mature and strong, so I&#x27;d advise young people to avoid unless they have a marked preference for strong florals.</li>
            <li> The packaging was nice, it was brand new and the scent lasts so long</li>
            <li> Smells good but lastes very little time.</li>
            <li> There was so much of it flying around my home the first week that I could smell it all over the house.</li>
            <li> It smells very formal, and pretty, I would not describe it as &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too flowery or sweet, nor too masculine.  </li>
            <li> I like Halloween so much that I decided to send it to my sister for her birthday.  </li>
            <li> I really do like this fragrance.  </li>
            <li> A very noticable perfume.</li>
            <li> However too much of it would be overkill.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> hope you guys like it to its very floral if you like that type frage</li>
            <li> very helpful thank you all  recommended in date required</li>
            <li> After applying the scent, it took about 5 minutes for the scent to really develop.  </li>
            <li> It is very inexpensive and affordable.  </li>
            <li> my sister really likes it as well.</li>
            <li> good product I have nin type of complaint</li>
            <li> and I love that the price is much lower than other perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I just received this perfume and was so excited to use it because I had just used up the last bit of Halloween</li>
            <li> I did not find this perfume to be anything special or present itself as described.</li>
            <li> It is not a fake, as its sold directly by Amazon and fulfilled too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take</li>
            <li> Several years ago our local perfume store was out of my favorite perfume and the clerk offered Halloween instead.</li>
            <li> This product fulfilled all my expectations and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> We were at a Mexican grocery store and smelled a nice scent on one of the other shoppers.  </li>
            <li> it is very light and last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not a complaint at all...</li>
            <li> Does not smell like this fragrance normally does on me.</li>
            <li> This is one of my new fragrances.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing a lot of Paris Hilton perfumes for a few months now, however Halloween is very sweet smelling.</li>
            <li> Actually I love it all year round!  </li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> Although when you first spray it, I can smell the lime notes, but they do not last.  </li>
            <li> and it smells wonderful.its noticable ,but not an over powering scent,it also last all day.its true to its key noted scents as well.</li>
            <li> exactly describe the smell other than a gentle floral scent</li>
            <li> Very ordinary and cheap smelling, luckily the fragrance disappeared in a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> I knew the second I opened the box that it was the real thing.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> Overpowering floral scent that I have trouble understanding how some could find it to be light, but that&#x27;s the beauty of individuality</li>
            <li> Nothing else to add just complete required words on this message.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my old faithful.  </li>
            <li> They are surprised</li>
            <li> I expected this to smell really good from the great reviews, I was a little disappointed with the smell</li>
            <li> When it arrived she was surprised, the last time she bought halloween she got a small bottle for more than what I paid for the 3.4 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> This is a perfume very appreciated in Europe, and virtually unknown in the United States.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t speak english because I live in Venezuela.</li>
            <li> It brought back memories of when I used it back in high school.</li>
            <li> Mainly because it&#x27;s light and subtle -- not one of the overpoweringly strong scented perfumes that you can smell long after a women walks past you!  </li>
            <li> the soft and romantic smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical of a purple perfume called Halloween, but my boyfriend liked the smell and wanted me to buy it.  </li>
            <li> It is indeed subtle, somewhat sweet, and mainly preferred by younger women.</li>
            <li> This is not for me don&#x27;t like the scent but on the other hand Amazon rocks on there products and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the real deal, but at least the bottle I received smelled past its prime.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure – and I do not mean this to be offensive – but this perfume had a very &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; smell to it.</li>
            <li> I will never go to the mall again just to try to find a parking space, wait in line to be serviced by a rude salesperson who tells me that there is only one product size available.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit too floral when you first apply it</li>
            <li> Its a mature scent, not young and girly like some juicy or celebrity perfumes.</li>
            <li> concern is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> If perfumes don&#x27;t last a long time on you, this is not what you want.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s long lasting and the scent will remain on your coat/clothes for days to come.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting and smells divine!!!</li>
            <li> so I know this bottle will last me a long time!</li>
            <li> The big bottle lasts me a long time!</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new fragrance a few years ago</li>
            <li> i really love it, and refuse to pay crazy amounts for perfume.  </li>
            <li> A bottle lasts me a long time.</li>
            <li> I use this perfum for long long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for way too long.</li>
            <li> after using this perfume, every other perfume smells overwhelming and artificial</li>
            <li> i think its too sweet smelling  and has this weird after smell that gives me a headache.</li>
            <li> People always give me a weird face when I tell them the name, and I laugh.</li>
            <li> I expected this scent to be \\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve continued to use it anyway, because I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, but I&#x27;ll buy the next one in Spain, when I go visit my family.</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
            <li> To bad this is not sold anywhere near where we live in East Central Indiana.  </li>
            <li> I went by other&#x27;s and what they said about it and just bought it.</li>
            <li> only thing is that the size is to small.--</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put down.</li>
            <li> I on the other hand am not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> well\\&quot; black</li>
            <li> i guess im the odd ball out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a good idea to use same perfume as a friend...</li>
            <li> The only thing is that if I put on too much It can get a little annoying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sporty and not too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Which is  everyday.</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT A LIGHT FRAGRANCE EITHER.</li>
            <li> It is not a light scent, and I had to scrub it off because I could not take it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the odd name fool you!  </li>
            <li> Do not let the name make you think of a dark hard smell.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why he named it Halloween</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a scent I think is a bit bohemian, and is not overwhelming at all.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is really hard to find in the US</li>
            <li> I have a hard time buying perfume that I like on my wife.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to find in perfume stores in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Every time I use it at least one person asks &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying it on Amazon as I&#x27;ve bought it at retail price for close to $80.</li>
            <li> Sorry.  </li>
            <li> It is so expensive in department stores.</li>
            <li> If you like offbeat scents, you may like this.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SORRY YOU DON&#x27;T CAUSE IT STINKS.</li>
            <li> Sort of like a dirty hippy.  </li>
            <li> IT GAVE ME A BAD HEADACHE.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> excellent product quality, responsible vendors recommend them thank you very much</li>
            <li> I like Halloween so much that I decided to send it to my sister for her birthday.  I&#x27;m sure she will like it too. It&#x27;s sporty and not too heavy.  Just right for summer!  Actually I love it all year round!  Every time I use it at least one person asks &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34;?</li>
            <li> This fragrance is really hard to find in the US so I had to buy it online... I got it because I love freesia and I knew this had notes of freesia I tried it and I love the smell actually!. The only thing is that if I put on too much It can get a little annoying. It is a little bit too floral when you first apply it but after a while that strong fragrance goes away and it smells really good!</li>
            <li> good product I have nin type of complaint, I am satisfied recommend this seller and product</li>
            <li> This is one of the most amazing perfume I&#x27;ve ever had. It has a smell that is very soft and pleasant, perfect for use during the day. I love this perfume, I recommend it!</li>
            <li> Prompt, great service!!! Fast arrival! I will never go to the mall again just to try to find a parking space, wait in line to be serviced by a rude salesperson who tells me that there is only one product size available. This is the only perfume I can/will use! And this is the only site I will buy it from. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Extremely fast! I LOVE this perfume and it&#x27;s so nice to not have to drive to the mall to it and it&#x27;s SO much cheaper here too!</li>
            <li> I really do like this fragrance.  I bought it because of the name of it.  Would recommend this one to any lady.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it!!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend was running out of Halloween, which is her favorite, she saw this item and it&#x27;s price and asked me to order it for her. When it arrived she was surprised, the last time she bought halloween she got a small bottle for more than what I paid for the 3.4 oz bottle. It was shipped out very quickly with no problems.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. so worth it.</li>
            <li> This has become my #1 choice since I first smelled it! It&#x27;s fresh, you can smell it all day and is not overpowering. I was skeptical about buying it on Amazon as I&#x27;ve bought it at retail price for close to $80. I knew the second I opened the box that it was the real thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the odd name fool you!  This is one of the best smelling ladies perfumes on the market, at least on my wife that is.  It is light but very unique and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent and so do my daughters. There was so much of it flying around my home the first week that I could smell it all over the house. Of course, even with Halloween over, they are still using it often.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume! I actually mix it with \\&quot;Paris Hilton\\&quot; perfume and I receive compliments on the combo literally every time I wear it. SO GOOD!!</li>
            <li> I have worn this perfume for about 8 years now . A clerk made the suggestion in a store and I have been wearing it ever since! I get compliments everywhere I go.It is very clean and fresh smelling(on me anyway)</li>
            <li> Great item, good price and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I have never smelled Halloween prior to me purchasing it. I went by other&#x27;s and what they said about it and just bought it. I have been wearing a lot of Paris Hilton perfumes for a few months now, however Halloween is very sweet smelling. A very noticable perfume. However too much of it would be overkill.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again, also seller sent me samples coupons in box along with these really cute nail files. I would recommened him.</li>
            <li> Doesnt last like the ones at the mall. Smells good but lastes very little time. has me doubting if its original.</li>
            <li> Originally, I bought it for the name alone,but now it&#x27;s my favorite fragrance! It has a clean fresh scent that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm! Highly recommend !</li>
            <li> So many people ask me what kind of perfume I use.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY when I wear this one.&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought this because my friend was wearing it and I loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a good idea to use same perfume as a friend... lol (she doesn&#x27;t use this anymore.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the soft and romantic smell of this.&lt;br /&gt;This is some kind of magic...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only concern is that it doesn&#x27;t last long enough.</li>
            <li> I used the Halloween By Jesus Del Pozo For Women. Eau De Toilette Sprayfelling good,I&#x27;m so love the scent .</li>
            <li> Great scent &amp; quick delivery</li>
            <li> This perfume smells really good, I get compliments all the time when I wear it.  It&#x27;s sweet, fruity/flowery and fresh.  If you like Paris Hilton perfumes, you&#x27;ll like this one it&#x27;s similar.</li>
            <li> Have used this perfume for several years, so happy with the price on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I just received this perfume and was so excited to use it because I had just used up the last bit of Halloween I had left that my cousin from Barcelona, Spain had sent me. I was thrilled to see it was available at such a cheap price on Amazon....HOWEVER, it is NOT the same fragrance! Do not waste your money on this. Luckily, when I called Amazon, they were wonderful and gave me a refund without requiring that I send it back..because it is a nonrefundable item. It smells nothing like it should</li>
            <li> Love this!  I have several of the Del Pozo fragrances and would recommend any of them - they&#x27;re all awesome and uniquely different.  This one is for fans of Cool Water, Aqua Di Gio and maybe even CK Escape?  I just love it to pieces, it has a light spirited water-y floral feel that is not too strong or cloying.  It would probably sell a zillion bottles, but the namesake (Halloween) makes me think of candy corn, pumpkins and spice....they maybe should have named it something else.  Like Hallo-Blossoms!  Not a complaint at all...but will eventually buy ALL of the Del Pozo line because it really does smell that good!</li>
            <li> I did not find this perfume to be anything special or present itself as described. Very ordinary and cheap smelling, luckily the fragrance disappeared in a short amount of time. I would not recommend \\&quot;Halloween\\&quot; to anyone. I was extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Several years ago our local perfume store was out of my favorite perfume and the clerk offered Halloween instead. Now I keep it in my collection at all times. Love it! Can&#x27;t beat the price either!</li>
            <li> I love love love  this perfume it smells great.  I purchased 4 bottles for my family and friends, Everyone like it.</li>
            <li> This is not for me don&#x27;t like the scent but on the other hand Amazon rocks on there products and fast delivery</li>
            <li> Very good buy and excellent product of very good quality and excellent price very satisfied with my purchase thank you very much and very good buyed of good quality good</li>
            <li> Overpowering floral scent that I have trouble understanding how some could find it to be light, but that&#x27;s the beauty of individuality I guess. I found this fragrance to be rather mature and strong, so I&#x27;d advise young people to avoid unless they have a marked preference for strong florals. At any rate, you have been warned.</li>
            <li> If you like cool water, you might like this one too. The scent is clean and fresh. It is mostly a daytime perfume.</li>
            <li> This Product was described correctly and it was deliveried correctly. Nothing else to add just complete required words on this message.</li>
            <li> Its super fresh and original, not like soap fresh but more flowers, orchid fresh, I have been wearing this for years now, and always get compliments. I discovered an eu de parfum version, call HALLOWEEN FEVER, it last longer with the same scent and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this scent for about 10 years and I still get compliments on it! People always give me a weird face when I tell them the name, and I laugh. So fresh, sweet, and crisp. Definitely worth buying and lasts all day!</li>
            <li> my girlfriend love it. everyone around talks about the great scense and aroma the perfume transmits. keep the recommendation to myself jejeje. kidding recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I love those perfume!!! I&#x27;ve had it twice and every time I&#x27;m low I buy another before it finishes. One of my favorite perfumes!!!!</li>
            <li> A great perfume that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm &amp; a leg! A bottle lasts me a long time. Have worn this for many years and nobody who&#x27;s asked about it has ever heard of before, it&#x27;s like a great perfume secret, lol.  I would have never found it either but a boyfriend was looking to buy something for me and a salesperson at the perfume store recommended it to him. I&#x27;ve tried many others but always come back to Halloween.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m buying a lot of the Amazon 50-70% off fragrances just to try (if they have good ratings). People raved about this, so I tried it. If perfumes don&#x27;t last a long time on you, this is not what you want. I guess I didn&#x27;t get the correct &amp;#34;Halloween&amp;#34; -- it smells just like Coty&#x27;s Miquet (Lily of the Valley) on me.</li>
            <li> I expected this scent to be \\&quot; well\\&quot; black but as I sniffed, the aroma was so hot I can&#x27;t put down.</li>
            <li> This is an amazingly subtle fragrance, perfect for someone who wants to be radiate fragrance but not overwhelm people around with their scent! I have been using it for over 5 years now and feel this is the only fragrance for me.  after using this perfume, every other perfume smells overwhelming and artificial</li>
            <li> She loves this spanish perfume. Not sure why he named it Halloween but my wife says she gets the most compliments when she wears it. I am a guy with allergies and am not a big fan of many perfumes but I like the scent of this one too.  Mainly because it&#x27;s light and subtle -- not one of the overpoweringly strong scented perfumes that you can smell long after a women walks past you!  The price is good and it was delivered in 3 days using the Free delivery even though they predicted 20 days!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! I have been wearing it for almost 20 years and still go back to it every time IMO bottle runs out.</li>
            <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!!</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it.  It&#x27;s the only scent I buy.  Get compliments about scent every time I have it on.  Which is  everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume that my wife will wear. So buying this product is easy for me every Xmas, birthday, and anniversary.</li>
            <li> This is a sweet and light women perfume. my mom loves it. The price is great for a 3.4 ounces.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my girlfriend for Christmas. She was bugging me about finding some, because it is discontinued. I found it on here, and she loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this in high school before, loved it then, love it now. The smell is so pretty, fresh, and clean. At the mall this bottle would have cost 50 bucks, you can&#x27;t beat the price. It does NOT smell like a knock off either, smells just as I remember it.</li>
            <li> Has a funky scent to it.  Sort of like a dirty hippy.  I gave it a fair chance, wore it twice.  Doesn&#x27;t smell good at first spray, or after it has sat awhile.  Sorry.  To be fair, I will say that I didn&#x27;t get it from Amazon.</li>
            <li> excellent product, I am satisfied with it and with the Store esponsibility 100% recommended</li>
            <li> very original. recommend the product. very good fragrance.</li>
            <li> Underrated parfume (better for us lol). This is a perfume very appreciated in Europe, and virtually unknown in the United States. This perfume is more expensive in Europe than here in the U.S., so I recommend you take advantage of these prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A delicious eau de toilette which you will receive many compliments, not only because it&#x27;s a great scent but also because it is a rare and original perfume. The name and the bottle suggest magic and adventure, as a magic potion made jointly by witches and fairies. Created by the famous fashion designer Jesus del Pozo (d. 2011) this is one of his best creations. 5 stars, Extraordinary value for money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my old faithful.  People always ask, what it is.  The name always causes &amp;#34;a look&amp;#34;.  It has a Very pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li> many compliments mostly men</li>
            <li> good stuff have been wearing this very one for many many many many years hope you guys like it to its very floral if you like that type frage</li>
            <li> O.M.G I literally just discovered this perfume this afternoon, and I am inloveeee with it! So light, fresh, crisp, and lovely!</li>

            <li> My wife loves this perfume, she always get complimented on it by strangers and is always telling everyone about how awesome this perfume is.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe this but I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for almost a decade!! I always get compliments and people wanting to know what it is when I wear it (even more so than my Armani scents!). It has fantastic staying power and the bottle is pretty, too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this scent.</li>
            <li> This is my daughters favorite perfume and the only place I could find it was from Amazon !! When my daughter lived on the west coast, she fell in love with this perfume . Now that she lives on the east coast, the only place I could find to buy this was on Amazon !! You will love the fragrance, and it came the next day with free shipping on my Amazon Prime account !!</li>
            <li> not only was this item fairly priced,it shipped fast and it smells wonderful.its noticable ,but not an over powering scent,it also last all day.its true to its key noted scents as well. this would make a good gift item for sure</li>
            <li> Great product! Great Service!</li>
            <li> I received so many compliments! love the fragrance!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something different and not too strong this is a good one. I don&#x27;t wear it every day but it is a nice one to throw on for something different.</li>
            <li> I expected this to smell really good from the great reviews, I was a little disappointed with the smell it was too sweet and something else was mixed in, it was not a good match for me.</li>
            <li> The scent is just perfect, not too strong, not too sweet, the perfect mix. Whoever gets in touch with the aroma, has to ask what it is.  You can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was expecting to get</li>
            <li> LLEGO EN EXCELENTES CONDICIONES RICA FRAGANCIA  RIQUÍSIMA COMPREN LA SE LAS RECOMIENDO APROVÉCHENLA  NO PASAS DESAPERCIBIDA ES DURADERO EL OLOR</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t speak english because I live in Venezuela. But this but purchase was Excelent, and easy! I still expect shipment to Venezuela but from another company of parcels.</li>
            <li> Wifes favorite perfume, very light and non liqour-alcholy smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cant exactly describe the smell other than a gentle floral scent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;++</li>
            <li> So glad I found this perfume online since it has disappeared from most stores for a few years now. It brought back memories of when I used it back in high school. Great fresh scent and lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> The scent is just perfect, not strong or sweet, just perfect mix. I smelled it in one of my co workers and had to buy it. I&#x27;ts a daytime perfum, and it&#x27;ll make feel sexy. Yes, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Excellent purchase, excellent seller</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness, I am so glad I purchased this perfume. It is so wonderful: sexy, fun, perfect for the warmer seasons. This is one of my new fragrances. I had never heard of this perfume before, so I was a bit leary, but I am so glad I took a chance on it. I read the notes on it as to what the fragrance was supposed to smell like, and it is right on target! I am so thrilled with it. Take a chance for yourself and try this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> Is original. I&#x27;m really happy ith this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time buying perfume that I like on my wife.  We were at a Mexican grocery store and smelled a nice scent on one of the other shoppers.  We didn&#x27;t speak Spanish, and she didn&#x27;t speak English.  Somehow we figured out the name and look of the bottle.  After some Internet searching, we found it.  Her reaction to the name wasn&#x27;t great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it arrived, the packaging and bottle are very nice.  After applying the scent, it took about 5 minutes for the scent to really develop.  This was a great purchase, and I am sure we&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> excelente producto llego a la fecha esperada y en buenas condiciones todo el proceso fue muy rapido y sencillo gracias</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent as do those who smell it on me!</li>
            <li> I was utterly blown away by the scent. It smells so great, perfect for a lady who likes to look nice and take care of herself. The packaging was nice, it was brand new and the scent lasts so long so I know this bottle will last me a long time! I recommend this product, DEFINITELY. I get compliments all the time and people ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. It really does smell that good.</li>
            <li> I love this perfum, I really recommed it, pleasant scent that lasts all day especially if you work in office or indoors!!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. Arrived quickly and at a good price.</li>
            <li> this parfume smells delicious... it can be used for girls and ladies in many occasions. you&#x27;ll smell so cool for many time.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas.  This arrived very fast and smells awesome.  This is my favorite perfume for her.  Do not let the name make you think of a dark hard smell.  it is very light and last a long time.  To bad this is not sold anywhere near where we live in East Central Indiana.  She had this when we first met and we could not locate it anywhere.</li>
            <li> Excellent. I love this product. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. This product fulfilled all my expectations and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and the shipping was in time. Great purchase</li>
            <li> I would buy this again and again it smells so sweet and fresh ...I love it...I ordered the Big one this time so it will last me longer hopefully....I use it a lot...</li>
            <li> Love this perfume,  just so happens my birthday is Halloween so its fitting.</li>
            <li> THIS HALLOWEEN FRAGRANCE DOES NOT SMELL GOOD AT ALL.  IT IS NOT A LIGHT FRAGRANCE EITHER. THE BOX WAS SEALED SO I KNOW IT HAD NOT BEEN EXPOSED. THIS HAS A STRONG STINCHE WHEN SETTLES. IT GAVE ME A BAD HEADACHE. PEOPLE REALLY THINK THEY SMELL GOOD... WOW!  I&#x27;M SORRY YOU DON&#x27;T CAUSE IT STINKS.</li>
            <li> It smells very formal, and pretty, I would not describe it as &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; though. It smells like a perfume to wear to church.</li>
            <li> excelente producto, muy bueno el despacho, EXACTAMENTE el perfume que quer&amp;iacute;a y totalmente original y muy bien especificado en los detalles del producto</li>
            <li> I am in love with this scent.  I get numerous compliments day after day, it is just wonderful.  It&#x27;s the gift that keeps on giving, LOL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s long lasting and the scent will remain on your coat/clothes for days to come.  I recommend this perfume.  It is very inexpensive and affordable.  I remember when I paid triple the price for Halloween.  It is not a fake, as its sold directly by Amazon and fulfilled too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take in mind that I am a perfume queen, I have several such as Narciso Rodriguez, Michael Kors, Chloe, D&amp;G The One, Jimmy Choo, etc.  But I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new fragrance a few years ago and this was recommended to me at one of those mall fragrance stores.  I was a bit skeptical of a purple perfume called Halloween, but my boyfriend liked the smell and wanted me to buy it.  After all these years, I continue to get compliments and love wearing this fragrance.  It&#x27;s not too flowery or sweet, nor too masculine.  I don&#x27;t know how to describe the smell, but it works for me and I love that the price is much lower than other perfumes.  The big bottle lasts me a long time!</li>
            <li> very good and&lt;br /&gt;economical&lt;br /&gt;its aroma is excellent,&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance lasts long.&lt;br /&gt;just apply some&lt;br /&gt;recommend&lt;br /&gt;for&lt;br /&gt;purchase</li>
            <li> If you like offbeat scents, you may like this.  It&#x27;s neither too floral nor too musky, nor too fruity.  Although when you first spray it, I can smell the lime notes, but they do not last.  It&#x27;s light, but has lavender and violet notes, which are not for everyone.  It&#x27;s a scent I think is a bit bohemian, and is not overwhelming at all. If you spray it twice, unlike most other perfumes I&#x27;ve had, you will be okay.  I love this one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfume my wife likes, it was a great price, it arrived on time, and she is happy.  What more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> The product is original and is in good conditions for its use personal. I wait buy others fragances come soon</li>
            <li> I have ordered this for my wife several times, great smelling stuff, and take it from a guy, this stuff is sexy on a woman!</li>
            <li> this is my very favorite perfume for like 15yrs now.  i really love it, and refuse to pay crazy amounts for perfume.  i get compliments on it all of the time, in your face chanel!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this perfume and I love that its packaged with a purple box and that the perfume itself is purple (my favourite colour) :) I always get compliments on the smell.</li>
            <li> product arrived on time and are very good, a responsible person is recommended.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this because the reviews were so great. They said this was a light floral scent. Maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;m 25, I&#x27;m not sure – and I do not mean this to be offensive – but this perfume had a very &amp;#34;senior&amp;#34; smell to it. It smells like my grandmother&#x27;s house. It is not a light scent, and I had to scrub it off because I could not take it. If you are looking for a light, young scent, look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto, cumple totalmente con el requerimiento, escelente entrega, buen negocio, muy agradecido.  Llego en buen estado y perfectas condiciones</li>
            <li> Great scent! Quick shipping! Happy customer!</li>
            <li> my mom&#x27;s favorite perfume</li>
            <li> Such an amazing, light, flowery scent smell for daily wear! Definitely not overpowering! I get so many compliments.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this. (So so I of course!)  Good price and prompt service.</li>
            <li> soy de venezuela y me encanta este producto que pienso regarlo a un ser querido saludos a todos lo recomiendo</li>
            <li> Does not smell like this fragrance normally does on me. I have been wearing it for years and this has no resemblance of Halloween.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excelente producto recomendado.. lo recomiendo! funciona excelente y llego a tiempo, excelente envoltura y tal cual lo describio el vendedor</li>
            <li> This floral scent is perfect for my body chemistry. I have been wearing this perfume since 2003 and I have been hooked. It is hard to find in perfume stores in the U.S. so this is the place to purchase it. A unique scent that will make you stand out in a crowd.</li>
            <li> Love it! Long lasting and smells divine!!!</li>
            <li> Always under the Christmas tree!!&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves Halloween by Jesus Del Pozo and buys it for me every Christmas! We discovered this cologne about six years ago, and I always get compliments and women ask me for the name. They are surprised when I tell them &amp;#34;Halloween!&amp;#34; I love it!</li>
            <li> My wife like it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the only thing is that the size is to small.-- I shoud buy a bigger one.</li>
            <li> i order this perfume for my mom. she absolutely  LOVES it! I on the other hand am not a huge fan. i think its too sweet smelling  and has this weird after smell that gives me a headache. my sister really likes it as well. she says its a great work perfume. i guess im the odd ball out. :)  but my advice for all perfumes is TRY IT ON YOUR OWN SKIN because perfume smells different on everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i guess these reviews would be good to read about the holding power of a fragrance. i would say this perfume is ok in that way. doesn&#x27;t fade too quick.</li>
            <li> all excellent , thank you very much</li>
            <li> Awesome product and price! Good buy, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Second purchase. She loves the scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m from Spain, so I&#x27;m perfectly familiar with the original scent, and Halloween by Jesus del Pozo is one of my top 3 favorite perfumes. It is indeed subtle, somewhat sweet, and mainly preferred by younger women. I live in the US, so I was very excited to see it available on Amazon. However, it&#x27;s not the same. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s the real deal, but at least the bottle I received smelled past its prime. It&#x27;s been sitting on a shelf for way too long. That&#x27;s what happens. That&#x27;s why oftentimes when you buy perfume at an outlet, it doesn&#x27;t smell quite right. It did still have some of its essence, but I could definitely smell the alcohol. I&#x27;ve continued to use it anyway, because I didn&#x27;t want to waste it, but I&#x27;ll buy the next one in Spain, when I go visit my family.</li>
            <li> A sweet, but not overly sweet perfume that if very floral in fragrance. Its a mature scent, not young and girly like some juicy or celebrity perfumes. I just picked up this perfume from Burlington coat factory and am very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Excellent as sellers and punctual delivery time wing, totally reliable and very good fragrance</li>
            <li> It was what I expected</li>
