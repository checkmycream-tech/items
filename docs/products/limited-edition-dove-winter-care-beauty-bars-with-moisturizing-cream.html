            <li> It&#x27;s time-tested and as long as we can get, we will.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry in the winter.  </li>
            <li> Every winter I get horribly dry skin, in bed I would just itch no matter what lotion I used.</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone with extremely dry skin or eczema, or psoriasis, to buy this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linds</li>
            <li> All soap would make my skin dry and itchy but not</li>
            <li> Even in the summer my legs and arms get dry and scaly-looking.  </li>
            <li> you have dry skin works</li>
            <li> now my daughter use this on her toddler; give this a try if you have dry skin problem 5star for my family,</li>
            <li> I am having dry skin issues this winter.</li>
            <li> and it made my face so itchy, flaky and dry as well as a burning sensation.  </li>
            <li> It says limited edition.</li>
            <li> The scent is less old-lady smelling than other Dove soap varieties, such as the pink bar scent.  </li>
            <li> The extra moisture in this soap is valued all year round by my family</li>
            <li> and i found this a few days ago in a 6pk at my local walmart,used it that night and</li>
            <li> one of the only soaps i will use and amazon one of the few suppliers</li>
            <li> Avoid this version and stick to the other ones.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times and everytime it tries me out.  </li>
            <li> My family likes to stock up on it and use it all year round.</li>
            <li> but i use it year round.</li>
            <li> this stuff works all year round.</li>
            <li> I echo the sentiments that wish this soap was offered year round!</li>
            <li> Does not help winter skin for my face at least</li>
            <li> And if anyone who has skin like me, it&#x27;s highly irritating, well not anymore, I bought and used this soap and for the first time I did not itch like a mad man!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Dove.</li>
            <li> it is extremely cold</li>
            <li> Works like a champ for the cold NY winters.  </li>
            <li> Looks like bad dandruff in my lap after I rub my face once.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The extra moisture in this soap is valued all year round by my family so we buy it in bulk. It&#x27;s time-tested and as long as we can get, we will.</li>
            <li> My skin gets really dry in the winter.  Almost a scaly texture. This soap is great! My skin is so soft after using it.     It says limited edition. I really hope that doesn&#x27;t mean they will not sell it again next winter. If so I must stock pile now!</li>
            <li> The smell of this product is not the best and does take some getting used to. After switching to winter care from exfoliation, I realized how good the exfoliating dove bar smells. Also, all the glue on the packages degraded so the containers didn&#x27;t really do much in terms of convenient storage</li>
            <li> I saw this soap on the Dove website and thought hmmm maybe that soap will not make my skin so itchy. Every winter I get horribly dry skin, in bed I would just itch no matter what lotion I used. And if anyone who has skin like me, it&#x27;s highly irritating, well not anymore, I bought and used this soap and for the first time I did not itch like a mad man! My skin was calm and smooth, usually I get red blotchy type rashes on my forearms, and it was gone. HEAVENLY! I recommend for anyone with extremely dry skin or eczema, or psoriasis, to buy this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linds</li>
            <li> I think this is the first time I&#x27;ve felt compelled enough to review a product online.  I ran out of face wash and I saw this soap laying around (received it as part of a thank you gift), so I decided to give it a try on my face.  It was so nice!  Skin felt moisturized and smooth, and -dare I say- I think I like it better than my more expensive face wash.  Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Only available in the fall and winter months. Has a better effect on dry skin. An excellent product.</li>
            <li> I love Dove soaps they are the best in moisturizing the skin. The price for 14 bars is 26.00 dollars they are on sale at Walmart for $6.99 for 6. So I guess I overpaid by 9 dollars ouch!</li>
            <li> I love Dove but this version makes me break out and itch.  Do not know why but it does.  Tried it a few times and everytime it tries me out.  Avoid this version and stick to the other ones.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be so excited over soap. All soap would make my skin dry and itchy but not Dove Winter Care. My feet are always rough no matter what I do but to my amazment Dove Winter Care has made my feet perfectly soft again! Thank you Dove!!</li>
            <li> Dove has created an amazing product that soothes and relieves the skin from winter itch. Its light lather leaves your skin soft, silky, and so very smooth. Everytime I use it, I&#x27;m transported to sun-shined island with a warm gentle breeze while angels sing and play their harps in the background. It truly makes the skin feel just that wonderful. Great job Dove, keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products, I&#x27;ve used them for years but am not loving this one.  It makes my eyes burn and water (Soap not getting in my eyes)and my skin itch.  I switched back to my original Dove and no issues.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad that this soap is available year-round here!  I live in the Great Plains where the air is always so dry.  Even in the summer my legs and arms get dry and scaly-looking.  Dove winter care is the best soap I&#x27;ve found to moisturize my skin in the bath and minimize the dryness.  It makes wonderful, gentle creamy lather and smells fresh and clean.  The scent is less old-lady smelling than other Dove soap varieties, such as the pink bar scent.  The only con to this soap is the soap ring it leaves after draining the tub, but, for me, the moisturizing benefits outweigh the nuisance of having to rinse the bathtub after using it.  I hope Dove never stops making this product!</li>
            <li> I always use and enjoy Dove soap, but this bar is special: it is very creamy, lathers nicely, it is fragrant but in a gentle non-imposing way; it does not dry the skin at all.</li>
            <li> Just finished the Summer Care and i found this a few days ago in a 6pk at my local walmart,used it that night and OMG YES!!!! Home run for sure! This bar smells so good if say it&#x27;s better than original dove(which I&#x27;ve used for over 10yrs now dove snob.lol) it has a clean calming relaxing scent light yet it doesn&#x27;t smell like a soap. Lavender,dove scent with a hint of powder is what I get. I live on the west coast and its very dry here in the desert your skin is left lightly scented,and moisturized. I&#x27;m sad I only got the one 6pk:( definetly going back this week for more:)</li>
            <li> This is are fav bar soap. me and my daughter love this soap very good for dry skin.\\&quot;we have long cold winters in Michigan .we need lots of moisture \\&quot;if you have dry skin works nicely smell softly just right not to bold\\&quot;.love this \\&quot; now my daughter use this on her toddler; give this a try if you have dry skin problem 5star for my family,</li>
            <li> Exactly as sold in retail stores. Manufacturer distributes seasonally so its great to be able to bathe the remainder of the year. :-) Thank you for stocking this product.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful for those of us that have extremely dry skin in the winter.  My family likes to stock up on it and use it all year round.</li>
            <li> one of the only soaps i will use and amazon one of the few suppliers</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find this at stores so bought from amazon. Works great for dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is the BEST soap to use in the winter!!! I dsicovered it last winter and love it, will surely keep buying it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it is perfect for the winter when you tend to have more dry itchy skin hen it is extremely cold</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap under Doctors orders. I am having dry skin issues this winter. I prefer original DOVE because of its beautiful fragerance but that&#x27;s what I have to avoid for the Winter!</li>
            <li> Great, arrived on time and this product is the best.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin on my face drier than before to the point where if I rub my face mass amounts of skin flakes fall off. Looks like bad dandruff in my lap after I rub my face once. Does not help winter skin for my face at least</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have super dry skin like some do, and it&#x27;s still only September so winter itch hasn&#x27;t struck yet, but this soap is so rich and smells so wonderful. After using it, I don&#x27;t even need to use body lotion to feel comfortable in my skin. So soft! Wish this was available all year!</li>
            <li> I echo the sentiments that wish this soap was offered year round! Winter is mild where I live and yet I still find myself wishing for a soap with more moisturizers. This soap is perfect! The scent is mild and pleasant. I&#x27;ve been using a generic warehouse brand that is much, much harsher than Dove soap and I always feel it leaves a residue. This soap is creamy, a perfect lather and feels like it rinses away clean yet leaves my skin so very soft! I loved it and will stock up since it seems that this is a \\&quot;limited edition\\&quot; only offered in Winter.</li>
            <li> super fast delivery.  this is my favorite soap as it smells great and doesnt dry my skin out. it may say winter care on it but i use it year round.</li>
            <li> Bought for my Mom and at 86 she doesn&#x27;t experience dry, itchy skin any more and Loves her Winter Care Dove Bars all year round.</li>
            <li> I am a total fan of Dove original bar soap which I use on my face and all over my body.  I saw this winter bar in the store and thought I would give it a shot because it smelled better then the original.  I used it for a week and it made my face so itchy, flaky and dry as well as a burning sensation.  Had to switch back to the original and skin went back to normal.  I Don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I may be a guy, but I like to take care of my skin. This is the perfect mix of cleaning soap for the hard grime and comfortable care for dry skin that comes with working out in the elements.</li>
            <li> I was so happy to get this soap online hard to find in stores my skin gets so dry. In winter this soap is the best</li>
            <li> I have always used Dove soap, and the Winter Care scent is awesome!! I sure hope they keep making it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only soap I buy. We live in the upper mid-west and winters are harsh. So, I bought this to give it a go. That was years ago. Now in the winter I stock up because you can&#x27;t find it in the stores during the summer months. It makes your skin like a baby&#x27;s. I love the smell. It truly is the best.</li>
            <li> This soap product really works well if you have dry skin. We use it year around and really like it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.....make sure summer care is available and offer six pack bodywashes. Also where is a lotion or body butter...lol</li>
            <li> this soap is the best. men women , it don&#x27;t matter . not just for winter either. this stuff works all year round.</li>
            <li> this is the best year round beauty bar for the entire family.  It does not clash with your perfume and the men in our house like how it lathers and soothes their skin.  Great never stop manufacturing it.</li>
            <li> Works like a champ for the cold NY winters.  My sister turned me onto this soap.  At the time, they were not selling it at CVS sold I purchased here on Amazon.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with Dove.</li>
            <li> Love it! My favorite soap!!!</li>
            <li> I TRIED THE DOVE WINTERCARE BY CHANCE AND LOVED THE WAY IT MADE MY SKIN FEEL. AFTERWARDS I COULD NOT FIND IT IN THE LOCAL STORES SO I WAS TRULY HAPPY WHEN I FOUNG IT ONLINE.</li>
            <li> Love!  My favorite scent, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.  One bar lasts about two weeks.  Good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Dove is GREAT I use all of these products this is one of my favorites for the winter it keeps my skin from drying and itching I live in Milwaukee and the winter is hard on the skin but using DOVE my skin feels soft and smooth all year long</li>
