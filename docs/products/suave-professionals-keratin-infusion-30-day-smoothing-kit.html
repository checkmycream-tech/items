    <ol>
            <li>My hair looked great!</li>
            <li>Also the conditioner that comes with the kit is great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the Garnier version and even though I know a girl who claims her hair fell out over it, mine was perfect.</li>
            <li>but i still have my hair &amp; it looks wonderful!</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT IS BEST FOR VIRGIN UNTRREATRED HAIR, and if you were to go to a salon with permed and bleached hair and ask for it, they probably would reccommend against it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m very happy for them, but I wouldn&#x27;t risk it to anyone that is considering it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>and it is still looking great!</li>
            <li>ever\\&quot; or \\&quot;best thing</li>
            <li>I used to have beautiful hair, now I have brillo pad hair!</li>
            <li>I thought this would be perfect....</li>
            <li>I was really impressed.  </li>
            <li>Awesome.  </li>
            <li>I have been getting them done for 3 years with perfect results.  </li>
            <li>:D</li>
            <li>I figured for 10 dollars it might not be the best, but might help with some frizz</li>
            <li>and I am still very happy with the end results.  </li>
            <li>I was extremely impressed.  </li>
            <li>my hair is great!!!  </li>
            <li>And that.. to this day.. stands as the best hair day of my life.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not meant to be perfect replacement to the pricier products they mimic.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not meant to be perfect replacement to the pricier products they mimic.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE IT !!!!!</li>
            <li>She ran over to her best friend &#x27;s house and her friend, and her mom, wanted to know what miracle occurred.  </li>
            <li>Thank you Suave for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li>I tried my best to put a hat on and went to my salon.</li>
            <li>I should have been the perfect candidate for this.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say, am very happy with their response and concern for what happened.  </li>
            <li>It looks like the commercials of beautiful hair on tv models!  </li>
            <li>was very happy about the results.</li>
            <li>Followed instructions perfectly and usage resulted in hair loss and breakage.</li>
            <li>Wish you all the best of luck with the product.[[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]]</li>
            <li>chickening out, but I wish others the best of luck!</li>
            <li>The description of this product is misleading at best!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Before she could use the product, we all read the reviews and decided a sample section of hair would be the best things to do.</li>
            <li>Best of luck with your salon visit.</li>
            <li>My best friends wedding is in a month</li>
            <li>I wish all of you that is living this nightmare the best of luck.</li>
            <li>After the claims I saw on the commercials I thought this seemed like the perfect product for me</li>
            <li>I  followed the instructions perfect</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions perfectly, and now my hair is stringy in some sections and breaking in others.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m trying to style it the best I can</li>
            <li>I know better than to buy store products like this, any treatment, including color should be done at the salon!!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Please do not risk your lovely hair for this!!!</li>
            <li>The results were VERY good</li>
            <li>My hair was in very good health when i applied this product, I now have frizzy hair and burned ends.</li>
            <li>so I have always taken very good care of my hair using the highest quality of product out.</li>
            <li>so I was an ideal candidate for this product</li>
            <li>I thought that I had the ideal hair for this product.</li>
            <li>Good luck to you all!</li>
            <li>good luck!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe I will use this product again, just because I believe it wasn&#x27;t so good for my hair, but for a $10 suave product I was fairly impressed.</li>
            <li>beautiful lady&#x27;s ???</li>
            <li>I decided to use this product to straighten my hair and make it beautiful and shiny</li>
            <li>Her hair was sleek and beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have, I should say HAD, beautiful shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe their intentions were to sabotage all womens beautiful hair or something.</li>
            <li>Nioxin hair re-growth system, Phyto, and Rene Furterer are all great products to help strengthen and regrow hair.  </li>
            <li>Before I begin, I would like to say that my hair is my pride and joy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Embrace your hair as is, wear your curls and waves proudly.</li>
            <li>My hair feels great</li>
            <li>This product worked great.</li>
            <li>am really happy that I found Suave and no longer have to spend $250 at the salon.</li>
            <li>(Attractive, eh?)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great value for the price.</li>
            <li>I think it is a great alternative.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy I gave this a try.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Also I am happy with the lighter color</li>
            <li>If your hair cannot handle a perm, then this is not going to be happy ending for you.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am so happy I read these.</li>
            <li>I have to say that it is great.  </li>
            <li>and I wanted my hair to look great.  </li>
            <li>and it still worked great.</li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;m happy with what this Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion</li>
            <li>Therefore, I&#x27;m happy with what this Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion</li>
            <li>My wife used it and says it worked great for her.</li>
            <li>But in all honesty, it worked great for my wife, and she did not face this problem.</li>
            <li>Why they didn&#x27;t just offer a great smoothing conditioning treatment is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this is a great product  keeps my curly hair manageable .</li>
            <li>just a great product all around ..</li>
            <li>The reviews I remember run the gamut from works great to my hair fell out, and the product seems to have been pulled from shelves</li>
            <li>Well not any more!!  </li>
            <li>their hair, mitigate the damage, tips on when to shampoo, what to use (i.e. using a sulfate free shampoo!!!)</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>I used this product and absolutely LOVE it!!</li>
            <li>The breakage is what haunts me most, I look like tweety bird!!</li>
            <li>it looks amazing!</li>
            <li>Now I have relatively healthy hair, not the best though.</li>
            <li>I bet they wouldn&#x27;t even test this on their own families!  </li>
            <li>My hair was real healthy, I just had a dusting done...</li>
            <li>You can visualize just how nice THAT looks!</li>
            <li>When I wash it, it dries very quickly and with great style!!</li>
            <li>You will look amazing and your hair will be healthy and best of all not falling out.</li>
            <li>Find a good hair stylist to get you through this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I take immensely good care of it and spend hundreds of dollars a year on products.</li>
            <li>I figured since it was sold on the shelf, it must&#x27;ve have lots of good results, etc.</li>
            <li>I had an Keratin treatement done at an Aveda salon in January and loved it.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews where people said they loved this product.</li>
            <li>Please don&#x27;t buy this, go to a salon and buy a good conditioning mask or one of their products.</li>
            <li>I told them they should have to pay for my hair cut and GOOD product to repair my hair, but they disagreed.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I ruined my perfectly good hair with something like this.  </li>
            <li>No balding, no rubbery ends, just a good result...</li>
            <li>Good luck to all of you.  </li>
            <li>I am not against spending money for my hair to look good</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian and thought it would be a good idea to straighten/relax my hair with a product made for African-American hair....</li>
            <li>Good luck to you all.  </li>
            <li>I felt I was a good prospect for the product.</li>
            <li>and I put in a good leave in every day.</li>
            <li>Good luck to everyone who fell for the AD.</li>
            <li>Is it as good as a salon keratin treatment?</li>
            <li>The salons there are really good at those techniques.</li>
            <li>This product is so good</li>
            <li>My hair is strait and looks good.</li>
            <li>My hair WAS is in good condition.  </li>
            <li>Suave&#x27;s a brand I trust for shampoo, conditioner, and styling products, and I&#x27;ve heard good things about the salon keratin treatments, and this kit seems like a good matchup between the two.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would be a good thing for my hair</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>My hair is crimped, but not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>this product lightened my hair not in a good way).  </li>
            <li>but nothing gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>There was just nothing good that came out of my using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>women, beautiful hair is very important....</li>
            <li>I also lost a good amount of hair, and my hair was very healthy before this treatment.</li>
            <li>After reading the box and seeing the advertisements, I thought this was going to be something healthy and great for my hair.</li>
            <li>As a licensed Cosmetologist, I have found many people are using this, even on \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair, have followed the instructions and have experienced , loss of hair, skin burns and chemical burns on hairline, as well as the hair</li>
            <li>I had very healthy hair.  </li>
            <li>Exorbitantly pricey, my hair came out of that looking incredibly fab, feeling fantastic, and I was able to maintain the great style my hair sylist had accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair feels great; it lays well with its layers, and so I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels great; it lays well with its layers, and so I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>this product does not seem very safe.</li>
            <li>You have probably saved many others from the nightmares you have experienced.</li>
            <li>yet is generally very healthy.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>And hope you have the same amazing results I did!! :D</li>
            <li>I wish the best for anyone who is wanting to try this product and please be smart about it!</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Pretty awesome home Suave Keratin kit.</li>
            <li>Suave should not market this as a smoothing treatment either, I have used many kinds and this is not one!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I scoured the internet for answers and discovered that this product has ruined the hair of many others as well!  </li>
            <li>When I first finished the treatment (which I did perfectly by the directions)</li>
            <li>she knew better!</li>
            <li>MORE THEN TIME STATED ON BOX!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>If I had more spare time, I would be buying this product twice a year and do it 4 times each year myself just because it gives amazing, professional-looking, and salon-like results!</li>
            <li>JUST MAKE SURE TO READ THE WARNING FOR THIS PRODUCT AND TAKE THE TEST TO SEE IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE!</li>
            <li>, I think the first problem is the wording it should be called a relaxer or a straightener not a smoother!!!!</li>
            <li>But this stuff is amazing and so afordable.  </li>
            <li>The difference is so amazing.</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain to rinse my hair not once but 3 times through the process.</li>
            <li>I applied it based on the instructions and am thrilled with the outcome.  </li>
            <li>I actually liked my hair before, It was wavy but was hoping to get rid of some frizz.</li>
            <li>I liked my curls, I just wanted them to be smoother and not so frizzy.</li>
            <li>All we wanted to do was to look nice.  </li>
            <li>Again, thank you for your candid reviews.  </li>
            <li>Even though I really liked this product, I should not have used it.  </li>
            <li>I have to be honest.</li>
            <li>I had gone online and taken the quiz honestly and saw the product on sale</li>
            <li>I saw the product and thought it would be nice for me to treat my hair and give it a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>I own every product from the keratin line EXCEPT the 30 min boxed treatment set.</li>
            <li>People at zumba class today commented on how nice my hair looked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If nothing else, they are amusing.    </li>
            <li>If you are trying to save money doing your own smoothing treatment instead of spending $200+ at a salon, this product is not the answer.  </li>
            <li>and since I was laid off of work I wanted hair to look nice for interviews but also needed to save money and compared to a salon smoothing treatment of $200</li>
            <li>I wish I&#x27;d looked at these reviews before I bought this product; however I had good hopes since I&#x27;m generally satisfied with Suave&#x27;s products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>had I had a salon keratin treatment, but I didn&#x27;t expect those kind of results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this formula stacks up against the kind they use in salons, but I do know how my skills and techniques stack up against a hairdresser in a salon-</li>
            <li>had I had a salon keratin treatment, but I didn&#x27;t expect those kind of results.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this formula stacks up against the kind they use in salons, but I do know how my skills and techniques stack up against a hairdresser in a salon-</li>
            <li>I also knew not to use any kind of hair bows or hair ties or put my hair up in a ponytail, as this would put a crease in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Her advice: leave this kind of conditioning to the professionals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this a three star review because I can not make an honest determination about ths product.  </li>
            <li>this was the better option and they made it sound so wonderful and look so easy on the ads on TV.  </li>
            <li>be sure to give the age, gender, and ethnicity of the person who had the reaction, says FDA scientist Wendy Good, Ph.D. Good, who analyzes reports about problems with cosmetics, says that information is important because it can help scientists spot trends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My top rated hair dresser (who even has done celebrities hair) looked at the package and ingredients  and told me that he couldn&#x27;t believe this was packaged to where this was something good to make hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>Luckily I had some great argan oil that helped alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does have a very strong smell like a perm.</li>
            <li>Well the steps are very easy , just follow directions and continue.</li>
            <li>Product, though smelly, was very easy to put on.  </li>
            <li>the stuff is very strong smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and there is a very strong chance that Unilever will deny the extent of damage</li>
            <li>From the advertising, I thought it would be good thing--moisturizing and smoothing--but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print to see that it was basically a perm.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and gorgeous.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap way to do a good treatment on your hair.</li>
            <li>Since its safe to get the Keratin treatment I received every 30 days, I thought this would be a nice transition or pick-me-up from my salon treatment.  </li>
            <li>have very fine, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>A REAL KERATIN treatment (of good quality, like the Copola keratin treatment, which is the one my stylist uses) doesn&#x27;t need to be done in a well ventalated area because you aren&#x27;t putting anything harmful on your hair and it smells really good.</li>
            <li>It did straighten my hair and it was actually kind of nice and smooth for two days.  </li>
            <li>ANd the rest of my hair is not even very smooth</li>
            <li>If the product works for you then great but please go into this knowing it is a chemical relaxer and by the way the part of the treatment with keratin also has large amounts of peroxide.</li>
            <li>followed the instructions very precisely, and used a stopwatch at each interval to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave the products in for more than the recommended time.  </li>
            <li>But I have never color treated my hair or permed and my hair is really healthy.</li>
            <li>and after I did so my hair looked so shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li>this has helped someone :)</li>
            <li>But I love my curls, they tend to frizz and cling to my head.</li>
            <li>I have had several Keratin treatments and they work wonderful!!  </li>
            <li>I was in love with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li>This product promised smoother hair with more defined.</li>
            <li>When I read the packaging I was okay to go as none of the \\&quot;do not use\\&quot; applied to me.</li>
            <li>The rest was a leap of faith and I am glad I did it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not at all satisfied, and will be calling the 800 number before I go to work tomorrow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so many pour reviews, haven&#x27;t read anything suave</li>
            <li>Leave cream on for 15 min, if no inflammation treatment is safe.</li>
            <li>They teach students to do this service safely and correctly.</li>
            <li>I tried to straighten it with my iron and felt I was doing even more damage</li>
            <li>(Although that is how most of us find our we&#x27;re allergic to things like, say, antibiotics or bees.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>As with most of you  this product damaged my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is not 100% but much much better.  </li>
            <li>, perms don&#x27;t make your hair better as were the claims advertised by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably rinsed for more than 5 minutes after the Step 1 process.  </li>
            <li>Ok, deal with it.  </li>
            <li>It worked safely for me.</li>
            <li>After researching keratin treatments more online</li>
            <li>I have some of the best deep conditioners on the market and nothing is working.  </li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about two weeks into the product and am still finding a dramatically shortened blow dry/flat iron time - I would love it</li>
            <li>If I figure out how to get rid of this smell without risking ruining my hair (more) I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li>So glad my gamble worked out.</li>
            <li>I had curly frizzy healthy hair before using this product.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a better person than I am.  </li>
            <li>I have dyed, cut, curled, braided, weaved, and extended my hair in many dubious and regretful ways.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many, \\&quot;what was</li>
            <li>If she had, she would have had bald spots on top.</li>
            <li>My hair is healthy, wavy, color treated, but NOT bleached; and had been colored 4 weeks when I did the strand test.</li>
            <li>Being made by Suave makes it seem more \\&quot;safe\\&quot;</li>
            <li>My suggestion embrace your curls, love them.</li>
            <li>I was searching online for a antidote to this treatment, some sort of magic reversal.</li>
            <li>Okay</li>
            <li>, everything went okay, so I proceeded.</li>
            <li>well it WAS healthy.</li>
            <li>I thought it was OK for an at home treatment.</li>
            <li>Trust me, and DO NOT try it, even if your hair is healthy.</li>
            <li>and I am so embarrassed I have to wear it in a bun to avoid answering more questions</li>
            <li>I have coarse,frizzy hair and this made it much more manageable.</li>
            <li>It did nothing but make my hair look better.</li>
            <li>My hair was healthy except for the flyaways and lack of body.</li>
            <li>However I&#x27;m sure with all the combing of the product through my hair during step 1</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>Way better to err on the side of caution.  </li>
            <li>Shame on you SUAVE for damaging the hair of so many women.  </li>
            <li>Therefore, I am glad I did not read the reviews, because I had no problems at all with this product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my hair looks so much better.  </li>
            <li>On top of that I am gray and color my hair as well which makes it even dryer..  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been better.</li>
            <li>I love playing with my hair</li>
            <li>2 thumbs up!:)</li>
            <li>I love it ,</li>
            <li>but they are more tamed.</li>
            <li>i believe it will help my frizz even more.</li>
            <li>Please read all waring on side of the box because there are many cons</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li>I have an appointment to cut most of my hair off.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE my hair after using this.</li>
            <li>, I will have a better idea of the longetivity of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>gave it four stars because my hair was still a bit frizzy although it was much better after blow drying than before I used the product.</li>
            <li>and I have to have one more of each</li>
            <li>It was mostly out</li>
            <li>My fiancée assured me it will be okay.</li>
            <li>ALL the hair around the top of my head, around my face and under was breaking, falling out, and felt like. . .  </li>
            <li>When I showed my house mate (a woman who has colored her hair many times)</li>
            <li>I grow it out to donate to locks of love.</li>
            <li>Like the 3million lawsuit with Nutella the lady said the company claimed it was healthy...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am glad I did not go sit somewhere to wait out the 20 minutes because I would&#x27;ve had a bald head.</li>
            <li>I tried this product because so many salon clients were asking about it.  </li>
            <li>will make it look okay.</li>
            <li>I was pleased.</li>
            <li>but I always have to pay more than $10</li>
            <li>so I was thinking sure why not try it..</li>
            <li>you are better off straighening it</li>
            <li>hair came out smooth!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more involved process than just an at-home hair-coloring treatmnet.</li>
            <li>and I thought, huh I would love to have nice smooth shiny hair</li>
            <li>When I loaned it to a friend with wavy hair it worked better for her.</li>
            <li>had used Suave products for most of my life</li>
            <li>, I urge to visit this Facebook page (see link below) for more stories and information.  </li>
            <li>You can also learn more</li>
            <li>Again, it&#x27;s excellent resource and people are posting daily.    </li>
            <li>To sincerely express empathy and sympathy, to</li>
            <li>there are many.</li>
            <li>As others have pointed out, it&#x27;s more of a home permanent than a 30-day \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; kit.  </li>
            <li>my hair was way more manageable in the morning</li>
            <li>I had to trim my ends to see if that would make it better.  </li>
            <li>so I would advise making sure you have a record of it.</li>
            <li>She had to have awlful layers added to the top of her hair</li>
            <li>I bemoaned the fact that I wasn&#x27;t able to do some work on my laptop while straightening my hair, which I can do when I go to the salon to have it done.</li>
            <li>so I assumed it was safe for me to use.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to take a team of experts to get my hair in shape again.</li>
            <li>except reimburse me for the product and send me some free samples which doesn&#x27;t help me because I have to CUT ALL MY HAIR OFF NOW!).</li>
            <li>so it sounded okay.  </li>
            <li>It felt and looked better after one use so that increased my expectation for this product.</li>
            <li>I had healthy hair before using this.</li>
            <li>like it says, also I wish I could do it again before 3 months but (after reading everyone&#x27;s horror stories) I will make sure to wait 3 months just to be safe.</li>
            <li>The hair that did not fall out have lost all shine and are way more frizzy than when I started.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>in all I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I went in to my hairdresser and she put many of their conditioners in my hair hoping she could save it.</li>
            <li>As for me, I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the product burns if it gets on your scalp.</li>
            <li>I thought this might be interesting.  </li>
            <li>While this product seems to have made my hair a bit more relaxed, it is not something I would use again.  </li>
            <li>My hair is falling out on top of everything.</li>
            <li>Since none of the warnings applied to me, I thought the product would be okay for my hair.  </li>
            <li>May everyone get well and back to health soon, my best wishes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why so many are having problems.</li>
            <li>Keratin would make my hair so healthy...</li>
            <li>again washed 4 more times.  </li>
            <li>Had 3 inches cut off, a Malibu(gently clarifies hair of most residue),a conditioning treatment and</li>
            <li>I am more focused on the headache and scalp pain</li>
            <li>so it broke a bit on top</li>
            <li>Step 1 is the most important!</li>
            <li>Self, Your hair is healthy and you won&#x27;t have those problems.....</li>
            <li>It could not be flat-ironed, blow-dried smooth, or even combed!</li>
            <li>I like many others writing a review for this product</li>
            <li>Pick something else with a better rating or just spring for an in salon treatment.</li>
            <li>I tried the Keratin Infusion 30 day Smoothing Kit and have to say I was pleasantly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I just used this product, thinking Keratin good for my hair, right?</li>
            <li>For the price you pay for the kit, I&#x27;d recommend a really good flat iron and a great oil pre-conditioner, like CHI&#x27;s Silk Infusion</li>
            <li>BE AWARE!!!</li>
            <li>I was very excited about the product</li>
            <li>When I requested this as part of the Amazon Vine Program, I was VERY excited.</li>
            <li>I went straight for Step 2; and saturated my hair with that much more pleasant smelling cream.  </li>
            <li>I went straight for Step 2; and saturated my hair with that much more pleasant smelling cream.  </li>
            <li>and I have to say I got a pretty good result.</li>
            <li>But you can get good results from it; if you&#x27;re aware of what&#x27;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But you can get good results from it; if you&#x27;re aware of what&#x27;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used this product on my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and it came out beautiful.  </li>
            <li>hair was so much alive and beautiful before.</li>
            <li>results were pretty good.</li>
            <li>It drys beautifully and silky soft, all by itself!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was excited!  </li>
            <li>My hair became more easy to manage, you could comb through it without any problem and that is never happens.</li>
            <li>I should have known better as soon as I smelled the strong chemical smell of the product.</li>
            <li>For me, it wasn&#x27;t an easy process for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;First, the product smells SOOO</li>
            <li>but my hair was one of my better assets and thought this product would help even more making it smooth and shinier.  </li>
            <li>Also, I felt more comfortable using this product because every time I get my hair cut my stylist is always raving about how healthy my hair is, which the packaging says not to use this if you have damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>I wish I could take a magic wand and bring back the beautiful hair that many have lost in this process.  </li>
            <li>On top of the leave in conditioner they prodvide in the kit, I also had to use an oil serum to smooth my hair out.</li>
            <li>and it was becoming elastic(like</li>
            <li>I just got back from getting my hair cut where my stylist said my hair felt incredible and was so shiny.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Within seconds after putting the product into my hair, I noticed my hair shriveling up and becoming &#x27;gummy&#x27;</li>
            <li>I am glad I did use it because my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>I have had professional Keratin treatment and thought it was great</li>
            <li>- I washed my hair today and used the Keratin shampoo and conditioner and my hair looks longer as the curls are more manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li>My wavy hair is smooth, more manageable and easier to style.</li>
            <li>Your detailed reviews have helped many others like myself, NOT want to try this treatment anymore.  </li>
            <li>So far it looks great, I&#x27;m waiting to wash it out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>I took the test online to make sure that my hair was eligible for this product and fortunately it was.</li>
            <li>Now, at 31 days post-use (which, if you&#x27;ll notice is more than the kit promises), I have smooth hair with the body</li>
            <li>The rest of my hair is ok and frizz free</li>
            <li>I have not been able to secure the product in stores or online so that in the hope I could get a box with directions.  </li>
            <li>I really understand the stress of not having good, well managed hair.</li>
            <li>Keratin is good for your hair, and so in theory there&#x27;s no way you can really damage it using Keratin.</li>
            <li>And there is good reason for the cost, not to mention why real keratin smoothing/straightening processes are done by *professionals* in salons...    </li>
            <li>and I doubt there is really anyone whose hair is in as good as condition as it was before they used this.</li>
            <li>I thought i was gonna go to school with nice fresh looking hair</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, all she really got was what a great beautician can get from her hair with a good straight blow out and great flat iron.</li>
            <li>I am about to take a vacation to the Caribbean awarded by my company for the top 100 in the company, so I was excited to use this product to eliminate the frizz from the humidity.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done many different processes and honestly I was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>As I rinsed out the product there was a significant amount of hair in the drain, more than ever.</li>
            <li>a full out PERM!</li>
            <li>By the end of it my hair was more frizzy than it was originally and my hair</li>
            <li>My hair curls easily and frizzed in humidity.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li>My hair tends to frizz easily as well.  </li>
            <li>This is definately not a product that can be reversed easily.  </li>
            <li>It has helped many in seeing what kind of product this really is-</li>
            <li>i used this product because i knew people who had really damaged hair who used the product and their hair came out amazing, so i figured why not, my hair is really healthy.</li>
            <li>It made it so easy to do my hair.</li>
            <li>There is a very bold hair cut in my future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...</li>
            <li>The smell of Cream 1 is so overwhelmingly strong that it lasted in my bathroom for almost 2 days (with windows opened).  </li>
            <li>, I strongly suggest you do.  </li>
            <li>I strongly suggest you stay away from it if your hair is highlighted or lifted - which is stated in the directions.</li>
            <li>This is to strong to be sold in stores.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so strong</li>
            <li>On the flip side the Suave Keratin Conditioner for colored hair is spectacular (which is why I got suckered into doing this in the first place).  </li>
            <li>she spends her time, being beautiful and as i speak this commercial</li>
            <li>I have used keratinique last year, which was much more money, but an excellent product, very time consuming though.  </li>
            <li>and I also didn&#x27;t leave it in the full 15 minutes but rinsed after 12 just to make sure it didn&#x27;t go overkill</li>
            <li>and it seemed fine.  </li>
            <li>My hair was fine before I used this</li>
            <li>I figured it would be fine.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair but alot of it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re still willing to take the risk, than be sure that you&#x27;re also willing to sport a bob or a pixie cut this summer, able to creatively cover up bald patches, or can afford to pay the hundreds of dollars to a correction specialist/stylist at a reputable salon.    </li>
            <li>I have fine hair but a lot of it, hair was almost to my waist</li>
            <li>I have found reviewers that say the product did fine with them.</li>
            <li>I tried the strand test and everything appeared to work just fine</li>
            <li>I am lucky that I can wear a hat to work because my hair won&#x27;t do anything!  </li>
            <li>, I trusted that a product on the shelf was safe and mild.</li>
            <li>I read the fine print, followed the directions and thought that I would have \\&quot;smooth and silky hair\\</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s little to no wonder that it worked great!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the final results, but still have to work at smoothing my hair with a  large curling iron.</li>
            <li>HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li>It fit the criteria mentioned on the box.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would make it easier to have the smooth look.</li>
            <li>I had to straighten it lightly</li>
            <li>and I did with curl free as well</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and lustrous again after two uses.</li>
            <li>I go sulfate free, etc.</li>
            <li>Also, my hair was not shiney or smooth.</li>
            <li>I dread seeing my hair if it is supposed to be smooth now.</li>
            <li>I too read the product as \\&quot;it will smooth out and make your cuticle lay flat\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It was such a great deal that I bought about 10 kits.</li>
            <li>I should have known by the smell and all the warnings, but I had a free afternoon and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Suaves keratin shampoo and conditioner along with the leave-in conditioner is fantastic for control.</li>
            <li>I bought this hoping it would help smooth my hair  </li>
            <li>This product should not be available at drug store/</li>
            <li>The roots of my hair are smooth</li>
            <li>I thought this product was to smooth and get rid of frizzy hair</li>
            <li>From now on I will use the sulfate free Keratin products and see what happens after the infusion kit wears off.  </li>
            <li>I follow the steps to the T. After washing out the product, her hair was smooth n manageable.  </li>
            <li>But to my surprise my hair remained sleek, smooth and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product worked fantastic and even if I don&#x27;t use my hair straightener</li>
            <li>No issue really, was actually nice.</li>
            <li>I had been growing it out for quite some time and was actually quite proud of it.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe it is still available.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely, and none of the precautions applied to me..</li>
            <li>hair fit all the direction&#x27;s condition, in that it hadn&#x27;t had a perm for months, no coloring for years.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use a curling iron on it to smooth it out, but that may have made my hair frizzier as time went</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT*</li>
            <li>I wish I could give more info, but just don&#x27;t feel it is worth a gamble at this time.</li>
            <li>I am going to end up with a very short cut eventually, which does not make me happy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still wavy, it didn&#x27;t smooth it at all.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions precisely.  </li>
            <li>I bought this based on the ad that stated that it had as good of results as a professional keratin treatment...</li>
            <li>My hair is generally healthy and I get a lot of compliments on it, now I&#x27;m getting recommendations to hair salons and short hair styles that will look good on me.</li>
            <li>Seeing your long, once beautiful hair fall out in the shower is heartbreaking.  </li>
            <li>I tried this product 5 days ago, and thus far am delighted with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I headed straight for the shower to rinse out the solution and encountered the loss of more and more hair continuing to come out in clumps in the shower.</li>
            <li>but then again i didnt expect something that supposed to be good for you to completely ruin my hair.</li>
            <li>I now have to cut my long beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>Every time I comb my hair the comb is full of hair, like FULL of hair!</li>
            <li>I made sure that I followed the instructions regarding whether the product was right for me.  </li>
            <li>but I really appreciate the warnings!!!   </li>
            <li>it really needs to be pulled asap!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very glad that I did not have my hair fall out like other reviewers experienced, but I still did not have a positive result.</li>
            <li>I used the flat iron, and it did look great for two days.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to have silky smooth hair.</li>
            <li>This is also very important for a first time with a product...</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like a perm, and I&#x27;m sure if you curled your hair while doing the treatment, you&#x27;d have curly hair.</li>
            <li>My advice to anyone interested in this product: DO NOT buy this if you love your hair.</li>
            <li>I bought it in January and was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I just wish it had more consistent results for every one because not I&#x27;m nervous to try it again in three months.</li>
            <li>She is just as excited by her hair as I am by mine.</li>
            <li>well after the first step my hair was messed up, i continued in hope that it would be better once i finish all of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am familiar with keratin treatments as I&#x27;ve had them done before.</li>
            <li>All in all pretty satisfied but may not be for everyone - depends on your hair type and your expectations I guess.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try the product.  </li>
            <li>it is still pretty healthy.  </li>
            <li>all I could do was laugh!  </li>
            <li>To learn more about what exactly you would be putting in your hair, visit the FB page for a comprehensive list of chemicals.    </li>
            <li>and I had better results with this $12 kit than the $35 hot oil treatment at my salon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll have to buy a wig.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product until I read the reviews.</li>
            <li>and I was excited for the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So when I heard about the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit, I got excited.  </li>
            <li>However, the damage it does to your hair isn&#x27;t worth any amount of money!</li>
            <li>I also remember being told that virgin hair does not usually respond as well to keratin treatments because chemically treated hair is more porous and absorbs the keratin better.  </li>
            <li>What I saw on the commercial and on the box, it seemed like a good fit.</li>
            <li>2- Relaxers have to be applied methodically and cleanly with a tint brush about 1/2 an inch away from the scalp, leaving the ends out till the end.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve come clean about the treatment, but I guess I worry about what those salon girls will say when you tell them you did an at-home treatment</li>
            <li>I chose to try this product simply for the convenience of it - the idea of being able to do a smoothing treatment in my home, on my own schedule, was preferable to making an appointment at the salon.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt better :) and my old perm is now straight(yayyyy).</li>
            <li>I usually flat iron my hair about every day very lightly as my hair is naturally very straight, but I didn&#x27;t need to do so this time surprisingly.</li>
            <li>I have had several salon keratin treatments over the past couple of years and the results were wonderful - shiny, sleek, gorgeous hair.  </li>
            <li>Phyto and Rene Furterer carry  vitamins (with biotin) that will most certainly promote growth.  </li>
            <li>Once the stylist rinsed it out, she could tell that I had lost a large amount of hair and when she tried, she was not be able to brush, comb or finger comb it either.</li>
            <li>She did use a special shampoo and it did help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Within seconds of applying the product to my hair, it literally melted right before my eyes!  </li>
            <li>Had I read the reviews first, I would not have been brave enough to try this product.  </li>
            <li>Hi I have damaged my hair so many times therefor I am really leary about what I use on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a safe bet to say that anything with the words \\&quot;Smoothing\\&quot; in it or promising long-term results is going to be hardcore.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be fun to have smooth hair like in the commercials, for a change.  </li>
            <li>They sent me a check for $12 to refund my purchase and then sent me coupons for $30 worth of free Nexus stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair is not permed, color treated, or red, so I was hoping to have a good outcome.</li>
            <li>I did lose a comb full of hair</li>
            <li>A person with straight, shiny, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>but I kind of feel like its the old saying...</li>
            <li>If you want a true Brazilian treatment or a Chi relaxer treatment done, call your stylist and pay the $100</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s straight, shiny and looks a 100 times better than it did before.</li>
            <li>When I saw the Suave Keratine commercial, I have to admit that my hopes were up thinking that maybe this is a product that if marketed and tested had to be good.  </li>
            <li>wanted to wait until the full 30 days were up before I wrote a review.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Suave Keratin Infusion Smoothing kit after I saw a commercial and loved the girls hair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really remember how many minutes it took me to put step 1 in my hair</li>
            <li>A good haircut will be next on my list.  </li>
            <li>The cuticle sealer smelled better and the amount given is very generous.</li>
            <li>This product surprisingly does not even mention proper ventilation.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to relax my hair just make it in better condition not worse</li>
            <li>When I did this it worked better, but I still feel like my hair had too much product in it.</li>
            <li>- the chances of producing true keratin treatment results are slim.    </li>
            <li>Clearly this is a \\&quot;use it at your own risk\\&quot; sort of product.  </li>
            <li>As many others have said I really wished I would have read these reviews before trying this product.</li>
            <li>but I have a whole layer on the top of my head</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it lasts the full thirty days as I just did all of this tonight</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it lasts the full 30 days</li>
            <li>Throw this product away, it was a nightmare come true for me today.  </li>
            <li>I get it trimmed religiously and use really good products on it.  </li>
            <li>My hair was the only thing i loved about my look, and its gone.</li>
            <li>I have always had medium length hair, because I don&#x27;t look good with short hair.  </li>
            <li>Smooth,shiny, and light, and, healthy, and new, and I felt like my hair was born.</li>
            <li>It may sound easy but anything that requires putting chemical in ur haor and using hot tools right after shpuld be done by someone licensed.</li>
            <li>full well, that I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones.  </li>
            <li>Using the kit itself is pretty easy-</li>
            <li>so I can have straight hair for a whole year, maybe more!  </li>
            <li>&quot; I would suggest this product, but you CAN&#x27;T use it if you have used high-lift color or your hair is damaged or breaking, so read the box!My hair felt kind of \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; when I was styling it, but once it was dry it felt very silky and nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but thought those wanting to try a straightening kit for the first time might be interested to know about this kit.  </li>
            <li>(Luckily it wasn&#x27;t all of my bangs.)</li>
            <li>Luckily mine wasn&#x27;t to the roots</li>
            <li>but I feel like I got lucky.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t super over powering.  </li>
            <li>I was just lucky that my hair didn&#x27;t break off.  </li>
            <li>again I feel I just got lucky</li>
            <li>I may not be so lucky if I use it again.  </li>
            <li>My hair is continuing to be straight over 3 weeks later, which is great - and we have been having a lot of rain and humidity.</li>
            <li>but I was expecting nice, smooth hair that would last \\&quot;30</li>
            <li>i quickly rinsed it off of my head and came to read the reviews.  </li>
            <li>Her hair is more healthier and vibrant, and not tangled.</li>
            <li>I am lucky I have a lot of hair</li>
            <li>The top and main ingredient is ammonium thioglycolate.  </li>
            <li>Keratin treatments leave your hair soft and smooth and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>We had a healthy dose of high humidity for 3 days and you could tell the hair was trying to frizz up again.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised though because this is the first time i used any kind of product.</li>
            <li>It feels healthy and normal.</li>
            <li>In the am I woke up to hair that was way more flatten than my normal chaotic hair in the mornings...</li>
            <li>I have contacted and lawyer that is very interested in taking my case and will be meeting with him soon.</li>
            <li>I thought that maybe when I was able to wash it and use all of my mega conditioners and styling products that my hair would look normal.  </li>
            <li>I used the product as directed, and my hair is pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li>So if you like very straight silky hair this is the product!</li>
            <li>It may give you good results, but in the long run, it will damage your hair and your health.  </li>
            <li>The warnings on the box probably would have made me think twice about using it, but I LOVE reading hair product reviews before I try something new.</li>
            <li>I am happy with the results - just wish they could find a way to make it a bit less damaging.</li>
            <li>THANKS SUAVE!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>I applied the product as instructed and within the first 5 minutes, after the product was applied, I was combing through my hair while it was processing, and clumps of hair started to come out of my head, and my hair started to shrivel up like someone lit it on fire!</li>
            <li>For a quick fix I ended up spending hundreds of dollars and completely lost my confidence with the loss of my long, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, the cuticle seal cream and the heat defense leave-in conditioner both have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thankfully I found a very good Keratin Rx treatment that helped bring my hair back to some normalcy but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and continued with the sealing cream thinking it would calm it.</li>
            <li>I used the third step of the kit and my hair looks amazing</li>
            <li>Since I had success with that at home relaxer</li>
            <li>My vanity got the best of me and I was tired of having frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li>Thank you to everyone that has posted their own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li>Busy days, I can pony it and on evenings out, the curls were cute.</li>
            <li>I used my own big comb.</li>
            <li>I honestly thought that this was like a deep conditioning treatment</li>
            <li>2 hours and $60 worth of treatments, she ended up chopping about 3 inches of hair off the ends of all of my layers, and now it basically looks like I have a mullet.  </li>
            <li>The waves actually looked nice, I thought.  </li>
            <li>fortunate in that my hair can handle more than a bit of abuse, I just don&#x27;t abuse it regularly.  </li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>The results the second time were not as effective and seemed to not take.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had a real Keratin treatment in a salon 6 weeks prior and loved the result.  </li>
            <li>The chemical mixture is nothing more than an old school</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, so I was able to use the smoothing cream (#1 bottle) and cuticle seal cream (#2 bottle) 2 times, which means I got hair that looked professionally straightened hair for 2 months.  </li>
            <li>On top of all the bald spots she said that my hair was fried at the top of my head and was really worried that the follicles had been damaged and there was a possibility that it would not grow back.</li>
            <li>She sent me home with $80 worth of at home treatment for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>But for a price tag of about $11, I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>A salon can treat color-treated hair and may be worth the $.</li>
            <li>My sister spends hundreds to have hers done professionally, and personally I think mine looks Better!!</li>
            <li>If you purchased this product, it is probably because you&#x27;re like me and want a great product that helps tame frizzy or unruly hair and do what the product advertises.</li>
            <li>My hair was very healthy and now it is so dry and frazzled no amount of oil or serum</li>
            <li>This was my first experience trying something so bold.  </li>
            <li>And to think I thought well maybe it gets rid of the loose hair to help make it smooth and straight only to keep having more and more and more fall out.</li>
            <li>At first I really wasn&#x27;t impressed at all as my hair did not look shiny in the least</li>
            <li>I waited, hoping that other people would have good experiences with it.</li>
            <li>I took the time to flat iron it and it looked nice for the two days that I couldn&#x27;t wash it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s just a matter of finding the right treatment and the right stylist.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;melting\\&quot; right off.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>before you use it on your hair, I went to the Suave site and took the quiz to see if it is right for you hair [...] .</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know who to turn to anymore, i have even tried meds, a massage, acupuncture, exercise, eating right, herbs, all with NO</li>
            <li>I thought it sounded right for me.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just hair right?  </li>
            <li>so I rinsed it out right away.  </li>
            <li>I am right there with you.</li>
            <li>Visit [...] before deciding if the product is right for you...    </li>
            <li>You have to answer a lot of questions to see if it right</li>
            <li>During the treatment i could tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li>it couldnt hurt right?</li>
            <li>just by looking at it are going to MELT right into your hand when you run your fingers through it (see pictures on FB).  </li>
            <li>Just so you know you have the right to sue.</li>
            <li>I AM LIVID AT SUAVE RIGHT NOW.  </li>
            <li>It sounds like this product needs to be taken off the shelves and the right people need to know.</li>
            <li>I should have figured it out right away when I opened the tube</li>
            <li>To those who have had positive results, one word...LUCKY!</li>
            <li>The most important thing to remember is do NOT lose track of time and leave it in too long.  </li>
            <li>, I went to Sally&#x27;s and bought about $70 worth of super strengthening and moisturizing treatments and nothing really works.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this product is going to make your hair look any better if you are lucky enough to still have all of your hair you started with.  </li>
            <li>as I got older and the hairs on the top of my head were a bit more dry and kinked</li>
            <li>Now i have to cut my long hair off and pay a stylist to do some kind of conditioning treatment</li>
            <li>Firstly, I came very close to purchasing and experimenting with this product, because I love trying new products.  </li>
            <li>First of all it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of smoothing, and second and most importantly, it makes you bald.</li>
            <li>so I figured Amazon would be the best because this is where I saw so many bad reviews</li>
            <li>Ulta Salon offers the Kera Straight treatment, while many salons offer the Coppola treatment.  </li>
            <li>and it was still super straight  after a month.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on the 5th month and still loving my straight</li>
            <li>Have to admit, was worried about using this product due to the reviews on here, but since my hair is very healthy I decided to take a chance...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s going to last anywhere near as long as the Salon version; nor do I expect it to come anywhere close to the awesome that is the Coppola Keratin treatments.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s going to last anywhere near as long as the Salon version; nor do I expect it to come anywhere close to the awesome that is the Coppola Keratin treatments.  </li>
            <li>and im sure im not the only one feeling this way right now.</li>
            <li>Based on the name having \\&quot;keratin\\&quot; and \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; in it, I assumed that this was a deep conditioning product that would smooth down my fly aways.  </li>
            <li>not too sure if it&#x27;s because my hair is super frizzy and I have long</li>
            <li>I started to apply, luckily to the underside of my hair first, I noticed some hair collecting in the comb, but didn&#x27;t seem like too much.  </li>
            <li>I had to cut it very very</li>
            <li>and then it was very straight.</li>
            <li>I read the fine print, I realized it was completely inappropriate for a person with my hair</li>
            <li>I feel this is great for us Hispanic people with really unmanageable, frizzy, dry, puffy hair needing a relaxer type product that leaves your hair looking natural and non broom-looking.</li>
            <li>More importantly, the kit is devoid of any neutralizing agent, which is one of its biggest flaws!  </li>
            <li>The hair at my crown (a good number of strands) sticks straight up due to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The straightening cream had a very strong smell that lingered long after I had rinsed the cream out of my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The flyaways that are normally at the top of my hair are smooth and flat now.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The flyaways that are normally at the top of my hair are smooth and flat now.  </li>
            <li>and that is okay as I just wanted it somewhat straight and smooth as ANYTHING is better than my really dry, curly, frizzy, puffy, damaged, short hair</li>
            <li>Seriously how many woman now days have not done some kind of chemical treatment to their hair?</li>
            <li>Even if you have taken the \\&quot;quiz\\&quot; that Suave has provided in order to see if this product is right for you, and the results are positive, it more than likely ISN&#x27;T!  </li>
            <li>, my hair look good the first 2 days, but after the first shower my hair got a little curly and my tips had lots of split ends.</li>
            <li>My hair is very straight, so it didn&#x27;t do much except apparently make it more brittle</li>
            <li>My hair felt amazing even wet.  </li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used this, I went to a dinner and my hair did not kink or tangle despite humid conditions.</li>
            <li>Now two weeks later, my hair looks even better than it did after I first used the treatment.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is AMMONIUM THIOGLYCOLATE which is perm solution..</li>
            <li>When I first ordered this product there were no reviews for it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t check it out first.</li>
            <li>Anyhow I cut about 20 hairs from differents parts of my head and did,the kit on those first.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re weary about using it just do a strands  test first and stay away from your scalp.</li>
            <li>will most likely be using this product again!!!</li>
            <li>I also couldn&#x27;t wash or surf in the ocean for 3 days... and my hair had a waxy feel and a funny smell to it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Thanks Suave!</li>
            <li>I have colored my hair (with good results) for the past 20 years, so I was not afraid to try this product.  </li>
            <li>I am getting my hair cut tomorrow (not planned, but it may be the only way to save it and be able to style it) and I am praying to the hair gods that she can perform a miracle.  </li>
            <li>When you wash you hair after doing a keratin treatment, it feels exactly like you&#x27;ve done NOTHING to your hair.</li>
            <li>If your hair needs smoothing or anti frizz, spend the money on a credible treatment, or look up home remidies, like olive oil, if you can&#x27;t afford a professional.</li>
            <li>Now I will only buy products at a salon and ask them if it&#x27;s safe for my hair.</li>
            <li>Suave Professionals is as potent as regular strength relaxer (NaOH- relaxer)  </li>
            <li>FIRST READ \\&quot;ALL\\&quot; OF THE ONE STAR REVIEWS....</li>
            <li>This product really worked for me!</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly to the tee</li>
            <li>I realized what a dummy I was for doing it in the first place.  </li>
            <li>If I had used the hot iron, it probably would have been straighter and smoother.  </li>
            <li>I now have my first migraine</li>
            <li>I am sure you have saved alot of women from the same pain you have endured.</li>
            <li>There is still about an inch of fried hair at the ends of the top layer of my hair but the stylist didn&#x27;t want to chop that off just yet because it would be ridiculously short and mullet-like.  </li>
            <li>I can barely afford my rent (hence the reason I bought this crummy Suave Keratin Treatment in the first place - thinking it would be a wise alternative to some deep conditioning treatment at a salon.  </li>
            <li>Well, this product undid all of that, and probably made it even more damaged than it was when I was heat styling daily.  </li>
            <li>so my hair was pretty curly.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time and have never had any problems with over the counter hair treatments, hair dyes etc.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s exactly what my hair looks like, like relaxed hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This may be exactly what some people are looking for, but it should be advertised as a straightening treatment, not a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>If you really want to use this product, please do a strand test!</li>
            <li>I hope this smoothness does last the 30 days. :)</li>
            <li>I am Hispanic (Mexican) and I love this SUAVE Keratin Smoothing product as I have used relaxers and they just make my hair look like The Flintstone type hair or like a broom...</li>
            <li>At first I thought it burned my scalp</li>
            <li>I applied it exactly as instructed, 2 weeks ago, and I have no idea what to do</li>
            <li>I am writing this post to say THANK YOU to all those brave women who wrote their negative reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li>I thank God that before making a purchase I read the reviews first.</li>
            <li>This product has left too many women in tears and with feeling a hopelessness...</li>
            <li>Thanks, Suave!</li>
            <li>Well, my hair was never straighter and never felt as soft and smooth after I blew it out.  </li>
            <li>Boy do I wish I read them first because all I thought about was my hair was going to come out</li>
            <li>The entire texture of my hair has changed, it almost feels like there is a coating still on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time today.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to see reviews first....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had Keratin treatments in the past (last time 18 months ago) with excellent results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 4 months since I&#x27;ve colored my hair and overall my hair is really healthy.</li>
            <li>I wish I had read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>Her exact words were \\&quot;It</li>
            <li>should work pretty well</li>
            <li>My hair at the roots is smooth and soft for about an inch</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolute garbage!</li>
            <li>I GOT THIS TO SMOOTH OUT MY HAIR AND MAKE IT SOFT AND SHINY</li>
            <li>Be sure read the responses to her review starting from the newest first (using the sort function).  </li>
            <li>Or perhaps you&#x27;ve seen a scene from a movie -there are many- where a man is in a barber shop yelling and squirming in their seats with that white gunk burning their scalps begging the barber to get it off!)  </li>
            <li>There are also some sympathetic professionals (not affliated w/Unilever) who are following the page, and contributing their opinions and advice.  </li>
            <li>I got so many compliments on my hair especially the month after I used it.</li>
            <li>After I used it, my hair smelled great every day for at least one month.</li>
            <li>After a deep conditioning treatment and having 3 inches cut off I do not look any better.  </li>
            <li>I followed all of the instructions on the box and did exactly what the instructions said to.  </li>
            <li>I figured if it worked for Nicole Richie (because I am sure her hair is bleached blonde and probably coarser)</li>
            <li>i bought this and followed the directions exact.</li>
            <li>It actually burned the top layer of her hair off in a circle around the crown of her head.  </li>
            <li>Did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li>While I was still in the first steps of application, my hair began to literally melt and break off -</li>
            <li>Within the first 4 minutes of the first step being on my head my hair began to fry.</li>
            <li>The instructions state to run the comb through your hair with the first step of the product on it; I could not even get the comb through.</li>
            <li>i tried many different leave in masks</li>
            <li>I used the product like it says, three steps, wash first, rinse between each step</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe some things are better left to the professionals...</li>
            <li>Upon reading the directions and smelling the product it was evident</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li>We applied the product exactly as directed.</li>
            <li>It always worked wonderfully, but was so expensive ($400-$500)</li>
            <li>I made sure to start as close to the roots as possible and go all the way to the ends.  </li>
            <li>like many others my hair is ruined, I fell for the gimmick and since then have been emailing, phone calling with the Unilever Consumer Services, and they are sending me my money back for the product, coupons for products to help my hair-better not be Suave-and will \\&quot;look into reimbursing me for any purchases, trips to the salon\\&quot; in order to correct the damage.</li>
            <li>I did everything exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li>As soon as I opened the first tube, I smelled perm solution.  </li>
            <li>I went and got 3 more inches cut off(6 in total).  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first 48 hours, I washed with the Keratin Infusion shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I switched shampoo and conditioner midway through my first week to an intensive repair product.</li>
            <li>the other hand, I absolutely love the results of my hair!</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what is said it would.  </li>
            <li>but when I applied it to my whole head, tragedy struck!</li>
            <li>What a waste, and good thing</li>
            <li>However, I am lucky in that the damage is minimal compared to what most of you went through.  </li>
            <li>It is so easy to blow out, and its still really straight and extremely soft.  </li>
            <li>but right now my hair is as straight as it has ever been(when straightened by myself).</li>
            <li>My hair felt like it was shaved off right there, very close to my scalp.</li>
            <li>My hair has stayed smooth the whole 30 days, and I don&#x27;t know how much longer it will continue to stay smooth, since its time is up, but I will write a followup on this review later to let you</li>
            <li>(yes, I did assess the status of my hair before using, and based on their stylist recommendations, my hair was fine for this product), left it flat on top with frizzy, fried, split ends (about 4-5 inches worth).  </li>
            <li>If you want your hair straighted or smoothed out - go to a professional, it is worth the money!</li>
            <li>It was fairly brittle for the first few days, but I didn&#x27;t end up with too much breakage.</li>
            <li>However I assure you there are many relaxers and straighteners on the consumer shelves that are exactly the same if not worse.</li>
            <li>would think that the other reviews have to be exaggerating when they say their hair \\&quot;Melted\\&quot; or became \\&quot;Gummy\\&quot;, honestly if this didn&#x27;t happen to me</li>
            <li>I did not have to flat iron my hair, just a blow dry with the provided styling conditioner,which works great.</li>
            <li>To all the other women who state they love the product, I guess your some of the lucky ones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, to make a long story short...DO NOT PUT THIS STUFF ON YOUR HAIR unless you want to look like a mop, and a very cheap mop at that.</li>
            <li>Right after I used the kit my hair did seem pretty dry and damaged - but it sure was straight.</li>
            <li>it pretty much does exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>this product completely fried my hair and now I have to use a special conditioner and cannot do anything to it.</li>
            <li>Better to sacrifice a small portion of hair than risk losing it all.&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago, I had the keratin treatment done to my hair, and it was straight with no blow-drying, shiny, and beautiful compared to the generally frizzy but mostly ok appearance it usually has.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this product because I had heard positive things about keratin.</li>
            <li>I am positive it will be nothing as discribed on the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I saw some review videos and those results were positive.</li>
            <li>and I had really positive results.</li>
            <li>I had hoped that the situation would change for the better after washing my hair &amp; giving it a good conditioner (my hair is more dry than oily) but unfortunately that didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li>The product says my hair would be ok as long as not lightened.</li>
            <li>, my hair is flat, mostly strait, very damaged, and frizzy.</li>
            <li>Pretty much everything it said it would address, instead it caused for my hair.</li>
            <li>The top layer of my hair is about 2 inches long of just whacked offhair...</li>
            <li>Suave pretty much states that unless you have virgin hair don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li>Not to mention that my hair is pretty much platinum now.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and colored but according to the directions safe for me to use.</li>
            <li>last longer)&gt;I&#x27;m fortunate in that my hair can handle more than a bit of abuse, I just don&#x27;t abuse it regularly.  </li>
            <li>But it dries so fast and so straight and shiny!</li>
            <li>However, with the grey hair it is much more course and frizzy now.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to present a review from the other perspective because this did great things for my hair.</li>
            <li>But by the third step, it actually felt more smooth.  </li>
            <li>My hair was still pretty full (I followed directions and combed the hair back to keep the fullness on my crown per the directions) and not flat on top.</li>
            <li>The first step went fine, but as I was washing out the second I noticed my hair coming out as I ran my fingers through it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Summary:  3 out of 5 stars because the [[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]] does indeed smooth the hair but the extreme result and overpowering smell keeps it from being a product I can&#x27;t even like much less love.</li>
            <li>im doing deep conditioning treatments, went to a high end salon to see what could be done, and there is just nothin more than treating,</li>
            <li>It is time consuming and should not be done the day you&#x27;re going to a special occasion where you want to wow everyone with your straight hair.  </li>
            <li>I googled to see if that was normal, saw all these reviews, and washed my hair right away.  </li>
            <li>You must know that I have super naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>After buying the product and doing the first step, I noticed that some hair did come out but not a lot and the dyed color was starting to go from med brown to light blond.  </li>
            <li>tried the Suave keratin treatment and 3 months later my hair is still smooth and straight!</li>
            <li>Started to dry, and it seemed most of my hair survived.  </li>
            <li>I have to first of all say that I&#x27;m very fortunate to not have some of the extreme results others have had ie.</li>
            <li>To the point I got 2 large and handfulls out when combing it.</li>
            <li>I had an accidental moment of smart.  </li>
            <li>I had an accidental moment of smart.  </li>
            <li>do not try this inexpensive new wonder for hair!!</li>
            <li>my hair could air dry pin straight, but I don&#x27;t think there is a product in this world that could make that happen :)</li>
            <li>but this products did just as good for far LESS money.</li>
            <li>I might consider using a professional next time though until I read some more positive reviews.</li>
            <li>slightly reduces wave/curl; makes hair silky soft; retains smoothness and straightness better after flat-ironing; inexpensive  To sum up the cons:  not a magical frizz eraser, must wait 3 months to touch up (or try a more effective straightener!), only marginally reduces wave.  </li>
            <li>After reading the instructions alone it should have thrown up huge red flags but as a consumer do you not read the ingredients in what you eat or put on your body?</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and did dry out some at first.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have much to spare.</li>
            <li>and I like it straight.</li>
            <li>So when I read all the warnings on the package I was really scared and hesitant to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li>, that didn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li>so I put the whole bottle on my hair</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t bring my hair to stick straight, but I didn&#x27;t want that either.</li>
            <li>You are doing what they might call a straight perm...</li>
            <li>My hair is generally straight but it tends to get frizzy and</li>
            <li>when you have a salon do your keratin treatment you do not have to leave your hair straight because it is not a perm.</li>
            <li>and you do not leave your hair straight</li>
            <li>When I was ready to try the treatment the reviews were rolling in</li>
            <li>I thought \\&quot;really, this seems like a nuclear reactor drill\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>stinkyness, just silky smooth hair, and the wait to get in the water is only 2 days.</li>
            <li>You CAN do a keratin treatment to damaged hair because the real keratin treatments correct damage to your hair.</li>
            <li>I am going to check with my stylist to see if a real keratin treatment would be helpful in reversing the damage or if I&#x27;m just going to have to cut my hair off.</li>
            <li>I really wish I would have found the reviews on this product before I used it</li>
            <li>and I really hope they pull this off store shelves.</li>
            <li>The one attempt I made to comb it, a whole bunch if hair came out.</li>
            <li>I think I would have ended up withbald spots if I combed it the whole time.</li>
            <li>I put that much oil in and my hair is STILL thirsty.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who meets the requirements for this product!</li>
            <li>I already had smooth hair, BUT it wasn&#x27;t as shiny as the suave commercial...</li>
            <li>Just straight and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>I am stuck with straight and frizzy until my hair recovers or grows out or something.  </li>
            <li>HAHAHAHAHA...</li>
            <li>so much fell out.</li>
            <li>not what it really does \\&quot;straighten even the tightest curl to board straight and fry the ends\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>If you have any type of curly hair I really recommend you stay away from this product.  </li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>and I know what and how much chemical abuse it can take.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious as to how they were able to help.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for your reviews</li>
            <li>but i am one of those people that complain about having too much hair.</li>
            <li>thanks Unilever.  </li>
            <li>So thanks to YOU, SUAVE, UNILEVER...</li>
            <li>I did not use this product but want to warn everyone of the dangers of a real keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>This product should really be pulled from the shelves.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely feel for you.</li>
            <li>the directions for this  product, and the requirements for what type of hair you should \\&quot;bring to the table\\&quot;  really scared me off.</li>
            <li>My hair became CURLIER at the ends, sticky to the touch, and absolutely embarrassing.</li>
            <li>so I really needed the heat-protection conditioner.</li>
            <li>I have done the real keratin treatment at hair salons, and I can assure you this is NOT a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li>I will trying coloring again since the whole 30 days is up.  </li>
            <li>I will trying coloring again since the whole 30 days is up.  </li>
            <li>I have very wavy, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>She has very curly hair</li>
            <li>Well I did not end up with pin straight hair</li>
            <li>I even recommended it to my friend who have very think wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>But there are places where its really damaged close to an inch from my scalpe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Go straight to step 2 and don&#x27;t risk your coiffure.  </li>
            <li>Go straight to step 2 and don&#x27;t risk your coiffure.  </li>
            <li>THANKS SO MUCH SUAVE.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much ,&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li>It was noticeably straight.  </li>
            <li>I am very upset about the results, and cant even believe this item is on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had blond straight hair about 3 inches below my shoulder.</li>
            <li>It has always been very curly</li>
            <li>it is working very well.</li>
            <li>Five years ago I did a straightening treatment and while it was sort of straight it wasn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and did the whole head. . .  </li>
            <li>I stopped and really looked.</li>
            <li>Also if Suave wants proof, I can send them the hair</li>
            <li>I am finding I do not have to shampoo very often - probably every 5 days or so</li>
            <li>so much for trying to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li>were everyone wants to sue over everything under the sun.</li>
            <li>but also really slimy feeling, in some parts.</li>
            <li>That wasn&#x27;t really what I wanted, but it also says it&#x27;s a \\&quot;30 day\\&quot; kit, which to me means \\&quot;temporary.\\</li>
            <li>It is very embarrassing</li>
            <li>and I got ready to use it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I CANT EVEN EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE USED.</li>
            <li>and I really trusted the brand.  </li>
            <li>It is also very time-consuming.</li>
            <li>The packaging on this product is very misleading.  </li>
            <li>My hair does not grow that fast anymore.  </li>
            <li>I think this is going to really gain momentum</li>
            <li>You will end up spending as much money in order to correct the damage this will do to your hair, if it can even be corrected.  </li>
            <li>This is a very misleading product</li>
            <li>Depending on how you look at it, doing this yourself can save you time and money because you don&#x27;t have to do it professionally, but for me it sort of cost me the same because I realized how much work I am actually able to do in one hour while someone else straightens my hair for me.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>I tried brushing it straight just as the directions said to do</li>
            <li>I went to my beautician that has done hair for over 20 years and she was in as much shock as me.</li>
            <li>I have been taking these vitamins, eating protein and the treatments and be as gentle with  </li>
            <li>I could not even brush through my hair without it hurting so much.</li>
            <li>Your hair is straight.</li>
            <li>I had perfectly straight hair before using this product, but thought it would make it \\&quot;smoother\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The biggest challenge for me with the whole process was finding the 20 minutes wait-time to use this kit, plus the time it takes to blow out and flat-iron, and then not shampooing for a couple days after.  </li>
            <li>I guess I trusted Suave way too much,</li>
            <li>but the smell is just too much.  </li>
            <li>told that this product is really intended for \\&quot;Virgin</li>
            <li>Real Keratin smoothing treatments do not burn on the scalp.</li>
            <li>I noticed the breakage and what it was really doing to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t really brush through because of the texture it created, went in shower</li>
            <li>I could use the whole tube and my hair would still suck it all</li>
            <li>others have mentioned, this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li>It smells just like a perm and is really a chemical</li>
            <li>The product smells like a perm because I analyzed the ingredients today, and it&#x27;s basically a temporary straight perm.  </li>
            <li>Suave legal team will be hearing from my attorneys.</li>
            <li>It seems from teh pitures on here it is meant for very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t spend much.</li>
            <li>I have used so much products for frizz and nothing</li>
            <li>Get this professionally done ($50-120 LA) with better products at your local salon.</li>
            <li>About two months ago I used another home straightening product and I color my own hair every few months.</li>
            <li>Keratin treatments leave your hair softer and more nourished, but this does the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>I probably should have looked on the box and found an 800 number and asked the Suave people themselves, but it was just more convenient to ask my personal hair care professional, plus I trust her.  </li>
            <li>The ends especially were completely brittle and more frizzy than ever.  </li>
            <li>My hair was thick and gorgeous this morning.</li>
            <li>I have scheduled an appointment to get my once very long, beautiful hair cut to my shoulders next week with a deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li>Today i washed it and WOW !!!</li>
            <li>I mean a good four inches.  </li>
            <li>I am right now in the process of trying to save a young lady&#x27;s hair who tried this at home.</li>
            <li>It lifted the color right out of my hair and it feels like an old broom.  </li>
            <li>I straightened it with a flat iron and my hair was straight and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>I used it about four days stright prior to doing the treatment and could see a significant difference in the texture of my hair...</li>
            <li>I saw the commercial for this product and was excited when I saw it at Target.  </li>
            <li>I originally was looking up why I could only use it every 3 months and came across these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will most likely end up with extensions, although I&#x27;m not sure how I will be able to cover up all the bald spots.</li>
            <li>Also, this product works much better than other at home treatments I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>That should have been the first RED FLAG, because ever since I have started coloring my hair on a regular basis, I have not been able to use perm solution on my hair.  </li>
            <li>But it does look like there is something which has been missed by manufacturer in the testing and research since so many other people are affected.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I saw a commercial for this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair routine was easy before...wash, mousse, and either let air dry or scrunch with blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The results: My hair is definitely smoother, easier to straighten, and laying nicer, plus it still holds curling iron curls very well, but it will not curl up on its own, if I let it air dry.</li>
            <li>The first few inches are okay.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need my flat iron for touch ups until after more than 2 months had passed since I first used the straightening cream (about the same time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s become a great resource for many, and a place to go if you just need to vent, or at the very least find a little comfort in knowing you&#x27;re not alone.    </li>
            <li>It reminded me a lot of the process of taking a Toni Home Perm and combing my hair straight with it when I was in high school, instead of setting my hair on curlers for a perm.  </li>
            <li>To get the results I want, I am going to go back to the anti-frizz gel, but I will probably have to use less, which is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So this morning I woke up early to use this stuff thinking it was a nice inexpensive keratin treatment that would fix my previously fried hair and make it silky and make it so i wouldnt even have to straighten the life out of it for awhile.</li>
            <li>I have very long, fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li>First off, my hair is very wavy and lightened 2 levels, from light brown to dark blond.  </li>
            <li>something that would smooth and strenthen your hair, not completely suck the moisture out and cause your hair to literally MELT off of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I read the instructions clearly and follow them exactly.</li>
            <li>I was pretty surprised.</li>
            <li>After I applied the suave - the finish result looked exactly like the professional keratin (with formaldehyde) treatments.</li>
            <li>I have tried to speak with someone at Suave too many times to count with no success.</li>
            <li>It is very fine but is long, very frizzy, and there is lots of it, so from shower to straight takes me 45 minutes with the dryer and flat iron.  </li>
            <li>Now,I will have to spend more money to purchase deep conditioning treatment for my hair and will have to wait months for my hair to get back to normal!</li>
            <li>i normally have gorgeous black hair and  now im stuck with red hair.</li>
            <li>That said, I would also follow their directions of testing it on one small spot (I tested mine on the flyaway pieces on the back of my head so that if something happened I&#x27;d be able to cover it easily).  </li>
            <li>I spend more than an hour yesterday trying to blow dry and straighten my hair out and by the end it looked almost exactly the same.</li>
            <li>There is A LOT of new information on this FB page!  </li>
            <li>The other day I took a really good look at my hair and several inches were just completely fried.  </li>
            <li>I live in a very humid city.</li>
            <li>In 3 months I may try a product that is more expensive and is reviewed with better results.  </li>
            <li>waited 7 minutes and washed it out and followed with a dime size amount of step 3 leave in conditioner and my hair is so soft, not straight by any means but the cutical seems sealed and my hair feels healthy</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;ve read enough reviews to know that I am not the only one this happened too, and like I said before, sounds like I&#x27;m luckier than most who used it.</li>
            <li>Because my hair is colored, and just mild wavy, I left it on for the shortest time specified - 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li>My hair was thick, long and beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I have only colored my hair like 2 times in my entire life, my hair is healthy,</li>
            <li>She said, if it is permanent color, to wait a week after applying this smoothing kit, but if it is temporary color, it can be done the same day (but do the smoothing kit first and then the coloring, because she said if you color first, the smoothing kit will strip out the coloring).  </li>
            <li>Now some of us are lucky if we even have hair left.</li>
            <li>in all, a decent product that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>I want more then just my money back, I want justice and my damn hair back!</li>
            <li>, this is a decent product if your hair is in decent shape.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s that there really aren&#x27;t enough hours in a day to make it worth it for me to put in all that effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After this product fried my hair and took away any body it ever posessed, I did some more research and found out that this is actually a straightening product that has the same ingredients as a perm.  </li>
            <li>Which is the main ingredient in perm solutions.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only cried 2 times from what i&#x27;ll call a \\&quot;hair disaster\\&quot;, and this one is definitely the one I cried more about.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional keratin treatments in the past and, although I loved that I had less frizz, I still had to work to make my curly hair smooth (not stick straight).</li>
            <li>I just finished using this product &amp; I followed the directions very clearly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, for those of you who are still interested in getting a keratin treatment, Coppola&#x27;s Keratin Complex Smoothing Therapy and Kera Straight are my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The negative reviews almost made me not try this product, but I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li>I think that anyone who tries this sort of thing at home has to be aware of the possible consequences and remember that you can always do more, but that you can&#x27;t UNdo over processing.</li>
            <li>but in no way will I try something that a high majority of people say is damaging.</li>
            <li>S&amp;S. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>Its also color treated with high lights.</li>
            <li>I got a real Keratin conditioning treatment which I will have to go back and get more cause my hair is so dry and breaking off.</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes of applying it thoroughly (maybe slightly more), then 20 minutes of constantly combing and using my hands to flatten the hair repeatedly with some slight massaging and pulling of the hair downwards to keep it straight, I got a crick in my neck and elbows the first time I used this.</li>
            <li>Now, that&#x27;s nothing compared to what many of you experienced, so much so that I feel bad even complaining about it, but Suave, this is UNACCEPTABLE!  </li>
            <li>It feels a little better.</li>
            <li>I was able to blow dry but it took forever it just would not dry.  </li>
            <li>It is not a keratin treatment, it is pure chemicals, not healthy or safe.  </li>
            <li>Before applying I did the quiz on the SUAVE website and it recommended the 30 day treatment, which I certainly do not, at least not if you love your curls and bounce and just wish they were a little</li>
            <li>I tried this product, not really expecting much in terms of results, as I have fine, natural curly hair which frizzes at the smallest hint of humidity or moisture in the air.</li>
            <li>and there is no improvement in the frizz department, and, too much, and it can be sticky and weigh down my already fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It might also be due less to the product itself and more because of the sulfate free shampoo I am using, but I did use the shampoo before I tried the straightening treatment and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li>I cannot miss the event, and have to make the best out of a bad situation.</li>
            <li>I look like I have jammed a fork in a light socket.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft to the touch and is much easier to straighten.</li>
            <li>With as much patience as she could, she combed through it as softly as she could using leave-in spray conditioner.</li>
            <li>If you really want your hair straightened get it done professionally.</li>
            <li>I also work out six days a week, so I really do have to shampoo my hair nearly every day, as I leave the gym drenched in sweat.  </li>
            <li>I am completely saddened and in disbelief that a 10.00 product could cause this much damage to our hair.  </li>
            <li>I also spent $150 on a Keratin Express Blowout at a salon, which gave me smooth hair for about a month -</li>
            <li>I have wavy hair, especially in the summer, and I had hoped to use it to calm the curls on humid days.  </li>
            <li>she has hair that&#x27;s almost straight naturally</li>
            <li>I am so grateful I didn&#x27;t have the nightmare trouble many have had, but I&#x27;d avoid the risk and just not buy this.</li>
            <li>Normal people are not qualified to use it.  </li>
            <li>This kit remindes me of the straightening kits sold next to the perm kits, which is pretty much a perm kit with a comb.</li>
            <li>Hopefully in a few months I will be able to layer my hair in a way that looks presentable,</li>
            <li>but when you can do it yourself and get the same results it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Personally, I think that its a powerful product with a trusted name.</li>
            <li>My curl is finally starting to come back at the root, and in patches throughout the top part of my head, however it&#x27;s looking even more awkward since it&#x27;s curling at the top</li>
            <li>My hair is colored frequently, so I left the mixture (which is pretty much just relaxer -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had long hair most of my life -- the only way to salvage what this product has done is to cut it off and regrow it.  </li>
            <li>I do not own that set because it specifically states that basically if you have ever had any kind of chemical treatment on your hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually pretty anal about the products I buy, but didn&#x27;t really look too closely at the ingredients to confirm it was the same.  </li>
            <li>The few splatters I made didn&#x27;t seem to discolor the towel around my shoulders or the counter top or rugs on the floor, all which I wiped up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you just wash and condition your hair like you normally would, and then comb this through, wait a while, and rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>I was kind of scared to begin with after reading all of the negative feedback</li>
            <li>I cant even look in the mirror without crying and on top of it all im going to have to spend over $300 on hair extensions</li>
            <li>It will take years for our hair to return to normal if ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it was straighter than normal.  </li>
            <li>My hair normally dries in ringlets.</li>
            <li>The few time sI have been able to get a comb or brush through it ive lost lots of hair that breaks off and comes out in clumps.</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s coarse) is SUPER soft and pretty straight for only being blow-dried.  </li>
            <li>and I could not hardly get the comb through it.</li>
            <li>Since I live in a very humid climate, I have wanted to have my hair professionally straightened for years.  </li>
            <li>I spent a good hour to hour and a half on this one morning.</li>
            <li>My hair was so thin and flat and on top of that the top and crown of my head was bald.</li>
            <li>It is now very short, right before prom and graduation.</li>
            <li>and I wanted to stress the following:  GO TO THE SUAVE WEBSITE TO SEE IF THE PRODUCT IS RIGHT FOR YOU.  </li>
            <li>Suave is not tring to make this right for their consumers only tring to place blame somwhere else.</li>
            <li>I know it is the last thing you feel like doing right now, but I would advise taking photos of your hair before you visit a salon.</li>
            <li>But there&#x27;s more negative comments than positive.</li>
            <li>I had beautiful thick brown hair that I have always been very careful with.</li>
            <li>I had mixed feelings at first because my hair seemed to be rather damaged, but that seemed to get better after a few days of conditioning.</li>
            <li>After seeing the ingredients, I was disappointed, as many of them are equally harsh and problematic.&lt;br /&gt;The strand test didn&#x27;t yield impressive results.</li>
            <li>Her beautiful long blonde hair is no more.  </li>
            <li>I want to say to all those people who experienced hair loss, bald spots and just a plain ole&#x27;mess on their hair that my heart goes out to each and every one of you.  </li>
            <li>I hoped that waiting the suggested 48 hours to shampoo would somehow magically fix it or at the very least calm the frizziness.  </li>
            <li>I went to a new salon and they used Coppola.  </li>
            <li>and I have to live with it for 48 hours because you aren&#x27;t supposed to shampoo for that amount of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Monday night I decided to try this new keratin kit.</li>
            <li>They haven&#x27;t seen my new \\&quot; look\\&quot; yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of this new trial.</li>
            <li>It was easy to apply and non-irritating, but as far as I can tell it didn&#x27;t do anything for me, even in combination with the other products in the box.</li>
            <li>I have used only my regular salon shampoo and rinse, which aren&#x27;t sulfite free.</li>
            <li>but my hair is super dry</li>
            <li>Now my hair is above my shoulders, to my disappointment the ends are still straight,they did not curl at all, I now have more volume since it&#x27;s so short, so it&#x27;s super puffy, frizzy, and awkwardly straight at the bottom and wavy at the top.</li>
            <li>then really how much damage would it do to mine especially since my hair didn&#x27;t have any of the warnings on the box.  </li>
            <li>I only say this because I have a very demanding job that demands a lot of my time, so I really don&#x27;t have time to spend straightening my hair myself.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be really conscientious and not even pull my hair back for the couple days after using this product- who wants a perma-ridge from a ponytail holder in their hair, even for 30 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When the air is dry, specially during winter, my hair is actually more wavy and harder to straighten without a flat iron and leave-in treatments.  </li>
            <li>For this product, I set my timer for 20 minutes for step 1 and left step 2 in for about 20 minutes and my hair is as straight as when I relax it, I am amazed!  </li>
            <li>My hair was beyond soft!</li>
            <li>During the first process, I noticed that when I was using the comb, my hair was starting to frizz up</li>
            <li>My hair looks EXACTLY THE SAME as before and still feels elastic in some areas.</li>
            <li>First off, just reading the box and instructions is enough to freak out the calmest of people.</li>
            <li>At first it was a couple strands when I brushed my hair.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I did the smoothing kit first and then the temporary color; either the smoothing kit stripped it out even though the coloring was done last, or else the coloring just didn&#x27;t take.  </li>
            <li>I did not have any more hair fall out than usual when I used this product.  </li>
            <li>I used the product exactly as it said I should, and overall, my hair is smoother.</li>
            <li>It is called \\&quot;keratin\\&quot; (which is a natural hair protein) but had NO keratin in it, that was an advertizing ploy I guess!</li>
            <li>My fine hair strands felt slightly thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions to a T and after the last step and last rinse I was excited to see how my \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair looked.</li>
            <li>I put this on my hair and it completely broke off my hair!  </li>
            <li>I actually followed the first two steps.</li>
            <li>I followed the directions on the box and ended up rinsing off the first step in ten minutes because everytime I combed like it said I could see clumps of hair in the comb.  </li>
            <li>So unless you have pretty coarse hair</li>
            <li>I noticed that after the first step when i was combing my hair my hair started to fall out as well as after the second step i cryed and cryed my hair is nothing but a fuzz ball and hair</li>
            <li>Then, my hair started to kink up and pretty, which i later learned it was burning and frying.</li>
            <li>Following the directions EXACTLY, my hair was of ALL body.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank God I haven&#x27;t lost any hair so far!</li>
            <li>I still have a little wave to it but am sure if I did flat iron it, it would go pefectly straight.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t just look at these reviews, these other women may have just bought the product and used it (like I did) without really knowing if this product was right for their hair.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, wavy hair that is very healthy (not chemically processed, dyed, regularly cut).</li>
            <li>result was not worth the effort, and we were all glad we had done a trial section only.</li>
            <li>Not worth doing a whole head&#x27;s worth, given the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>In the past, I&#x27;ve spent $300 on a Brazilian Blowout at a salon, which gave me gorgeous, lustrous hair.  </li>
            <li>Upon beginning its use, I could not get my hair to comb out straight, I was barely getting a comb through my hair and once I got lucky and could actually drag the comb through my hair, the hair would snap back into curls instead of staying straight.</li>
            <li>FAR FAR AWAY!</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll feel much better only losing a small piece of hair, as opposed to your whole head.</li>
            <li>I naturally have thick, wavy and sometimes coarse hair - which is probably why it was able to handle the product better than some of the other users.  </li>
            <li>This product allows me to have smooth straight hair or loose wavy curls if I let it dry natural.</li>
            <li>Easy to say \\&quot;next time i&#x27;ll keep it on longer\\&quot; much harder to deal with hair</li>
            <li>My hair has continued to dry straight and stay straight throughout the day which was my goal.</li>
            <li>I actually only had to blow dry my hair lightly when I did wash it.</li>
            <li>My hair is now super straight but completely dried out.</li>
            <li>and all together useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super healthy hair, I never blow dry, sometimes flat iron or curl but not often, use little to no product, and do not dye.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought some &#x27;Hair Cholesterol, Aphogee 2 minute strengthener, Olive Oil Leave-in treatment, some other $12 leave in treatments, some special Bio-something or other super conditioner...</li>
            <li>It was back to being a brillo pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without putting more work into my hair than should be required, my hair looks like a fried mess.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, as I was rinsing, many many clumps of hair started going down the drain, and the whole under layer of my bangs completely fried off.</li>
            <li>After a real keratin treatment, I could blow dry my hair with my fingers and end up with shiney straight hair that felt crazy healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>The whole process took me a little over an hour, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Upon reading these other reviews I suppose I was lucky to not have a ton of hair fall out,</li>
            <li>I had to have 12 inches of my hair cut off and lucky that my stylist didn&#x27;t have to shave my head due to the damage/burns from Suave Keratin Kit.</li>
            <li>I am causasian with very naturally curly, course, frizzy type hair that is hard to manage, though in the fall and winter I can get it pretty smooth and straight with the blow dry and curling iron.  </li>
            <li>My hair would tripled in size when it was dry (with the hair drier)it was embarrassing, not even flat ironing it would look shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>I was told that I needed to start taking certain vitamins and eating as much protein as possible and different hair treatments to make my hair grow as fast as possible so it would not break off at my scalp.</li>
            <li>but for this works great, I am only sorry that I can use it for 3 months.</li>
            <li>(I did think that it would smooth my hair, when actually it straightened it a bit which is not really what I wanted</li>
            <li>This should be clearly advertised for what it is--A HOME PERM.  </li>
            <li>I can clearly see the breakage all over, sort of looks frizzy.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only real benefit I see from this product.  </li>
            <li>The bottom inch or two or my hair was completely fried up.</li>
            <li>I am 24 years old</li>
            <li>Thanks Suave, for ruining my hair for the next 20 years.</li>
            <li>I have read many of the reviews below, so I will make mine straight to the point because the 1 star, I hate it reviews are 100% accurate!</li>
            <li>And it wasn&#x27;t, but it did take all the hair color out as well as even changed the color of my natural hair to brown/red.</li>
            <li>natural keratin treatments have keratin not perm solution.</li>
            <li>I have had one professional keratin treatment and one professional Brazilian blowout both with no issues.  </li>
            <li>It gave my hair soft texture with no frizz.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Problem 3-Hairstylists use basing gel to protect the scalp on sensitive clients, but not offered with the kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Ive had the smoothing keratin treatment done professionally twice and thought I&#x27;d give the suave kit a try.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>That idea may even be better, at least I may not know what this hair looks like.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only time it felt good was in the shower after washing it, it felt sleek and smooth, which is why I was so confused once it dried.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally curly and kinda frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>If you still feel the need to get a keratin treatment get it done professionally.  </li>
            <li>My sister is a professional cosmetologist, and she has worked with my hair for years before I moved across the country.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li>iron it - which takes a considerable amount of time</li>
            <li>Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t put any of this directly on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Now my hair is completely destroyed.</li>
            <li>I can tell by the look of my hair that in a week or two it will be completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>I was itching to use a product that would straighten my hair  (without damaging it) and that would allow my hair to return to its natural state after 30 to 90 days.  </li>
            <li>I have been coloring it for years with Clairol Natural Instincts.</li>
            <li>i plan to get a class action lawsuit started to take care of the victims of this product</li>
            <li>I HAVE A LAWYER TO HELP ME IN THIS CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT</li>
            <li>au natural</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t understand how this product could possibly bald someone.</li>
            <li>I am absolutely horrified at the results and damage this product has caused to countless numbers of women.</li>
            <li>my ends were completely fried.</li>
            <li>but it completely fried my hair.</li>
            <li>After using this product my hair was completely gummi.  </li>
            <li>completely unmanagable.</li>
            <li>After I was done, my hair felt like my 1 year old baby girl.</li>
            <li>I have coarse, wavy/curly hair and was hoping to have it as straight as the picture implies.</li>
            <li>Let a professional do it.</li>
            <li>read the instructions; and it didn&#x27;t seem too out of line with my professional experience.  </li>
            <li>My bangs if that&#x27;s what I can still call them are completely burt off.</li>
            <li>I know I am not a hair professional but</li>
            <li>I went to Sallys and picked up the ion keratin smoothing system (which is a real keratin treatment, not a falsely advertised hair relaxer), which has definitely made a big improvement to the damage.</li>
            <li>I was waiting to write this review until enough time passed to really judge the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised no one has sued them yet?</li>
            <li>It completely fried my hair and it was not salvageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is completely wavy/loosely curled and virgin - never been colored, bleached, permed or treated before.  </li>
            <li>Wow... thank goodness</li>
            <li>I went on and did the sample, near the crown of my head where the sun hits it</li>
            <li>My hair is completely wrecked.</li>
            <li>It also states to contact a... professional before using.</li>
            <li>Still, for the price and the convenience, I would recommend that women with problem hair give it a try, as they may be surprised with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had professional keratin treatments my friend works at a salon</li>
            <li>im a 21 year old women</li>
            <li>Completely ruined my hair.</li>
            <li>I get the keratin treatment or Japanese style straight perm whenever I&#x27;m in asia.</li>
            <li>THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li>NO HEAT IS ALLOWED NEAR MY HEAD</li>
            <li>I wanted to write a review of this product because there are so many negative reviews</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m at the 3 month mark, and my hair has started returning to it&#x27;s wild state, and I just purchased this kit again to use it.</li>
            <li>Given the overwhelming negative response</li>
            <li>Completely fried it.  </li>
            <li>So that day (Saturday) I went in search of a professional stylist for some help.  </li>
            <li>Yes, but only if you really look close can you tell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t use the product I had bought, as a direct consequence of reading these disaster stories.</li>
            <li>But with being laid off there is only so much I can afford</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been growing out my hair for 5 years, and in an hour, I completely destroyed it.</li>
            <li>Also, please make sure to report Unilever to the FDA Consumer Complaint Department.</li>
            <li>I would have needed it after having it professionally straightened).  </li>
            <li>I managed to finally get the comb through it and continued to comb it straight.</li>
            <li>I rinsed and rinsed till it was all out and then put on the cutical cream and left it in for the whole 7 minutes then rinsed that out.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s still completely fried.....</li>
            <li>My hair is very coarse and very curly.</li>
            <li>Suave is completely irresponsible for putting this on the shelves.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever died my hair once in my whole life</li>
            <li>The only time I can get it completely straight (like I truly want it) is if I blowdry it, straighten it and then sleep on it for a night and</li>
            <li>least you have cute hats.\\</li>
            <li>I have bleach, color, and old perm (which i wanted out) in my hair and I ignored all the warnings for already processed hair....</li>
            <li>If you want soft hair use any Keratin product like Coppola.</li>
            <li>I think for $10 you can only expect so much.</li>
            <li>When i tried to pull the hair straight it would just shrivel back up when i let it go.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;Step 1\\&quot; of the treatment is actually a perm solution to straighten your hair, but I don&#x27;t want stick straight hair; I like my ends to curl.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been naturally kinky curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Two years ago I started going to a professional to get my hair colored,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what to tell my 13 year old daughter whom I convinced to let me use this product on her</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although I recommend if you do choose to use this product, have a professional hair dresser apply it.</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair and thought I would try this to get rid of some of that humidity friz for the summer.</li>
            <li>This completely took the frizzy out 100%.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, sleek, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li>hopefully it will stay like this for the next few weeks :)</li>
            <li>, I thought I was going to be left bald and was sure that I had quite a few bald spots</li>
            <li>Alas, I love my hair too much to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off, I want to say that this product is clearly NOT for everyone.  </li>
            <li>It should just smooth and weigh down the cuticles and generally make it behave</li>
            <li>They also said that they didn&#x27;t sell the product in walgreens (where I purchased it) and that it can only be applied by a professional!?!?!  </li>
            <li>My only hope is to cut as much off as possible and hope the new growth comes in normally.  </li>
            <li>I was excited about this since my hair is very thin and shows frizz easily.</li>
            <li>My hair is not very thick, in fact its actually pretty thin and fine and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>I am Caucasian and I have naturally wavy/curly hair (not tight curls).  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need to over-iron it, it was very straight with a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>so i would not have to deal with flat ironing it to calm frizz and such.</li>
            <li>kit will definitely smooth and tame frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>She had beautiful, full hair down past the middle of her back -- this treatment burned half of it off (up to her shoulders)...</li>
            <li>Still, after reading the fine print and realizing that she has had her hair professionally straightened with chemicals in the past, I am reluctant to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>I have had my hair relaxed, highlighted, dyed different colors, super dry, and so forth.</li>
            <li>Then when I flat ironed it, it was pin straight in no time.  </li>
            <li>it then flat ironed it and she has so much body n bounce to her hair.</li>
            <li>After blow drying, I really didn&#x27;t need to use the flat iron, but I knew it would help to seal the product into my hair.  </li>
            <li>I normally use one of the \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; clear gels on my hair right after I wash it, but, it is tricky to get it right--too little</li>
            <li>finally grew my hair back out from a short cut, and I&#x27;m having to visit the strong possibility of having to get it cut short again!</li>
            <li>But between ordering it and getting it, I had a BAD experience with my normal hair dye and my hair lightened greatly, so heading the warnings</li>
            <li>but of course I wanted straight smooth hair without having to blow dry and straighten everyday.  </li>
            <li>THANKS SUAVE for being a company that put a relaxer product, (like a perm), out to the general public</li>
            <li>She only left on the first step for 13 minutes instead of the recommended 20-25.</li>
            <li>For the first time im finally seeing some shine and health come back to my hair.</li>
            <li>about exactly whatall those \\&quot;concerned\\&quot; Suave/Unilever representatives&#x27; responses to the negative Amazon reviews you might have read are all about, and exactly what they have and haven&#x27;t done for the few who were able to actually communicate with them.  </li>
            <li>I only left the first part on for 10 min....</li>
            <li>I bought this a few weeks back and used it on my hair that was already in good health just slightly wavy....</li>
            <li>No matter how much I left the treatment in my hair and tried to continue to comb it, larger and larger chunks of my hair was yanked out of my hair in large clumps with every attempt to comb it straight.</li>
            <li>i dont think there is a quick fix for this mess..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few damage repair products, but it&#x27;s pretty obvious that the only remedy will be to get a short cut and wait for healthy hair to grow back.  </li>
            <li>Right now it&#x27;s about 10 inches past my shoulders, but the damage is very noticable up to my chin-length layers.</li>
            <li>and I had a huge paper worth 20% of my grade due today and was hoping to work on that last night instead of crying and praying and wanting to die!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have asked around how much it would be for someone professional to chemically relax my hair and its over $200 dollars and the product in your local walmart is only $8.00.</li>
            <li>I have a huge event next week for the Veterans Medical Center and I am horrified at my look.</li>
            <li>I read the instructions and got ready to try the Keratin Infusion Kit, but then I read the long lists of ingredients. . .</li>
            <li>I read the warnings on here first and proceeded carefully.  </li>
            <li>I carefully read the directions, and did it exactly as specified.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not back to normal, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like cotton candy anymore</li>
            <li>I just pray that eventually my hair will get back to normal.</li>
            <li>The following weeks let me continue to enjoy straight hair with very little effort on my part!</li>
            <li>I didnt know, I wish I had because it is costing me 420 dollars in conditioning treatments to get my hair to calm down and the cuticle to close</li>
            <li>I have thin fine hair naturally straight</li>
            <li>2 years worth of hair growth down the drain.</li>
            <li>You probably are not used to seeing your hair straight or even having little tolerance for what I would call 80&#x27;s punk rocker straight hair (aka fried hair that sticks up straight...think krimped with a dose of unrecoverable dryness added in...</li>
            <li>But I have about 2-3 inches of new split ends, and as my hair grows back, it has a kink in it so that I look like I have a buzz cut underneath the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I did not have as bad of an experience as many others on here have.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m having to blow dry my hair straight and then curl it until it grows out.  </li>
            <li>so I used the dry shampoo because my hair gets really oily.</li>
            <li>It has been almost a week, and my hair is so broken, I can&#x27;t seem to get this product out and am sure I&#x27;m going to go see a professional hairdresser.</li>
            <li>so today my real hair actually matched the texture of my real human hair extensions.</li>
            <li>and then about 6 inches of my hair is still super straight, dry and shapeless.</li>
            <li>First off I have extremely curly hair...</li>
            <li>My hair looks like it does after I flat iron normally.</li>
            <li>CONSIDERING USING THE SUAVE PROFESSIONALS KERATIN INFUSION 30 DAY SMOOTHING KIT to save yourself the time, trouble and heartache of going through all the destruction possible all because you want to make your hair a little more straight for a couple of months.</li>
            <li>It gave me almost the same results as I get when I have my hair professionally straightened!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any major improvement either.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product did any major damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li>The last 5-6 inches of hair died completely!</li>
            <li>After following full instructions, I started blow drying my hair to find it completely fried at the ends, damaged, split ends and very little noticeable as far as the claims</li>
            <li>usually the next day it&#x27;s nice and straight.. usually.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I read the instructions very carefully.  </li>
            <li>I am able to wear my hair down with less frizz.</li>
            <li>It completely ruined my hair, much like the other reviews here.</li>
            <li>The curl is uneven, and I easily spend an hour with the round brush to get it straight.  </li>
            <li>I have never complained about a product before, id normally assume this was a problem I brought upon myself, but the damage is so extreme that I feel i&#x27;m obligated to warn others.</li>
            <li>I have kinda wavy, kinda straight, sorta curly mostly very dry hair</li>
            <li>I guess for me, having had professional treatments before, I had somewhat of an advantage because I was aware of some of the little qwirks you have to watch out for.</li>
            <li>I have deep conditioned my hair all day multiple times and nothing is working to even smooth it out a little bit.</li>
            <li>which originally was just wavy is now straight till about half way down where it then frizzes out into a big poof.</li>
            <li>This product is meant to be used in salons by a hair professional because the general public has no idea what these chemicals could do.  </li>
            <li>stylist says my hair is very damaged and it&#x27;ll take a long time to get all the \\&quot;dead\\&quot; hair gone and get it back to the way it was before the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Spoke to a representative at Suave today.</li>
            <li>Once I was done my wet hair looked perfectly straight and silky.  </li>
            <li>My hair is soft, and actually hangs looser!</li>
            <li>I used the product last night and have noticed considerable damage.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy, curly blonde hiar and wanted a sleeker look.  </li>
            <li>Some women are strictly salon women and only rely on a professional to handle their hair.  </li>
            <li>&quot; well I have the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>Apparently I didn&#x27;t answer all the questions correct</li>
            <li>She has natural coarse hair</li>
            <li>It has been roughly six weeks since this whole ordeal</li>
            <li>Now you tell me why in the heck  people starting a \\&quot;class action lawsuit\\&quot; for others because their \\&quot;hair fell</li>
            <li>And now reading others reviews I see that it actually is a relaxer for if you were to have like really cury hair or african american hair which I do not!</li>
            <li>My 17 year old daughter used this produce (thinking that it was a deep conditioning treatment).  </li>
            <li>I am a natural redhead, but put in a temporary rinse 2 weeks ago making my hair a darker shade of red (</li>
            <li>I do not want to cut my hair short, because I am fifty years old.  </li>
            <li>Now after using it I can&#x27;t go back, it does not wash out in 30 days, it is a permenet chemical that has completely destroyed all of the hair on my head.</li>
            <li>, I have been looking for another way to get the same professional salon look.</li>
            <li>This was only after a few minutes, I did not leave it on for the full time</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re not great, but just ok.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any clumps of hair come out, but I have had A LOT of breakage at the ends, so my hair feels very fine and thin in the back.</li>
            <li>Also, there&#x27;s a warning on the side about using it if you&#x27;re sensitive to the main ingredient or other relaxer-type treatments or even perms.</li>
            <li>but my usually oily hair is now dry and more frizzy than ever before, even after using deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li>There are many new horror stories (unfortunately), and a section in which people are sharing info about what they&#x27;ve done to try and \\&quot;fix\\&quot;</li>
            <li>, it never had the same straight, glossy shine as before, and it felt brittle and dry, like straw.  </li>
            <li>My hair was completely mushy and would not dry (my hairdresser later told me it was because it was over processed).</li>
            <li>but the last few years it has been super frizzy, unruly, and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time I blow dried my hair after following the directions, my hair was almost as straight as when I flat iron!  </li>
            <li>That first night it was actually quite difficult to style my hair after I had blow-dryed it, mainly because I rarely blow</li>
            <li>I have used at-home single process hair color for years to cover up some gray mostly and to slightly lighten a natural dark brown color.  </li>
            <li>I normally wash my hair at night, let it air dry overnight, then iron it in the morning.</li>
            <li>Normally I cannot blow dry my hair and go out.</li>
            <li>used half of the first two bottles, and will use it again after September when my hair gets frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Suave, I used to love your products, cheep, got my hair clean, and now I really am disappointed in you.</li>
            <li>I did not loose any at all</li>
            <li>I now have to worry with my hair breaking , falling out , or turning into a frizzy hot mess.</li>
            <li>, I WAS NOT A VICTIM, BUT MY TWIN SISTER WAS ....</li>
            <li>my hair was always a problem no matter if I let it go curly, flat ironed or professionally blew it out.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, after reading other Amazonian review, it seems a lot of reviewers say this product is very damaging.</li>
            <li>My ends are completely burned, and my bangs are flat against my forehead.  </li>
            <li>Even after the stylist&#x27;s best efforts, my hair continues to be damaged and fried which makes it very difficult to comb through, much less style and try to make it look half way decent in public.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when I saw this suave product, read the box and thought this is much easier, doesn&#x27;t require flat iron, can blow dry.</li>
            <li>And again, from what I&#x27;ve been told by professionals, the damage could potentially have a lasting effect even after your new hair does grow back.    </li>
            <li>The hair looked quite dry and the texture was mostly the same as before--a bit straighter, but not nice and shiny like with the salon keratin treatments.</li>
            <li>The following day I went out and spend an obscene amount of money on professional hair care products (deep conditioners, etc).</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even put in a ponytail because there are so many tiny hairs sticking out around my face and scalp where the hair has broken off to my scalp or fallen out.  </li>
            <li>because I kind of like my wild&#x27;n&#x27;crazy hair, and there&#x27;s that pernicious time-factor thing.  </li>
            <li>because I kind of like my wild&#x27;n&#x27;crazy hair, and there&#x27;s that pernicious time-factor thing.  </li>
            <li>Suave should be ashamed of themselves for ruining our hair with their false advertisements and promises of lush shiny smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>had one little sore on my head, and the lotion stung it, and it lasted about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;After the first treatment</li>
            <li>I was lucky I washed out right away, my hair mostly survived, though insanely damaged.  </li>
            <li>After a couple of months it went back to normal, but it was dry to the point that there was not hair mask that could fix it..</li>
            <li>My daughter is has mixed hair, not totally black, not totally white</li>
            <li>But after going to the salon to have it fixed, they said this product is NOT a keratin treatment but a relaxer they would only use on African American type hair!!</li>
            <li>There is no excuse for permanently messing your hair up.</li>
            <li>did ask a hair care professional how long to wait before coloring.  </li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth, I did apply the #1 bottle on a small portion of my hair to test it</li>
            <li>I have been doing Hot Oil treatments a few times a week</li>
            <li>so I would look as normal as could be expected.</li>
            <li>my hair is very thick and strong.</li>
            <li>I have it professionally straightened twice a year; I can&#x27;t afford any more than that, and I&#x27;m afraid my hair will be unhealthy if I do it more</li>
            <li>Maybe it won&#x27;t last a whole month; but there are other products out there that last longer.  </li>
            <li>Maybe it won&#x27;t last a whole month; but there are other products out there that last longer.  </li>
            <li>I had wanted to have soft, silky hair--not dry, brittle, damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;Reading</li>
            <li>It is not super straight</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and about a minute and a half after I applied step one my hair start kinking up at a fast speed.</li>
            <li>and if I let dry naturally it was wavy curls</li>
            <li>There are reasons why these products should only be sold to professionals, not the general public.</li>
            <li>Shame on Suave for introducing a potentially harmful product to the general public.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, my hair is a hot mess now!</li>
            <li>top of that my hair feels dry and its hard to brush since, as I may have mentioned, the last 2 inches are burnt frizzy dry knotted</li>
            <li>The only way to straighten my hair normally is blow it dry and then flat</li>
            <li>My blonde hair, that normally shows any oil I put in it and can look dirty if I put too many weighty products in it.</li>
            <li>I continued with the other steps per instruction, hoping this was normal.  </li>
            <li>I still have some waves, but when I blow dry and flat iron my hair is so soft, shiny, and sleek!</li>
            <li>Despite following the instructions to the very detail I literally lost half my hair.</li>
            <li>And when my hair was wet it was icky feeling and broke off so easily.</li>
            <li>She says it was a very detailed and bit complicated procedure to use the product in the correct manner, and wishes it could be made simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I started my hair was all one length, now it looks like someone took a razor and put large uneven layers in my hair.  </li>
            <li>and it is now straight with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair, but it was a little frizzy.</li>
            <li>but I still keep it on for a little while I didn&#x27;t even keep it on the whole 15 minutes (for my hair type) and washed it out my hair</li>
            <li>(Through experience, I find that air drying my hair a little before blow drying it, a week or so after having it straightened, helps me maintain the straight look longer.)  </li>

            <li> My hair looked great!</li>
            <li> Also the conditioner that comes with the kit is great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Garnier version and even though I know a girl who claims her hair fell out over it, mine was perfect.</li>
            <li> but i still have my hair &amp; it looks wonderful!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS BEST FOR VIRGIN UNTRREATRED HAIR, and if you were to go to a salon with permed and bleached hair and ask for it, they probably would reccommend against it.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m very happy for them, but I wouldn&#x27;t risk it to anyone that is considering it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great!</li>

            <li> Thank you Suave for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> I tried my best to put a hat on and went to my salon.</li>
            <li> I should have been the perfect candidate for this.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say, am very happy with their response and concern for what happened.  </li>
            <li> It looks like the commercials of beautiful hair on tv models!  </li>
            <li> was very happy about the results.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions perfectly and usage resulted in hair loss and breakage.</li>
            <li> Wish you all the best of luck with the product.[[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]]</li>
            <li> chickening out, but I wish others the best of luck!</li>
            <li> The description of this product is misleading at best!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Before she could use the product, we all read the reviews and decided a sample section of hair would be the best things to do.</li>
            <li> Best of luck with your salon visit.</li>
            <li> My best friends wedding is in a month</li>
            <li> I wish all of you that is living this nightmare the best of luck.</li>
            <li> After the claims I saw on the commercials I thought this seemed like the perfect product for me</li>
            <li> I  followed the instructions perfect</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions perfectly, and now my hair is stringy in some sections and breaking in others.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m trying to style it the best I can</li>
            <li> I know better than to buy store products like this, any treatment, including color should be done at the salon!!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Please do not risk your lovely hair for this!!!</li>
            <li> The results were VERY good</li>
            <li> My hair was in very good health when i applied this product, I now have frizzy hair and burned ends.</li>
            <li> so I have always taken very good care of my hair using the highest quality of product out.</li>
            <li> so I was an ideal candidate for this product</li>
            <li> I thought that I had the ideal hair for this product.</li>
            <li> Good luck to you all!</li>
            <li> good luck!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe I will use this product again, just because I believe it wasn&#x27;t so good for my hair, but for a $10 suave product I was fairly impressed.</li>
            <li> beautiful lady&#x27;s ???</li>
            <li> I decided to use this product to straighten my hair and make it beautiful and shiny</li>
            <li> Her hair was sleek and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I have, I should say HAD, beautiful shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe their intentions were to sabotage all womens beautiful hair or something.</li>
            <li> Nioxin hair re-growth system, Phyto, and Rene Furterer are all great products to help strengthen and regrow hair.  </li>
            <li> Before I begin, I would like to say that my hair is my pride and joy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Embrace your hair as is, wear your curls and waves proudly.</li>
            <li> My hair feels great</li>
            <li> This product worked great.</li>
            <li> am really happy that I found Suave and no longer have to spend $250 at the salon.</li>
            <li> (Attractive, eh?)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I think it is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy I gave this a try.</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Also I am happy with the lighter color</li>
            <li> If your hair cannot handle a perm, then this is not going to be happy ending for you.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I have to say that it is great.  </li>
            <li> and I wanted my hair to look great.  </li>
            <li> and it still worked great.</li>

            <li> Therefore, I&#x27;m happy with what this Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion</li>
            <li> My wife used it and says it worked great for her.</li>
            <li> But in all honesty, it worked great for my wife, and she did not face this problem.</li>
            <li> Why they didn&#x27;t just offer a great smoothing conditioning treatment is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this is a great product  keeps my curly hair manageable .</li>
            <li> just a great product all around ..</li>
            <li> The reviews I remember run the gamut from works great to my hair fell out, and the product seems to have been pulled from shelves</li>
            <li> Well not any more!!  </li>
            <li> their hair, mitigate the damage, tips on when to shampoo, what to use (i.e. using a sulfate free shampoo!!!)</li>
            <li> I love it!!</li>
            <li> I used this product and absolutely LOVE it!!</li>
            <li> The breakage is what haunts me most, I look like tweety bird!!</li>
            <li> it looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Now I have relatively healthy hair, not the best though.</li>
            <li> I bet they wouldn&#x27;t even test this on their own families!  </li>
            <li> My hair was real healthy, I just had a dusting done...</li>
            <li> You can visualize just how nice THAT looks!</li>
            <li> When I wash it, it dries very quickly and with great style!!</li>
            <li> You will look amazing and your hair will be healthy and best of all not falling out.</li>
            <li> Find a good hair stylist to get you through this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I take immensely good care of it and spend hundreds of dollars a year on products.</li>
            <li> I figured since it was sold on the shelf, it must&#x27;ve have lots of good results, etc.</li>
            <li> I had an Keratin treatement done at an Aveda salon in January and loved it.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews where people said they loved this product.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this, go to a salon and buy a good conditioning mask or one of their products.</li>
            <li> I told them they should have to pay for my hair cut and GOOD product to repair my hair, but they disagreed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I ruined my perfectly good hair with something like this.  </li>
            <li> No balding, no rubbery ends, just a good result...</li>
            <li> Good luck to all of you.  </li>
            <li> I am not against spending money for my hair to look good</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and thought it would be a good idea to straighten/relax my hair with a product made for African-American hair....</li>
            <li> Good luck to you all.  </li>
            <li> I felt I was a good prospect for the product.</li>
            <li> and I put in a good leave in every day.</li>
            <li> Good luck to everyone who fell for the AD.</li>
            <li> Is it as good as a salon keratin treatment?</li>
            <li> The salons there are really good at those techniques.</li>
            <li> This product is so good</li>
            <li> My hair is strait and looks good.</li>
            <li> My hair WAS is in good condition.  </li>
            <li> Suave&#x27;s a brand I trust for shampoo, conditioner, and styling products, and I&#x27;ve heard good things about the salon keratin treatments, and this kit seems like a good matchup between the two.  </li>
            <li> I thought it would be a good thing for my hair</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> My hair is crimped, but not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product lightened my hair not in a good way).  </li>
            <li> but nothing gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> There was just nothing good that came out of my using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> women, beautiful hair is very important....</li>
            <li> I also lost a good amount of hair, and my hair was very healthy before this treatment.</li>
            <li> After reading the box and seeing the advertisements, I thought this was going to be something healthy and great for my hair.</li>
            <li> As a licensed Cosmetologist, I have found many people are using this, even on \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair, have followed the instructions and have experienced , loss of hair, skin burns and chemical burns on hairline, as well as the hair</li>
            <li> I had very healthy hair.  </li>
            <li> Exorbitantly pricey, my hair came out of that looking incredibly fab, feeling fantastic, and I was able to maintain the great style my hair sylist had accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair feels great; it lays well with its layers, and so I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels great; it lays well with its layers, and so I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li> this product does not seem very safe.</li>
            <li> You have probably saved many others from the nightmares you have experienced.</li>
            <li> yet is generally very healthy.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> And hope you have the same amazing results I did!! :D</li>
            <li> I wish the best for anyone who is wanting to try this product and please be smart about it!</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> Pretty awesome home Suave Keratin kit.</li>
            <li> Suave should not market this as a smoothing treatment either, I have used many kinds and this is not one!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I scoured the internet for answers and discovered that this product has ruined the hair of many others as well!  </li>
            <li> When I first finished the treatment (which I did perfectly by the directions)</li>
            <li> she knew better!</li>
            <li> MORE THEN TIME STATED ON BOX!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> If I had more spare time, I would be buying this product twice a year and do it 4 times each year myself just because it gives amazing, professional-looking, and salon-like results!</li>
            <li> JUST MAKE SURE TO READ THE WARNING FOR THIS PRODUCT AND TAKE THE TEST TO SEE IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE!</li>
            <li> , I think the first problem is the wording it should be called a relaxer or a straightener not a smoother!!!!</li>
            <li> But this stuff is amazing and so afordable.  </li>
            <li> The difference is so amazing.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain to rinse my hair not once but 3 times through the process.</li>
            <li> I applied it based on the instructions and am thrilled with the outcome.  </li>
            <li> I actually liked my hair before, It was wavy but was hoping to get rid of some frizz.</li>
            <li> I liked my curls, I just wanted them to be smoother and not so frizzy.</li>
            <li> All we wanted to do was to look nice.  </li>
            <li> Again, thank you for your candid reviews.  </li>
            <li> Even though I really liked this product, I should not have used it.  </li>
            <li> I have to be honest.</li>
            <li> I had gone online and taken the quiz honestly and saw the product on sale</li>
            <li> I saw the product and thought it would be nice for me to treat my hair and give it a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> I own every product from the keratin line EXCEPT the 30 min boxed treatment set.</li>
            <li> People at zumba class today commented on how nice my hair looked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If nothing else, they are amusing.    </li>
            <li> If you are trying to save money doing your own smoothing treatment instead of spending $200+ at a salon, this product is not the answer.  </li>
            <li> and since I was laid off of work I wanted hair to look nice for interviews but also needed to save money and compared to a salon smoothing treatment of $200</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d looked at these reviews before I bought this product; however I had good hopes since I&#x27;m generally satisfied with Suave&#x27;s products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had I had a salon keratin treatment, but I didn&#x27;t expect those kind of results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this formula stacks up against the kind they use in salons, but I do know how my skills and techniques stack up against a hairdresser in a salon-</li>
            <li> had I had a salon keratin treatment, but I didn&#x27;t expect those kind of results.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this formula stacks up against the kind they use in salons, but I do know how my skills and techniques stack up against a hairdresser in a salon-</li>
            <li> I also knew not to use any kind of hair bows or hair ties or put my hair up in a ponytail, as this would put a crease in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Her advice: leave this kind of conditioning to the professionals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a three star review because I can not make an honest determination about ths product.  </li>
            <li> this was the better option and they made it sound so wonderful and look so easy on the ads on TV.  </li>
            <li> be sure to give the age, gender, and ethnicity of the person who had the reaction, says FDA scientist Wendy Good, Ph.D. Good, who analyzes reports about problems with cosmetics, says that information is important because it can help scientists spot trends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My top rated hair dresser (who even has done celebrities hair) looked at the package and ingredients  and told me that he couldn&#x27;t believe this was packaged to where this was something good to make hair healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> Luckily I had some great argan oil that helped alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a very strong smell like a perm.</li>
            <li> Well the steps are very easy , just follow directions and continue.</li>
            <li> Product, though smelly, was very easy to put on.  </li>
            <li> the stuff is very strong smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and there is a very strong chance that Unilever will deny the extent of damage</li>
            <li> From the advertising, I thought it would be good thing--moisturizing and smoothing--but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print to see that it was basically a perm.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap way to do a good treatment on your hair.</li>
            <li> Since its safe to get the Keratin treatment I received every 30 days, I thought this would be a nice transition or pick-me-up from my salon treatment.  </li>
            <li> have very fine, curly, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> A REAL KERATIN treatment (of good quality, like the Copola keratin treatment, which is the one my stylist uses) doesn&#x27;t need to be done in a well ventalated area because you aren&#x27;t putting anything harmful on your hair and it smells really good.</li>
            <li> It did straighten my hair and it was actually kind of nice and smooth for two days.  </li>
            <li> ANd the rest of my hair is not even very smooth</li>
            <li> If the product works for you then great but please go into this knowing it is a chemical relaxer and by the way the part of the treatment with keratin also has large amounts of peroxide.</li>
            <li> followed the instructions very precisely, and used a stopwatch at each interval to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave the products in for more than the recommended time.  </li>
            <li> But I have never color treated my hair or permed and my hair is really healthy.</li>
            <li> and after I did so my hair looked so shiny and smooth!</li>
            <li> this has helped someone :)</li>
            <li> But I love my curls, they tend to frizz and cling to my head.</li>
            <li> I have had several Keratin treatments and they work wonderful!!  </li>
            <li> I was in love with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;However</li>
            <li> This product promised smoother hair with more defined.</li>
            <li> When I read the packaging I was okay to go as none of the \\&quot;do not use\\&quot; applied to me.</li>
            <li> The rest was a leap of faith and I am glad I did it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all satisfied, and will be calling the 800 number before I go to work tomorrow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so many pour reviews, haven&#x27;t read anything suave</li>
            <li> Leave cream on for 15 min, if no inflammation treatment is safe.</li>
            <li> They teach students to do this service safely and correctly.</li>
            <li> I tried to straighten it with my iron and felt I was doing even more damage</li>
            <li> (Although that is how most of us find our we&#x27;re allergic to things like, say, antibiotics or bees.)&lt;br</li>
            <li> As with most of you  this product damaged my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is not 100% but much much better.  </li>
            <li> , perms don&#x27;t make your hair better as were the claims advertised by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably rinsed for more than 5 minutes after the Step 1 process.  </li>
            <li> Ok, deal with it.  </li>
            <li> It worked safely for me.</li>
            <li> After researching keratin treatments more online</li>
            <li> I have some of the best deep conditioners on the market and nothing is working.  </li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about two weeks into the product and am still finding a dramatically shortened blow dry/flat iron time - I would love it</li>
            <li> If I figure out how to get rid of this smell without risking ruining my hair (more) I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> So glad my gamble worked out.</li>
            <li> I had curly frizzy healthy hair before using this product.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a better person than I am.  </li>
            <li> I have dyed, cut, curled, braided, weaved, and extended my hair in many dubious and regretful ways.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how many, \\&quot;what was</li>
            <li> If she had, she would have had bald spots on top.</li>
            <li> My hair is healthy, wavy, color treated, but NOT bleached; and had been colored 4 weeks when I did the strand test.</li>
            <li> Being made by Suave makes it seem more \\&quot;safe\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My suggestion embrace your curls, love them.</li>
            <li> I was searching online for a antidote to this treatment, some sort of magic reversal.</li>
            <li> Okay</li>
            <li> , everything went okay, so I proceeded.</li>
            <li> well it WAS healthy.</li>
            <li> I thought it was OK for an at home treatment.</li>
            <li> Trust me, and DO NOT try it, even if your hair is healthy.</li>
            <li> and I am so embarrassed I have to wear it in a bun to avoid answering more questions</li>
            <li> I have coarse,frizzy hair and this made it much more manageable.</li>
            <li> It did nothing but make my hair look better.</li>
            <li> My hair was healthy except for the flyaways and lack of body.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m sure with all the combing of the product through my hair during step 1</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> Way better to err on the side of caution.  </li>
            <li> Shame on you SUAVE for damaging the hair of so many women.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, I am glad I did not read the reviews, because I had no problems at all with this product.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my hair looks so much better.  </li>
            <li> On top of that I am gray and color my hair as well which makes it even dryer..  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been better.</li>
            <li> I love playing with my hair</li>
            <li> 2 thumbs up!:)</li>
            <li> I love it ,</li>
            <li> but they are more tamed.</li>
            <li> i believe it will help my frizz even more.</li>
            <li> Please read all waring on side of the box because there are many cons</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m SO glad I did.</li>
            <li> I have an appointment to cut most of my hair off.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE my hair after using this.</li>
            <li> , I will have a better idea of the longetivity of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> gave it four stars because my hair was still a bit frizzy although it was much better after blow drying than before I used the product.</li>
            <li> and I have to have one more of each</li>
            <li> It was mostly out</li>
            <li> My fiancée assured me it will be okay.</li>
            <li> ALL the hair around the top of my head, around my face and under was breaking, falling out, and felt like. . .  </li>
            <li> When I showed my house mate (a woman who has colored her hair many times)</li>
            <li> I grow it out to donate to locks of love.</li>
            <li> Like the 3million lawsuit with Nutella the lady said the company claimed it was healthy...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am glad I did not go sit somewhere to wait out the 20 minutes because I would&#x27;ve had a bald head.</li>
            <li> I tried this product because so many salon clients were asking about it.  </li>
            <li> will make it look okay.</li>
            <li> I was pleased.</li>
            <li> but I always have to pay more than $10</li>
            <li> so I was thinking sure why not try it..</li>
            <li> you are better off straighening it</li>
            <li> hair came out smooth!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more involved process than just an at-home hair-coloring treatmnet.</li>
            <li> and I thought, huh I would love to have nice smooth shiny hair</li>
            <li> When I loaned it to a friend with wavy hair it worked better for her.</li>
            <li> had used Suave products for most of my life</li>
            <li> , I urge to visit this Facebook page (see link below) for more stories and information.  </li>
            <li> You can also learn more</li>
            <li> Again, it&#x27;s excellent resource and people are posting daily.    </li>
            <li> To sincerely express empathy and sympathy, to</li>
            <li> there are many.</li>
            <li> As others have pointed out, it&#x27;s more of a home permanent than a 30-day \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; kit.  </li>
            <li> my hair was way more manageable in the morning</li>
            <li> I had to trim my ends to see if that would make it better.  </li>
            <li> so I would advise making sure you have a record of it.</li>
            <li> She had to have awlful layers added to the top of her hair</li>
            <li> I bemoaned the fact that I wasn&#x27;t able to do some work on my laptop while straightening my hair, which I can do when I go to the salon to have it done.</li>
            <li> so I assumed it was safe for me to use.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to take a team of experts to get my hair in shape again.</li>
            <li> except reimburse me for the product and send me some free samples which doesn&#x27;t help me because I have to CUT ALL MY HAIR OFF NOW!).</li>
            <li> so it sounded okay.  </li>
            <li> It felt and looked better after one use so that increased my expectation for this product.</li>
            <li> I had healthy hair before using this.</li>
            <li> like it says, also I wish I could do it again before 3 months but (after reading everyone&#x27;s horror stories) I will make sure to wait 3 months just to be safe.</li>
            <li> The hair that did not fall out have lost all shine and are way more frizzy than when I started.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I was pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> in all I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I went in to my hairdresser and she put many of their conditioners in my hair hoping she could save it.</li>
            <li> As for me, I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the product burns if it gets on your scalp.</li>
            <li> I thought this might be interesting.  </li>
            <li> While this product seems to have made my hair a bit more relaxed, it is not something I would use again.  </li>
            <li> My hair is falling out on top of everything.</li>
            <li> Since none of the warnings applied to me, I thought the product would be okay for my hair.  </li>
            <li> May everyone get well and back to health soon, my best wishes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why so many are having problems.</li>
            <li> Keratin would make my hair so healthy...</li>
            <li> again washed 4 more times.  </li>
            <li> Had 3 inches cut off, a Malibu(gently clarifies hair of most residue),a conditioning treatment and</li>
            <li> I am more focused on the headache and scalp pain</li>
            <li> so it broke a bit on top</li>
            <li> Step 1 is the most important!</li>
            <li> Self, Your hair is healthy and you won&#x27;t have those problems.....</li>
            <li> It could not be flat-ironed, blow-dried smooth, or even combed!</li>
            <li> I like many others writing a review for this product</li>
            <li> Pick something else with a better rating or just spring for an in salon treatment.</li>
            <li> I tried the Keratin Infusion 30 day Smoothing Kit and have to say I was pleasantly pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I just used this product, thinking Keratin good for my hair, right?</li>
            <li> For the price you pay for the kit, I&#x27;d recommend a really good flat iron and a great oil pre-conditioner, like CHI&#x27;s Silk Infusion</li>
            <li> BE AWARE!!!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about the product</li>
            <li> When I requested this as part of the Amazon Vine Program, I was VERY excited.</li>
            <li> I went straight for Step 2; and saturated my hair with that much more pleasant smelling cream.  </li>
            <li> I went straight for Step 2; and saturated my hair with that much more pleasant smelling cream.  </li>
            <li> and I have to say I got a pretty good result.</li>
            <li> But you can get good results from it; if you&#x27;re aware of what&#x27;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But you can get good results from it; if you&#x27;re aware of what&#x27;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product on my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and it came out beautiful.  </li>
            <li> hair was so much alive and beautiful before.</li>
            <li> results were pretty good.</li>
            <li> It drys beautifully and silky soft, all by itself!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was excited!  </li>
            <li> My hair became more easy to manage, you could comb through it without any problem and that is never happens.</li>
            <li> I should have known better as soon as I smelled the strong chemical smell of the product.</li>
            <li> For me, it wasn&#x27;t an easy process for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;First, the product smells SOOO</li>
            <li> but my hair was one of my better assets and thought this product would help even more making it smooth and shinier.  </li>
            <li> Also, I felt more comfortable using this product because every time I get my hair cut my stylist is always raving about how healthy my hair is, which the packaging says not to use this if you have damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I wish I could take a magic wand and bring back the beautiful hair that many have lost in this process.  </li>
            <li> On top of the leave in conditioner they prodvide in the kit, I also had to use an oil serum to smooth my hair out.</li>
            <li> and it was becoming elastic(like</li>
            <li> I just got back from getting my hair cut where my stylist said my hair felt incredible and was so shiny.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Within seconds after putting the product into my hair, I noticed my hair shriveling up and becoming &#x27;gummy&#x27;</li>
            <li> I am glad I did use it because my hair looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> I have had professional Keratin treatment and thought it was great</li>
            <li> - I washed my hair today and used the Keratin shampoo and conditioner and my hair looks longer as the curls are more manageable and smooth.</li>
            <li> My wavy hair is smooth, more manageable and easier to style.</li>
            <li> Your detailed reviews have helped many others like myself, NOT want to try this treatment anymore.  </li>
            <li> So far it looks great, I&#x27;m waiting to wash it out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> I took the test online to make sure that my hair was eligible for this product and fortunately it was.</li>
            <li> Now, at 31 days post-use (which, if you&#x27;ll notice is more than the kit promises), I have smooth hair with the body</li>
            <li> The rest of my hair is ok and frizz free</li>
            <li> I have not been able to secure the product in stores or online so that in the hope I could get a box with directions.  </li>
            <li> I really understand the stress of not having good, well managed hair.</li>
            <li> Keratin is good for your hair, and so in theory there&#x27;s no way you can really damage it using Keratin.</li>
            <li> And there is good reason for the cost, not to mention why real keratin smoothing/straightening processes are done by *professionals* in salons...    </li>
            <li> and I doubt there is really anyone whose hair is in as good as condition as it was before they used this.</li>
            <li> I thought i was gonna go to school with nice fresh looking hair</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, all she really got was what a great beautician can get from her hair with a good straight blow out and great flat iron.</li>
            <li> I am about to take a vacation to the Caribbean awarded by my company for the top 100 in the company, so I was excited to use this product to eliminate the frizz from the humidity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done many different processes and honestly I was very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> As I rinsed out the product there was a significant amount of hair in the drain, more than ever.</li>
            <li> a full out PERM!</li>
            <li> By the end of it my hair was more frizzy than it was originally and my hair</li>
            <li> My hair curls easily and frizzed in humidity.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> My hair tends to frizz easily as well.  </li>
            <li> This is definately not a product that can be reversed easily.  </li>
            <li> It has helped many in seeing what kind of product this really is-</li>
            <li> i used this product because i knew people who had really damaged hair who used the product and their hair came out amazing, so i figured why not, my hair is really healthy.</li>
            <li> It made it so easy to do my hair.</li>
            <li> There is a very bold hair cut in my future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...</li>
            <li> The smell of Cream 1 is so overwhelmingly strong that it lasted in my bathroom for almost 2 days (with windows opened).  </li>
            <li> , I strongly suggest you do.  </li>
            <li> I strongly suggest you stay away from it if your hair is highlighted or lifted - which is stated in the directions.</li>
            <li> This is to strong to be sold in stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so strong</li>
            <li> On the flip side the Suave Keratin Conditioner for colored hair is spectacular (which is why I got suckered into doing this in the first place).  </li>
            <li> she spends her time, being beautiful and as i speak this commercial</li>
            <li> I have used keratinique last year, which was much more money, but an excellent product, very time consuming though.  </li>
            <li> and I also didn&#x27;t leave it in the full 15 minutes but rinsed after 12 just to make sure it didn&#x27;t go overkill</li>
            <li> and it seemed fine.  </li>
            <li> My hair was fine before I used this</li>
            <li> I figured it would be fine.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair but alot of it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re still willing to take the risk, than be sure that you&#x27;re also willing to sport a bob or a pixie cut this summer, able to creatively cover up bald patches, or can afford to pay the hundreds of dollars to a correction specialist/stylist at a reputable salon.    </li>
            <li> I have fine hair but a lot of it, hair was almost to my waist</li>
            <li> I have found reviewers that say the product did fine with them.</li>
            <li> I tried the strand test and everything appeared to work just fine</li>
            <li> I am lucky that I can wear a hat to work because my hair won&#x27;t do anything!  </li>
            <li> , I trusted that a product on the shelf was safe and mild.</li>
            <li> I read the fine print, followed the directions and thought that I would have \\&quot;smooth and silky hair\\</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s little to no wonder that it worked great!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the final results, but still have to work at smoothing my hair with a  large curling iron.</li>
            <li> HUGE mistake.</li>
            <li> It fit the criteria mentioned on the box.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would make it easier to have the smooth look.</li>
            <li> I had to straighten it lightly</li>
            <li> and I did with curl free as well</li>
            <li> My hair was smooth and lustrous again after two uses.</li>
            <li> I go sulfate free, etc.</li>
            <li> Also, my hair was not shiney or smooth.</li>
            <li> I dread seeing my hair if it is supposed to be smooth now.</li>
            <li> I too read the product as \\&quot;it will smooth out and make your cuticle lay flat\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It was such a great deal that I bought about 10 kits.</li>
            <li> I should have known by the smell and all the warnings, but I had a free afternoon and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Suaves keratin shampoo and conditioner along with the leave-in conditioner is fantastic for control.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help smooth my hair  </li>
            <li> This product should not be available at drug store/</li>
            <li> The roots of my hair are smooth</li>
            <li> I thought this product was to smooth and get rid of frizzy hair</li>
            <li> From now on I will use the sulfate free Keratin products and see what happens after the infusion kit wears off.  </li>
            <li> I follow the steps to the T. After washing out the product, her hair was smooth n manageable.  </li>
            <li> But to my surprise my hair remained sleek, smooth and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product worked fantastic and even if I don&#x27;t use my hair straightener</li>
            <li> No issue really, was actually nice.</li>
            <li> I had been growing it out for quite some time and was actually quite proud of it.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe it is still available.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely, and none of the precautions applied to me..</li>
            <li> hair fit all the direction&#x27;s condition, in that it hadn&#x27;t had a perm for months, no coloring for years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use a curling iron on it to smooth it out, but that may have made my hair frizzier as time went</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so smooth</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT*</li>
            <li> I wish I could give more info, but just don&#x27;t feel it is worth a gamble at this time.</li>
            <li> I am going to end up with a very short cut eventually, which does not make me happy.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still wavy, it didn&#x27;t smooth it at all.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions precisely.  </li>
            <li> I bought this based on the ad that stated that it had as good of results as a professional keratin treatment...</li>
            <li> My hair is generally healthy and I get a lot of compliments on it, now I&#x27;m getting recommendations to hair salons and short hair styles that will look good on me.</li>
            <li> Seeing your long, once beautiful hair fall out in the shower is heartbreaking.  </li>
            <li> I tried this product 5 days ago, and thus far am delighted with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I headed straight for the shower to rinse out the solution and encountered the loss of more and more hair continuing to come out in clumps in the shower.</li>
            <li> but then again i didnt expect something that supposed to be good for you to completely ruin my hair.</li>
            <li> I now have to cut my long beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> Every time I comb my hair the comb is full of hair, like FULL of hair!</li>
            <li> I made sure that I followed the instructions regarding whether the product was right for me.  </li>
            <li> but I really appreciate the warnings!!!   </li>
            <li> it really needs to be pulled asap!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very glad that I did not have my hair fall out like other reviewers experienced, but I still did not have a positive result.</li>
            <li> I used the flat iron, and it did look great for two days.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to have silky smooth hair.</li>
            <li> This is also very important for a first time with a product...</li>
            <li> It smells exactly like a perm, and I&#x27;m sure if you curled your hair while doing the treatment, you&#x27;d have curly hair.</li>
            <li> My advice to anyone interested in this product: DO NOT buy this if you love your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought it in January and was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I just wish it had more consistent results for every one because not I&#x27;m nervous to try it again in three months.</li>
            <li> She is just as excited by her hair as I am by mine.</li>
            <li> well after the first step my hair was messed up, i continued in hope that it would be better once i finish all of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am familiar with keratin treatments as I&#x27;ve had them done before.</li>
            <li> All in all pretty satisfied but may not be for everyone - depends on your hair type and your expectations I guess.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try the product.  </li>
            <li> it is still pretty healthy.  </li>
            <li> all I could do was laugh!  </li>
            <li> To learn more about what exactly you would be putting in your hair, visit the FB page for a comprehensive list of chemicals.    </li>
            <li> and I had better results with this $12 kit than the $35 hot oil treatment at my salon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll have to buy a wig.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product until I read the reviews.</li>
            <li> and I was excited for the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So when I heard about the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit, I got excited.  </li>
            <li> However, the damage it does to your hair isn&#x27;t worth any amount of money!</li>
            <li> I also remember being told that virgin hair does not usually respond as well to keratin treatments because chemically treated hair is more porous and absorbs the keratin better.  </li>
            <li> What I saw on the commercial and on the box, it seemed like a good fit.</li>
            <li> 2- Relaxers have to be applied methodically and cleanly with a tint brush about 1/2 an inch away from the scalp, leaving the ends out till the end.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve come clean about the treatment, but I guess I worry about what those salon girls will say when you tell them you did an at-home treatment</li>
            <li> I chose to try this product simply for the convenience of it - the idea of being able to do a smoothing treatment in my home, on my own schedule, was preferable to making an appointment at the salon.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt better :) and my old perm is now straight(yayyyy).</li>
            <li> I usually flat iron my hair about every day very lightly as my hair is naturally very straight, but I didn&#x27;t need to do so this time surprisingly.</li>
            <li> I have had several salon keratin treatments over the past couple of years and the results were wonderful - shiny, sleek, gorgeous hair.  </li>
            <li> Phyto and Rene Furterer carry  vitamins (with biotin) that will most certainly promote growth.  </li>
            <li> Once the stylist rinsed it out, she could tell that I had lost a large amount of hair and when she tried, she was not be able to brush, comb or finger comb it either.</li>
            <li> She did use a special shampoo and it did help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within seconds of applying the product to my hair, it literally melted right before my eyes!  </li>
            <li> Had I read the reviews first, I would not have been brave enough to try this product.  </li>
            <li> Hi I have damaged my hair so many times therefor I am really leary about what I use on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a safe bet to say that anything with the words \\&quot;Smoothing\\&quot; in it or promising long-term results is going to be hardcore.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be fun to have smooth hair like in the commercials, for a change.  </li>
            <li> They sent me a check for $12 to refund my purchase and then sent me coupons for $30 worth of free Nexus stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair is not permed, color treated, or red, so I was hoping to have a good outcome.</li>
            <li> I did lose a comb full of hair</li>
            <li> A person with straight, shiny, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> but I kind of feel like its the old saying...</li>
            <li> If you want a true Brazilian treatment or a Chi relaxer treatment done, call your stylist and pay the $100</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s straight, shiny and looks a 100 times better than it did before.</li>
            <li> When I saw the Suave Keratine commercial, I have to admit that my hopes were up thinking that maybe this is a product that if marketed and tested had to be good.  </li>
            <li> wanted to wait until the full 30 days were up before I wrote a review.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Suave Keratin Infusion Smoothing kit after I saw a commercial and loved the girls hair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really remember how many minutes it took me to put step 1 in my hair</li>
            <li> A good haircut will be next on my list.  </li>
            <li> The cuticle sealer smelled better and the amount given is very generous.</li>
            <li> This product surprisingly does not even mention proper ventilation.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to relax my hair just make it in better condition not worse</li>
            <li> When I did this it worked better, but I still feel like my hair had too much product in it.</li>
            <li> - the chances of producing true keratin treatment results are slim.    </li>
            <li> Clearly this is a \\&quot;use it at your own risk\\&quot; sort of product.  </li>
            <li> As many others have said I really wished I would have read these reviews before trying this product.</li>
            <li> but I have a whole layer on the top of my head</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say if it lasts the full thirty days as I just did all of this tonight</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it lasts the full 30 days</li>
            <li> Throw this product away, it was a nightmare come true for me today.  </li>
            <li> I get it trimmed religiously and use really good products on it.  </li>
            <li> My hair was the only thing i loved about my look, and its gone.</li>
            <li> I have always had medium length hair, because I don&#x27;t look good with short hair.  </li>
            <li> Smooth,shiny, and light, and, healthy, and new, and I felt like my hair was born.</li>
            <li> It may sound easy but anything that requires putting chemical in ur haor and using hot tools right after shpuld be done by someone licensed.</li>
            <li> full well, that I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones.  </li>
            <li> Using the kit itself is pretty easy-</li>
            <li> so I can have straight hair for a whole year, maybe more!  </li>
            <li> &quot; I would suggest this product, but you CAN&#x27;T use it if you have used high-lift color or your hair is damaged or breaking, so read the box!My hair felt kind of \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; when I was styling it, but once it was dry it felt very silky and nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but thought those wanting to try a straightening kit for the first time might be interested to know about this kit.  </li>
            <li> (Luckily it wasn&#x27;t all of my bangs.)</li>
            <li> Luckily mine wasn&#x27;t to the roots</li>
            <li> but I feel like I got lucky.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t super over powering.  </li>
            <li> I was just lucky that my hair didn&#x27;t break off.  </li>
            <li> again I feel I just got lucky</li>
            <li> I may not be so lucky if I use it again.  </li>
            <li> My hair is continuing to be straight over 3 weeks later, which is great - and we have been having a lot of rain and humidity.</li>
            <li> but I was expecting nice, smooth hair that would last \\&quot;30</li>
            <li> i quickly rinsed it off of my head and came to read the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Her hair is more healthier and vibrant, and not tangled.</li>
            <li> I am lucky I have a lot of hair</li>
            <li> The top and main ingredient is ammonium thioglycolate.  </li>
            <li> Keratin treatments leave your hair soft and smooth and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> We had a healthy dose of high humidity for 3 days and you could tell the hair was trying to frizz up again.</li>
            <li> I was very surprised though because this is the first time i used any kind of product.</li>
            <li> It feels healthy and normal.</li>
            <li> In the am I woke up to hair that was way more flatten than my normal chaotic hair in the mornings...</li>
            <li> I have contacted and lawyer that is very interested in taking my case and will be meeting with him soon.</li>
            <li> I thought that maybe when I was able to wash it and use all of my mega conditioners and styling products that my hair would look normal.  </li>
            <li> I used the product as directed, and my hair is pretty smooth.  </li>
            <li> So if you like very straight silky hair this is the product!</li>
            <li> It may give you good results, but in the long run, it will damage your hair and your health.  </li>
            <li> The warnings on the box probably would have made me think twice about using it, but I LOVE reading hair product reviews before I try something new.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the results - just wish they could find a way to make it a bit less damaging.</li>
            <li> THANKS SUAVE!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I applied the product as instructed and within the first 5 minutes, after the product was applied, I was combing through my hair while it was processing, and clumps of hair started to come out of my head, and my hair started to shrivel up like someone lit it on fire!</li>
            <li> For a quick fix I ended up spending hundreds of dollars and completely lost my confidence with the loss of my long, beautiful hair.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the cuticle seal cream and the heat defense leave-in conditioner both have a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thankfully I found a very good Keratin Rx treatment that helped bring my hair back to some normalcy but it&#x27;s not the same.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight, smooth, and shiny.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and continued with the sealing cream thinking it would calm it.</li>
            <li> I used the third step of the kit and my hair looks amazing</li>
            <li> Since I had success with that at home relaxer</li>
            <li> My vanity got the best of me and I was tired of having frizzy curly hair.</li>
            <li> Thank you to everyone that has posted their own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> Busy days, I can pony it and on evenings out, the curls were cute.</li>
            <li> I used my own big comb.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought that this was like a deep conditioning treatment</li>
            <li> 2 hours and $60 worth of treatments, she ended up chopping about 3 inches of hair off the ends of all of my layers, and now it basically looks like I have a mullet.  </li>
            <li> The waves actually looked nice, I thought.  </li>
            <li> fortunate in that my hair can handle more than a bit of abuse, I just don&#x27;t abuse it regularly.  </li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> The results the second time were not as effective and seemed to not take.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had a real Keratin treatment in a salon 6 weeks prior and loved the result.  </li>
            <li> The chemical mixture is nothing more than an old school</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, so I was able to use the smoothing cream (#1 bottle) and cuticle seal cream (#2 bottle) 2 times, which means I got hair that looked professionally straightened hair for 2 months.  </li>
            <li> On top of all the bald spots she said that my hair was fried at the top of my head and was really worried that the follicles had been damaged and there was a possibility that it would not grow back.</li>
            <li> She sent me home with $80 worth of at home treatment for damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> But for a price tag of about $11, I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> A salon can treat color-treated hair and may be worth the $.</li>
            <li> My sister spends hundreds to have hers done professionally, and personally I think mine looks Better!!</li>
            <li> If you purchased this product, it is probably because you&#x27;re like me and want a great product that helps tame frizzy or unruly hair and do what the product advertises.</li>
            <li> My hair was very healthy and now it is so dry and frazzled no amount of oil or serum</li>
            <li> This was my first experience trying something so bold.  </li>
            <li> And to think I thought well maybe it gets rid of the loose hair to help make it smooth and straight only to keep having more and more and more fall out.</li>
            <li> At first I really wasn&#x27;t impressed at all as my hair did not look shiny in the least</li>
            <li> I waited, hoping that other people would have good experiences with it.</li>
            <li> I took the time to flat iron it and it looked nice for the two days that I couldn&#x27;t wash it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just a matter of finding the right treatment and the right stylist.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;melting\\&quot; right off.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> before you use it on your hair, I went to the Suave site and took the quiz to see if it is right for you hair [...] .</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know who to turn to anymore, i have even tried meds, a massage, acupuncture, exercise, eating right, herbs, all with NO</li>
            <li> I thought it sounded right for me.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just hair right?  </li>
            <li> so I rinsed it out right away.  </li>
            <li> I am right there with you.</li>
            <li> Visit [...] before deciding if the product is right for you...    </li>
            <li> You have to answer a lot of questions to see if it right</li>
            <li> During the treatment i could tell a difference right away.</li>
            <li> it couldnt hurt right?</li>
            <li> just by looking at it are going to MELT right into your hand when you run your fingers through it (see pictures on FB).  </li>
            <li> Just so you know you have the right to sue.</li>
            <li> I AM LIVID AT SUAVE RIGHT NOW.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like this product needs to be taken off the shelves and the right people need to know.</li>
            <li> I should have figured it out right away when I opened the tube</li>
            <li> To those who have had positive results, one word...LUCKY!</li>
            <li> The most important thing to remember is do NOT lose track of time and leave it in too long.  </li>
            <li> , I went to Sally&#x27;s and bought about $70 worth of super strengthening and moisturizing treatments and nothing really works.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this product is going to make your hair look any better if you are lucky enough to still have all of your hair you started with.  </li>
            <li> as I got older and the hairs on the top of my head were a bit more dry and kinked</li>
            <li> Now i have to cut my long hair off and pay a stylist to do some kind of conditioning treatment</li>
            <li> Firstly, I came very close to purchasing and experimenting with this product, because I love trying new products.  </li>
            <li> First of all it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of smoothing, and second and most importantly, it makes you bald.</li>
            <li> so I figured Amazon would be the best because this is where I saw so many bad reviews</li>
            <li> Ulta Salon offers the Kera Straight treatment, while many salons offer the Coppola treatment.  </li>
            <li> and it was still super straight  after a month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on the 5th month and still loving my straight</li>
            <li> Have to admit, was worried about using this product due to the reviews on here, but since my hair is very healthy I decided to take a chance...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s going to last anywhere near as long as the Salon version; nor do I expect it to come anywhere close to the awesome that is the Coppola Keratin treatments.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s going to last anywhere near as long as the Salon version; nor do I expect it to come anywhere close to the awesome that is the Coppola Keratin treatments.  </li>
            <li> and im sure im not the only one feeling this way right now.</li>
            <li> Based on the name having \\&quot;keratin\\&quot; and \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; in it, I assumed that this was a deep conditioning product that would smooth down my fly aways.  </li>
            <li> not too sure if it&#x27;s because my hair is super frizzy and I have long</li>
            <li> I started to apply, luckily to the underside of my hair first, I noticed some hair collecting in the comb, but didn&#x27;t seem like too much.  </li>
            <li> I had to cut it very very</li>
            <li> and then it was very straight.</li>
            <li> I read the fine print, I realized it was completely inappropriate for a person with my hair</li>
            <li> I feel this is great for us Hispanic people with really unmanageable, frizzy, dry, puffy hair needing a relaxer type product that leaves your hair looking natural and non broom-looking.</li>
            <li> More importantly, the kit is devoid of any neutralizing agent, which is one of its biggest flaws!  </li>
            <li> The hair at my crown (a good number of strands) sticks straight up due to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The straightening cream had a very strong smell that lingered long after I had rinsed the cream out of my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The flyaways that are normally at the top of my hair are smooth and flat now.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The flyaways that are normally at the top of my hair are smooth and flat now.  </li>
            <li> and that is okay as I just wanted it somewhat straight and smooth as ANYTHING is better than my really dry, curly, frizzy, puffy, damaged, short hair</li>
            <li> Seriously how many woman now days have not done some kind of chemical treatment to their hair?</li>
            <li> Even if you have taken the \\&quot;quiz\\&quot; that Suave has provided in order to see if this product is right for you, and the results are positive, it more than likely ISN&#x27;T!  </li>
            <li> , my hair look good the first 2 days, but after the first shower my hair got a little curly and my tips had lots of split ends.</li>
            <li> My hair is very straight, so it didn&#x27;t do much except apparently make it more brittle</li>
            <li> My hair felt amazing even wet.  </li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used this, I went to a dinner and my hair did not kink or tangle despite humid conditions.</li>
            <li> Now two weeks later, my hair looks even better than it did after I first used the treatment.</li>
            <li> The first ingredient is AMMONIUM THIOGLYCOLATE which is perm solution..</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product there were no reviews for it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t check it out first.</li>
            <li> Anyhow I cut about 20 hairs from differents parts of my head and did,the kit on those first.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re weary about using it just do a strands  test first and stay away from your scalp.</li>
            <li> will most likely be using this product again!!!</li>
            <li> I also couldn&#x27;t wash or surf in the ocean for 3 days... and my hair had a waxy feel and a funny smell to it for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Thanks Suave!</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair (with good results) for the past 20 years, so I was not afraid to try this product.  </li>
            <li> I am getting my hair cut tomorrow (not planned, but it may be the only way to save it and be able to style it) and I am praying to the hair gods that she can perform a miracle.  </li>
            <li> When you wash you hair after doing a keratin treatment, it feels exactly like you&#x27;ve done NOTHING to your hair.</li>
            <li> If your hair needs smoothing or anti frizz, spend the money on a credible treatment, or look up home remidies, like olive oil, if you can&#x27;t afford a professional.</li>
            <li> Now I will only buy products at a salon and ask them if it&#x27;s safe for my hair.</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals is as potent as regular strength relaxer (NaOH- relaxer)  </li>
            <li> FIRST READ \\&quot;ALL\\&quot; OF THE ONE STAR REVIEWS....</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me!</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly to the tee</li>
            <li> I realized what a dummy I was for doing it in the first place.  </li>
            <li> If I had used the hot iron, it probably would have been straighter and smoother.  </li>
            <li> I now have my first migraine</li>
            <li> I am sure you have saved alot of women from the same pain you have endured.</li>
            <li> There is still about an inch of fried hair at the ends of the top layer of my hair but the stylist didn&#x27;t want to chop that off just yet because it would be ridiculously short and mullet-like.  </li>
            <li> I can barely afford my rent (hence the reason I bought this crummy Suave Keratin Treatment in the first place - thinking it would be a wise alternative to some deep conditioning treatment at a salon.  </li>
            <li> Well, this product undid all of that, and probably made it even more damaged than it was when I was heat styling daily.  </li>
            <li> so my hair was pretty curly.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and have never had any problems with over the counter hair treatments, hair dyes etc.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s exactly what my hair looks like, like relaxed hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This may be exactly what some people are looking for, but it should be advertised as a straightening treatment, not a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> If you really want to use this product, please do a strand test!</li>
            <li> I hope this smoothness does last the 30 days. :)</li>
            <li> I am Hispanic (Mexican) and I love this SUAVE Keratin Smoothing product as I have used relaxers and they just make my hair look like The Flintstone type hair or like a broom...</li>
            <li> At first I thought it burned my scalp</li>
            <li> I applied it exactly as instructed, 2 weeks ago, and I have no idea what to do</li>
            <li> I am writing this post to say THANK YOU to all those brave women who wrote their negative reviews about this product.  </li>
            <li> I thank God that before making a purchase I read the reviews first.</li>
            <li> This product has left too many women in tears and with feeling a hopelessness...</li>
            <li> Thanks, Suave!</li>
            <li> Well, my hair was never straighter and never felt as soft and smooth after I blew it out.  </li>
            <li> Boy do I wish I read them first because all I thought about was my hair was going to come out</li>
            <li> The entire texture of my hair has changed, it almost feels like there is a coating still on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to see reviews first....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had Keratin treatments in the past (last time 18 months ago) with excellent results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 4 months since I&#x27;ve colored my hair and overall my hair is really healthy.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> Her exact words were \\&quot;It</li>
            <li> should work pretty well</li>
            <li> My hair at the roots is smooth and soft for about an inch</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolute garbage!</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS TO SMOOTH OUT MY HAIR AND MAKE IT SOFT AND SHINY</li>
            <li> Be sure read the responses to her review starting from the newest first (using the sort function).  </li>
            <li> Or perhaps you&#x27;ve seen a scene from a movie -there are many- where a man is in a barber shop yelling and squirming in their seats with that white gunk burning their scalps begging the barber to get it off!)  </li>
            <li> There are also some sympathetic professionals (not affliated w/Unilever) who are following the page, and contributing their opinions and advice.  </li>
            <li> I got so many compliments on my hair especially the month after I used it.</li>
            <li> After I used it, my hair smelled great every day for at least one month.</li>
            <li> After a deep conditioning treatment and having 3 inches cut off I do not look any better.  </li>
            <li> I followed all of the instructions on the box and did exactly what the instructions said to.  </li>
            <li> I figured if it worked for Nicole Richie (because I am sure her hair is bleached blonde and probably coarser)</li>
            <li> i bought this and followed the directions exact.</li>
            <li> It actually burned the top layer of her hair off in a circle around the crown of her head.  </li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li> While I was still in the first steps of application, my hair began to literally melt and break off -</li>
            <li> Within the first 4 minutes of the first step being on my head my hair began to fry.</li>
            <li> The instructions state to run the comb through your hair with the first step of the product on it; I could not even get the comb through.</li>
            <li> i tried many different leave in masks</li>
            <li> I used the product like it says, three steps, wash first, rinse between each step</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe some things are better left to the professionals...</li>
            <li> Upon reading the directions and smelling the product it was evident</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT!</li>
            <li> We applied the product exactly as directed.</li>
            <li> It always worked wonderfully, but was so expensive ($400-$500)</li>
            <li> I made sure to start as close to the roots as possible and go all the way to the ends.  </li>
            <li> like many others my hair is ruined, I fell for the gimmick and since then have been emailing, phone calling with the Unilever Consumer Services, and they are sending me my money back for the product, coupons for products to help my hair-better not be Suave-and will \\&quot;look into reimbursing me for any purchases, trips to the salon\\&quot; in order to correct the damage.</li>
            <li> I did everything exactly as directed.  </li>
            <li> As soon as I opened the first tube, I smelled perm solution.  </li>
            <li> I went and got 3 more inches cut off(6 in total).  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first 48 hours, I washed with the Keratin Infusion shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I switched shampoo and conditioner midway through my first week to an intensive repair product.</li>
            <li> the other hand, I absolutely love the results of my hair!</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what is said it would.  </li>
            <li> but when I applied it to my whole head, tragedy struck!</li>
            <li> What a waste, and good thing</li>
            <li> However, I am lucky in that the damage is minimal compared to what most of you went through.  </li>
            <li> It is so easy to blow out, and its still really straight and extremely soft.  </li>
            <li> but right now my hair is as straight as it has ever been(when straightened by myself).</li>
            <li> My hair felt like it was shaved off right there, very close to my scalp.</li>
            <li> My hair has stayed smooth the whole 30 days, and I don&#x27;t know how much longer it will continue to stay smooth, since its time is up, but I will write a followup on this review later to let you</li>
            <li> (yes, I did assess the status of my hair before using, and based on their stylist recommendations, my hair was fine for this product), left it flat on top with frizzy, fried, split ends (about 4-5 inches worth).  </li>
            <li> If you want your hair straighted or smoothed out - go to a professional, it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> It was fairly brittle for the first few days, but I didn&#x27;t end up with too much breakage.</li>
            <li> However I assure you there are many relaxers and straighteners on the consumer shelves that are exactly the same if not worse.</li>
            <li> would think that the other reviews have to be exaggerating when they say their hair \\&quot;Melted\\&quot; or became \\&quot;Gummy\\&quot;, honestly if this didn&#x27;t happen to me</li>
            <li> I did not have to flat iron my hair, just a blow dry with the provided styling conditioner,which works great.</li>
            <li> To all the other women who state they love the product, I guess your some of the lucky ones.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, to make a long story short...DO NOT PUT THIS STUFF ON YOUR HAIR unless you want to look like a mop, and a very cheap mop at that.</li>
            <li> Right after I used the kit my hair did seem pretty dry and damaged - but it sure was straight.</li>
            <li> it pretty much does exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> this product completely fried my hair and now I have to use a special conditioner and cannot do anything to it.</li>
            <li> Better to sacrifice a small portion of hair than risk losing it all.&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago, I had the keratin treatment done to my hair, and it was straight with no blow-drying, shiny, and beautiful compared to the generally frizzy but mostly ok appearance it usually has.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this product because I had heard positive things about keratin.</li>
            <li> I am positive it will be nothing as discribed on the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I saw some review videos and those results were positive.</li>
            <li> and I had really positive results.</li>
            <li> I had hoped that the situation would change for the better after washing my hair &amp; giving it a good conditioner (my hair is more dry than oily) but unfortunately that didn&#x27;t help either.</li>
            <li> The product says my hair would be ok as long as not lightened.</li>
            <li> , my hair is flat, mostly strait, very damaged, and frizzy.</li>
            <li> Pretty much everything it said it would address, instead it caused for my hair.</li>
            <li> The top layer of my hair is about 2 inches long of just whacked offhair...</li>
            <li> Suave pretty much states that unless you have virgin hair don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> Not to mention that my hair is pretty much platinum now.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and colored but according to the directions safe for me to use.</li>
            <li> last longer)&gt;I&#x27;m fortunate in that my hair can handle more than a bit of abuse, I just don&#x27;t abuse it regularly.  </li>
            <li> But it dries so fast and so straight and shiny!</li>
            <li> However, with the grey hair it is much more course and frizzy now.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to present a review from the other perspective because this did great things for my hair.</li>
            <li> But by the third step, it actually felt more smooth.  </li>
            <li> My hair was still pretty full (I followed directions and combed the hair back to keep the fullness on my crown per the directions) and not flat on top.</li>
            <li> The first step went fine, but as I was washing out the second I noticed my hair coming out as I ran my fingers through it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summary:  3 out of 5 stars because the [[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]] does indeed smooth the hair but the extreme result and overpowering smell keeps it from being a product I can&#x27;t even like much less love.</li>
            <li> im doing deep conditioning treatments, went to a high end salon to see what could be done, and there is just nothin more than treating,</li>
            <li> It is time consuming and should not be done the day you&#x27;re going to a special occasion where you want to wow everyone with your straight hair.  </li>
            <li> I googled to see if that was normal, saw all these reviews, and washed my hair right away.  </li>
            <li> You must know that I have super naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li> After buying the product and doing the first step, I noticed that some hair did come out but not a lot and the dyed color was starting to go from med brown to light blond.  </li>
            <li> tried the Suave keratin treatment and 3 months later my hair is still smooth and straight!</li>
            <li> Started to dry, and it seemed most of my hair survived.  </li>
            <li> I have to first of all say that I&#x27;m very fortunate to not have some of the extreme results others have had ie.</li>
            <li> To the point I got 2 large and handfulls out when combing it.</li>
            <li> I had an accidental moment of smart.  </li>
            <li> I had an accidental moment of smart.  </li>
            <li> do not try this inexpensive new wonder for hair!!</li>
            <li> my hair could air dry pin straight, but I don&#x27;t think there is a product in this world that could make that happen :)</li>
            <li> but this products did just as good for far LESS money.</li>
            <li> I might consider using a professional next time though until I read some more positive reviews.</li>
            <li> slightly reduces wave/curl; makes hair silky soft; retains smoothness and straightness better after flat-ironing; inexpensive  To sum up the cons:  not a magical frizz eraser, must wait 3 months to touch up (or try a more effective straightener!), only marginally reduces wave.  </li>
            <li> After reading the instructions alone it should have thrown up huge red flags but as a consumer do you not read the ingredients in what you eat or put on your body?</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and did dry out some at first.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have much to spare.</li>
            <li> and I like it straight.</li>
            <li> So when I read all the warnings on the package I was really scared and hesitant to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> , that didn&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li> so I put the whole bottle on my hair</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t bring my hair to stick straight, but I didn&#x27;t want that either.</li>
            <li> You are doing what they might call a straight perm...</li>
            <li> My hair is generally straight but it tends to get frizzy and</li>
            <li> when you have a salon do your keratin treatment you do not have to leave your hair straight because it is not a perm.</li>
            <li> and you do not leave your hair straight</li>
            <li> When I was ready to try the treatment the reviews were rolling in</li>
            <li> I thought \\&quot;really, this seems like a nuclear reactor drill\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> stinkyness, just silky smooth hair, and the wait to get in the water is only 2 days.</li>
            <li> You CAN do a keratin treatment to damaged hair because the real keratin treatments correct damage to your hair.</li>
            <li> I am going to check with my stylist to see if a real keratin treatment would be helpful in reversing the damage or if I&#x27;m just going to have to cut my hair off.</li>
            <li> I really wish I would have found the reviews on this product before I used it</li>
            <li> and I really hope they pull this off store shelves.</li>
            <li> The one attempt I made to comb it, a whole bunch if hair came out.</li>
            <li> I think I would have ended up withbald spots if I combed it the whole time.</li>
            <li> I put that much oil in and my hair is STILL thirsty.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who meets the requirements for this product!</li>
            <li> I already had smooth hair, BUT it wasn&#x27;t as shiny as the suave commercial...</li>
            <li> Just straight and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I am stuck with straight and frizzy until my hair recovers or grows out or something.  </li>
            <li> HAHAHAHAHA...</li>
            <li> so much fell out.</li>
            <li> not what it really does \\&quot;straighten even the tightest curl to board straight and fry the ends\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> If you have any type of curly hair I really recommend you stay away from this product.  </li>
            <li> Thanks again</li>
            <li> and I know what and how much chemical abuse it can take.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious as to how they were able to help.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for your reviews</li>
            <li> but i am one of those people that complain about having too much hair.</li>
            <li> thanks Unilever.  </li>
            <li> So thanks to YOU, SUAVE, UNILEVER...</li>
            <li> I did not use this product but want to warn everyone of the dangers of a real keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> This product should really be pulled from the shelves.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely feel for you.</li>
            <li> the directions for this  product, and the requirements for what type of hair you should \\&quot;bring to the table\\&quot;  really scared me off.</li>
            <li> My hair became CURLIER at the ends, sticky to the touch, and absolutely embarrassing.</li>
            <li> so I really needed the heat-protection conditioner.</li>
            <li> I have done the real keratin treatment at hair salons, and I can assure you this is NOT a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> I will trying coloring again since the whole 30 days is up.  </li>
            <li> I will trying coloring again since the whole 30 days is up.  </li>
            <li> I have very wavy, frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> She has very curly hair</li>
            <li> Well I did not end up with pin straight hair</li>
            <li> I even recommended it to my friend who have very think wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> But there are places where its really damaged close to an inch from my scalpe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Go straight to step 2 and don&#x27;t risk your coiffure.  </li>
            <li> Go straight to step 2 and don&#x27;t risk your coiffure.  </li>
            <li> THANKS SO MUCH SUAVE.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much ,&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li> It was noticeably straight.  </li>
            <li> I am very upset about the results, and cant even believe this item is on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had blond straight hair about 3 inches below my shoulder.</li>
            <li> It has always been very curly</li>
            <li> it is working very well.</li>
            <li> Five years ago I did a straightening treatment and while it was sort of straight it wasn&#x27;t really.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and did the whole head. . .  </li>
            <li> I stopped and really looked.</li>
            <li> Also if Suave wants proof, I can send them the hair</li>
            <li> I am finding I do not have to shampoo very often - probably every 5 days or so</li>
            <li> so much for trying to grow my hair out.</li>
            <li> were everyone wants to sue over everything under the sun.</li>
            <li> but also really slimy feeling, in some parts.</li>
            <li> That wasn&#x27;t really what I wanted, but it also says it&#x27;s a \\&quot;30 day\\&quot; kit, which to me means \\&quot;temporary.\\</li>
            <li> It is very embarrassing</li>
            <li> and I got ready to use it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I CANT EVEN EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE USED.</li>
            <li> and I really trusted the brand.  </li>
            <li> It is also very time-consuming.</li>
            <li> The packaging on this product is very misleading.  </li>
            <li> My hair does not grow that fast anymore.  </li>
            <li> I think this is going to really gain momentum</li>
            <li> You will end up spending as much money in order to correct the damage this will do to your hair, if it can even be corrected.  </li>
            <li> This is a very misleading product</li>
            <li> Depending on how you look at it, doing this yourself can save you time and money because you don&#x27;t have to do it professionally, but for me it sort of cost me the same because I realized how much work I am actually able to do in one hour while someone else straightens my hair for me.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> I tried brushing it straight just as the directions said to do</li>
            <li> I went to my beautician that has done hair for over 20 years and she was in as much shock as me.</li>
            <li> I have been taking these vitamins, eating protein and the treatments and be as gentle with  </li>
            <li> I could not even brush through my hair without it hurting so much.</li>
            <li> Your hair is straight.</li>
            <li> I had perfectly straight hair before using this product, but thought it would make it \\&quot;smoother\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The biggest challenge for me with the whole process was finding the 20 minutes wait-time to use this kit, plus the time it takes to blow out and flat-iron, and then not shampooing for a couple days after.  </li>
            <li> I guess I trusted Suave way too much,</li>
            <li> but the smell is just too much.  </li>
            <li> told that this product is really intended for \\&quot;Virgin</li>
            <li> Real Keratin smoothing treatments do not burn on the scalp.</li>
            <li> I noticed the breakage and what it was really doing to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t really brush through because of the texture it created, went in shower</li>
            <li> I could use the whole tube and my hair would still suck it all</li>
            <li> others have mentioned, this is not the real deal.</li>
            <li> It smells just like a perm and is really a chemical</li>
            <li> The product smells like a perm because I analyzed the ingredients today, and it&#x27;s basically a temporary straight perm.  </li>
            <li> Suave legal team will be hearing from my attorneys.</li>
            <li> It seems from teh pitures on here it is meant for very frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t spend much.</li>
            <li> I have used so much products for frizz and nothing</li>
            <li> Get this professionally done ($50-120 LA) with better products at your local salon.</li>
            <li> About two months ago I used another home straightening product and I color my own hair every few months.</li>
            <li> Keratin treatments leave your hair softer and more nourished, but this does the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> I probably should have looked on the box and found an 800 number and asked the Suave people themselves, but it was just more convenient to ask my personal hair care professional, plus I trust her.  </li>
            <li> The ends especially were completely brittle and more frizzy than ever.  </li>
            <li> My hair was thick and gorgeous this morning.</li>
            <li> I have scheduled an appointment to get my once very long, beautiful hair cut to my shoulders next week with a deep conditioning treatment.  </li>
            <li> Today i washed it and WOW !!!</li>
            <li> I mean a good four inches.  </li>
            <li> I am right now in the process of trying to save a young lady&#x27;s hair who tried this at home.</li>
            <li> It lifted the color right out of my hair and it feels like an old broom.  </li>
            <li> I straightened it with a flat iron and my hair was straight and smooth all day.</li>
            <li> I used it about four days stright prior to doing the treatment and could see a significant difference in the texture of my hair...</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial for this product and was excited when I saw it at Target.  </li>
            <li> I originally was looking up why I could only use it every 3 months and came across these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will most likely end up with extensions, although I&#x27;m not sure how I will be able to cover up all the bald spots.</li>
            <li> Also, this product works much better than other at home treatments I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> That should have been the first RED FLAG, because ever since I have started coloring my hair on a regular basis, I have not been able to use perm solution on my hair.  </li>
            <li> But it does look like there is something which has been missed by manufacturer in the testing and research since so many other people are affected.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw a commercial for this product.  </li>
            <li> My hair routine was easy before...wash, mousse, and either let air dry or scrunch with blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The results: My hair is definitely smoother, easier to straighten, and laying nicer, plus it still holds curling iron curls very well, but it will not curl up on its own, if I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> The first few inches are okay.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need my flat iron for touch ups until after more than 2 months had passed since I first used the straightening cream (about the same time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s become a great resource for many, and a place to go if you just need to vent, or at the very least find a little comfort in knowing you&#x27;re not alone.    </li>
            <li> It reminded me a lot of the process of taking a Toni Home Perm and combing my hair straight with it when I was in high school, instead of setting my hair on curlers for a perm.  </li>
            <li> To get the results I want, I am going to go back to the anti-frizz gel, but I will probably have to use less, which is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So this morning I woke up early to use this stuff thinking it was a nice inexpensive keratin treatment that would fix my previously fried hair and make it silky and make it so i wouldnt even have to straighten the life out of it for awhile.</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> First off, my hair is very wavy and lightened 2 levels, from light brown to dark blond.  </li>
            <li> something that would smooth and strenthen your hair, not completely suck the moisture out and cause your hair to literally MELT off of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I read the instructions clearly and follow them exactly.</li>
            <li> I was pretty surprised.</li>
            <li> After I applied the suave - the finish result looked exactly like the professional keratin (with formaldehyde) treatments.</li>
            <li> I have tried to speak with someone at Suave too many times to count with no success.</li>
            <li> It is very fine but is long, very frizzy, and there is lots of it, so from shower to straight takes me 45 minutes with the dryer and flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Now,I will have to spend more money to purchase deep conditioning treatment for my hair and will have to wait months for my hair to get back to normal!</li>
            <li> i normally have gorgeous black hair and  now im stuck with red hair.</li>
            <li> That said, I would also follow their directions of testing it on one small spot (I tested mine on the flyaway pieces on the back of my head so that if something happened I&#x27;d be able to cover it easily).  </li>
            <li> I spend more than an hour yesterday trying to blow dry and straighten my hair out and by the end it looked almost exactly the same.</li>
            <li> There is A LOT of new information on this FB page!  </li>
            <li> The other day I took a really good look at my hair and several inches were just completely fried.  </li>
            <li> I live in a very humid city.</li>
            <li> In 3 months I may try a product that is more expensive and is reviewed with better results.  </li>
            <li> waited 7 minutes and washed it out and followed with a dime size amount of step 3 leave in conditioner and my hair is so soft, not straight by any means but the cutical seems sealed and my hair feels healthy</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve read enough reviews to know that I am not the only one this happened too, and like I said before, sounds like I&#x27;m luckier than most who used it.</li>
            <li> Because my hair is colored, and just mild wavy, I left it on for the shortest time specified - 15 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My hair was thick, long and beautiful.  </li>
            <li> I have only colored my hair like 2 times in my entire life, my hair is healthy,</li>
            <li> She said, if it is permanent color, to wait a week after applying this smoothing kit, but if it is temporary color, it can be done the same day (but do the smoothing kit first and then the coloring, because she said if you color first, the smoothing kit will strip out the coloring).  </li>
            <li> Now some of us are lucky if we even have hair left.</li>
            <li> in all, a decent product that I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I want more then just my money back, I want justice and my damn hair back!</li>
            <li> , this is a decent product if your hair is in decent shape.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s that there really aren&#x27;t enough hours in a day to make it worth it for me to put in all that effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After this product fried my hair and took away any body it ever posessed, I did some more research and found out that this is actually a straightening product that has the same ingredients as a perm.  </li>
            <li> Which is the main ingredient in perm solutions.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only cried 2 times from what i&#x27;ll call a \\&quot;hair disaster\\&quot;, and this one is definitely the one I cried more about.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional keratin treatments in the past and, although I loved that I had less frizz, I still had to work to make my curly hair smooth (not stick straight).</li>
            <li> I just finished using this product &amp; I followed the directions very clearly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, for those of you who are still interested in getting a keratin treatment, Coppola&#x27;s Keratin Complex Smoothing Therapy and Kera Straight are my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The negative reviews almost made me not try this product, but I&#x27;m glad I did!  </li>
            <li> I think that anyone who tries this sort of thing at home has to be aware of the possible consequences and remember that you can always do more, but that you can&#x27;t UNdo over processing.</li>
            <li> but in no way will I try something that a high majority of people say is damaging.</li>
            <li> S&amp;S. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Its also color treated with high lights.</li>
            <li> I got a real Keratin conditioning treatment which I will have to go back and get more cause my hair is so dry and breaking off.</li>
            <li> After about 10 minutes of applying it thoroughly (maybe slightly more), then 20 minutes of constantly combing and using my hands to flatten the hair repeatedly with some slight massaging and pulling of the hair downwards to keep it straight, I got a crick in my neck and elbows the first time I used this.</li>
            <li> Now, that&#x27;s nothing compared to what many of you experienced, so much so that I feel bad even complaining about it, but Suave, this is UNACCEPTABLE!  </li>
            <li> It feels a little better.</li>
            <li> I was able to blow dry but it took forever it just would not dry.  </li>
            <li> It is not a keratin treatment, it is pure chemicals, not healthy or safe.  </li>
            <li> Before applying I did the quiz on the SUAVE website and it recommended the 30 day treatment, which I certainly do not, at least not if you love your curls and bounce and just wish they were a little</li>
            <li> I tried this product, not really expecting much in terms of results, as I have fine, natural curly hair which frizzes at the smallest hint of humidity or moisture in the air.</li>
            <li> and there is no improvement in the frizz department, and, too much, and it can be sticky and weigh down my already fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It might also be due less to the product itself and more because of the sulfate free shampoo I am using, but I did use the shampoo before I tried the straightening treatment and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> I cannot miss the event, and have to make the best out of a bad situation.</li>
            <li> I look like I have jammed a fork in a light socket.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft to the touch and is much easier to straighten.</li>
            <li> With as much patience as she could, she combed through it as softly as she could using leave-in spray conditioner.</li>
            <li> If you really want your hair straightened get it done professionally.</li>
            <li> I also work out six days a week, so I really do have to shampoo my hair nearly every day, as I leave the gym drenched in sweat.  </li>
            <li> I am completely saddened and in disbelief that a 10.00 product could cause this much damage to our hair.  </li>
            <li> I also spent $150 on a Keratin Express Blowout at a salon, which gave me smooth hair for about a month -</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair, especially in the summer, and I had hoped to use it to calm the curls on humid days.  </li>
            <li> she has hair that&#x27;s almost straight naturally</li>
            <li> I am so grateful I didn&#x27;t have the nightmare trouble many have had, but I&#x27;d avoid the risk and just not buy this.</li>
            <li> Normal people are not qualified to use it.  </li>
            <li> This kit remindes me of the straightening kits sold next to the perm kits, which is pretty much a perm kit with a comb.</li>
            <li> Hopefully in a few months I will be able to layer my hair in a way that looks presentable,</li>
            <li> but when you can do it yourself and get the same results it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Personally, I think that its a powerful product with a trusted name.</li>
            <li> My curl is finally starting to come back at the root, and in patches throughout the top part of my head, however it&#x27;s looking even more awkward since it&#x27;s curling at the top</li>
            <li> My hair is colored frequently, so I left the mixture (which is pretty much just relaxer -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had long hair most of my life -- the only way to salvage what this product has done is to cut it off and regrow it.  </li>
            <li> I do not own that set because it specifically states that basically if you have ever had any kind of chemical treatment on your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually pretty anal about the products I buy, but didn&#x27;t really look too closely at the ingredients to confirm it was the same.  </li>
            <li> The few splatters I made didn&#x27;t seem to discolor the towel around my shoulders or the counter top or rugs on the floor, all which I wiped up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you just wash and condition your hair like you normally would, and then comb this through, wait a while, and rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> I was kind of scared to begin with after reading all of the negative feedback</li>
            <li> I cant even look in the mirror without crying and on top of it all im going to have to spend over $300 on hair extensions</li>
            <li> It will take years for our hair to return to normal if ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it was straighter than normal.  </li>
            <li> My hair normally dries in ringlets.</li>
            <li> The few time sI have been able to get a comb or brush through it ive lost lots of hair that breaks off and comes out in clumps.</li>
            <li> (it&#x27;s coarse) is SUPER soft and pretty straight for only being blow-dried.  </li>
            <li> and I could not hardly get the comb through it.</li>
            <li> Since I live in a very humid climate, I have wanted to have my hair professionally straightened for years.  </li>
            <li> I spent a good hour to hour and a half on this one morning.</li>
            <li> My hair was so thin and flat and on top of that the top and crown of my head was bald.</li>
            <li> It is now very short, right before prom and graduation.</li>
            <li> and I wanted to stress the following:  GO TO THE SUAVE WEBSITE TO SEE IF THE PRODUCT IS RIGHT FOR YOU.  </li>
            <li> Suave is not tring to make this right for their consumers only tring to place blame somwhere else.</li>
            <li> I know it is the last thing you feel like doing right now, but I would advise taking photos of your hair before you visit a salon.</li>
            <li> But there&#x27;s more negative comments than positive.</li>
            <li> I had beautiful thick brown hair that I have always been very careful with.</li>
            <li> I had mixed feelings at first because my hair seemed to be rather damaged, but that seemed to get better after a few days of conditioning.</li>
            <li> After seeing the ingredients, I was disappointed, as many of them are equally harsh and problematic.&lt;br /&gt;The strand test didn&#x27;t yield impressive results.</li>
            <li> Her beautiful long blonde hair is no more.  </li>
            <li> I want to say to all those people who experienced hair loss, bald spots and just a plain ole&#x27;mess on their hair that my heart goes out to each and every one of you.  </li>
            <li> I hoped that waiting the suggested 48 hours to shampoo would somehow magically fix it or at the very least calm the frizziness.  </li>
            <li> I went to a new salon and they used Coppola.  </li>
            <li> and I have to live with it for 48 hours because you aren&#x27;t supposed to shampoo for that amount of time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Monday night I decided to try this new keratin kit.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t seen my new \\&quot; look\\&quot; yet.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this new trial.</li>
            <li> It was easy to apply and non-irritating, but as far as I can tell it didn&#x27;t do anything for me, even in combination with the other products in the box.</li>
            <li> I have used only my regular salon shampoo and rinse, which aren&#x27;t sulfite free.</li>
            <li> but my hair is super dry</li>
            <li> Now my hair is above my shoulders, to my disappointment the ends are still straight,they did not curl at all, I now have more volume since it&#x27;s so short, so it&#x27;s super puffy, frizzy, and awkwardly straight at the bottom and wavy at the top.</li>
            <li> then really how much damage would it do to mine especially since my hair didn&#x27;t have any of the warnings on the box.  </li>
            <li> I only say this because I have a very demanding job that demands a lot of my time, so I really don&#x27;t have time to spend straightening my hair myself.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be really conscientious and not even pull my hair back for the couple days after using this product- who wants a perma-ridge from a ponytail holder in their hair, even for 30 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When the air is dry, specially during winter, my hair is actually more wavy and harder to straighten without a flat iron and leave-in treatments.  </li>
            <li> For this product, I set my timer for 20 minutes for step 1 and left step 2 in for about 20 minutes and my hair is as straight as when I relax it, I am amazed!  </li>
            <li> My hair was beyond soft!</li>
            <li> During the first process, I noticed that when I was using the comb, my hair was starting to frizz up</li>
            <li> My hair looks EXACTLY THE SAME as before and still feels elastic in some areas.</li>
            <li> First off, just reading the box and instructions is enough to freak out the calmest of people.</li>
            <li> At first it was a couple strands when I brushed my hair.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I did the smoothing kit first and then the temporary color; either the smoothing kit stripped it out even though the coloring was done last, or else the coloring just didn&#x27;t take.  </li>
            <li> I did not have any more hair fall out than usual when I used this product.  </li>
            <li> I used the product exactly as it said I should, and overall, my hair is smoother.</li>
            <li> It is called \\&quot;keratin\\&quot; (which is a natural hair protein) but had NO keratin in it, that was an advertizing ploy I guess!</li>
            <li> My fine hair strands felt slightly thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions to a T and after the last step and last rinse I was excited to see how my \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair looked.</li>
            <li> I put this on my hair and it completely broke off my hair!  </li>
            <li> I actually followed the first two steps.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions on the box and ended up rinsing off the first step in ten minutes because everytime I combed like it said I could see clumps of hair in the comb.  </li>
            <li> So unless you have pretty coarse hair</li>
            <li> I noticed that after the first step when i was combing my hair my hair started to fall out as well as after the second step i cryed and cryed my hair is nothing but a fuzz ball and hair</li>
            <li> Then, my hair started to kink up and pretty, which i later learned it was burning and frying.</li>
            <li> Following the directions EXACTLY, my hair was of ALL body.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank God I haven&#x27;t lost any hair so far!</li>
            <li> I still have a little wave to it but am sure if I did flat iron it, it would go pefectly straight.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t just look at these reviews, these other women may have just bought the product and used it (like I did) without really knowing if this product was right for their hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, wavy hair that is very healthy (not chemically processed, dyed, regularly cut).</li>
            <li> result was not worth the effort, and we were all glad we had done a trial section only.</li>
            <li> Not worth doing a whole head&#x27;s worth, given the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In the past, I&#x27;ve spent $300 on a Brazilian Blowout at a salon, which gave me gorgeous, lustrous hair.  </li>
            <li> Upon beginning its use, I could not get my hair to comb out straight, I was barely getting a comb through my hair and once I got lucky and could actually drag the comb through my hair, the hair would snap back into curls instead of staying straight.</li>
            <li> FAR FAR AWAY!</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll feel much better only losing a small piece of hair, as opposed to your whole head.</li>
            <li> I naturally have thick, wavy and sometimes coarse hair - which is probably why it was able to handle the product better than some of the other users.  </li>
            <li> This product allows me to have smooth straight hair or loose wavy curls if I let it dry natural.</li>
            <li> Easy to say \\&quot;next time i&#x27;ll keep it on longer\\&quot; much harder to deal with hair</li>
            <li> My hair has continued to dry straight and stay straight throughout the day which was my goal.</li>
            <li> I actually only had to blow dry my hair lightly when I did wash it.</li>
            <li> My hair is now super straight but completely dried out.</li>
            <li> and all together useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super healthy hair, I never blow dry, sometimes flat iron or curl but not often, use little to no product, and do not dye.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought some &#x27;Hair Cholesterol, Aphogee 2 minute strengthener, Olive Oil Leave-in treatment, some other $12 leave in treatments, some special Bio-something or other super conditioner...</li>
            <li> It was back to being a brillo pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without putting more work into my hair than should be required, my hair looks like a fried mess.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, as I was rinsing, many many clumps of hair started going down the drain, and the whole under layer of my bangs completely fried off.</li>
            <li> After a real keratin treatment, I could blow dry my hair with my fingers and end up with shiney straight hair that felt crazy healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> The whole process took me a little over an hour, but it was worth it.  </li>
            <li> Upon reading these other reviews I suppose I was lucky to not have a ton of hair fall out,</li>
            <li> I had to have 12 inches of my hair cut off and lucky that my stylist didn&#x27;t have to shave my head due to the damage/burns from Suave Keratin Kit.</li>
            <li> I am causasian with very naturally curly, course, frizzy type hair that is hard to manage, though in the fall and winter I can get it pretty smooth and straight with the blow dry and curling iron.  </li>
            <li> My hair would tripled in size when it was dry (with the hair drier)it was embarrassing, not even flat ironing it would look shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> I was told that I needed to start taking certain vitamins and eating as much protein as possible and different hair treatments to make my hair grow as fast as possible so it would not break off at my scalp.</li>
            <li> but for this works great, I am only sorry that I can use it for 3 months.</li>
            <li> (I did think that it would smooth my hair, when actually it straightened it a bit which is not really what I wanted</li>
            <li> This should be clearly advertised for what it is--A HOME PERM.  </li>
            <li> I can clearly see the breakage all over, sort of looks frizzy.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only real benefit I see from this product.  </li>
            <li> The bottom inch or two or my hair was completely fried up.</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old</li>
            <li> Thanks Suave, for ruining my hair for the next 20 years.</li>
            <li> I have read many of the reviews below, so I will make mine straight to the point because the 1 star, I hate it reviews are 100% accurate!</li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t, but it did take all the hair color out as well as even changed the color of my natural hair to brown/red.</li>
            <li> natural keratin treatments have keratin not perm solution.</li>
            <li> I have had one professional keratin treatment and one professional Brazilian blowout both with no issues.  </li>
            <li> It gave my hair soft texture with no frizz.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Problem 3-Hairstylists use basing gel to protect the scalp on sensitive clients, but not offered with the kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Ive had the smoothing keratin treatment done professionally twice and thought I&#x27;d give the suave kit a try.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> That idea may even be better, at least I may not know what this hair looks like.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only time it felt good was in the shower after washing it, it felt sleek and smooth, which is why I was so confused once it dried.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally curly and kinda frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> If you still feel the need to get a keratin treatment get it done professionally.  </li>
            <li> My sister is a professional cosmetologist, and she has worked with my hair for years before I moved across the country.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturally wavy</li>
            <li> iron it - which takes a considerable amount of time</li>
            <li> Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t put any of this directly on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is completely destroyed.</li>
            <li> I can tell by the look of my hair that in a week or two it will be completely unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> I was itching to use a product that would straighten my hair  (without damaging it) and that would allow my hair to return to its natural state after 30 to 90 days.  </li>
            <li> I have been coloring it for years with Clairol Natural Instincts.</li>
            <li> i plan to get a class action lawsuit started to take care of the victims of this product</li>
            <li> I HAVE A LAWYER TO HELP ME IN THIS CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT</li>
            <li> au natural</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand how this product could possibly bald someone.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely horrified at the results and damage this product has caused to countless numbers of women.</li>
            <li> my ends were completely fried.</li>
            <li> but it completely fried my hair.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair was completely gummi.  </li>
            <li> completely unmanagable.</li>
            <li> After I was done, my hair felt like my 1 year old baby girl.</li>
            <li> I have coarse, wavy/curly hair and was hoping to have it as straight as the picture implies.</li>
            <li> Let a professional do it.</li>
            <li> read the instructions; and it didn&#x27;t seem too out of line with my professional experience.  </li>
            <li> My bangs if that&#x27;s what I can still call them are completely burt off.</li>
            <li> I know I am not a hair professional but</li>
            <li> I went to Sallys and picked up the ion keratin smoothing system (which is a real keratin treatment, not a falsely advertised hair relaxer), which has definitely made a big improvement to the damage.</li>
            <li> I was waiting to write this review until enough time passed to really judge the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised no one has sued them yet?</li>
            <li> It completely fried my hair and it was not salvageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is completely wavy/loosely curled and virgin - never been colored, bleached, permed or treated before.  </li>
            <li> Wow... thank goodness</li>
            <li> I went on and did the sample, near the crown of my head where the sun hits it</li>
            <li> My hair is completely wrecked.</li>
            <li> It also states to contact a... professional before using.</li>
            <li> Still, for the price and the convenience, I would recommend that women with problem hair give it a try, as they may be surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had professional keratin treatments my friend works at a salon</li>
            <li> im a 21 year old women</li>
            <li> Completely ruined my hair.</li>
            <li> I get the keratin treatment or Japanese style straight perm whenever I&#x27;m in asia.</li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR</li>
            <li> NO HEAT IS ALLOWED NEAR MY HEAD</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a review of this product because there are so many negative reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m at the 3 month mark, and my hair has started returning to it&#x27;s wild state, and I just purchased this kit again to use it.</li>
            <li> Given the overwhelming negative response</li>
            <li> Completely fried it.  </li>
            <li> So that day (Saturday) I went in search of a professional stylist for some help.  </li>
            <li> Yes, but only if you really look close can you tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t use the product I had bought, as a direct consequence of reading these disaster stories.</li>
            <li> But with being laid off there is only so much I can afford</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out my hair for 5 years, and in an hour, I completely destroyed it.</li>
            <li> Also, please make sure to report Unilever to the FDA Consumer Complaint Department.</li>
            <li> I would have needed it after having it professionally straightened).  </li>
            <li> I managed to finally get the comb through it and continued to comb it straight.</li>
            <li> I rinsed and rinsed till it was all out and then put on the cutical cream and left it in for the whole 7 minutes then rinsed that out.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s still completely fried.....</li>
            <li> My hair is very coarse and very curly.</li>
            <li> Suave is completely irresponsible for putting this on the shelves.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever died my hair once in my whole life</li>
            <li> The only time I can get it completely straight (like I truly want it) is if I blowdry it, straighten it and then sleep on it for a night and</li>
            <li> least you have cute hats.\\</li>
            <li> I have bleach, color, and old perm (which i wanted out) in my hair and I ignored all the warnings for already processed hair....</li>
            <li> If you want soft hair use any Keratin product like Coppola.</li>
            <li> I think for $10 you can only expect so much.</li>
            <li> When i tried to pull the hair straight it would just shrivel back up when i let it go.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Step 1\\&quot; of the treatment is actually a perm solution to straighten your hair, but I don&#x27;t want stick straight hair; I like my ends to curl.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been naturally kinky curly and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Two years ago I started going to a professional to get my hair colored,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what to tell my 13 year old daughter whom I convinced to let me use this product on her</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although I recommend if you do choose to use this product, have a professional hair dresser apply it.</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and thought I would try this to get rid of some of that humidity friz for the summer.</li>
            <li> This completely took the frizzy out 100%.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, sleek, silky and shiny.  </li>
            <li> hopefully it will stay like this for the next few weeks :)</li>
            <li> , I thought I was going to be left bald and was sure that I had quite a few bald spots</li>
            <li> Alas, I love my hair too much to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First off, I want to say that this product is clearly NOT for everyone.  </li>
            <li> It should just smooth and weigh down the cuticles and generally make it behave</li>
            <li> They also said that they didn&#x27;t sell the product in walgreens (where I purchased it) and that it can only be applied by a professional!?!?!  </li>
            <li> My only hope is to cut as much off as possible and hope the new growth comes in normally.  </li>
            <li> I was excited about this since my hair is very thin and shows frizz easily.</li>
            <li> My hair is not very thick, in fact its actually pretty thin and fine and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> I am Caucasian and I have naturally wavy/curly hair (not tight curls).  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to over-iron it, it was very straight with a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so i would not have to deal with flat ironing it to calm frizz and such.</li>
            <li> kit will definitely smooth and tame frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> She had beautiful, full hair down past the middle of her back -- this treatment burned half of it off (up to her shoulders)...</li>
            <li> Still, after reading the fine print and realizing that she has had her hair professionally straightened with chemicals in the past, I am reluctant to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> I have had my hair relaxed, highlighted, dyed different colors, super dry, and so forth.</li>
            <li> Then when I flat ironed it, it was pin straight in no time.  </li>
            <li> it then flat ironed it and she has so much body n bounce to her hair.</li>
            <li> After blow drying, I really didn&#x27;t need to use the flat iron, but I knew it would help to seal the product into my hair.  </li>
            <li> I normally use one of the \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; clear gels on my hair right after I wash it, but, it is tricky to get it right--too little</li>
            <li> finally grew my hair back out from a short cut, and I&#x27;m having to visit the strong possibility of having to get it cut short again!</li>
            <li> But between ordering it and getting it, I had a BAD experience with my normal hair dye and my hair lightened greatly, so heading the warnings</li>
            <li> but of course I wanted straight smooth hair without having to blow dry and straighten everyday.  </li>
            <li> THANKS SUAVE for being a company that put a relaxer product, (like a perm), out to the general public</li>
            <li> She only left on the first step for 13 minutes instead of the recommended 20-25.</li>
            <li> For the first time im finally seeing some shine and health come back to my hair.</li>
            <li> about exactly whatall those \\&quot;concerned\\&quot; Suave/Unilever representatives&#x27; responses to the negative Amazon reviews you might have read are all about, and exactly what they have and haven&#x27;t done for the few who were able to actually communicate with them.  </li>
            <li> I only left the first part on for 10 min....</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks back and used it on my hair that was already in good health just slightly wavy....</li>
            <li> No matter how much I left the treatment in my hair and tried to continue to comb it, larger and larger chunks of my hair was yanked out of my hair in large clumps with every attempt to comb it straight.</li>
            <li> i dont think there is a quick fix for this mess..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few damage repair products, but it&#x27;s pretty obvious that the only remedy will be to get a short cut and wait for healthy hair to grow back.  </li>
            <li> Right now it&#x27;s about 10 inches past my shoulders, but the damage is very noticable up to my chin-length layers.</li>
            <li> and I had a huge paper worth 20% of my grade due today and was hoping to work on that last night instead of crying and praying and wanting to die!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have asked around how much it would be for someone professional to chemically relax my hair and its over $200 dollars and the product in your local walmart is only $8.00.</li>
            <li> I have a huge event next week for the Veterans Medical Center and I am horrified at my look.</li>
            <li> I read the instructions and got ready to try the Keratin Infusion Kit, but then I read the long lists of ingredients. . .</li>
            <li> I read the warnings on here first and proceeded carefully.  </li>
            <li> I carefully read the directions, and did it exactly as specified.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not back to normal, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like cotton candy anymore</li>
            <li> I just pray that eventually my hair will get back to normal.</li>
            <li> The following weeks let me continue to enjoy straight hair with very little effort on my part!</li>
            <li> I didnt know, I wish I had because it is costing me 420 dollars in conditioning treatments to get my hair to calm down and the cuticle to close</li>
            <li> I have thin fine hair naturally straight</li>
            <li> 2 years worth of hair growth down the drain.</li>
            <li> You probably are not used to seeing your hair straight or even having little tolerance for what I would call 80&#x27;s punk rocker straight hair (aka fried hair that sticks up straight...think krimped with a dose of unrecoverable dryness added in...</li>
            <li> But I have about 2-3 inches of new split ends, and as my hair grows back, it has a kink in it so that I look like I have a buzz cut underneath the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I did not have as bad of an experience as many others on here have.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m having to blow dry my hair straight and then curl it until it grows out.  </li>
            <li> so I used the dry shampoo because my hair gets really oily.</li>
            <li> It has been almost a week, and my hair is so broken, I can&#x27;t seem to get this product out and am sure I&#x27;m going to go see a professional hairdresser.</li>
            <li> so today my real hair actually matched the texture of my real human hair extensions.</li>
            <li> and then about 6 inches of my hair is still super straight, dry and shapeless.</li>
            <li> First off I have extremely curly hair...</li>
            <li> My hair looks like it does after I flat iron normally.</li>
            <li> CONSIDERING USING THE SUAVE PROFESSIONALS KERATIN INFUSION 30 DAY SMOOTHING KIT to save yourself the time, trouble and heartache of going through all the destruction possible all because you want to make your hair a little more straight for a couple of months.</li>
            <li> It gave me almost the same results as I get when I have my hair professionally straightened!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any major improvement either.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product did any major damage to my hair.  </li>
            <li> The last 5-6 inches of hair died completely!</li>
            <li> After following full instructions, I started blow drying my hair to find it completely fried at the ends, damaged, split ends and very little noticeable as far as the claims</li>
            <li> usually the next day it&#x27;s nice and straight.. usually.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I read the instructions very carefully.  </li>
            <li> I am able to wear my hair down with less frizz.</li>
            <li> It completely ruined my hair, much like the other reviews here.</li>
            <li> The curl is uneven, and I easily spend an hour with the round brush to get it straight.  </li>
            <li> I have never complained about a product before, id normally assume this was a problem I brought upon myself, but the damage is so extreme that I feel i&#x27;m obligated to warn others.</li>
            <li> I have kinda wavy, kinda straight, sorta curly mostly very dry hair</li>
            <li> I guess for me, having had professional treatments before, I had somewhat of an advantage because I was aware of some of the little qwirks you have to watch out for.</li>
            <li> I have deep conditioned my hair all day multiple times and nothing is working to even smooth it out a little bit.</li>
            <li> which originally was just wavy is now straight till about half way down where it then frizzes out into a big poof.</li>
            <li> This product is meant to be used in salons by a hair professional because the general public has no idea what these chemicals could do.  </li>
            <li> stylist says my hair is very damaged and it&#x27;ll take a long time to get all the \\&quot;dead\\&quot; hair gone and get it back to the way it was before the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Spoke to a representative at Suave today.</li>
            <li> Once I was done my wet hair looked perfectly straight and silky.  </li>
            <li> My hair is soft, and actually hangs looser!</li>
            <li> I used the product last night and have noticed considerable damage.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, curly blonde hiar and wanted a sleeker look.  </li>
            <li> Some women are strictly salon women and only rely on a professional to handle their hair.  </li>
            <li> &quot; well I have the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> Apparently I didn&#x27;t answer all the questions correct</li>
            <li> She has natural coarse hair</li>
            <li> It has been roughly six weeks since this whole ordeal</li>
            <li> Now you tell me why in the heck  people starting a \\&quot;class action lawsuit\\&quot; for others because their \\&quot;hair fell</li>
            <li> And now reading others reviews I see that it actually is a relaxer for if you were to have like really cury hair or african american hair which I do not!</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter used this produce (thinking that it was a deep conditioning treatment).  </li>
            <li> I am a natural redhead, but put in a temporary rinse 2 weeks ago making my hair a darker shade of red (</li>
            <li> I do not want to cut my hair short, because I am fifty years old.  </li>
            <li> Now after using it I can&#x27;t go back, it does not wash out in 30 days, it is a permenet chemical that has completely destroyed all of the hair on my head.</li>
            <li> , I have been looking for another way to get the same professional salon look.</li>
            <li> This was only after a few minutes, I did not leave it on for the full time</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not great, but just ok.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any clumps of hair come out, but I have had A LOT of breakage at the ends, so my hair feels very fine and thin in the back.</li>
            <li> Also, there&#x27;s a warning on the side about using it if you&#x27;re sensitive to the main ingredient or other relaxer-type treatments or even perms.</li>
            <li> but my usually oily hair is now dry and more frizzy than ever before, even after using deep conditioning treatments.</li>
            <li> There are many new horror stories (unfortunately), and a section in which people are sharing info about what they&#x27;ve done to try and \\&quot;fix\\&quot;</li>
            <li> , it never had the same straight, glossy shine as before, and it felt brittle and dry, like straw.  </li>
            <li> My hair was completely mushy and would not dry (my hairdresser later told me it was because it was over processed).</li>
            <li> but the last few years it has been super frizzy, unruly, and unmanageable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The first time I blow dried my hair after following the directions, my hair was almost as straight as when I flat iron!  </li>
            <li> That first night it was actually quite difficult to style my hair after I had blow-dryed it, mainly because I rarely blow</li>
            <li> I have used at-home single process hair color for years to cover up some gray mostly and to slightly lighten a natural dark brown color.  </li>
            <li> I normally wash my hair at night, let it air dry overnight, then iron it in the morning.</li>
            <li> Normally I cannot blow dry my hair and go out.</li>
            <li> used half of the first two bottles, and will use it again after September when my hair gets frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Suave, I used to love your products, cheep, got my hair clean, and now I really am disappointed in you.</li>
            <li> I did not loose any at all</li>
            <li> I now have to worry with my hair breaking , falling out , or turning into a frizzy hot mess.</li>
            <li> , I WAS NOT A VICTIM, BUT MY TWIN SISTER WAS ....</li>
            <li> my hair was always a problem no matter if I let it go curly, flat ironed or professionally blew it out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, after reading other Amazonian review, it seems a lot of reviewers say this product is very damaging.</li>
            <li> My ends are completely burned, and my bangs are flat against my forehead.  </li>
            <li> Even after the stylist&#x27;s best efforts, my hair continues to be damaged and fried which makes it very difficult to comb through, much less style and try to make it look half way decent in public.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when I saw this suave product, read the box and thought this is much easier, doesn&#x27;t require flat iron, can blow dry.</li>
            <li> And again, from what I&#x27;ve been told by professionals, the damage could potentially have a lasting effect even after your new hair does grow back.    </li>
            <li> The hair looked quite dry and the texture was mostly the same as before--a bit straighter, but not nice and shiny like with the salon keratin treatments.</li>
            <li> The following day I went out and spend an obscene amount of money on professional hair care products (deep conditioners, etc).</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even put in a ponytail because there are so many tiny hairs sticking out around my face and scalp where the hair has broken off to my scalp or fallen out.  </li>
            <li> because I kind of like my wild&#x27;n&#x27;crazy hair, and there&#x27;s that pernicious time-factor thing.  </li>
            <li> because I kind of like my wild&#x27;n&#x27;crazy hair, and there&#x27;s that pernicious time-factor thing.  </li>
            <li> Suave should be ashamed of themselves for ruining our hair with their false advertisements and promises of lush shiny smooth hair.  </li>
            <li> had one little sore on my head, and the lotion stung it, and it lasted about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;After the first treatment</li>
            <li> I was lucky I washed out right away, my hair mostly survived, though insanely damaged.  </li>
            <li> After a couple of months it went back to normal, but it was dry to the point that there was not hair mask that could fix it..</li>
            <li> My daughter is has mixed hair, not totally black, not totally white</li>
            <li> But after going to the salon to have it fixed, they said this product is NOT a keratin treatment but a relaxer they would only use on African American type hair!!</li>
            <li> There is no excuse for permanently messing your hair up.</li>
            <li> did ask a hair care professional how long to wait before coloring.  </li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth, I did apply the #1 bottle on a small portion of my hair to test it</li>
            <li> I have been doing Hot Oil treatments a few times a week</li>
            <li> so I would look as normal as could be expected.</li>
            <li> my hair is very thick and strong.</li>
            <li> I have it professionally straightened twice a year; I can&#x27;t afford any more than that, and I&#x27;m afraid my hair will be unhealthy if I do it more</li>
            <li> Maybe it won&#x27;t last a whole month; but there are other products out there that last longer.  </li>
            <li> Maybe it won&#x27;t last a whole month; but there are other products out there that last longer.  </li>
            <li> I had wanted to have soft, silky hair--not dry, brittle, damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;Reading</li>
            <li> It is not super straight</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and about a minute and a half after I applied step one my hair start kinking up at a fast speed.</li>
            <li> and if I let dry naturally it was wavy curls</li>
            <li> There are reasons why these products should only be sold to professionals, not the general public.</li>
            <li> Shame on Suave for introducing a potentially harmful product to the general public.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my hair is a hot mess now!</li>
            <li> top of that my hair feels dry and its hard to brush since, as I may have mentioned, the last 2 inches are burnt frizzy dry knotted</li>
            <li> The only way to straighten my hair normally is blow it dry and then flat</li>
            <li> My blonde hair, that normally shows any oil I put in it and can look dirty if I put too many weighty products in it.</li>
            <li> I continued with the other steps per instruction, hoping this was normal.  </li>
            <li> I still have some waves, but when I blow dry and flat iron my hair is so soft, shiny, and sleek!</li>
            <li> Despite following the instructions to the very detail I literally lost half my hair.</li>
            <li> And when my hair was wet it was icky feeling and broke off so easily.</li>
            <li> She says it was a very detailed and bit complicated procedure to use the product in the correct manner, and wishes it could be made simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I started my hair was all one length, now it looks like someone took a razor and put large uneven layers in my hair.  </li>
            <li> and it is now straight with little to no frizz.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair, but it was a little frizzy.</li>
            <li> but I still keep it on for a little while I didn&#x27;t even keep it on the whole 15 minutes (for my hair type) and washed it out my hair</li>
            <li> (Through experience, I find that air drying my hair a little before blow drying it, a week or so after having it straightened, helps me maintain the straight look longer.)  </li>
            <li> How dare they continue to make these false claims of beautifully smooth flowing hair with all of the complaints out there.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do any major damage, but it did dry my hair out a lot.  </li>
            <li> My hair is approximately down to the middle of my back,I fear that if I go to a salon to have have the straight dry parts cut off it will end up above my shoulder, hence once it curls it will look even shorter.</li>
            <li> But at $12.99 (at the drugstore) it&#x27;s worth a shot if you have minimal waves or frizz to tame, so that&#x27;s why I begrudgingly gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Sorry, everyone, I was indeed very excited to receive this product and got it out to try it around a week after I got</li>
            <li> but I have to flat iron it to make it look half way decent.</li>
            <li> and my hair is still less curly than it had been, but the normal texture seems to be coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair has been so extremely unmanageable and frizzy that I didn&#x27;t really mind the unknown results that would surprise me in the end.</li>
            <li> So I decided to give it a go and try it out, thinking it would smooth out all the little fly-aways from short hairs and some crappy layers an amateur hair stylist cut in my hair.</li>
            <li> It calmed down the frizz, and I live in Texas, with humidity, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles.</li>
            <li> on.&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions several times over several days, as they are complicated, and one has to be exact with the directions.&lt;br /&gt;Finally was ready to do it.  </li>
            <li> (Natural curls in hair are actually due to a variance in thickness in the cuticle of the hair.)</li>
            <li> Neither of us saw marked improvement in straightening, as we have with other products.  </li>
            <li> and apparently I&#x27;m not the only one either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a while back and thought it made my hair too flat since I&#x27;m 43 and with thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> , I moved to deep conditioners and the trusty flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and I only ever use the flat iron once a month</li>
            <li> so we had to flat iron it daily.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t do much to my hair on a daily basis and was finding it to be a little dry</li>
            <li> So with her mom&#x27;s help, she pulled most of her hair up, and tried a sample section that would lay underneath her normal hair, in case things went bad.</li>
            <li> I did the first step as directed and then followed with the second step, it was late at night</li>
            <li> I have coarse dark hair that has natural wave in it.  </li>
            <li> With long hair, that&#x27;s always a concern, but after months of staying away from curling/flat irons, and only blow drying every 3 days I had FINALLY beaten split ends.  </li>
            <li> I suppose I can only look to both the short term and long term plans for now which is to continue to get conditioning treatments and hair cuts until everything has grown</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just hoping and praying that in a few months my hair will go back to normal??  </li>
            <li> My hair went from being long, full, and golden blond to sparse, gummy, broken, dull, and rust colored.  </li>
            <li> waited the longer than the 48 hours to wash my hair, since it took me a few days to get it to calm down.  </li>
            <li> Your reviews have tipped me to not purchasing this particular product for my thick, long, natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> She suggested I use special healing shampoos and conditioners to keep my hair from getting worse.</li>
            <li> My hair is very long and reaches to my mid back.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick, wavy/straight hair that is frizzy a lot of the time due to the fact that I live in Alabama, which is a very humid state.</li>
            <li> And last step and blow dry on low heat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been washing it daily with regular shampoo to see if it comes off, but it&#x27;s still lifeless, dry, and I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;m going to have to cut it off...</li>
            <li> I did blow dry my hair (it dried mostly straight)</li>
            <li> All that said, be careful if you have THIN hair, damaged hair and adverse to strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> if I air dried it, but who wants to wait 3 hours for their hair to completely dry, then flat iron it???</li>
            <li> I have crazy kinks everywhere, breakage and my beautiful long blond hair is dull and frizzy (understatement).</li>
            <li> BUT, the waves were much tamer than I would usually have.</li>
            <li> , it was also straight looking, my hair is usually curly.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t going to be much of a review because I couldn&#x27;t even get past the smell.</li>
            <li> Not a fun thing for anyone, let alone a 13 year old girl.</li>
            <li> Flat ironing helps along with argon oil.</li>
            <li> The product is enough to apply for long hair, at waist level.</li>
            <li> so I used a brush and finished it with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> One hour later, glorious, long shiny hair.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll stick to my argan oil and flat iron.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, before using the keratin, I would blow-dry my hair, flat iron it</li>
            <li> I went ahead and flat ironed it</li>
            <li> It did get the mats out of my hair and smoothed it, but only as long as the product was on my hair.</li>
            <li> OR they left the product on too long.</li>
            <li> this company has been around long enough</li>
            <li> I have long blonde hair, which I straighten but do not color treat.  </li>
            <li> so I flat iron it...</li>
            <li> it takes her FOREVER with a flat iron, so we sent it over to her, for her to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I tried to avoid this the 2nd time by stretching my arms above my head after each combing/massaging/pulling action every few minutes.)</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;Step 2\\&quot; is the keratin treatment, so I left it on about twice as long as the directions said.</li>
            <li> but I dont know if thats the flat iron or the product.</li>
            <li> I flat ironed, and ironed and ironed and still could not get the frizz under control.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have medium/long hair and its pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with this product I have always loved suave&#x27;s products</li>
            <li> This is a true form of false advertisement in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Naturally, my hair is very thick, very wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try, since my hair gets too dry and unmanageable by using the flat iron on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Also, as my fiancée is a photographer we will be spreading the word to all major shoots, clients, models, and other MUA&#x27;s in the industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought it would be healthier if I did not have to use my flat iron every day (ha!).</li>
            <li> The active ingredient seems to be something of a high pH like other relaxers.</li>
            <li> Once I finished the last step and was drying my hair, parts of my hair still felt elastic, and it took me about 25 minutes to dry my hair, because I was trying to lessen the amount of hair that was breaking off.  </li>
            <li> have naturally frizzy hair with a slight wave.</li>
            <li> spend far less time styling my hair, as I no longer have to fight the frizz.</li>
            <li> I purchased anyways as I have really dry, curly, frizzy, puffy, damaged, short hair...</li>
            <li> I just want to express my gratitude to the Amazon reviewers who have taken the time to write about their negative experiences, they have convinced me to stay far, far away from  the Suave Keratin Smoothing kit.   </li>
            <li> So now I am having to spend extra money on products just so hair will look presentable and having to pay more to a stylist to keep cutting every couple weeks as the damaged hair keeps breaking off.  </li>
            <li> I am 33 years old and NEVER have I EVER experienced anything as horrific as this product.</li>
            <li> Yes the product might work for the first few days but its not worth the headache that comes after.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d gotten keratin and brazilian blowout treatments before and they left my hair vibrant, shiny, and frizz-free during the humid summer months; so i wrongly jumped at the chance of not having to pay so much for a keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sitting here with a wet head because it will not dry with a blowdryer.</li>
            <li> However after about a week of rereading the directions I finally got enough courage to go for it, how bad could it be, right?!?!?!</li>
            <li> But, I also single process dye my hair from brown to red.</li>
            <li> It cut down my time with the flat iron, and my hair seems to be less frizzy and is laying much flatter.</li>
            <li> I put the second treatment on, hoping that it would make my hair go back to at least normal, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My hair was frizzy after I blow dried or air dried (actually, right when stepping out of the shower).</li>
            <li> I only blow-dried my hair this time rather than straightening it right after because I was tired of messing with my hair.  </li>
            <li> I called my salon hair stylist as soon as I exited the shower because what hair I had left was stripped down next to nothing and could not be combed, brushed or even finger combed.</li>
            <li> My hair now is completely messed up, breaking off, weird, coarse and straw-like texture, dull - pretty much everything you don&#x27;t want your hair to look like.  </li>
            <li> I did get very shiny, very manageable hair that wasn&#x27;t as crazy as usual, and those results did last for the whole 30 days, I think.  </li>
            <li> After weeks of seeing this commercial on tv, and trying multiple other remedies and hair care lines, I thought to myself $10 is definately affordible to try this product.</li>
            <li> and I only spent about 5 minutes with the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> it fried my hair and in no way is my hair and different then prior other than fried and</li>
            <li> Hair looks a little healthier after the cut and treatment, however still does not resemble my natural hair in any way.</li>
            <li> (Picture James Brown or Little Richard&#x27;s hair - an old \\&quot;conk\\&quot; hairstyle obtained by using those kinds of lye-based concoctions.  </li>
            <li> After reading the other reviews, it seems pretty pointless even to try to contact Suave, they seem pretty incompetent.  </li>
            <li> She kept asking if Iblow dry my hair all the time, and use a flat iron on it all the time.  </li>
            <li> I had to flat iron just to look like I had dry, damaged hair and ruined ends.</li>
            <li> Even when I do blow dry and flat iron, my hair is stiff/limp and lifeless!</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a treatment that will help hair not feel so dry and brittle but realize I am just going to have to live with bad damaged hair until new hair grows, which cannot happen fast enough.  </li>
            <li> No matter how hard she tried, she finally began slowly cutting away the worst of the damage of what was left of my hair after that treatment when only hours before I had extremely long, shiny, bouncy, perfect healthy, brown</li>
            <li> Status of her hair- DRY and nOT soft, like you get with flat ironing!</li>
            <li> I have very dark hair and the only thing I&#x27;ve done to is darken the ends that turn a little red in the California sun and ocean to my natural almost black natural color.</li>
            <li> I trid to take the cheap route this time and now I&#x27;m sorry I did.  </li>
            <li> It shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to be called a keratin treatment, because I have had a real keratin complex treatment in a salon (cost $250)</li>
            <li> I am so angry at myself for thinking a cheap product like this</li>
            <li> Because of this, most of the time my hair spends its life corralled in a pony tail, or just allowed to be crazy.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely use this again as opposed to the $300 I&#x27;ve paid in the past for a professional treatment.</li>
            <li> I tried calling the number to ask their specialist but only to find out they are closed on weekends.</li>
            <li> And here I had been trying to grow my hair out long.  </li>
            <li> I am soooo not a professional but, decided I could  figure this out -</li>
            <li> I noticed that the end of my part at the crown of my head, felt strange.</li>
            <li> It took me so long to grow out my hair, I can&#x27;t believe I ruined it by believing this was just a \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot;treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have another cut scheduled in 3 months, it&#x27;s going to be a long while until I manage to get rid of all the damage done.</li>
            <li> She said there was a minor itching.  </li>
            <li> how long it is going to take for my hair to grow out of all the damage done to it.</li>
            <li> Suave, Ive always been dissappointed by your products, but this is unthinkable that youv ebeen making women bald like this.</li>
            <li> I have let it go grey.</li>
            <li> I have a long layers hair style.</li>
            <li> My step one was not nearly as smelly as others reported.</li>
            <li> Might use it again, but maybe won&#x27;t leave in as long.</li>
            <li> It killed the natural curls in my hair without smoothing anything.  </li>
            <li> I have used Suave products for a long time but they have definately lost a customer.  </li>
            <li> After the long process, even for the section, we all waited with anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it took me a long time to get to this length</li>
            <li> Because of the long application process and the lack of results I saw, and the drying out of my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I followed every step, setting times for how long to leave it in, how long to rinse and so on.</li>
            <li> well I will be headed to the salon tomorrow to cut off all of my burnt/damaged long hair.  </li>
            <li> I used this on my long hair and it fried it.</li>
            <li> I have long hair.</li>
            <li> I would recommend reading the item details carefully to see if you can actually use this product.  </li>
            <li> Please do not use this product and do not support this company as they clearly do not respect consumers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After growing out a fresh crop of virgin hair for approximately 4 months.</li>
            <li> My hair is very course , thick , and curly.</li>
            <li> I have thick, curly (almost kinky) hair and straight iron</li>
            <li> Anything where your hair is getting semi-dissolved, re-shaped, and cooked back into a new pattern is gonna be HARD ON YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li> I would not say my hair anytime after the treatment was softer, smoother looking, or less frizzy (actually the opposite).  </li>
            <li> , it says 30 day Smoothing kit, so I was wrong assuming that it would be mild enough to use at home.  </li>
            <li> What few  strands I have left are dry, brittle, and straight and stiff as a board.</li>
            <li> If they cannot do anything for me i am contacting an attorney right away for the false advertising of this product and what it has done to my hair</li>
            <li> (in fact it looked duller than it usually does), though I noticed my hair felt very soft.</li>
            <li> My hair which usually doesn&#x27;t feel very soft</li>
            <li> Well after my last hair cut that went a little too short</li>
            <li> So for extremely curly hair it says 25 minutes, I only combed it through for 17 minutes.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s started a petition on change.org to get this product yanked from shelves and to warn other women of the potential hazards that await them if they decide to use this product.</li>
            <li> I think the key thing to do is to use as little product as possible.</li>
            <li> When I run my hands through my hair little tiny pieces constantly fall to the ground.  </li>
            <li> Other keratin treatments have a different smell.  </li>
            <li> My hair tends to be extremely frizzy, especially if I blow dry it but after using Suave Smoothing treatment, I can just wash it and that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong on assuming that, I have completely the opposite of how my hair used to be other than it is straight and</li>
            <li> again, the frizz remained even after applying the leave-in and allowing it to air dry.  </li>
            <li> -dry my hair</li>
            <li> I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> and now I get to reconstruct dry, damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry or even straighten my hair.  </li>
            <li> You put the product on, let it process, dry and straighten.</li>
            <li> I always have had to blow dry and straighten with my Chi ceramic straigthener.</li>
            <li> By the end of this \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; treatment, I couldn&#x27;t run my hands through it, let alone brush it and blow dry it, like the instructions say to do.</li>
            <li> and I straighten it as I blow dry each day</li>
            <li> It also takes FOREVER to dry.</li>
            <li> My hair is dry but not brittle or</li>
            <li> I did have some dry ends, but I have not had my hair cut in months.  </li>
            <li> I tried to blow dry it</li>
            <li> but it wouldn&#x27;t dry</li>
            <li> my hair is fried, dry and ruined..</li>
            <li> I finished the process and my hair ended up being completely dry, brittle, and damaged.  </li>
            <li> but my hair is still dry and damaged.  </li>
            <li> I applied the leave in conditioner and started to blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> halfway through my blow dryer stopped working, so I let my hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> Every strand is cinched and stripped dry.</li>
            <li> and it was dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> and my hair is not even dry yet.</li>
            <li> My hair is fried, dry, and breaking off.</li>
            <li> I will then style my hair by letting it air dry and then update this review.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think that you can just step out of the shower and let your hair air dry though.</li>
            <li> You still need to blow dry it.</li>
            <li> I dont use hairspray or gel, I never blow dry</li>
            <li> I do not do any sort of treatment to my hair besides conditioning as it was a tad dry.</li>
            <li> However, with this kit, when I blow dry my hair and style it - it stays how I styled it no matter the weather.</li>
            <li> I tried to blow dry it</li>
            <li> It ruined my hair, it was so dry and frizzy.</li>
            <li> I kept thinking I must not have rinsed it all out or something as I was trying to dry my hair because it seemed like it was sticky and wouldn&#x27;t dry and looked crinkly.  </li>
            <li> After blowing it dry</li>
            <li> I do not blow dry my hair</li>
            <li> so I waited for it to dry.</li>
            <li> I used to dry my hair for 30 minutes with a blow dryer, then another 15 minutes with a straighter to make it not frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was up all night crying, I finally got the courage to run to Meijer at around 5AM, with my hood pulled up over my hair the entire time.... and got some &#x27;Hair Mayo&#x27; in hopes that it would correct the issue, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> so I just dried it (with the blow-dryer) and then used the whole heat protection lotion from step 3 while straightening with flat-iron, combing, and brushing with round brush.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wanted to change were the few patches of waves in the back, so I decided to use this product.</li>
            <li> I have to put at least half a bottle of argon oil in my hair everyday, just to feel mildly comfortable walking out the door.</li>
            <li> The warnings again were a little scary, but I know from experience they kind of have to cover their butts by stating EVERY LITTLE PROBLEM that could go wrong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you have been doing ityourself for years, then you probably have the methods and time down pat, but I haven&#x27;t done this since I left college, so it&#x27;s been a long while!  </li>
            <li> but I am not really good at blow-drying straight</li>
            <li> My hair never gets straight even when straightening maybe because I am not good at it</li>
            <li> was so tangly so not normal for me.</li>
            <li> The heat defense leave-in conditioner (bottle #3) lasted me a long time because I only had to use such a small amount each time I needed it.  </li>
            <li> The results are not worth the gross smell and the burning sensation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent month conditioning my long hair and letting it grow because I am in a wedding as well this spring.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews first to hear of the poor souls this also happened to.  </li>
            <li> Scary and true.</li>
            <li> It was probably worse than the first day.  </li>
            <li> You will cause your hair to loose curl and frizz.</li>
            <li> so I dont loose all my hair.</li>
            <li> I usually loose my hair when I comb it</li>
            <li> I have very thick dark hair that, as I&#x27;ve gotten older (and a little grey has made it&#x27;s way in) has a more dramatic reaction to the humidity than it did when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It was just getting to the point where it was flowing down my back..</li>
            <li> If I part my hair differently the bristles are covered but that doesn&#x27;t matter anyways because I cant wear my hair down anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the second I sat down and told my stylist what I had done</li>
            <li> Ultimately I cut it down shoulder length.  </li>
            <li> I was left with a small tuft of dry unmanageable hair and I left the salon in tears.</li>
            <li> im spending a fortune to try and have it fixed.. which is not easy due to the damage created...</li>
            <li> Once I was done with the whole process, I blow dried my hair with a paddle brush and it has very little wave and NO frizz</li>
            <li> DRY- NOT EVEN WITH A BLOW DRYER!</li>
            <li> Chemicals like this should be handled/used by professionals only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, my hair feels dry, frizzy, brittle, is breaking all over and literally RUINED!  </li>
            <li> , I never even have to blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li> I typically get keratin treatments every 3-4 months (since 2008), and I think they work well with frizzy, coarse, or unruly hair.  </li>
            <li> I too ignored the warnings about straightening it previously and having color treated hair, my last home relaxer was about 4 or 5 months ago</li>
            <li> The first red flag, it&#x27;s quite difficult to tell, before purchasing this and opening it, that it&#x27;s a product that you need to wait for it to process.</li>
            <li> then my phone rang disrupting me from my previous goal of starting this process.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: AFTER 6 WEEKS: hair didn&#x27;t get any better, had to go to hair salon this week where they did a deep conditioning and cut over 6 inches off my hair :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not kidding you when I tell you that I had a lamp in the back and could see in the mirror as pieces of my hair were breaking and falling to the floor as I used their black comb to style my hair and detangle.  </li>
            <li> and if i wear it wet to air dry it dries poofy with zero curl.</li>
            <li> Like probably 95% of potential users, I have colored, highlighted, slightly dry/frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I left the product on for half the time it recommended because my hair was literally melting off in chunks.</li>
            <li> I definitely have less frizz and volume.</li>
            <li> As soon as I got out of the shower, panicking of course, I saw that the hair I still had had lost all of its color, was VERY dry, brittle and breaking.</li>
            <li> I am back to wearing weaves, wigs, and protective styles to cover up the mess I used to call my crowning glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But alas, after blowing it dry it was straight but as frizzy as ever.  </li>
            <li> The tips of my hair are now a tight curl that constantly feels sticky and damp, I cant even brush it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to hear so many people had such a bad experience with this product as mine turned out pretty well.</li>
            <li> I usually straighten my hair professionally but due to a lack of time before a trip decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is a fairly light blonde and reaches down below my waist (I would say its about 30 inches long if not more), so needless to say I&#x27;ve been growing it for awhile.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair need a little extra help.</li>
            <li> little did I suspect that the Karatin Infusion 30 day smoothing kit was going to cost me my entire head of hair.</li>
            <li> I know is it smelled like deep fried farts and seems to have calmed the frizz a little.</li>
            <li> but what it actually was, was little stubble.</li>
            <li> Just shorter hair and $70.00 down the toilet.  </li>
            <li> please if you&#x27;re smart enough to do what I failed to do</li>
            <li> It was straight, YES, but it was dead, flaky, it broke and had no shine!!!  </li>
            <li> and when I air or blow dry, it gets extremely frizzy no matter what products I try.  </li>
            <li> My scalp is dry and inflamed  and endlessly itchy (Surprise, surprise)&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
            <li> Your hair will receive less damage with blow-drying and flat irons.</li>
            <li> I thought useing this has to be less damaging than a flat iron every day.</li>
            <li> ; other than having some slightly dry ends I felt that it shouldn&#x27;t be a</li>
            <li> My few highlights looked a little lighter but that is the only thing I could tell different.</li>
            <li> I should have read more of these reviews on bad experiences instead of listening to all the rave reviews on the Suave sight or the commercials.  </li>
            <li> I can also not stress enough how bad my hair smells, It smells like a cheap home perm.</li>
            <li> What a great ending to the worst week ever.</li>
            <li> And finally your cut is probably all wrong for straight hair</li>
            <li> I have long hair well past my shoulders and didn&#x27;t use the entire bottle.</li>
            <li> These products are slightly expensive, but they are well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> This product spent a lot of time on the shelf before I used it.</li>
            <li> I had to wait 3 days because they were closed on Sunday and Monday.</li>
            <li> I have been soooooo careful with my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m washing it with sulfates and sodium chloride every day and not much is happening yet.  </li>
            <li> Now it either goes in a ponytail (which I have to be careful of cause of the breakage), braided, or I have to spend 30-45 minutes with the straightening iron.</li>
            <li> never really had an issue with frizzy hair until after the treatment.  </li>
            <li> So the hundreds of dollars that I have spent on hair treatments and hair pieces to try to hide the damage..</li>
            <li> I have to be careful not to break my hair</li>
            <li> So, just be careful if you think that a \\&quot;real\\&quot; keratin treatment will fix the damamge.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent two years growing out my hair and would have been devastated</li>
            <li> I carefully washed away the product and used the cream for heat protection and styled my hair.  </li>
            <li> Please read carefully their instructions and do a strand test before you put it in all your hair.  </li>
            <li> So I let that one soak all in to my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> So I let that one soak all in to my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> The process was quite lengthy (but it is to be expected for what you are using the product for).  </li>
            <li> and if it was rainy or humid out my hair would just turn to frizzy fluff.</li>
            <li> all the directions carefully or have a friend help you.</li>
            <li> Apparently they no longer have the quality controls in place that they had in the past.</li>
            <li> I thought I was being so careful with all the directions, but then realized I forgot to put on the gloves.</li>
            <li> absolutely NO difference.</li>
            <li> I was careful about not rubbing into my scalp.</li>
            <li> wet yarn.</li>
            <li> , it was sort of rough</li>
            <li> This product must have a miniscule amount of Keratin in order to allow it to advertise it as a Keratin infusion, but THIS IS NOT A KERATIN TREATMENT OR ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> product(i re-read it a few times, there is not) and its the peroxide in the second step that did this to me.</li>
            <li> I was really curious about this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will say to use this product, you have to devote some time to read the instructions carefully and to understand and perform all the steps.</li>
            <li> What you might be left with once it&#x27;s dried is a *</li>
            <li> Well I used it a few weeks ago, following the instructions to a T.  </li>
            <li> it literally feels like I have a military buzz cut if I rubfingers by my scalp.  </li>
            <li> and I still cannot get a comb (even a wide tooth one) through my hair.</li>
            <li> I had to put it up wet &amp; come to work like that</li>
            <li> This is destroying not only our hair but our self esteem and confidence.</li>
            <li> The last 6 inches of my hair was completely fried and kinked up and then random spots in the middle of my head were kinky as well.</li>
            <li> This product is not a real keratin treatment, its a hair fryer in a box.</li>
            <li> However, hair loss during the process was minimal.  </li>
            <li> After blow drying it, I was devastated, it was nothing like I had expected or hoped for.</li>
            <li> Short and dead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a few days, but every time I get my hair wet the smell comes back!  </li>
            <li> everyone, I sure hate this lesson; but I definitely learned from it!!!</li>
            <li> and feels so soft and not as  thick.</li>
            <li> so I keep the length long to help weigh it down a bit.</li>
            <li> So Im not sure what to rate it really because its doing half the job it supposed to other than my ends &amp; some strands in the front are damaged!!</li>
            <li> I brushed my hair as recommended and felt like it took out half a head of hair!  </li>
            <li> But with this kit you will get the same results for LESS!</li>
            <li> , after the hour and a half long process I finally blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> Also, I suspect that a lot of the bad experiences come from people finding out in the most painful way possible that they ARE sensitive or even allergic to the main ingredient.</li>
            <li> It has little to no affect that I couldnt get with a bit of smoothing cream and a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an art opening tomorrow and as the artist I need to look at least a little decent.</li>
            <li> They want before and after pics but unfortunately didn&#x27;t take any pics of myself right after I did the treatment.</li>
            <li> I kinda feel bad about being able to give it 5 stars when all those other people had all those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think sometimes I have the frizziest for a straight-haired girl, so I was definitely up for trying something that might tame it.</li>
            <li> actually walked into the store today to buy this product after seeing a commercial, but I&#x27;m one to research hair products before I buy them because I&#x27;m mixed black and white, and my hair can be quite difficult to maintain, as it&#x27;s both frizzy and</li>
            <li> Anytime I dried or flat ironed it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on a hair weave to replace her fried hair)- and would include coupons for other Suave products-</li>
            <li> It has gotten slightly softer through the use of expensive protein treatments and naturally growing out about an inch, but the overall condition of my hair is awfuland I wish I had never given this product a second glance on the shelf.</li>
            <li> I noticed less frizz, but, really did not expect miracles in that department, as mother nature can be tough.</li>
            <li> I can only tame it down by using a ton of product and heavy flat ironing</li>
            <li> I bought my product on the high street but was confused by the instructions and a came across this site while looking for clarification.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After rinsing, my hair was a bit sleeker (less frizz), yet as it dried it ended up looking the way it always does (!)</li>
            <li> Now, it takes less than 10 minutes to dry and style and it lasts DAYS!</li>
            <li> It has made me money, due to all the fixes that I have had to do.</li>
            <li> Just not worth what minimal straightening it did.</li>
            <li> I stayed about 2 inches away from my scalp and left for 10 minutes instead of the usual 15 to 25.</li>
            <li> other people have mentioned in their reviews) and would even break as if it were a rubber band.</li>
            <li> Reading other reviews, I saw done people ended up with bald spots.</li>
            <li> Then...it went back to being frizzy, but no more curls.  </li>
            <li> I have used a similar product that Walgreens sells that did work in the past.  </li>
            <li> First those results are fake and two as grown women</li>
            <li> will not use this product again nor will I recommend it to anyone else until Suave figures out why it ruined other peoples hair.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have any breakage or balding as I read in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> First off, it smells absolutely terrible and my head starting burning and my hair falling out and breaking off within minutes of applying the first step.  </li>
            <li> I will not use it again due to the fact that I color my hair and the Suave test told me I shouldn&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> other words, if you don&#x27;t want to perm your hair?  </li>
            <li> other words, if you don&#x27;t want to perm your hair?  </li>
            <li> I do still use a curling iron to frame my bangs around my face but other than that</li>
            <li> I read through all the direction and didn&#x27;t find anything about grey hair having any trouble.</li>
            <li> I donate my hair so other children do not have to go through this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I should have listened to all the other warnings.</li>
            <li> I am a teacher and all my students were commenting on my hair as well as all the other staff at the school.</li>

            <li> After I was finished with the entire process, my hair is just as (if not more) frizzy as before</li>
            <li> I learned the formaldehyde and other chemicals could cause hair loss, damage to the scalp, and cancer, so I thought I&#x27;d try this product.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE EXTREMELY FRIZZY HAIR</li>
            <li> Extremely overpowering.  </li>
            <li> For the past year, I have been coloring my hair at home myself and I had just colored it about 4 to 5 weeks prior to using this product.</li>
            <li> I bought all the other products that go with this line</li>
            <li> based off of the other reviews for this product, I&#x27;d take caution...</li>
            <li> Use this product extremely cautiously.  </li>
            <li> My hair didn&#x27;t fall out like the other reviewers...</li>
            <li> The fact that the coloring didn&#x27;t take is a very small nuisance compared to the major problems other reviewers had.  </li>
            <li> or if it just didn&#x27;t take).act that the coloring didn&#x27;t take is a very small nuisance compared to the major problems other reviewers had.  </li>
            <li> and I was very curious about the treatment.  </li>
            <li> I was very careful with the timing and everything</li>
            <li> read all the directions and warnings very carefully after reading the reviews here.</li>
            <li> I read all the instructions very very carefully.</li>
            <li> Be very, very careful about the warnings on the side of the box-</li>
            <li> followed the directions very carefully, minding all of the warnings given.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I&#x27;m 1/2 Mexican and I have VERY thick coarse wavy/always frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> a Pheto deep damage mask that is amazing on the worst burnt hair I ever saw and</li>
            <li> It might have some in it, but it is not an active ingredient.</li>
            <li> think after I wash in again in a few days, then blow dry it</li>
            <li> I think a zero stars option would be a move forward too for actively harmful products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate to sound like such a vain person</li>
            <li> i will be starting a petition soon against this product for false advertisment, as this is NOT a keratine product,, it only contains 10% keratine, this is a CHEMICAL straightner!!!</li>
            <li> only a few handfuls, and not enough to leave any bald spots (my hair was previously quite thick anyway).</li>
            <li> and I hardly ever have done color or straiting minus the professional keratin treatments I&#x27;ve had in the past.  </li>
            <li> I was a little worried after I rinsed it out because my hair felt very dry and brittle.  </li>
            <li> I am using a round brush to shape it and the curling iron just to give it a little body and feather it back, but no more fuzzing or strange bang curls in every direction, etc..</li>
            <li> and I usually like the flat iron look...</li>
            <li> The other half is dry, brittle, and dead.  </li>
            <li> After using this product, I found my hair to be very dry and straw-like, not smooth.</li>
            <li> 2 months after application, my hair is very dry &amp; a few shades lighter in color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used other Suave products and had been content.  </li>
            <li> It stripped all color out of my hair and I was left with dull, lifeless, damaged, fried hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is so short and so chopped with layers that I hardly recognize myself.</li>
            <li> but there is very little keratin mixed with the abundance of harsh chemicals</li>
            <li> I ended up going to the salon this weekend and cutting off SEVERAL inches of hair, and now my hair is back up above my shoulders with lots of layers, and there is still fried frizz.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth it.  </li>
            <li> My hair began to fall out in fistfuls, losing an average of 200-300 strands</li>
            <li> I am going to try deep conditioning but will probably have to have at least 2 inches cut off the ends, including all the layers.</li>
            <li> product is erroneously label like keratin, but really it is a relaxer and should be applied by a hair</li>
            <li> IT IS SO NOT WORTH</li>
            <li> I used this product for 15 mins, as I have died my hair dark brown a month ago.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE RISK.</li>
            <li> died my hair dark brown about 6 months ago but haven&#x27;t done anything since.</li>
            <li> Let me also state that i came close to buying it anyways but thought its not worth hurting my hair over</li>
            <li> I will do another temp color next week as directions state to wait at least a week to color after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the words \\&quot;30 day</li>
            <li> I was wrong, but the treatment in the box did give me straight hair for 30 days.</li>
            <li> only it was too late...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Given the risk and the time I would say this product is not worth it at all.</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS : Not enough of the keratin treatment (no 1)product for my thick mane&lt;br /&gt;Probably not for caucasian hair (read the reviews)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Test the smoothing cream on the skin behind your ear, or your forearm near your elbow.</li>
            <li> It is layered and all layers are frizzy on the ends, it&#x27;s limp and has absolutely no body.</li>
            <li> The strands were completely ruined and thin and breaking off at the root.  </li>
            <li> Good grief, I have a MULLET!  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it will frizz especially on humid Texas days.</li>
            <li> I knew this wasn&#x27;t the same thing they do in salons, it smells like a hair relaxer/perm, and the results are the same as a hair relaxer, unhealthy, shapeless hair.</li>
            <li> My hair type is naturally very coarse and thick</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse hair, a lot of it!</li>
            <li> I do have curly finer hair and maybe this will work for people with coarse thick hair.  </li>
            <li> This is hair that has broken off to my scalp or just completely fallen out.  </li>
            <li> I am blessed with thick hair and lost about a third of the volume of my hair.</li>
            <li> Very let down, disappointed &amp; near tears....</li>
            <li> I have really coarse, thick hair and this product worked well, but it felt like it weighed it down some.</li>
            <li> Idk what I may have done wrong or its just my hair was so damaged but the back of my hair is staying straight when it usually curls!</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse, slightly wavy hair.</li>
            <li> Her hair is less coarse and not quite is thick.</li>
            <li> after 70$$ and 4 inches less hair, I can at least go out in public.</li>
            <li> A lady I work with used this product, she had hair down to her waist.</li>
            <li> However, after two weeks I am just trying my hair down as it has been pulled up since the day before Easter.  </li>
            <li> Her damage was from the chin down.</li>
            <li> product smoothed down my hair, like it was supposed to.  </li>
            <li> But it strips down the hair to accomplish that.</li>
            <li> This was just what I got out of my brush not the clumps that went down the drain.</li>
            <li> My hair was down to my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this product would help cut down on my frizzies and the poofieness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear my hair down</li>
            <li> The suave \\&quot;help\\&quot; line mearly took down my information and promised me a refund, even though this is going to cost me dearly.  </li>
            <li> I just want my hair to lay down and be \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Use a small amount of a product like Bio-Silk for frizzy and softness and air dry.</li>
            <li> After the final rinse and applying the leave-in conditioner while my hair was still wet, I did see a dramatic change in how my hair looked wet.  </li>
            <li> I thought my ends were dry in the past...</li>
            <li> I have always had thick coarse tightly coiled hair, unmanageable beyond belief.</li>
            <li> The only real complaint I have is that this treatment totally stripped the rinse I had put in and lightened my hair a few notches.</li>
            <li> and if I had the money think I would just break down and get extensions till this mess could grow</li>
            <li> curls were less pronounced but</li>
            <li> The keratin treatments typically work well</li>
            <li> is I ALWAYS leave it on less time</li>
            <li> My suggestion is as the hair dresser said is to do the skin test for irritation and use it for less time.</li>
            <li> for black hair&lt;br /&gt;Straightens your hair somewhat&lt;</li>
            <li> You have all saved me the heartache that I was just about to make less then an hour ago.</li>
            <li> did glance over the directions and thought it a bit odd becuse of the gloves and warnings,</li>
            <li> Half of my hair is smooth(ish) and shiny(ish).  </li>
            <li> My hair is half of what is used to be.  </li>
            <li> Now, it is half the thickness, scalp showing in the front and fried.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Someone commented on my previous review that this product was a relaxer; after a week of seeing what has hapenned to my hair, i agree.</li>
            <li> I read the directions wrong and only left step 1 on for 7 minutes.  </li>
            <li> on my hair five minutes less than the directions specified.  </li>
            <li> My hair now looks like what I typical spend an hour doing.  </li>
            <li> I leave even less time the product because noticed that the hair color had change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I touched up any slight waves with a hot-iron straightener.  </li>
            <li> It did have a slight \\&quot;perm\\&quot; smell to it.</li>
            <li> My hair has a slight wave (and some frizz)</li>
            <li> is it less frizzy?</li>
            <li> But when I do want smoother, less wavy hair for a bit, I think this&#x27;ll be my go-to kit to get the job done at home.r or anything.  </li>
            <li> But when I do want smoother, less wavy hair for a bit, I think this&#x27;ll be my go-to kit to get the job done at home.</li>
            <li> After reading some online reviews, I decided to do it, but to slightly adjust the prescribed process.</li>
            <li> It burned my hair and half of it fell out.  </li>
            <li> I noticed much less frizz</li>
            <li> HALF THE HAIR</li>
            <li> I use to have wavy, slightly frizzy, medium thickness, hair.</li>
            <li> After putting this Suave product on my hair, within less than 5 minutes, my hair was falling out in clumps.</li>
            <li> so I am disclined to subject myself to the testing of this one.</li>
            <li> It started turning into the typical frizzy mess</li>
            <li> nothing touched this mess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m devastated, every day is a struggle to maintain this burnt mess.</li>
            <li> Nothing will fix this mess.  </li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair was a mess...</li>
            <li> and then it turns into a frizzy tangled mess that poofs away from my face.</li>
            <li> My hair is now a frizzy mess.  </li>
            <li> FRIED MESS</li>
            <li> I am having to go in to see hair stylist tomorrow to see what she can do with this mess as I do not want to lose a lot of my length</li>
            <li> Please report this to the FDA at:  (...)  Copy and paste the link to your browser and it will take you to the page with the toll free number to call.  </li>
            <li> and it is a mess.</li>
            <li> : I would like let you all know my hair still is a mess.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair, and no patience for spending (literally) hours blow-drying and flat-ironing it into submission after I shampoo it.  </li>
            <li> Just like a perm can be used to force tight curls in hair, it can be used to force them out.</li>
            <li> So I bought it and then after reading the directions was a little hesitant that I would mess it up.</li>
            <li> My thin, fine hair is now dry and fried--much like after a bad perm--and permanently altered.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant after reading the instructions.</li>
            <li> When I was rinsing my hair, it seemed as if little bits of my hair and some longer strands kept breaking and falling out.  </li>
            <li> I pray each and everyday that I recover from this mess.  </li>
            <li> My hair started coming out in clumps in the little brush as I was combing it through.  </li>
            <li> I had a little melting scare during the come through and immediately rinsed the solution out.  </li>
            <li> Those are some scary stories, wow!</li>
            <li> My hair felt smoother but a little fried.</li>
            <li> So not worth using this product!</li>
            <li> I had a little frizz towards the ends of the hair.</li>
            <li> I read all the warnings and did a little research.</li>
            <li> Based on some other reviews though, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d risk it.</li>
            <li> and I used to get perms when I was little (10-12)</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nothing a little product can&#x27;t cover up.  </li>
            <li> ...that sounds a little odd.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Please tell everyone you know, it&#x27;s not worth the risk!</li>
            <li> Before both of our hair was a little frizzy with some damage</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the risk!</li>
            <li> I mean tight ringlets that dry in knots!  </li>
            <li> I can normally get away with shampooing my hair every other day, but I really can&#x27;t do that now without looking terrible.  </li>
            <li> At the very least, they have definitely lost me as a customer.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, dry, fragile, fizzy, curly hair that has always been a problem for me</li>
            <li> knows how depending on the amount of time that has passed by the time each occasion happens, all because I wanted a little extra and UNNECESSARY vanity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry for those who&#x27;ve had bad experiences, but this is an amazing product for me.</li>
            <li> I have waves in my hair nothing huge, just annoying to me, which is why I bought this.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I&#x27;ve had with it is it has definitely dried my hair out quite a bit, so I have to use leave-in conditioners to try and restore it, but it doesn&#x27;t work so well.</li>
            <li> She now had to cut her hair into a short bob, but even that did not get rid of all the broken pieces.</li>
            <li> I pray everyday for this pressure to go away.  </li>
            <li> It feels horrid like straw and looks even worse if possible.</li>
            <li> As I towel dried my hair</li>
            <li> She cries everyday.</li>
            <li> Use an everyday keratin treatment like Ion Repair Solutions.</li>
            <li> I closely followed the directions for all 3 steps, and then blow dried my hair.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not comfortable perming your hair at home; then Step 1 is not going to help that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am writing my review as I&#x27;m crying sitting at the hair salon with my hair dresser trying to figure out what to do with my hair.</li>
            <li> May I say that was a waste.</li>
            <li> I blow dried</li>
            <li> I guess i shouldn&#x27;t complain because some poor women actually lost their hair, what a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, all is not lost though..</li>
            <li> AND IT IS SO DEAD</li>
            <li> But when I tried to use this treatment on my hair a few nights ago, it had no effect</li>
            <li> I am also putting coconut oil in my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> As it is I have lost enough that my hair is now thin and it has compromised the integrity of my hair.</li>
            <li> I waited a few days to see any improvement, but the hair just kept breaking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s DAMAGED, BROKEN, I did not even last 10 minutes!I was supposed to leave it on for 20!</li>
            <li> really hated this, but I admit that&#x27;s mostly because it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I took out my round brush and my blowdryer and about a minute in</li>
            <li> I applied the treatment on Thursday and immediately after drying it knew that I was in trouble.  </li>
            <li> I have not stopped crying since.  </li>
            <li> I dried it and thought maybe that would help.</li>
            <li> I am writing this review after crying for over an hour and after calling Suave to complain (they din&#x27;t help at all</li>
            <li> also noticed the box said it lasts up to thirty days but that the treatment could not be repeated again until a few months have passed</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know what dead ends</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s the difference between a dead end were</li>
            <li> a few minutes ago I reported this product to Consumer Reports AND the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).  </li>
            <li> I am now able to at least get my hair brushed, but still it looks like crap!</li>
            <li> I jumped in the shower crying and praying that I wouldn&#x27;t lose all of my hair.</li>
            <li> They are no better than the companies with hidden formaldehyde in their products.</li>
            <li> Layers from my hair breaking in half and a rats nest that can&#x27;t be combed!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why I had no problems, yet so many other people had horrible problems.  </li>
            <li> During the process my hair felt stiff and as if it was melting together.  </li>
            <li> I am spending a fortune trying to find a products to tame the frizz.  </li>
            <li> I am angry because my hair was beautiful and now it is disgusting and feels like straw.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out for a long time and now that it had almost gotten to a length I like, I&#x27;m afraid I will have to get it cut short again.</li>
            <li> Overly tame in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> but really it&#x27;s not a huge deal vs. hitting a dead end in the woods on a stormy night in the middle of nowhere and your battery dies and your phone is dead and some weird guy with an axe is heading toward your</li>
            <li> it crinkled up tightly!</li>
            <li> As I was blow drying it, my hair was breaking off bad, and it tried pretty frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product on Sunday and had a pretty bad experience with it in terms of scalp pain, hair breakage and hair loss.  </li>
            <li> It took me a long time to grow my hair past my shoulders and now I&#x27;m afraid I may be starting over.</li>
            <li> I have very long very thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> I keep hoping that the longer I put up with it, the less embarassing it will be and I can avoid chopping off all that I have worked hard to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; she felt so bad for me but the only thing we could do was take off 3\\&quot; and she layered it up about 5\\&quot; in the back to get rid of the permanent damage.</li>
            <li> What I was left with was so bad that I actually went out and purchased a wig.</li>
            <li> Like the poor girl who lost her hair above said, this product does not deserve a star, but Amazon makes you select at least one.</li>
            <li> You probably have naturally dry hair to begin with, this will damage it and make it worse.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks dry &amp; damaged and I have parts and pieces broken throughout.</li>
            <li> I for one will not be taking any chances with my hair and will continue to spend the outrageous amount of money it cost to have a REAL keratin treatment done by a professional salon.</li>
            <li> ITS NOT WORTH IT!!</li>
            <li> Its not worth the gamble!!</li>
            <li> I just hope that my landlord will be understanding when my rent is a little bit late.  </li>
            <li> I saw how bad it really was.</li>
            <li> It looks, smells &amp; feels like a bad perm and even when I apply detangler to my hair, it kinks up &amp; breaks when I try to even gently comb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I had done \\&quot;Curl Free\\&quot; which is no longer on the market.</li>
            <li> had to buy a expensive deep conditioner</li>
            <li> I have had salon KERATIN treatments in the past.</li>
            <li> The keratin treatments I&#x27;ve used in the past did not have two steps (like a perm).</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WILL DESTROY YOUR HAIR!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words cannot describe my experience!</li>
            <li> That being said I usually use their shampoos and conditioners as well.</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m a so sorry to all the women who now have severly damaged hair and thank you infinity for posting your stories so someone like me wouldn&#x27;t have the same results.</li>
            <li> and I sat with it on for about 5minutes past the time I was supposed to.</li>
            <li> If you are afraid of treating your hair, you probably should consult a professional before trying this product out.  </li>
            <li> the rest of it is past my shoulders.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I&#x27;ve had in the past three decades.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am sorry to hear that others have had detrimental results, but I can only say I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It is not ok to sell a product that works 50% of the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I fell for the commercial.</li>
            <li> Coupons and hand lotion and refunds will not fix the hair and scalps of those who were unfortunate enough to use it.</li>
            <li> and I have had keratin treatments in the past and</li>
            <li> having them try to figure out what to do with my hair that was past my shoulders that is now a bob up to my ears.</li>
            <li> I have not purchased or used this product but have been anxiously awaiting it&#x27;s release so that I could use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;MY HAIR IS SO FRIED AND DEAD!</li>
            <li> I am disgusted by the irreparable damage and the hundreds I&#x27;m having to pay to make my hair healthy again.</li>
            <li> Not magic, but for someone who has always wanted straighter hair it fits the bill.</li>
            <li> and I am still sad to wake up to my short damaged hair.</li>
            <li> NOT MANY.</li>
            <li> I read the box I haven&#x27;t had anything done to my hair besides it being dyed a shade darker in the past</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure whether or not it did what it was supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> I was wrong, it&#x27;s not the same type of a treatment, rather its a treatment meant to mimic the results of a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I thought that if Suave came out with a simplified system that give similar effects as those expensive treatments, I want to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> *NOT SAFE</li>
            <li> and after you&#x27;re done, or on the floor of a salon because you had to PAY someone to cut off  the 3, 4, or for some, even 6 to 8 inches of DEAD HAIR!  </li>
            <li> I usually avoid reading others&#x27; reviews until after I&#x27;ve tried a product, but this time was an exception.  </li>
            <li> not sure how the models got their&#x27;s that way.</li>
            <li> As I said, I&#x27;m 31 days past the date I used and there is still a faint hint even after daily shampoos.  </li>
            <li> mean I&#x27;m talking the way your hair gets when you accidently burn a piece and the rest of it curls up in that brittle little tangle.</li>
            <li> I had about 2 minutes left, so unfortunately the damage had already been done.</li>
            <li> Doing this and washing with cold water should stop the action of the perm in this product.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair are shiny and my hair is softer than usual.  </li>
            <li> Same story, I was unable to get a brush through my hair again.</li>
            <li> Three words, WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> However, I am not able to use it</li>
            <li> When I wash it, no matter how much conditioner I add, it feels strange and stiff, and looks awful when dried.  </li>
            <li> i just plain sucks Please</li>
            <li> I think cutting it all off is going to be the only way to go to get rid of this mess.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smoother and very fluffy.</li>
            <li> but I am a little afraid of next time.</li>
            <li> It still looked very damaged, but after the oil, at least it didn&#x27;t feel as bad.</li>
            <li> However, using this product on my natural 4B Kinky Curly (Natural) hair was the worst hair mistake I have ever made.</li>
            <li> now I as well am among the numerous female victims of this horrid crap.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t understand why Suave would sell this crap and destroy it&#x27;s reputation.  </li>
            <li> Just want to say thanks to everyone who took the time to write their review and that my heart goes out to y&#x27;all :(</li>
            <li> we do see the bad reviews by other people here, and really feel sorry for them.</li>
            <li> so shocked to see all of the new users with destroyed hair.</li>
            <li> I have 3 young kids to take care of and its almost impossible to do so with this pain.  </li>
            <li> My mom and I are both very lucky that we did not lose any hair or have any bald spots but it should have warning labels because this product is horrible.</li>
            <li> I have had bad experiences with salons in the past and with certain products, but nothing like what these poor people have gone through.  </li>
            <li> I feel really badly because so many people had bad experiences with it, but I&#x27;m not sure why mine would work</li>
            <li> Every new glob of gummy hair made me feel like I was going to get sick.  </li>
            <li> I seemed to have a hard time blow drying it.</li>
            <li> Once you start to feel the BURNING sensation just minutes into the application, that horrific suffocating ODOR, or when you can see your hair MELTING and CLUMPING up, and BREAKING or FALLING OUT, you can&#x27;t frantically quickly rinse or shampoo it out to make it stop - the damage is done, and it will only take minutes!  </li>
            <li> My hair is now to my neck and it is still hard to manage with.</li>
            <li> you get a little annoyed</li>
            <li> I have to get it chopped off and start all over with expensive repairing treatments all because I wanted a little less frizz for the summer!</li>
            <li> They told me that no one else had complained....</li>
            <li> After all of the negative reviews, I refuse to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually considering cutting off my hair, it&#x27;s that</li>
            <li> For all those that have suffered crying nights (and afternoons), heartache, frustration and sheer anger, please hang in there.  </li>
            <li> I got this product because my hair has been frizzy lately</li>
            <li> but I had hoped it would at least improve my hair.  </li>
            <li> Now I need to attempt to find something that is going to at least make it some what liveable.</li>
            <li> I have not had highlights or bleached hair or a perm since late 1980&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> and then we are cutting it to my shoulders and we pray it wont break any further.</li>
            <li> My poor fiancée had to hold me while I sobbed my eyes out and made myself physically ill over the massive amount of hair I lost.</li>
            <li> I have lost at least 3 inches of hair, and now have a hair cut that would have been all the rage in maybe the 70&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> During humidity my hair fuzzes, gets weird waves and curls and is frustrating - my style doesn&#x27;t last 5 minutes on a humid day.</li>
            <li> I rinsed my hair immediately but it was too late.</li>
            <li> Why do I not own that set?</li>

            <li> i called and complained and all the women told me was there is a warning on the paper that comes with the</li>
            <li> Not only was my hair completely fried and ruined, puffy, unmanageable, HORRIBLE looking</li>
            <li> I jumped in the shower but it was too late.  </li>
            <li> I would set aside at least one hour for this process.</li>
            <li> And one that sucks, at that.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell (which is disclosed on the package) was the least of my problems.</li>
            <li> Suave has been completely negligent by falsely advertising this dangerous chemical and they need to be held accountable.</li>
            <li> I contacted suave and complained now i am waiting to see what they can do for me .</li>
            <li> I have NEVER written a negative review about ANY product before.  </li>
            <li> negative I would give it is the smell.  </li>
            <li> It was too late.</li>
            <li> , you have to wash your hair at least 3 times and</li>
            <li> I have to go cut at least 2 inches off.</li>
            <li> My hair still has a weird texture to it when wet</li>
            <li> She says we will need to cut at least 4inches and do some intensive treatments biweekly.  </li>
            <li> I plan on giving my head at least 4 days of rest</li>
            <li> How I wish I had read all of these negative reviews before doing this to myself.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy medium-to-coarse brown hair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, curly, color treated hair.  </li>
            <li> This is simply a thick perm solution that is combed through hair.</li>
            <li> Anyways, my hair is thick, wavy</li>
            <li> I have thick hair which I have not colored in at least two years.</li>
            <li> I then grabbed my thick detangling comb and it had a lot of hair on it whenever i tried to run it through my hair.</li>
            <li> I now have hair that is broken off and we are not talking a few splint ends here.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair and shed quite a bit when I wash it</li>
            <li> and it is kinky, thick and frizzy, so</li>
            <li> Go get the Redken extreme products they really helped salvage my God awful hair caused by Suave.</li>
            <li> I mean I had no idea what I was going to happen</li>
            <li> My hair has body, sleek, no more stringiness, and is very shiny now.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry for those who had bad results with this.</li>
            <li> CHEAPER----definately not better!</li>
            <li> From the information I&#x27;ve gathered, unless your hair is \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair, and I mean truly virgin hair - never had any processing, etc.</li>
            <li> BUT, DAMAGE WAS DONE CAME TO ME CRYING!!</li>
            <li> It stinks and takes a long time to apply.  </li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length with tight medium-sized curls that are very hard to keep in place and in the way I want them to be; they&#x27;re just all over the place!</li>
            <li> I just hate that we live in a world</li>
            <li> I am so upset I called and complained because I&#x27;ve worked so hard at growing my hair out now to have it fried!</li>
            <li> SERIOUSLY PEOPLE IF I WERE A VAIN PERSON  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry that most of you had terrible experiences</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: AFTER 4 WEEKS: Have been applying olive oil daily to give hair at least some shine, but I am still extremely frustrated.</li>
            <li> Seriously jacked up.</li>
            <li> I am afraid to dry it.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be serious</li>
            <li> This has made my hair fall out, scalp constantly burn and itch, what is left of my hair is fried and disgusting.</li>
            <li> It was seriously like a brillo pad.</li>
            <li> I am seriously considering getting a haircut but from the looks of it, I will have to get 3-4 inches cut off.</li>
            <li> There are warnings on the box that were a little bit scary but none of them applied to my hair.</li>
            <li> I hate how it left my hair with no body but possibly cutting the time in half or using less than recommend might change that</li>
            <li> it was all chemicals the bad ones that hurt your hair the same ones that give you a perm.  </li>
            <li> I was worried during the process as every time I would comb through my hair, my \\&quot;bangs\\&quot; would kink up really bad, and I&#x27;d have to straighten them back out with my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t have as bad of results as some of the reviewers, but I definitely won&#x27;t use it again or recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li> I assume the bad reviewers left the treatment on longer than they should have.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also the odor is bad so it only gets 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However I didn&#x27;t like some of the fumes (although hair dye is just as bad), and the way my head tingled a day later.  </li>
            <li> I came across some of the bad reviews while looking on how to try to do something to fix  besides getting my hair cut short.</li>
            <li> if you have had a bad reaction to this product as thousands of others please sign the petition [...]to help do your part in getting this product off the market so others do not have to suffer the same fate.</li>
            <li> Well i should have checked the ratings before because it fried my hair just as bad as a double process of 40 volume bleach.</li>
            <li> so I guess I&#x27;m not a good candidate for the treatment either.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and hated it.  </li>
            <li> Not a good review anywhere.</li>
            <li> I hate that this has completely ruined the bottom two inches of my hair.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m going to have to completely whacked off just to not look like the idiot I am for purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> To anyone who is saying this product ruined their hair either didnt do it right or had really horrible hair and should NOT have tried to use it.</li>
            <li> if I flat iron it looks awful, if I let it dry</li>
            <li> This was the worst $10 something I spent and is now costing me hundreds to get my hair back.</li>
            <li> There are still a couple of long hairs there, so hopefully its not going to be so bad.</li>
            <li> That means if I have to just cut it off, I&#x27;ll be losing at least 10 inches of hair!</li>
            <li> To all of you other ladies that had the same problem what did you do for your hair after the dreadful results?</li>
            <li> , i have used every product on the market trying to tam the frizz and was never successful until now..</li>
            <li> Again, I&#x27;m sorry for the scary and awful experiences many of you have had</li>
            <li> I totally wish I would have atleast read the reviews.. :(</li>
            <li> The first step smells awful</li>
            <li> I have been back and forth on deciding to use this product and have now decided against it due to the horrific stories.  </li>
            <li> The only con is that I can&#x27;t use it again for 3 months :(</li>
            <li> /&gt;Suave should be forced to take this product off of the market!</li>
            <li> But when I washed my hair after using this stuff, my hair felt dry and it stuck together really bad.</li>
            <li> First of all, I feel badly for the people who had a bad experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I am now considering shaving this mess off, but I&#x27;m afraid that it may have done permanent damage to my scalp.</li>
            <li> If you buy this product do yourself a favor return it before use or at the very least read every inch of the box you can before purchasing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very dangerous and can fry, damage, and give u bald spots if u over use it or do not follow the directions and the RED CAUTION STATEMENTS on the box.  </li>
            <li> I have always had sligtly frizzy wavy hair, very thick.</li>
            <li> I am not sure where all the reviewers who left bad reviews went wrong!</li>
            <li> I am sorry that others had a hard time with it</li>
            <li> I believe that 99%  of the bad reviews of people saying it fried their hair, is because they did not read the directions carefully.</li>
            <li> Stupid me thought it has to be simple</li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone except the guy in the commercial and the girl on the cover of the box, and whomever came up with this stupid thing.</li>
            <li> and my hair has never looked worse.</li>
            <li> I have to put so much Moroccan oil in it just to not look puffy, burnt and disgusting.</li>
            <li> I have a LOT of broken hairs and fried ends that I did not have before.  </li>
            <li> My hair is layered and now a waterfall and horribly burnt ends which cascade the whole length of my hair.</li>
            <li> Which I don&#x27;t, and every time I said that she looked confused.  </li>
            <li> The lady at the Salon said that it had &#x27;broken the bonds&#x27; in my hair - whatever that means.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say goodbye to my long locks just yet.  :(  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing was a sweetheart about it, I would have probably broken up with me.  </li>
            <li> AND I MIGHT LEARN TO READ AMAZON REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING BOOTLEG PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I realize that my damage could have been a lot worse.</li>
            <li> nothing can be worse than that.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin.</li>
            <li> the worse my hair has become.</li>
            <li> and I think I can hold off on cutting it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I guess I will have to either spendmore money to get a wig to hide the places where my hair is now thin, or wear a lot of hats.</li>
            <li> So Suave please tell me why about 40% of my hair has broken off and</li>
            <li> Some people have broken hair.</li>
            <li> It said I had to wait 14 days before using it, and I was confused.  </li>
            <li> just stringy ends now because of the hair all breaking off and stray hairs poking out everywhere that have broken off.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s going to get even worse.  </li>
            <li> Poor misrepresentation by Suave</li>
            <li> Ive never experienced anything like this.</li>
            <li> During the process I got confused on one direction and looked it up here to see what people had to say.</li>
            <li> too am confused why this product is on the market.  </li>
            <li> So it seems like playing a game of chance if you use it.</li>
            <li> Its really your worst enemy.</li>
            <li> Oh how I wish I had my annoying waves back!</li>
            <li> if you r reading this, please do not use this product,, it will ruin your hair.. they need to take this off market.. its false advertisement.</li>
            <li> This for me was a case of false advertizing &amp; ignorance on my part.</li>
            <li> I WANT MY CURLS BACK, ALL I WANTED WAS TO GET IT LESS FRIZZY, AND WHAT I GOT WAS NO CURLS, NO SHINE AND UGLY STRAW HAIR. :(</li>
            <li> And in fact hesistate to give 5 star review here for this product, fearing that it might encourage someone to buy this product and then suffer the bad fate as other folks.</li>
            <li> long story short, conditioner good-30 day treatment bad, very bad.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to hear all the bad reviews for this product, but I&#x27;m not surprised.  </li>
            <li> (Seriously.. their idea of mimicking Aveda&#x27;s Rosemary Mint Shampoo and Conditioner is laughable)  </li>
            <li> (Seriously.. their idea of mimicking Aveda&#x27;s Rosemary Mint Shampoo and Conditioner is laughable)  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bald spots, but my experience with this crap has been pretty bad.</li>
            <li> After having read so many awful 1 star reviews :(</li>
            <li> can you hear the dramatic horror music.</li>
            <li> my hair is still terrible, but at least I can go out in public.  </li>
            <li> When my husband called their helpline (because I was crying too bad to call myself)</li>
            <li> Add me to the list of ladies who sat crying in my room after doing this \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Ruined my hair so bad I had to get 4 inches of \\&quot;dead\\&quot; hair</li>
            <li> and because frankly after the smell of the stuff (REEKS LIKE RAW SEWERAGE!!!</li>
            <li> I am very sorry for the ladies that had terrible results, but for me it worked pretty well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just bad</li>
            <li> It usually takes us a painful twenty minutes every morning to brush out the knots.  </li>
            <li> I happen to walk down the hair section and saw the suave keratin CRAP.</li>
            <li> I stood there in the mirror crying my eyes out!!!!  </li>
            <li> It is a perm in fake packaging.  </li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong so about 7 minutes into it</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I used this product without reading reviews prior to my horrific experience.  </li>
            <li> Its extremely difficult to attempt a home relaxing hair treatment because I would start to burn halfway through applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The results are scary and that is not an understatement.  </li>
            <li> has done to help the people that their product messed up, this horrible line is still on shelves, and doubt they will be paying for the bills that people have incurred getting help from people who actually know what they are doing.</li>
            <li> and nothing went wrong or weird.</li>
            <li> I will let everyone I know about your story so that it might save others from making this same horrible mistake.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the reviews that started to come out were scary, so I waited and debated whether or not to risk it.</li>
            <li> I feel so sorry for the women who had hair loss and damage from this product.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, I thought this would do the trick.</li>
            <li> The mere thought makes me want to cry.  </li>
            <li> Scary, right?&lt;br /&gt;3)</li>
            <li> I knew something was wrong.</li>
            <li> I was so wrong it isn&#x27;t even funny.&lt;br</li>
            <li> (sorry about that</li>
            <li> unfortunately she was born with her father&#x27;s uncontrollable hair and no longer wanted to look like Albert Einstein.  </li>
            <li> I am so angry, and when I look in the mirror I cry, all my hair gone.</li>
            <li> she cut out the worst of the damage, she tried to cut layers as evenly as possible</li>
            <li> I am sorry for those who had to endure the awful experiences with this product and thankful you thought enough of others to post your reviews.</li>
            <li> I did not have any ill effects from this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never has such a horrible experience.</li>
            <li> I immediately rinsed this product out, but my hair felt weird</li>
            <li> I read the freakish scary warnings and they did not apply to me</li>
            <li> I knew nothing about except that their names would be difficult to read aloud.  </li>
            <li> (look terrible with short hair).&lt;br /&gt;Yes</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> This is the worst mistake and most terrible purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  </li>
            <li> Boy, was I WRONG.</li>
            <li> It will corrupt your hair.</li>
            <li> Today she said her hair feels weird in spots.</li>
            <li> I was SO wrong.</li>
            <li> cuz you went the wrong way and have to turn the car around</li>
            <li> , it felt gummy and weird.  </li>
            <li> I was so sad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry I ever used it.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical and nauseated!</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> Needless to say my hair did not absorb any keratin at all but is literally fried.  </li>
            <li> I am really careful about my hair as I lost a lot of it when I was very sick as a teenager, I am vain about it now sadly.</li>
            <li> The stylist was in shock over how badly my hair had been damaged and after cutting the majority of it off in a boyish style was still not able to remove all of the damage.</li>
            <li> It feels very unhealthy.</li>
            <li> Ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> Its taken that long to get out of the horrible shock of having to cut all my hair off.</li>
            <li> My ends are so dry and split its horrible!</li>
            <li> Now our hair is broken off and the ends are so bad that we will be getting about 2 inches cut off just to make it look presentable.  </li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s still wet you might burst into tears when you see the nasty CLUMPS of hair that you know</li>
            <li> After about a week of being miserable with the mess of hair</li>
            <li> This little box of crap has cost me a ton of money and ruined the investment I&#x27;ve put into the health of my hair for years!!!!  </li>
            <li> I am now afraid to try this product.</li>
            <li> The hairdresser has been cutting hair for 30 years and cannot believe the damage that this product has caused.</li>
            <li> I called a friend of mine who is a hair stylest a few days after the awful day</li>
            <li> The layers are choppy and terrible looking because she was afraid that if she thinned or texturized it, it would just cause the ends to keep shriveling and look even shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was to the point I was afraid to comb it.</li>
            <li> and I just used a macadamia nut hair mask (from cvs since im desperate) and</li>
            <li> it looks horrible and being told im stuck like this for a week nearly killed me.</li>
            <li> That is what I was afraid would happen</li>
            <li> My hair is fried!&lt;br /&gt;First off, I do all my hair care at home with the exception of cutting it, so</li>
            <li> IT IS DANGEROUS.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m afraid when I wash it</li>
            <li> I will be cutting a lot of in hopes of improving and will be getting some intensive conditioning treatments</li>
            <li> And FAIL!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> wrong!</li>
            <li> I am so sorry for everybody who did use it!  </li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> I am so mad at myself for not reading these reviews before using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sorry for all those women that it didn&#x27;t work for :(&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> I am very sorry for all those reviewers who said they had all those problems.  </li>
            <li> As I was drying my hair, I saw a very scary amount of hair coming out.</li>
            <li> I am very sorry for the pain you have all gone through.</li>
            <li> If you want a product that will make you lose your hair in a very scary way, then this is for you.</li>
            <li> Very very sorry for anyone who was fooled by the deceptive marketing of this product.</li>
            <li> Seriously, yesterday was the worst day</li>
            <li> hair was so bad I immediately called my Salon Saturday evening to see when I can get in.</li>
            <li> After reading all the bad reviews online I still decided to go ahead and do it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t screw up and just use it on your chemically treated hair, I imagine that&#x27;s why all these people are writing bad reviews.</li>
            <li> I considered not writing a review as there are plenty of bad reviews that will hopefully convince everyone to no do this to yourself.</li>
            <li> Did you use this product and have a bad result?</li>
            <li> It has caused my hair to break off, come out in places and just look bad.</li>
            <li> My hair has never looked so bad.</li>
            <li> But I figured if they sold it at the store with the hair dyes, how bad could it be?</li>
            <li> my hair was in BAD shape.  </li>
            <li> This time nothing bad happened.</li>
            <li> The look on her face told me it was bad.  </li>
            <li> I looked like I had tried to brush out a bad perm.</li>
            <li> There was a BAD REACTION</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t look that bad</li>
            <li> just like what happens when you get a bad home</li>
            <li> just like what happens when you get a bad home</li>
            <li> heart truly goes out to the woman who had a bad experience with this...</li>
            <li> that would be bad press...</li>
            <li> SO SO BAD.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, given the bad reactions of some users and the list of unpronounceable ingredients, I&#x27;m giving this one a pass.  </li>
            <li> I am now paying the price for trying to save money and having to walk around looking like a fool and worried at an interview of how bad my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I have never had my hair feel this bad</li>
            <li> Since I had just gotten my hair cut a week or so before, I knew it wasn&#x27;t because the hair was badly damaged.  </li>
            <li> my hair is so bad I was hoping for some help/advice in the meantime.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the amount of comments on how bad this product is.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> and I remember experimenting years ago with a chemical straightener (which also turned out badly)</li>
            <li> and she read them for herself and was shocked and enraged that this product is still being sold.....</li>
            <li> I am literally sick about this.  </li>
            <li> i dont know what to do, im sick to my stomach and dont want to leave my house.</li>

            <li> The worst part is knowing that Suave put this out and knew about the problems in December.  </li>

            <li> it&#x27;s awful, people at work have asked me what happened to my hair</li>
            <li> , it truly looks AWFUL</li>
            <li> However, after reading all the horrific stories, I have decided not to pursue this product any furthur.  </li>
            <li> I tried a vinegar/water rinse but still looked awful.</li>
            <li> I hated it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mortified by how terrible it looks.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews, but thought those wanting to try a straightening kit for the first time might be interested to know about this kit.  First off, my hair is very wavy and lightened 2 levels, from light brown to dark blond.  It fit the criteria mentioned on the box.  It is very fine but is long, very frizzy, and there is lots of it, so from shower to straight takes me 45 minutes with the dryer and flat iron.  I don&#x27;t have hours or hundreds of dollars to spend in the salon, so I figured I&#x27;ve give this kit a shot.  I followed the directions exactly.  It does have a very strong smell like a perm. Kind of a pain to rinse my hair not once but 3 times through the process. Once I was done my wet hair looked perfectly straight and silky.  I was excited!  But alas, after blowing it dry it was straight but as frizzy as ever.  I used the flat iron, and it did look great for two days.  After the requisite two days I washed it again and noticed the waves/curls were less pronounced but again, the frizz remained even after applying the leave-in and allowing it to air dry.  I would guess that it will reduce my flat-iron time from around 30 minutes to 20.  That&#x27;s the only real benefit I see from this product.  In 3 months I may try a product that is more expensive and is reviewed with better results.  So to sum up the pros:  slightly reduces wave/curl; makes hair silky soft; retains smoothness and straightness better after flat-ironing; inexpensive  To sum up the cons:  not a magical frizz eraser, must wait 3 months to touch up (or try a more effective straightener!), only marginally reduces wave.  Based on results alone I would only give this 2 stars.  You are probably not going to see the results you see on the box. But at $12.99 (at the drugstore) it&#x27;s worth a shot if you have minimal waves or frizz to tame, so that&#x27;s why I begrudgingly gave it 3 stars.</li>
            <li> Firstly, I came very close to purchasing and experimenting with this product, because I love trying new products.  I typically get keratin treatments every 3-4 months (since 2008), and I think they work well with frizzy, coarse, or unruly hair.  With that said, to the women who have suffered hair loss or breakage- my heart goes out to you. I have been there before (not with a keratin treatment but with a relaxer).  Nioxin hair re-growth system, Phyto, and Rene Furterer are all great products to help strengthen and regrow hair.  Phyto and Rene Furterer carry  vitamins (with biotin) that will most certainly promote growth.  The Nioxin hair system is  specifically designed for growth.  These products are slightly expensive, but they are well worth the money.  Find a good hair stylist to get you through this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, for those of you who are still interested in getting a keratin treatment, Coppola&#x27;s Keratin Complex Smoothing Therapy and Kera Straight are my favorite.  Ulta Salon offers the Kera Straight treatment, while many salons offer the Coppola treatment.  Do your research on the treatment and get a consultation.  The keratin treatments typically work well, it&#x27;s just a matter of finding the right treatment and the right stylist.  I hope this helps!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t but this product. I am a hair stylist and I have had several customers come in after using this product, with ruined hair. All I have to say is that this product will not save you money and listen to the warnings. It has made me money, due to all the fixes that I have had to do. THANKS SUAVE for being a company that put a relaxer product, (like a perm), out to the general public so I can make a profit too. There are reasons why these products should only be sold to professionals, not the general public.</li>
            <li> This product spent a lot of time on the shelf before I used it. Unwarrented time as it turned out. The directions were frightening with so many warnings and disclaimers that I pictured myself with bald spots or hair falling out and breaking and I don&#x27;t have much to spare. I finally decided that since I don&#x27;t color or perm my hair that I could do it. I don&#x27;t have colored hair because it is white. My hair curls easily and frizzed in humidity. It is shoulder length and I like it straight. I thought this would make it easier to have the smooth look. And it did. I did not have to flat iron my hair, just a blow dry with the provided styling conditioner,which works great. The first time I used this, I went to a dinner and my hair did not kink or tangle despite humid conditions. The following weeks let me continue to enjoy straight hair with very little effort on my part! Since I hate wasting time fussing with my hair this was a great product.</li>
            <li> I followed all instructions when using this product. My hair was never permed or bleached and I didn&#x27;t feel that it lacked moisture. After rinsing this product in the shower gobs of my hair started to fall out. The bottom inch or two or my hair was completely fried up. I have 6 different BALD SPOTS on my head!(right around my part) I am 24 years old and I now have to figure out how to part my hair so that the bald spots don&#x27;t show! I would not want anyone to suffer the way I have been with this hair crisis. Please do not use this product! It literally made me cry and my hair has never looked worse. The fact that this product is considered a treatment is a joke! Please keep in mind that I only rated this product one star because amazon will not allow no stars. Thanks Suave, for ruining my hair for the next 20 years.</li>
            <li> Before I begin, I would like to say that my hair is my pride and joy. I take immensely good care of it and spend hundreds of dollars a year on products. My hair is a fairly light blonde and reaches down below my waist (I would say its about 30 inches long if not more), so needless to say I&#x27;ve been growing it for awhile. My hair is not very thick, in fact its actually pretty thin and fine and prone to breakage. So when I read all the warnings on the package I was really scared and hesitant to use it on my hair. But I have never color treated my hair or permed and my hair is really healthy. So I decided to give it a go and try it out, thinking it would smooth out all the little fly-aways from short hairs and some crappy layers an amateur hair stylist cut in my hair. As soon as I smelled the cream from step one I knew that I had been mislead because it smelled just like a perm. Nonetheless, I believed in the manufactures advertising and pressed on. That first night it was actually quite difficult to style my hair after I had blow-dryed it, mainly because I rarely blow-dry my hair (it makes my hair unruly and unmanageable). I usually flat iron my hair about every day very lightly as my hair is naturally very straight, but I didn&#x27;t need to do so this time surprisingly. At first I really wasn&#x27;t impressed at all as my hair did not look shiny in the least (in fact it looked duller than it usually does), though I noticed my hair felt very soft. Well I washed my hair two days later and instead of blow drying it I let it air dry. My hair looked great! I had to straighten it lightly and after I did so my hair looked so shiny and smooth! Now two weeks later, my hair looks even better than it did after I first used the treatment. The biggest problem I&#x27;ve had with it is it has definitely dried my hair out quite a bit, so I have to use leave-in conditioners to try and restore it, but it doesn&#x27;t work so well. I don&#x27;t believe I will use this product again, just because I believe it wasn&#x27;t so good for my hair, but for a $10 suave product I was fairly impressed.</li>
            <li> I have read many of the reviews below, so I will make mine straight to the point because the 1 star, I hate it reviews are 100% accurate! I read all of the warnings and directions, and followed them to the tee. I am about to take a vacation to the Caribbean awarded by my company for the top 100 in the company, so I was excited to use this product to eliminate the frizz from the humidity. After reading the box and seeing the advertisements, I thought this was going to be something healthy and great for my hair. WHAT A LIE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve spent month conditioning my long hair and letting it grow because I am in a wedding as well this spring. After following full instructions, I started blow drying my hair to find it completely fried at the ends, damaged, split ends and very little noticeable as far as the claims Suave made this product would deliver for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was so bad I immediately called my Salon Saturday evening to see when I can get in. I had to wait 3 days because they were closed on Sunday and Monday. I couldn&#x27;t wait, the ends were so fried and split that my mother who was visiting started trimming the ends. I went and got several inches taken off of my hair and it&#x27;s still horrible and severely  damaged. My top rated hair dresser (who even has done celebrities hair) looked at the package and ingredients  and told me that he couldn&#x27;t believe this was packaged to where this was something good to make hair healthy and shiny. That this was a scam and Suave should be sued. I have very dark hair and the only thing I&#x27;ve done to is darken the ends that turn a little red in the California sun and ocean to my natural almost black natural color. The product says my hair would be ok as long as not lightened. And it wasn&#x27;t, but it did take all the hair color out as well as even changed the color of my natural hair to brown/red. So not only did I pay $80 for a cut, that didn&#x27;t help much but I had to pay for color all over my entire hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use Wen shampoo/condition which is known to do miracles to your hair and also a Pheto deep damage mask that is amazing on the worst burnt hair I ever saw and nothing touched this mess. I have to put so much Moroccan oil in it just to not look puffy, burnt and disgusting. I&#x27;m devastated, every day is a struggle to maintain this burnt mess.</li>
            <li> Hi I have damaged my hair so many times therefor I am really leary about what I use on my hair.  I bought this product the girl on the cover has silky hair how can I be so fooled by cover photos stupid me!!  Well I read all the directions got a shower and opened up step one and I was takin back it was all chemicals the bad ones that hurt your hair the same ones that give you a perm.  It is a perm in fake packaging.  So I knew that it would totally fry my hair so in the trash it went!!  I did however open step 2 and I smelled it no chemical smell at all so I put the whole bottle on my hair waited 7 minutes and washed it out and followed with a dime size amount of step 3 leave in conditioner and my hair is so soft, not straight by any means but the cutical seems sealed and my hair feels healthy so I dont know what I think.....  I will pay 10 again for step 2&amp;3 but step one will go in the trash where it belongs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Hope this has helped someone :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry to hear all the bad reviews for this product, but I&#x27;m not surprised.  PLEASE ladies leave this stuff up to the professionals! It may sound easy but anything that requires putting chemical in ur haor and using hot tools right after shpuld be done by someone licensed. Save your money and get it done at a salon!</li>
            <li> First off I have extremely curly hair... But I love my curls, they tend to frizz and cling to my head. Well after my last hair cut that went a little too short I decided to relax it. In the past I had done \\&quot;Curl Free\\&quot; which is no longer on the market. Since I had success with that at home relaxer I decided to try the suave kit. The only thing I did different and I did with curl free as well is I ALWAYS leave it on less time then it says on the box. So for extremely curly hair it says 25 minutes, I only combed it through for 17 minutes. It didn&#x27;t bring my hair to stick straight, but I didn&#x27;t want that either. This is also very important for a first time with a product... Easy to say \\&quot;next time i&#x27;ll keep it on longer\\&quot; much harder to deal with hair fried or falling out. I&#x27;ve done many different processes and honestly I was very pleased with the product. My hair is soft, and actually hangs looser! Yes, it I a perm product, but your hair is not going on rollers... You are doing what they might call a straight perm... Retraining the hair follicles. My suggestion is as the hair dresser said is to do the skin test for irritation and use it for less time. Also the conditioner that comes with the kit is great! You can buy it separately as well... If you are just looking for a smoother, try just buying the shampoo and conditioner instead of the kit!</li>
            <li> I just tried the Suave 30 day smoothing kit and I love it!  I only hope it lasts since I can&#x27;t use it for three months and we are headed into spring in the Northeast.  I too ignored the warnings about straightening it previously and having color treated hair, my last home relaxer was about 4 or 5 months ago and I colored it two weeks ago.  I am causasian with very naturally curly, course, frizzy type hair that is hard to manage, though in the fall and winter I can get it pretty smooth and straight with the blow dry and curling iron.  For this product, I set my timer for 20 minutes for step 1 and left step 2 in for about 20 minutes and my hair is as straight as when I relax it, I am amazed!  I am sorry that others had a hard time with it but for this works great, I am only sorry that I can use it for 3 months.</li>
            <li> [...]    Please sign this petition to have this product removed. As a licensed Cosmetologist, I have found many people are using this, even on \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair, have followed the instructions and have experienced , loss of hair, skin burns and chemical burns on hairline, as well as the hair \\&quot;melting\\&quot; right off.</li>
            <li> I had been growing out my hair for 2 years.  It was just getting to the point where it was flowing down my back.. I saw this product at Walgreens and had seen the commercials.  My hair is generally straight but it tends to get frizzy and a tad wavy so I was intrigued by the hair in the commercials and on the box of the shiny silky hair that was advertised and of course I wanted my hair to look like that.&lt;br /&gt;I started the treatment and it said to leave it on for 15 minutes after about 5 minutes I knew something was wrong so about 7 minutes into it I rinsed it out. Needless to say, as I was rinsing, many many clumps of hair started going down the drain, and the whole under layer of my bangs completely fried off. (Luckily it wasn&#x27;t all of my bangs.) This was 2 1/2 weeks ago. I tried every conditioner I could find, used oil even and no matter what I did my hair looked like straw or had been set on fire. The only way I could wear my hair out in public was in a bun. Finally today I went to the salon and they told me that there was another woman there that had used this product and had burnt her hair to the roots. Luckily mine wasn&#x27;t to the roots but I had to get 6 inches cut off.  2 years worth of hair growth down the drain. I&#x27;m so upset I could cry.</li>
            <li> I used this treatment last night without knowing that it is not a smoothing treatment instead it is a PERM. The first ingredient is AMMONIUM THIOGLYCOLATE which is perm solution.. natural keratin treatments have keratin not perm solution. I now have to worry with my hair breaking , falling out , or turning into a frizzy hot mess. This product is misleading in all ways. The cuticle seal cream has hydrogen peroxide which is a neutralizer for a perm.. People unknowingly are using this product without knowing the information listed on here. when you have a salon do your keratin treatment you do not have to leave your hair straight because it is not a perm. if you use this and you do not leave your hair straight it will still have the curl you  started with. I would advice taking pictures of your hair if you recieved damage from this product and go see yourself a lawyer.. we as consumers should not allow sauve to mislead us with their products when we are trusting them as females with our hair..</li>
            <li> Please, Please don&#x27;t take the chance with this product!  I have had several Keratin treatments and they work wonderful!!  I trid to take the cheap route this time and now I&#x27;m sorry I did.  By the time I was on the last step (blow drying)  my hair was breaking, almost melting.&lt;br /&gt;I had to buy a expensive deep conditioner and now I get to reconstruct dry, damaged hair.  It now feels like straw.</li>
            <li> When I first ordered this product there were no reviews for it. When I was ready to try the treatment the reviews were rolling in and they were terrible. I am now afraid to try this product. I am a reviewer and will try anything but in no way will I try something that a high majority of people say is damaging. Ugh. I&#x27;ve tried the Garnier version and even though I know a girl who claims her hair fell out over it, mine was perfect. Just not worth what minimal straightening it did. I&#x27;d rather try my luck with heat than with chemicals. I hope all the ladies whose hair was damaged find something that helps with repair.Ii once ruined my hair trying to go blonde and my hair was like straw. IC Fantasia&#x27;s Olive Deep conditioner worked wonders. My hair was smooth and lustrous again after two uses.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few weeks back and used it on my hair that was already in good health just slightly wavy....&lt;br /&gt;It FRIED my hair... Now I have a borderline afro on the left side of my head because my hair is so fried it crinkled up tightly! I can only tame it down by using a ton of product and heavy flat ironing right now.&lt;br /&gt;I finally grew my hair back out from a short cut, and I&#x27;m having to visit the strong possibility of having to get it cut short again!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I used this product without reading reviews prior to my horrific experience.  I used the product last night and have noticed considerable damage.  My ends are knotted and very coarse.  My hair cracked off in areas along the roots.  DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!  I notice no conditioning effect, just severe damage and it&#x27;s only been one day!</li>
            <li> I usually straighten my hair professionally but due to a lack of time before a trip decided to try it.  My hair is FRIED, RUINED and a total embarrassment. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t check it out first. I don&#x27;t know what  to do to fix it. They should be sued. Can anyone help?  What can we do to get it off the market?</li>
            <li> A lady I work with used this product, she had hair down to her waist. Within 7 minutes of the treatment being on her head, clumps of hair started falling out. She now had to cut her hair into a short bob, but even that did not get rid of all the broken pieces. This product is a joke. It shouldn&#x27;t even be allowed to be called a keratin treatment, because I have had a real keratin complex treatment in a salon (cost $250) but i still have my hair &amp; it looks wonderful!</li>
            <li> After reading all the bad reviews online I still decided to go ahead and do it. I figured if it ruined my hair I could shave it off. What the heck. Anyhow I cut about 20 hairs from differents parts of my head and did,the kit on those first. They passed with flying colors. I did step 1 it was the worst part because it smelled awful!. I stayed about 2 inches away from my scalp and left for 10 minutes instead of the usual 15 to 25. Rinsed and step 2 for 7 minutes. Rinse. And last step and blow dry on low heat. My hair was beyond soft! And so shiny. No breakage or bald spots. Now I have relatively healthy hair, not the best though. I straighten about 7 times a month. I last highlighted my hair in january 2011 and dyed it april 2011. Since then all of my highlighted hair has been cut off. So if you&#x27;re weary about using it just do a strands  test first and stay away from your scalp.</li>
            <li> I have always had thick coarse tightly coiled hair, unmanageable beyond belief. Its extremely difficult to attempt a home relaxing hair treatment because I would start to burn halfway through applying the product.&lt;br /&gt;This however is applied on damp hair which makes its application way easier than a relaxer, and on applying the cuticle smoothing (no 2) I was in love with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;However the end product is like a perm (relaxer)&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Easy to apply&lt;br /&gt;Great for black hair&lt;br /&gt;Straightens your hair somewhat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS : Not enough of the keratin treatment (no 1)product for my thick mane&lt;br /&gt;Probably not for caucasian hair (read the reviews)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will most likely be using this product again!!!</li>
            <li> I use almost no chemicals in my house. I go sulfate free, etc. My vanity got the best of me and I was tired of having frizzy curly hair. This product promised smoother hair with more defined. When I read the packaging I was okay to go as none of the \\&quot;do not use\\&quot; applied to me. I was a little hesitant after reading the instructions. I thought \\&quot;really, this seems like a nuclear reactor drill\\&quot;. But I soldiered on. I should have stopped after I opened it and smelled the product, that should have been a sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, after the hour and a half long process I finally blow dried my hair. It stripped all color out of my hair and I was left with dull, lifeless, damaged, fried hair. I WANT TO CRY!! I have been soooooo careful with my hair. I figured since it was sold on the shelf, it must&#x27;ve have lots of good results, etc. Nope, this product is absolutely awful and needs to be pulled off the shelves and apparently I&#x27;m not the only one either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to my stylist after the period of \\&quot;no washing\\&quot; she felt so bad for me but the only thing we could do was take off 3\\&quot; and she layered it up about 5\\&quot; in the back to get rid of the permanent damage.</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome home Suave Keratin kit. I had an Keratin treatement done at an Aveda salon in January and loved it. But the price, a bit steep for having to do multiple treatments each year to maintain it. The treatment at the Aveda salon cost about $300 with tip included, and it took about 3.5 hours out of my day. I also couldn&#x27;t wash or surf in the ocean for 3 days... and my hair had a waxy feel and a funny smell to it for a couple weeks. I have to wash my hair almost every day because I surf and it still had that feel. But this Suave Keratin Kit only cost me $15 at Rite Aid, I did it myself at home in about 2 hours, and there is no waxy feel, stinkyness, just silky smooth hair, and the wait to get in the water is only 2 days. Now keep in mind, do you research before you use it on your hair, I went to the Suave site and took the quiz to see if it is right for you hair [...] . Don&#x27;t screw up and just use it on your chemically treated hair, I imagine that&#x27;s why all these people are writing bad reviews. My hair has had no bleaching or perming done to it. THIS PRODUCT IS BEST FOR VIRGIN UNTRREATRED HAIR, and if you were to go to a salon with permed and bleached hair and ask for it, they probably would reccommend against it. But this home kit, it is AWESOMEEEEE!! And what a money saver! Thanks Suave!</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me- not too sure if it&#x27;s because my hair is super frizzy and I have long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that nothing can substitute getting a blowout from a salon. When I used this product, my hair was smoother yes, but not what one would expect from a Keratin treament. Yes it&#x27;s cheaper than going to the salon, but why sacrifice quality?</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair (with good results) for the past 20 years, so I was not afraid to try this product.  I have had one professional keratin treatment and one professional Brazilian blowout both with no issues.  I bought this based on the ad that stated that it had as good of results as a professional keratin treatment...sooooo not the case!  First of all, I read the instructions very carefully.  I followed the steps to the tee including, \\&quot;comb your hair away from your face so that you maintain volume at the crown\\&quot; which I did.  The results are scary and that is not an understatement.  My hair now has ZERO volume not only at the crown, but the front of my hair looks like I was wearing a beanie for a month.  I have a LOT of broken hairs and fried ends that I did not have before.  I am getting my hair cut tomorrow (not planned, but it may be the only way to save it and be able to style it) and I am praying to the hair gods that she can perform a miracle.  I am lucky that I can wear a hat to work because my hair won&#x27;t do anything!  If you want your hair straighted or smoothed out - go to a professional, it is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy, curly blonde hiar and wanted a sleeker look.  I am in my 40&#x27;s and have never colored, permed or chemically treated my hair in any way.  This was my first experience trying something so bold.  My hair tends to frizz easily as well.  I applied it based on the instructions and am thrilled with the outcome.  I don&#x27;t blow dry or even straighten my hair.  I just apply leave in conditoner and mousse and off I go.  It gave my hair soft texture with no frizz.  I still have a little wave to it but am sure if I did flat iron it, it would go pefectly straight.  For what it&#x27;s worth, I did apply the #1 bottle on a small portion of my hair to test it and it seemed fine.  The rest was a leap of faith and I am glad I did it.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I did not have as bad of an experience as many others on here have. However, I will never use this product again and will never recommend it to anyone. I have had salon KERATIN treatments in the past. They last about 3 months and cost about $200 bucks. So, I figured I&#x27;d try this since it only lasts 30 days and only cost $10. It&#x27;s a reverse perm. It smells exactly like a perm, and I&#x27;m sure if you curled your hair while doing the treatment, you&#x27;d have curly hair. The keratin treatments I&#x27;ve used in the past did not have two steps (like a perm). You put the product on, let it process, dry and straighten. You didn&#x27;t even rinse it out. This you put on, let it process, rinse, then put in the second product (which stops the \\&quot;perm\\&quot; process) and rinse. A REAL KERATIN treatment (of good quality, like the Copola keratin treatment, which is the one my stylist uses) doesn&#x27;t need to be done in a well ventalated area because you aren&#x27;t putting anything harmful on your hair and it smells really good. You CAN do a keratin treatment to damaged hair because the real keratin treatments correct damage to your hair. When you wash you hair after doing a keratin treatment, it feels exactly like you&#x27;ve done NOTHING to your hair. It feels healthy and normal. But when I washed my hair after using this stuff, my hair felt dry and it stuck together really bad. It felt damaged. Naturally, my hair is very thick, very wavy hair. I always have had to blow dry and straighten with my Chi ceramic straigthener. After a real keratin treatment, I could blow dry my hair with my fingers and end up with shiney straight hair that felt crazy healthy and smooth. After using the Suave product and blow drying my hair, using a brush, I still had to straighten it. Also, my hair was not shiney or smooth. On top of the leave in conditioner they prodvide in the kit, I also had to use an oil serum to smooth my hair out. It still looked very damaged, but after the oil, at least it didn&#x27;t feel as bad. Afterthis \\&quot;reverse perm\\&quot;, my hair is flat, mostly strait, very damaged, and frizzy. It feels very unhealthy. I haven&#x27;t had any clumps of hair come out, but I have had A LOT of breakage at the ends, so my hair feels very fine and thin in the back. I am going to check with my stylist to see if a real keratin treatment would be helpful in reversing the damage or if I&#x27;m just going to have to cut my hair off. Right now it&#x27;s about 10 inches past my shoulders, but the damage is very noticable up to my chin-length layers. That means if I have to just cut it off, I&#x27;ll be losing at least 10 inches of hair! I really wish I would have found the reviews on this product before I used it and I really hope they pull this off store shelves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve previously used other Suave products and had been content.  I have naturally thick, wavy/straight hair that is frizzy a lot of the time due to the fact that I live in Alabama, which is a very humid state. During the first process, I noticed that when I was using the comb, my hair was starting to frizz up and it was becoming elastic(like other people have mentioned in their reviews) and would even break as if it were a rubber band. When I was rinsing my hair, it seemed as if little bits of my hair and some longer strands kept breaking and falling out.  Once I finished the last step and was drying my hair, parts of my hair still felt elastic, and it took me about 25 minutes to dry my hair, because I was trying to lessen the amount of hair that was breaking off.  My hair looks EXACTLY THE SAME as before and still feels elastic in some areas. I&#x27;m not at all satisfied, and will be calling the 800 number before I go to work tomorrow.  My advice to anyone interested in this product: DO NOT buy this if you love your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because my hair need a little extra help. What I saw on the commercial and on the box, it seemed like a good fit. The first red flag, it&#x27;s quite difficult to tell, before purchasing this and opening it, that it&#x27;s a product that you need to wait for it to process. It appeared to be a system that would be used daily. I put this in my hair and my entire home smelled like a perm. The directions kept saying to comb hair while product was in it. There was NO way that I could. The damage and breakage was already starting while the product was in my hair. The one attempt I made to comb it, a whole bunch if hair came out. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to keep trying to comb it. I&#x27;m grateful i didn&#x27;t. Reading other reviews, I saw done people ended up with bald spots. I think I would have ended up withbald spots if I combed it the whole time. By the end of this \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; treatment, I couldn&#x27;t run my hands through it, let alone brush it and blow dry it, like the instructions say to do. It has been almost a week, and my hair is so broken, I can&#x27;t seem to get this product out and am sure I&#x27;m going to go see a professional hairdresser. I want this awful stuff out of my hair! I read some reviews where people said they loved this product. Honestly, I&#x27;m very happy for them, but I wouldn&#x27;t risk it to anyone that is considering it. I&#x27;m so upset that I read reviews AFTER doing this to my hair. But I&#x27;ve read enough reviews to know that I am not the only one this happened too, and like I said before, sounds like I&#x27;m luckier than most who used it. If you&#x27;re reading this, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE don&#x27;t use this product!!! I have to put at least half a bottle of argon oil in my hair everyday, just to feel mildly comfortable walking out the door. I put that much oil in and my hair is STILL thirsty. My blonde hair, that normally shows any oil I put in it and can look dirty if I put too many weighty products in it. I&#x27;ve also bought several deep conditioning treatments and load it with protective products and nothing helps!!! If your hair needs smoothing or anti frizz, spend the money on a credible treatment, or look up home remidies, like olive oil, if you can&#x27;t afford a professional. I&#x27;ve read so many pour reviews, haven&#x27;t read anything suave has done to help the people that their product messed up, this horrible line is still on shelves, and doubt they will be paying for the bills that people have incurred getting help from people who actually know what they are doing. Oh, and as another reviewer mentioned, you can&#x27;t give zero stars, that is the ONLY reason I would even consider giving this product a star.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a week since I used this product, Its taken that long to get out of the horrible shock of having to cut all my hair off. I didnt even leave this horrible stuff on my head for ONE MINUTE before I could tell the damage was done. My hair was like glue melting off my head. My hair was fine before I used this, I trusted that a product on the shelf was safe and mild. But after going to the salon to have it fixed, they said this product is NOT a keratin treatment but a relaxer they would only use on African American type hair!! Please don&#x27;t buy this, go to a salon and buy a good conditioning mask or one of their products. Now I will only buy products at a salon and ask them if it&#x27;s safe for my hair.</li>
            <li> the physical issues with everyones hair is one thing, immediately when i woke up the day after from using this product i have had DEBILITATING head pressure that i can not get rid of.  i am suffering now for 5 days and NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING will get rid of this.  I pray everyday for this pressure to go away.  I have 3 young kids to take care of and its almost impossible to do so with this pain.  I don&#x27;t even know who to turn to anymore, i have even tried meds, a massage, acupuncture, exercise, eating right, herbs, all with NO prevail.&lt;br /&gt;plz email me with questions.  3dand4d(at)gmail dot com</li>
            <li> As a hair stylist I have lots of experience working with a vast majority of chemicals. I have done Brazilian Blowouts, though they have formaldahide. I had a client bring this in and ask for an application. This stuff is NOT keratin treatment. It might have some in it, but it is not an active ingredient. The active ingredient seems to be something of a high pH like other relaxers. Suave Professionals is as potent as regular strength relaxer (NaOH- relaxer)  in my opinion (same safety precautions should be taken). I draw that conclusion after smelling sulfur eminate from the hair during this treatment. That is caused by disulfide bonds breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Problem 1- Consumers are not performing a PD test prior to the service. Test the smoothing cream on the skin behind your ear, or your forearm near your elbow. Leave cream on for 15 min, if no inflammation treatment is safe. If your skin is red or inflamed return the product and get your money back.&lt;br /&gt;Problem 2- Relaxers have to be applied methodically and cleanly with a tint brush about 1/2 an inch away from the scalp, leaving the ends out till the end. Applying close to the root can cause breakage. Never touch relaxer to your scalp. It will burn like he**, and hair will fall out.&lt;br /&gt;Problem 3-Hairstylists use basing gel to protect the scalp on sensitive clients, but not offered with the kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you don&#x27;t have a friend in the hair industry avoid this like the plague. Get this professionally done ($50-120 LA) with better products at your local salon. If you cant afford to have it done at your regular salon, go to a beauty school($5-35). They teach students to do this service safely and correctly. They have teachers to come and help, should you doubt the ability of a student. There is no excuse for permanently messing your hair up. Suave should not market this as a smoothing treatment either, I have used many kinds and this is not one!</li>
            <li> I have faithfully used SUAVE products for years...little did I suspect that the Karatin Infusion 30 day smoothing kit was going to cost me my entire head of hair. BEFORE YOU BUY OR TRY....FIRST READ \\&quot;ALL\\&quot; OF THE ONE STAR REVIEWS....THEY SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES. THIS PRODUCT WILL DESTROY YOUR HAIR!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words cannot describe my experience!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all. First off, just reading the box and instructions is enough to freak out the calmest of people. I mean I had no idea what I was going to happen and it took a lot of nerve just to try it out. And FAIL! The instructions and warnings were all correct. My hair type obviously was not meant for this stuff. My hair is not smoother, instead it is fried. It is like I tried to color my hair 20 times in a row, that&#x27;s how fried it feels. I hate it.</li>
            <li> This product really worked for me! I have kinda wavy, kinda straight, sorta curly mostly very dry hair and it is now straight with little to no frizz. My hair was basically virgin - no dyes, no highlights, no perms, nothing - ever so I was an ideal candidate for this product so it&#x27;s little to no wonder that it worked great! I have medium/long hair and its pretty thick. I followed the directions exactly to the tee and nothing went wrong or weird. It&#x27;s great! I&#x27;ve also noticed that almost 4 weeks have gone by and it is still looking great! I don&#x27;t wash my hair that often so that probably helps stretch out the results.  I highly recommend this for anyone who meets the requirements for this product!</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!! I am a hairdresser and this product contains the same ingredient  as perm solution. It will ruin your hair</li>
            <li> Please I beg of you do not try this inexpensive new wonder for hair!! I have always had sligtly frizzy wavy hair, very thick. After weeks of seeing this commercial on tv, and trying multiple other remedies and hair care lines, I thought to myself $10 is definately affordible to try this product. So I bought it and then after reading the directions was a little hesitant that I would mess it up. However after about a week of rereading the directions I finally got enough courage to go for it, how bad could it be, right?!?!?! WRONG! My hair is layered and now a waterfall and horribly burnt ends which cascade the whole length of my hair. It feels horrid like straw and looks even worse if possible. I tried to straighten it with my iron and felt I was doing even more damage so I stopped after just doing one section, which did NOT help at all. And when my hair was wet it was icky feeling and broke off so easily. I must have had enough hair in my trashcan by the end to make a wig. No joke. And to think I thought well maybe it gets rid of the loose hair to help make it smooth and straight only to keep having more and more and more fall out. My hair is generally healthy and I get a lot of compliments on it, now I&#x27;m getting recommendations to hair salons and short hair styles that will look good on me. Definately would never recomend this product ever and wishing I could rewind time and return it in that week I had doubts. Always trust your instincts. I wish I had.</li>
            <li> I considered not writing a review as there are plenty of bad reviews that will hopefully convince everyone to no do this to yourself. However, if we are to stop Suaves insanity and get this garbage off the market, we need all the help we can get. That being said I usually use their shampoos and conditioners as well. Suave has lost a customer from ALL their products and sister companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 30 days since I used the system. I actually liked my hair before, It was wavy but was hoping to get rid of some frizz. Now that my hair has had 30 days to grow, all my parts that were burnt off look like boar bristles sticking up from my head and my hair feels like hay. If I part my hair differently the bristles are covered but that doesn&#x27;t matter anyways because I cant wear my hair down anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Embrace your hair as is, wear your curls and waves proudly.</li>
            <li> I keep seeing either \\&quot;worst thing ever\\&quot; or \\&quot;best thing ever\\&quot; reviews. Here&#x27;s my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to agree with the reviewers saying that it&#x27;s misleading - this is a relaxer, with some extra conditioner. That&#x27;s all it is. It&#x27;s a safe bet to say that anything with the words \\&quot;Smoothing\\&quot; in it or promising long-term results is going to be hardcore. Also, there&#x27;s a warning on the side about using it if you&#x27;re sensitive to the main ingredient or other relaxer-type treatments or even perms. Anything where your hair is getting semi-dissolved, re-shaped, and cooked back into a new pattern is gonna be HARD ON YOUR HAIR. Sometimes too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That warning probably needs to be in big red letters. Also, I suspect that a lot of the bad experiences come from people finding out in the most painful way possible that they ARE sensitive or even allergic to the main ingredient. I don&#x27;t know if a patch test can be done for something like this, but it seems like something that should be mentioned in the instructions. You shouldn&#x27;t have to find out you&#x27;re allergic to something by having a massive reaction to it. (Although that is how most of us find our we&#x27;re allergic to things like, say, antibiotics or bees.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I know is it smelled like deep fried farts and seems to have calmed the frizz a little. Not a miracle, but not a disaster either.</li>
            <li> This product doesn&#x27;t even deserve 1 star.  My hair is fried I had to go get it cut off.  :( The hairdresser has been cutting hair for 30 years and cannot believe the damage that this product has caused. DON&#x27;T TRY THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> As with most of you  this product damaged my hair.  However, I am lucky in that the damage is minimal compared to what most of you went through.  The difference I think is after I was done with the treatment my head felt tingly.  I googled to see if that was normal, saw all these reviews, and washed my hair right away.  Luckily, I only had to have just over an inch cut off.  However, after two weeks I am just trying my hair down as it has been pulled up since the day before Easter.  I called a friend of mine who is a hair stylest a few days after the awful day and she told me to buy a very specific product to help restore the damage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OJON DAMAGE REVERSE SHAMPOO &amp; CONDITIONER worked WONDERS to repair the damage.  My hair is not 100% but much much better.  It was pretty expensive but really did help!  I hope it works for you as it did for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave should be forced to take this product off of the market!</li>
            <li> I bet they wouldn&#x27;t even test this on their own families!  I used this product over 4 weeks ago and i still dread looking at my hair. I already had smooth hair, BUT it wasn&#x27;t as shiny as the suave commercial... so I thought, it&#x27;s only $10, I&#x27;ll give it a try....NEVER AGAIN SUAVE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I have crazy kinks everywhere, breakage and my beautiful long blond hair is dull and frizzy (understatement). The texture is 100% different than before. and i am very frustrated and devastated. Pretty much everything it said it would address, instead it caused for my hair. Why on earth would I want to perm my hair, perms don&#x27;t make your hair better as were the claims advertised by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m here today to see how to fix this nightmare. Help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For women, beautiful hair is very important.... SUAVE, you have taken that away from me, so I will take away any future sales I can from you. \\&quot;Guaranteed\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Did you use this product and have a bad result? My company represents a local salon in Camden County and we want to help!</li>
            <li> Ive had the smoothing keratin treatment done professionally twice and thought I&#x27;d give the suave kit a try. HUGE mistake. My hair is so damaged, frizzy and breaking off after using the Suave Kit. I am so upset. I used to have beautiful hair, now I have brillo pad hair! Do not use this product! I do not even want to give this product 1 star!</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]]I bought this product last week and waited, thank god. I did my nieces hair last week (who has virgin hair) and it came out okay ( maybe because she has NEVER done anything but wash her hair). I decided to wait until this weekend to do mine since it says you cannot wash for 48 hours. I started to do it last night and something told me to just wait till today. I woke up this morning and grabbed the box and was about to start the process then my phone rang disrupting me from my previous goal of starting this process. Once off the phone I started reading the warning label again. I was a bit nervous since I have had highlights, color and perms years ago. I tried calling the number to ask their specialist but only to find out they are closed on weekends. So that&#x27;s when I decided to go online and look at the reviews. Omg!!!! Thank you to everyone that has posted their own personal experience with this product. You have all saved me the heartache that I was just about to make less then an hour ago. My heart goes out to all the women out there whose hair was destroyed by this product. To all the other women who state they love the product, I guess your some of the lucky ones. I for one will not be taking any chances with my hair and will continue to spend the outrageous amount of money it cost to have a REAL keratin treatment done by a professional salon. Again, I&#x27;m a so sorry to all the women who now have severly damaged hair and thank you infinity for posting your stories so someone like me wouldn&#x27;t have the same results. I will let everyone I know about your story so that it might save others from making this same horrible mistake.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair and I straighten it as I blow dry each day, otherwise my hair is frizzy. I thought this would be perfect....NOT. It has caused my hair to break off, come out in places and just look bad. It also takes FOREVER to dry. My hair has never looked so bad. I am disgusted with this product and with suave. The smoothness is supposed to last for 30 days...I dread seeing my hair if it is supposed to be smooth now. It is layered and all layers are frizzy on the ends, it&#x27;s limp and has absolutely no body. It will not do anything except lay there. I look like I have jammed a fork in a light socket. That idea may even be better, at least I may not know what this hair looks like.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! HAIR DISASTER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had gone online and read the reviews as well before doing this.  But I figured if they sold it at the store with the hair dyes, how bad could it be? The warnings again were a little scary, but I know from experience they kind of have to cover their butts by stating EVERY LITTLE PROBLEM that could go wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God I didn&#x27;t have the extent of problems these ladies did.  Because my hair is colored, and just mild wavy, I left it on for the shortest time specified - 15 minutes.  I was worried during the process as every time I would comb through my hair, my \\&quot;bangs\\&quot; would kink up really bad, and I&#x27;d have to straighten them back out with my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I probably rinsed for more than 5 minutes after the Step 1 process.  So maybe that helped as well.  I did lose quite a bit of hair during it all, but I do when I dye my hair at home, and even when I put conditioner in my hair if I&#x27;ve skipped washing it a day or two.  So I tried to not worry about that.  As I was blow drying it, my hair was breaking off bad, and it tried pretty frizzy.  Anytime I dried or flat ironed it, it never had the same straight, glossy shine as before, and it felt brittle and dry, like straw.  The only time it felt good was in the shower after washing it, it felt sleek and smooth, which is why I was so confused once it dried.  Also, air-drying was also frizzy.  The other day I took a really good look at my hair and several inches were just completely fried.  Kinked up, frizzy, fried.  And here I had been trying to grow my hair out long.  I ended up going to the salon this weekend and cutting off SEVERAL inches of hair, and now my hair is back up above my shoulders with lots of layers, and there is still fried frizz.  My bangs were cut, but there is still some kink left at what is now the ends.  Also, I didn&#x27;t tell my hairdresser what I had done, but I could tell by the look on her face my hair was in BAD shape.  She kept asking if Iblow dry my hair all the time, and use a flat iron on it all the time.  Which I don&#x27;t, and every time I said that she looked confused.  I should&#x27;ve come clean about the treatment, but I guess I worry about what those salon girls will say when you tell them you did an at-home treatment and it bit you in the butt.  :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;STAY FAR FAR AWAY! I had several friends who wanted to try this out, and I told them DON&#x27;T TOUCH!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly and kinda frizzy hair.  I thought it would be fun to have smooth hair like in the commercials, for a change.  So...for the price I figured I&#x27;d try this out.  The smell is terrible.  Ok, deal with it.  It did straighten my hair and it was actually kind of nice and smooth for two days.  Then...it went back to being frizzy, but no more curls.  Just straight and frizzy.  I tried using a curling iron and hair spray to style it, but the style fell out within 20 minutes.  I am stuck with straight and frizzy until my hair recovers or grows out or something.  Ponytails every day, yay! (not)  I am so grateful I didn&#x27;t have the nightmare trouble many have had, but I&#x27;d avoid the risk and just not buy this.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!! I bought it in January and was so excited to use it. I have straight hair, but it was a little frizzy. I was so excited to have silky smooth hair. I went home, read the instructions, and began. As soon as I put it on my hair, my hair started breaking and coming out. I only left it on 1 minute, max before I washed it out. When I started washing it, my scalp starting burning. I felt like I was on fire. When I got it rinsed out I saw how bad it really was. The next day I had to go to the salon and have 8 1/2 inches cut off my hair. Now, 4 months later I still cannot have anything done to my hair. No salon will dye it because it is so damaged. The salon I go to said that another girl came in after using this product and had to have 13 inches cut off her hair. The stylist said that this product should not even be on the market. After this happened, I contacted Suave. They told me that no one else had complained....HAHAHAHAHA...liars!! They sent me a check for $12 to refund my purchase and then sent me coupons for $30 worth of free Nexus stuff. That $30 only covered one bottle of shampoo. Ridiculous!! I told them they should have to pay for my hair cut and GOOD product to repair my hair, but they disagreed. Please listen to all of these reviews and do not buy this product. It should be pulled off shelves immediately!!!</li>
            <li> I love it! I&#x27;m sorry for those who&#x27;ve had bad experiences, but this is an amazing product for me. In fact, it&#x27;s the answer to all my hair problems. I have thick wavy medium-to-coarse brown hair. This product allows me to have smooth straight hair or loose wavy curls if I let it dry natural. I&#x27;ve waited 30 years for something like this! And under $15? Insane. I LOVE IT! THANKS SUAVE!!</li>
            <li> I did not read these reviews before I applied this method. My hair is virgin. African American hair. My hair is dry but not brittle or damaged(I get trims regularly) I was worried that my hair would fall out because about 2years ago I had my hair treated to soften my curls and so much fell out. This time nothing bad happened. My hair is smoother and very fluffy. The results were VERY good and I sat with it on for about 5minutes past the time I was supposed to. I was pretty surprised. It worked safely for me. I would suggest this to people with VIRGIN hair. My hair feels great</li>
            <li> This product should not be on the market.  Normal people are not qualified to use it.  After researching keratin treatments more online I realized what a dummy I was for doing it in the first place.  I too read the product as \\&quot;it will smooth out and make your cuticle lay flat\\&quot; not what it really does \\&quot;straighten even the tightest curl to board straight and fry the ends\\&quot;.  And when I say ends I mean a good four inches.  If you have any type of curly hair I really recommend you stay away from this product.  You probably have naturally dry hair to begin with, this will damage it and make it worse.  You probably are not used to seeing your hair straight or even having little tolerance for what I would call 80&#x27;s punk rocker straight hair (aka fried hair that sticks up straight...think krimped with a dose of unrecoverable dryness added in...no conditioner will save you).  And finally your cut is probably all wrong for straight hair (layered)...ya doesn&#x27;t work, getting it cut afterwards is a must.  I would not say my hair anytime after the treatment was softer, smoother looking, or less frizzy (actually the opposite).  And nothing is helping it...I have some of the best deep conditioners on the market and nothing is working.  The cuticle is locked close so nothing can get in.  Now I&#x27;m patiently waiting for it to lose hold of my hair and wondering if my curls will ever come back.  I&#x27;m washing it with sulfates and sodium chloride every day and not much is happening yet.  This is definately not a product that can be reversed easily.  I can&#x27;t believe I ruined my perfectly good hair with something like this.  If you still feel the need to get a keratin treatment get it done professionally.  On the flip side the Suave Keratin Conditioner for colored hair is spectacular (which is why I got suckered into doing this in the first place).  I used it about four days stright prior to doing the treatment and could see a significant difference in the texture of my hair...long story short, conditioner good-30 day treatment bad, very bad.  UPDATE:  Went to salon this weekend to salvage what I had left of my hair, cut off 2 1/2 inches, the second I sat down and told my stylist what I had done she said that what I had in my hair was without a doubt perm solution.  She could still smell it after washing my hair 6 times over the course of the week attempted to reverse what I had done.  She gave me a layered undercut which brought back some resemblance of my hair.  Now I&#x27;m having to blow dry my hair straight and then curl it until it grows out.  This is not a keratin treatment, this is a chemical relaxer or straightening perm.  Suave should be ashamed of themselves.</li>
            <li> I just did the treatment 3 days ago.  You must know that I have super naturally curly hair.  I mean tight ringlets that dry in knots!  Well not any more!!  I still have some waves, but when I blow dry and flat iron my hair is so soft, shiny, and sleek! Thank you Sauve for making this product afordable! I did have some dry ends, but I have not had my hair cut in months.  I just got back from getting my hair cut where my stylist said my hair felt incredible and was so shiny.  I am not sure where all the reviewers who left bad reviews went wrong! But this stuff is amazing and so afordable.  My sister spends hundreds to have hers done professionally, and personally I think mine looks Better!! :)  Thanks again Sauve YOU ROCK!!!</li>
            <li> I have thick, course, curly, color treated hair.  The curl is uneven, and I easily spend an hour with the round brush to get it straight.  I have been considering a chemical straightener for some time, even considered buying perm solution and straightening it that way.  But I read a review in Allure Magazine for the Suave Keratin 30 day kit.  I thought it sounded right for me.  Just something to take the curl out, I was not even expecting results like the box picture.  I followed the instructions (except for the petroleum jelly), for my color treated hair. Once I was done with the whole process, I blow dried my hair with a paddle brush and it has very little wave and NO frizz (it looks like the pictures on the Amazon product posting).  My hair did lighten in color - it lifted some of the red brown out of my hair.  If I had used the hot iron, it probably would have been straighter and smoother.  I am completely satisfied with the product. I would recommend it only those who have tried chemical processes on their hair and have experience with their hair. Some women are strictly salon women and only rely on a professional to handle their hair.  I have experience with my hair and I know what and how much chemical abuse it can take.  If you are afraid of treating your hair, you probably should consult a professional before trying this product out.  My sister is a professional cosmetologist, and she has worked with my hair for years before I moved across the country.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews almost made me not try this product, but I&#x27;m glad I did!  My hair is naturally wavy and when I air or blow dry, it gets extremely frizzy no matter what products I try.  The only way to straighten my hair normally is blow it dry and then flat iron it - which takes a considerable amount of time, so I don&#x27;t do it that often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I blow dried my hair after following the directions, my hair was almost as straight as when I flat iron!  I was really impressed.  Then when I flat ironed it, it was pin straight in no time.  I&#x27;m about two weeks into the product and am still finding a dramatically shortened blow dry/flat iron time - I would love it my hair could air dry pin straight, but I don&#x27;t think there is a product in this world that could make that happen :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because I am finding that my hair seems to look greasy after just one day after washing. I can normally get away with shampooing my hair every other day, but I really can&#x27;t do that now without looking terrible.  It&#x27;s not a big deal, but it&#x27;s something I noticed.  It might also be due less to the product itself and more because of the sulfate free shampoo I am using, but I did use the shampoo before I tried the straightening treatment and didn&#x27;t notice any difference.</li>
            <li> Have to admit, was worried about using this product due to the reviews on here, but since my hair is very healthy I decided to take a chance...it&#x27;s just hair right?  Well I just finished the process and I have to say I got a pretty good result. My hair looks like it does after I flat iron normally. No balding, no rubbery ends, just a good result...hopefully it will stay like this for the next few weeks :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Suave!</li>
            <li> After receiving this product and reading the warnings, I was hesitant to try it. I waited, hoping that other people would have good experiences with it. Unfortunately, the reviews that started to come out were scary, so I waited and debated whether or not to risk it. I finally decided to give this product a shot. My hair is not permed, color treated, or red, so I was hoping to have a good outcome. I&#x27;m very glad that I did not have my hair fall out like other reviewers experienced, but I still did not have a positive result. After using this product, I found my hair to be very dry and straw-like, not smooth. It was fairly brittle for the first few days, but I didn&#x27;t end up with too much breakage. I definitely won&#x27;t use this again.</li>
            <li> Hi! For those of you that used this product and had horrible experiences, I noticed that Suave&#x27;s Customer Service commented on your post and asked you to contact them so they can find a solution to help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did any of you call Suave&#x27;s Customer Service Department?  If so, what did they do to help find a solution?  I&#x27;m curious as to how they were able to help.  After all of the negative reviews, I refuse to purchase this product. I have used a similar product that Walgreens sells that did work in the past.  I am trying to grow my hair longer and the last thing I need is a product that causes me to lose my hair or causes my hair to fall out in pieces or chunks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to thank everyone who posted their experience with this product since this is helpful when determining if to buy this product or not.  If you purchased this product, it is probably because you&#x27;re like me and want a great product that helps tame frizzy or unruly hair and do what the product advertises. Thank you for sharing your experiences.  This is one product I will not purchase.</li>
            <li> Read the rest of the reviews. The marketing on this product is SO sneaky. I read the instructions and everything on the box...except the ingredients. I just skimmed them to see if it contained keratin. That was a mistake. This is a chemical relaxer. Ammonium thioglycolate ... nasty stuff. I now have my first migraine and I&#x27;m worried about the effects it may have on my unborn child. If I figure out how to get rid of this smell without risking ruining my hair (more) I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> I was about to purchase this item from the store today but didn&#x27;t have a chance to go so I decided to read some reviews about the product.  I&#x27;d like to say \\&quot;thankyou\\&quot; to all of you that wrote reviews on this product as I decided not to buy it.  I feel really bad for all of you that used it and had a horrific experience but it was because of your reviews that I decided not to use this product.</li>
            <li> Thank You to all the reviewer&#x27;s who posted what a HORRIBLE product this is.  I purchased mine from Target and I will be returning it unopened for a refund.  This product sounds like a hair nightmare.  I feel so sorry for the women who had hair loss and damage from this product.  Thanks for your reviews I am sure you have saved alot of women from the same pain you have endured.</li>
            <li> I wish that I had read the reviews before I used this. I was looking for \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; not straightening. This kit remindes me of the straightening kits sold next to the perm kits, which is pretty much a perm kit with a comb. Plus it is the same smell! Thankfully, I didn&#x27;t put any of this directly on my scalp. I liked my curls, I just wanted them to be smoother and not so frizzy. Sadly, I thought this would do the trick. My hair routine was easy before...wash, mousse, and either let air dry or scrunch with blow dryer. Now it either goes in a ponytail (which I have to be careful of cause of the breakage), braided, or I have to spend 30-45 minutes with the straightening iron. My hair looks dry &amp; damaged and I have parts and pieces broken throughout. This even after the questionare on their website that I took, which said that it would work for my hair type and even gave me a coupon! This is NOT what I have come to expect from Suave!! I&#x27;m hoping that this will wear off soon as I have been growing my hair for 7 years (it grows sloooow) and it is actually managable. Busy days, I can pony it and on evenings out, the curls were cute.</li>
            <li> I have thick coarse, slightly wavy hair. Length is below necklie. This product worked great. I used my own big comb. I did lose a comb full of hair but i am one of those people that complain about having too much hair. About two months ago I used another home straightening product and I color my own hair every few months. I found this product at closeout price of 7.99&lt;br /&gt;And I had coupon for $2 off that was doubled. It was such a great deal that I bought about 10 kits. So glad my gamble worked out. All that said, be careful if you have THIN hair, damaged hair and adverse to strong chemical smell.</li>
            <li> I had curly frizzy healthy hair before using this product. I had never dyed or used any sort of chemical treatment. I decided to try this product because I had heard positive things about keratin. Now my hair is completely destroyed. I have horrible split ends a problem i never had in my life until after using this product, my hair is now brittle and looks horrible. Yes the product might work for the first few days but its not worth the headache that comes after. This has caused irreparable damage to my hair. I am mortified I would not recommend this product for anyone!</li>
            <li> What a traumatic and terrible experience.  I got a coupon from the Sunday press for $2 the Suave Keratin Treatment and so I thought I would give it a chance.  The product is marketed and appears to be a &#x27;Smoothing&#x27; treatment... something that would smooth and strenthen your hair, not completely suck the moisture out and cause your hair to literally MELT off of your head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did glance over the directions and thought it a bit odd becuse of the gloves and warnings, but since I had never bleached or double processed my hair I figured it would be fine.  I honestly thought that this was like a deep conditioning treatment, I didn&#x27;t realize that it was a chemical straightener!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within seconds after putting the product into my hair, I noticed my hair shriveling up and becoming &#x27;gummy&#x27; so I rinsed it out right away.  I put the second treatment on, hoping that it would make my hair go back to at least normal, but it didn&#x27;t.  As I towel dried my hair I realized that it was coming out by the handfuls  Every new glob of gummy hair made me feel like I was going to get sick.  It was horrifying.  I was up all night crying, I finally got the courage to run to Meijer at around 5AM, with my hood pulled up over my hair the entire time.... and got some &#x27;Hair Mayo&#x27; in hopes that it would correct the issue, but it didn&#x27;t.  I left it in for hours and couldn&#x27;t sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing out the Mayo, I sat in my shower and cried and prayed that the nightmare would go away.  I finally fell asleep.  I&#x27;m a college student and I had a huge paper worth 20% of my grade due today and was hoping to work on that last night instead of crying and praying and wanting to die!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I woke up, my hair still felt like spaghetti.  The strands were completely ruined and thin and breaking off at the root.  I tried to blow dry it but it wouldn&#x27;t dry, it just felt like cotton candy!  I scoured the internet for answers and discovered that this product has ruined the hair of many others as well!  It makes me infuriated that it&#x27;s even on the shelves!  I went to the salon and the hairdresser was horrified.  She tried treatment after treatment and nothing helped.  The look on her face told me it was bad.  I told her I had been trying to grow out my hair and my layers and she just kept apologizing for what had happened!  2 hours and $60 worth of treatments, she ended up chopping about 3 inches of hair off the ends of all of my layers, and now it basically looks like I have a mullet.  The layers are choppy and terrible looking because she was afraid that if she thinned or texturized it, it would just cause the ends to keep shriveling and look even shorter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is going to take years to repair what only minutes of having this product on my hair did.  I will never buy another Suave product again.  Hopefully in a few months I will be able to layer my hair in a way that looks presentable, for now I will just have to keep wearing it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never really had an issue with frizzy hair until after the treatment.  After reading the other reviews, it seems pretty pointless even to try to contact Suave, they seem pretty incompetent.  Obviously to put something like this on the market, they have to be.  Stores need to take this product off of their shelves!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In you value your hair, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!  It has ruined my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/3/2012:  It has been about 2 weeks, I went to Sally&#x27;s and bought about $70 worth of super strengthening and moisturizing treatments and nothing really works.  I bought some &#x27;Hair Cholesterol, Aphogee 2 minute strengthener, Olive Oil Leave-in treatment, some other $12 leave in treatments, some special Bio-something or other super conditioner... my gosh, basically my entire paycheck went to the unfriendly chick at Sally&#x27;s.  The lady at the Salon said that it had &#x27;broken the bonds&#x27; in my hair - whatever that means.  The top layer of my hair is about 2 inches long of just whacked offhair... the rest of it is past my shoulders.  I have been just wearing it up for now but I don&#x27;t know what to do with it.  I&#x27;m thinking I might wait like 4 months and then see if they can layer it like a gypsy-style cut or something.  I can&#x27;t say goodbye to my long locks just yet.  :(  The mere thought makes me want to cry.  I&#x27;m just hoping and praying that in a few months my hair will go back to normal??  There is still about an inch of fried hair at the ends of the top layer of my hair but the stylist didn&#x27;t want to chop that off just yet because it would be ridiculously short and mullet-like.  (Though it already is.)  Thank goodness the guy I&#x27;m seeing was a sweetheart about it, I would have probably broken up with me.  Good grief, I have a MULLET!  He&#x27;s a better person than I am.  I will keep you all updated on what happens.  I just hope that ladies are reading these reviews BEFORE putting this POISON in their hair... unlike what I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way - I am in college.  I can barely afford my rent (hence the reason I bought this crummy Suave Keratin Treatment in the first place - thinking it would be a wise alternative to some deep conditioning treatment at a salon.  HA.  So the hundreds of dollars that I have spent on hair treatments and hair pieces to try to hide the damage.. thanks Unilever.  Awesome.  I just hope that my landlord will be understanding when my rent is a little bit late.  So thanks to YOU, SUAVE, UNILEVER... I may be a HOMELESS MULLET!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel gummy and the horible smell of step one. I had to keep washing my hair and conditioning it but it looks fried. Flat ironing helps along with argon oil. I have a shampoo with argon oil I am going to use. I have to be careful not to break my hair it is so fragile now. I only left it in 10 minutes if that and I just kept washing and conditioning it. It feels a little better. I will need to cut off the ends, my hair is short I cut it monthly so I am looking forward to my next hair cut. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have very long, fine, wavy hair.  Lots of cowlicks and frizz.  I saw the commercial for this product and purchased it on an impulse while waiting for a prescription at wallgreens.  I had thought that it was three different leave in conditioning items, NOT a chemical nightmare.  I should have known by the smell and all the warnings, but I had a free afternoon and figured I&#x27;d give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have as bad of results as some of the reviewers, but I definitely won&#x27;t use it again or recommend it to anyone.  It&#x27;s not worth it.  Half of my hair is smooth(ish) and shiny(ish).  The other half is dry, brittle, and dead.  With long hair, that&#x27;s always a concern, but after months of staying away from curling/flat irons, and only blow drying every 3 days I had FINALLY beaten split ends.  Well, this product undid all of that, and probably made it even more damaged than it was when I was heat styling daily.  I&#x27;m probably going to have to cut off 3-4 inches.  Also my hair is noticeably thinner.  Now, that&#x27;s nothing compared to what many of you experienced, so much so that I feel bad even complaining about it, but Suave, this is UNACCEPTABLE!  I can tell by the look of my hair that in a week or two it will be completely unmanageable.  I want my money back.  Actually, I want the purchased price AND the $50 I now have to spend on a hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE THIS!</li>
            <li> this product fried my hair and what it didn&#x27;t fry it made it rubber feeling. i wish i wouldnt have  used this product.... never again</li>
            <li> I did not use this product but want to warn everyone of the dangers of a real keratin treatment.  I have been getting them done for 3 years with perfect results.  I went to a new salon and they used Coppola.  Then the nightmare began.  My hair fell out in clumps and 3 months later continues to fall out in abnormal amounts.  My hair is half of what is used to be.  The idiot stylist flatirioned my hair at 450 degrees with highlights!  OMG.  She burned off a big piece of my hair while she was flatironing it.  I was and still am devastated over this.  My hair was thick, long and beautiful.  Now, it is half the thickness, scalp showing in the front and fried.  I have breakage up to my roots.  I am literally sick about this.  It is 3 months and while the product has worn off, the damage is done.  I still dont know where all my hair went.  It amazes me how something that cost $300 can ruin your hair in a minute.  So, just be careful if you think that a \\&quot;real\\&quot; keratin treatment will fix the damamge.  The crap contains formaldyed (or however you spell it).  It may give you good results, but in the long run, it will damage your hair and your health.  I pray each and everyday that I recover from this mess.  Seeing your long, once beautiful hair fall out in the shower is heartbreaking.  I wont dye it or flatiron it for a year.  I have tried hairloss shampoos, oils, conditioners.  Nothing will fix this mess.  I feel for any of you who are suffering.  All we wanted to do was to look nice.  And now, we will have to suffer until it grows out.  Good luck to all of you.  I am right there with you.</li>
            <li> I have been doing keratin treatments for 3 years and wanted a change so decided to use the Suave.  I am soooo not a professional but, decided I could  figure this out - the directions were simple enough.  Anyway, I haven&#x27;t had a keratin treatment in 6 months so my hair was pretty curly. After I applied the suave - the finish result looked exactly like the professional keratin (with formaldehyde) treatments. Its been 2 weeks and I have had NO breakage of my hair and NO bald spots! I assume the bad reviewers left the treatment on longer than they should have.&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy that I found Suave and no longer have to spend $250 at the salon. I highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Suffice it to say, at different phases during my life. I have dyed, cut, curled, braided, weaved, and extended my hair in many dubious and regretful ways.  I don&#x27;t know how many, \\&quot;what was I thinking moments\\&quot; I&#x27;ve had in the past three decades. However, using this product on my natural 4B Kinky Curly (Natural) hair was the worst hair mistake I have ever made. After growing out a fresh crop of virgin hair for approximately 4 months. I was itching to use a product that would straighten my hair  (without damaging it) and that would allow my hair to return to its natural state after 30 to 90 days.  Well...&lt;br /&gt;1) I tried this product and my hair fell out. At first it was a couple strands when I brushed my hair. However, now I have a patch ridden scalp. That resembles something like a dog with mange.&lt;br /&gt;2) My hair began to fall out in fistfuls, losing an average of 200-300 strands everytime I touched my hair. Scary, right?&lt;br /&gt;3) My scalp is dry and inflamed  and endlessly itchy (Surprise, surprise)&lt;br /&gt;4) What few  strands I have left are dry, brittle, and straight and stiff as a board. (Attractive, eh?)&lt;br /&gt;5. I am now considering shaving this mess off, but I&#x27;m afraid that it may have done permanent damage to my scalp. I am back to wearing weaves, wigs, and protective styles to cover up the mess I used to call my crowning glory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONLY AN IDIOT WOULD BY THIS PRODUCT AFTER THESE DIRE WARNINGS. SERIOUSLY PEOPLE IF I WERE A VAIN PERSON  I WOULD BE DEVASTATED. BUT (HOPEFULLY) HAIR GROWS BACK.... AND I MIGHT LEARN TO READ AMAZON REVIEWS BEFORE BUYING BOOTLEG PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time and have never had any problems with over the counter hair treatments, hair dyes etc. and this product ruined my hair. I had to cut two inches from my hair because it burned the ends off. I will never purchase again.</li>
            <li> this product should be taken away from the shelves!!!! this is absurd!!! this is not keratin!!!! its a relaxer,,, the smell is just the same... my hair is fried, dry and ruined.. im spending a fortune to try and have it fixed.. which is not easy due to the damage created... i dont think there is a quick fix for this mess.. im doing deep conditioning treatments, went to a high end salon to see what could be done, and there is just nothin more than treating,, it will take time,, i cant go out anymore... my hair is just awful.. if you r reading this, please do not use this product,, it will ruin your hair.. they need to take this off market.. its false advertisement.</li>
            <li> awful.  do not purchase.  my hair fell out and what is left is the consistence of ramen noodles.  I will have to cut my hair off.  I wish I had read the reviews first to hear of the poor souls this also happened to.  please do not purchase.</li>
            <li> First of all, I feel badly for the people who had a bad experience with this product. I used it before I read the reviews and I would not have used it had I read the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I am glad I did use it because my hair looks fantastic. It is smooth and gorgeous. When I wash it, it dries very quickly and with great style!! Before if I would try to straighten my hair it would take about an hour and then halfway through the day it would be all kinky and I would have to put it up. Now, it takes less than 10 minutes to dry and style and it lasts DAYS! I couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled. I just wish it had more consistent results for every one because not I&#x27;m nervous to try it again in three months.</li>
            <li> Initially i had given this product a glowing review, but after a week i changed my mind. My hair is now super straight but completely dried out. I wanted to eliminate frizz but my usually oily hair is now dry and more frizzy than ever before, even after using deep conditioning treatments. I&#x27;m actually considering cutting off my hair, it&#x27;s that damaged.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d gotten keratin and brazilian blowout treatments before and they left my hair vibrant, shiny, and frizz-free during the humid summer months; so i wrongly jumped at the chance of not having to pay so much for a keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone commented on my previous review that this product was a relaxer; after a week of seeing what has hapenned to my hair, i agree. That&#x27;s exactly what my hair looks like, like relaxed hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a keratin treatment, it&#x27;s a relaxer! Keratin treatments leave your hair softer and more nourished, but this does the complete opposite. This may be exactly what some people are looking for, but it should be advertised as a straightening treatment, not a keratin treatment.</li>
            <li> My daughter, age 18, used this product and had to have 7 inches of damage cut off her hair. It is now very short, right before prom and graduation. She only left on the first step for 13 minutes instead of the recommended 20-25. Thank God! If she had, she would have had bald spots on top. Her damage was from the chin down. She cries everyday. This is garbage and should be taken off shelves immediately before another person goes through this trauma.</li>
            <li> To anyone who is saying this product ruined their hair either didnt do it right or had really horrible hair and should NOT have tried to use it. I have thick hair and it will frizz especially on humid Texas days. I have had professional Keratin treatment and thought it was great but this products did just as good for far LESS money. I am not against spending money for my hair to look good but when you can do it yourself and get the same results it is worth it.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have naturally frizzy hair with a slight wave. I have been coloring it for years with Clairol Natural Instincts. I tried this product 5 days ago, and thus far am delighted with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend far less time styling my hair, as I no longer have to fight the frizz. My hair is straight, smooth, and shiny. I have used only my regular salon shampoo and rinse, which aren&#x27;t sulfite free.My hair will hold a curl if I so desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry to hear that others have had detrimental results, but I can only say I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a keratin treatment. This is simply a thick perm solution that is combed through hair. If you really want to use this product, please do a strand test! You&#x27;ll feel much better only losing a small piece of hair, as opposed to your whole head. Use an everyday keratin treatment like Ion Repair Solutions. Your hair will receive less damage with blow-drying and flat irons. It is $12 for a reason. My hair is healthy, wavy, color treated, but NOT bleached; and had been colored 4 weeks when I did the strand test. I left step 1 on for only 6 minutes and the hair was obliterated. It was spongy, springy, and literally dissolved between my fingers. This product should really be pulled from the shelves.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT EVEN DESERVE A STAR~~~~ [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVERYONE! i started a PAGE. i plan to get a class action lawsuit started to take care of the victims of this product please head on over, like my page! i know almost everyone has a FB!!! i will be starting a petition soon against this product for false advertisment, as this is NOT a keratine product,, it only contains 10% keratine, this is a CHEMICAL straightner!!! which is not advertised on their commercials!!!! THEIR IS AN INVESTIGATION ALREADY ALERTED TO THE FDA, THIS PRODUCT IS NOW UNDER REVIEW! I HAVE A LAWYER TO HELP ME IN THIS CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT, I WAS NOT A VICTIM, BUT MY TWIN SISTER WAS .... she spends her time, being beautiful and as i speak this commercial is playing AGAIN on the television,! this product tests on animals, IF it is burning and killing animal fur, WHY OH WHY market this to human race? beautiful lady&#x27;s ???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Ladies, I have read the terrible results you have been having and I absolutely feel for you. Your reviews have tipped me to not purchasing this particular product for my thick, long, natural curly hair. With that being said, you probably purchased the product on the grounds that it would give you what it says and shows in the commercial. A person with straight, shiny, healthy hair. First those results are fake and two as grown women you are saying you didn&#x27;t know this product was not a chemical RELAXER? You were attempting to get the same results as the commercial. After reading the instructions alone it should have thrown up huge red flags but as a consumer do you not read the ingredients in what you eat or put on your body? You could have looked at the ingredients listed on the box and you could have seen all the chemicals involved. Suave pretty much states that unless you have virgin hair don&#x27;t use this product. Personally, I think that its a powerful product with a trusted name. Being made by Suave makes it seem more \\&quot;safe\\&quot; rather than it having a salon brand name. However I assure you there are many relaxers and straighteners on the consumer shelves that are exactly the same if not worse. I am Caucasian and thought it would be a good idea to straighten/relax my hair with a product made for African-American hair....hello my hair fell out and I had sores on my scalp. I didn&#x27;t blame the company. It was me. I understand this product is supposed to be ethnically equal however any type of relaxer, straightener, smoother, whatever IS A CHEMICAL PRODUCT. One of the reviews said her salon smelled perm solution on her hair the next day. Do you know why when you get a perm you can&#x27;t wash your hair for 24-48 hours after? You will cause your hair to loose curl and frizz. That&#x27;s basically what this product is. A perm can be combed through your hair to straighten it or rolled to curl it. I&#x27;m sorry that most of you had terrible experiences but I kind of feel like its the old saying...stupid is as stupid does. If you want a true Brazilian treatment or a Chi relaxer treatment done, call your stylist and pay the $100+ per hour fee. You are not going to achieve the same results from a $12 product. My suggestion embrace your curls, love them. Suaves keratin shampoo and conditioner along with the leave-in conditioner is fantastic for control. Use a small amount of a product like Bio-Silk for frizzy and softness and air dry. You will look amazing and your hair will be healthy and best of all not falling out.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help smooth my hair  All is has done is ruin my hair  im trying everything i can to not cut my hair off, but at this point i dont know what else to do  can not believe this product is for sale i am soo disappointed in it  shame on Sauve</li>
            <li> Sorry, everyone, I was indeed very excited to receive this product and got it out to try it around a week after I got it.&lt;br /&gt;When I read the fine print, I realized it was completely inappropriate for a person with my hair type.&lt;br /&gt;I guess it had been wishful thinking on my part. I had wanted to have soft, silky hair--not dry, brittle, damaged hair!&lt;br /&gt;Reading the directions for this  product, and the requirements for what type of hair you should \\&quot;bring to the table\\&quot;  really scared me off. I have a feeling that if I did in fact use this product, I wouldn&#x27;t have any hair left at all.&lt;br /&gt;NOT what I was looking for! Eek!</li>
            <li> I had very healthy hair.  Used this product...It \\&quot;melted\\&quot; my hair.  My hair started coming out in clumps in the little brush as I was combing it through.  I immediately rinsed it out after 3 minutes, but the damage was already done.  I had to get my hair all chopped off.  When my husband called their helpline (because I was crying too bad to call myself) they said to wash it out with a clarifying shampoo.  They also said that they didn&#x27;t sell the product in walgreens (where I purchased it) and that it can only be applied by a professional!?!?!  What?!?!  DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I realize that my damage could have been a lot worse. I closely followed the directions for all 3 steps, and then blow dried my hair. I looked like I had tried to brush out a bad perm. I had to flat iron just to look like I had dry, damaged hair and ruined ends. I am going to try deep conditioning but will probably have to have at least 2 inches cut off the ends, including all the layers. I can also not stress enough how bad my hair smells, It smells like a cheap home perm. It took me a long time to grow my hair past my shoulders and now I&#x27;m afraid I may be starting over.</li>
            <li> I used this product last night.&lt;br /&gt;You would think that the other reviews have to be exaggerating when they say their hair \\&quot;Melted\\&quot; or became \\&quot;Gummy\\&quot;, honestly if this didn&#x27;t happen to me I wouldn&#x27;t understand what they meant. My hair became CURLIER at the ends, sticky to the touch, and absolutely embarrassing. I was searching online for a antidote to this treatment, some sort of magic reversal. This product should not be available at drug store/grocery.&lt;br /&gt;Templton the Rat from \\&quot;Charlottes web\\&quot; just moved into the rats nest on my head.&lt;br /&gt;Really the damage is unexplainable. I have never complained about a product before, id normally assume this was a problem I brought upon myself, but the damage is so extreme that I feel i&#x27;m obligated to warn others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item, even after I was disqualified to use this product because of its warnings on the side of the box. I have had my hair relaxed, highlighted, dyed different colors, super dry, and so forth. I purchased anyways as I have really dry, curly, frizzy, puffy, damaged, short hair...nothing can be worse than that. Okay so I did the strand test, everything went okay, so I proceeded. I then blow-dried my hair but I am not really good at blow-drying straight so I just dried it (with the blow-dryer) and then used the whole heat protection lotion from step 3 while straightening with flat-iron, combing, and brushing with round brush. I have really short hair but my hair is super dry so I really needed the heat-protection conditioner. My hair never gets straight even when straightening maybe because I am not good at it but right now my hair is as straight as it has ever been(when straightened by myself). It is not super straight and that is okay as I just wanted it somewhat straight and smooth as ANYTHING is better than my really dry, curly, frizzy, puffy, damaged, short hair PLUS I live in a very humid city. I hope this smoothness does last the 30 days. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/3/2012 - I have not washed my hair as I have to wait 48 hours after applying Smoothing kit so I used the dry shampoo because my hair gets really oily. I straightened it with a flat iron and my hair was straight and smooth all day. Yay. I wear hair extensions to make my hair longer so today my real hair actually matched the texture of my real human hair extensions. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3/4/2012 - I washed my hair today and used the Keratin shampoo and conditioner and my hair looks longer as the curls are more manageable and smooth. I am Hispanic (Mexican) and I love this SUAVE Keratin Smoothing product as I have used relaxers and they just make my hair look like The Flintstone type hair or like a broom...maybe because it burns my hair? I feel this is great for us Hispanic people with really unmanageable, frizzy, dry, puffy hair needing a relaxer type product that leaves your hair looking natural and non broom-looking.</li>
            <li> I bought this at WalMart, so I did not see any of these reviews. Had I, I would NEVER have risked using it. I&#x27;ve spent two years growing out my hair and would have been devastated had it ruined it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said, this product DID work for me as intended. My wavy hair is smooth, more manageable and easier to style. The only downside is my step 1 product smelled revolting. Like dog poop mixed with chemicals--not exaggerating. I had to stuff my nose with tissues to keep from gagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use this product again nor will I recommend it to anyone else until Suave figures out why it ruined other peoples hair. It is not ok to sell a product that works 50% of the time. I like my results but I feel like I got lucky. Suave needs to work on this now.</li>
            <li> I saw the commercial for this product and was excited when I saw it at Target.  I figured for 10 dollars it might not be the best, but might help with some frizz I get from the Louisiana humidity.  I read the contraindications on the box and followed all of the directions.  I wish I had read the reviews before I touched this product.  My hair went from being long, full, and golden blond to sparse, gummy, broken, dull, and rust colored.  I am sitting here with a wet head because it will not dry with a blowdryer. It&#x27;s as if someone demolished my hair and coated it with wax.  I have washed it 20 times since last Wednesday, after waiting an excruciating 48 hours, and it is still....I have no words.  The worst part is knowing that Suave put this out and knew about the problems in December.  Please do not use this product and do not support this company as they clearly do not respect consumers.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so shocked to see all of the new users with destroyed hair.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read reviews before doing this to my hair. There are warnings on the box that were a little bit scary but none of them applied to my hair. I have only colored my hair like 2 times in my entire life, my hair is healthy, well it WAS healthy. When I first finished the treatment (which I did perfectly by the directions) I thought it was OK for an at home treatment. (I did think that it would smooth my hair, when actually it straightened it a bit which is not really what I wanted) I waited the 48 hours that you are instructed to wait to wash again. When I did that and styled my hair I noticed that the end of my part at the crown of my head, felt strange. At first I thought it burned my scalp but what it actually was, was little stubble. My hair felt like it was shaved off right there, very close to my scalp. There are still a couple of long hairs there, so hopefully its not going to be so bad. Bottom line is that this product is TERRIBLE. It should not be on shelves. Trust me, and DO NOT try it, even if your hair is healthy. First of all it doesn&#x27;t do much in the way of smoothing, and second and most importantly, it makes you bald. Unless you want to cry and constantly be worried about a bald spot on your head don&#x27;t do it!!!!</li>
            <li> I have done the real keratin treatment at hair salons, and I can assure you this is NOT a keratin treatment. I applied it exactly as instructed, 2 weeks ago, and I have no idea what to do do get my hair/curls/shine back. My hair feels and looks like straw, if I flat iron it looks awful, if I let it dry au natural it&#x27;s awful, people at work have asked me what happened to my hair and I am so embarrassed I have to wear it in a bun to avoid answering more questions, it truly looks AWFUL and I want to know what can I do to get my curls back????? I&#x27;ve been washing it daily with regular shampoo to see if it comes off, but it&#x27;s still lifeless, dry, and I&#x27;m scared I&#x27;m going to have to cut it off... I have no words to express how disappointed and frustrated I am. When I started applying it I knew this wasn&#x27;t the same thing they do in salons, it smells like a hair relaxer/perm, and the results are the same as a hair relaxer, unhealthy, shapeless hair. I WANT MY CURLS BACK, ALL I WANTED WAS TO GET IT LESS FRIZZY, AND WHAT I GOT WAS NO CURLS, NO SHINE AND UGLY STRAW HAIR. :( Before applying I did the quiz on the SUAVE website and it recommended the 30 day treatment, which I certainly do not, at least not if you love your curls and bounce and just wish they were a little smoother!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: AFTER 4 WEEKS: Have been applying olive oil daily to give hair at least some shine, but I am still extremely frustrated. My curl is finally starting to come back at the root, and in patches throughout the top part of my head, however it&#x27;s looking even more awkward since it&#x27;s curling at the top and then about 6 inches of my hair is still super straight, dry and shapeless. My hair is approximately down to the middle of my back,I fear that if I go to a salon to have have the straight dry parts cut off it will end up above my shoulder, hence once it curls it will look even shorter. It took me so long to grow out my hair, I can&#x27;t believe I ruined it by believing this was just a \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot;treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: AFTER 6 WEEKS: hair didn&#x27;t get any better, had to go to hair salon this week where they did a deep conditioning and cut over 6 inches off my hair :( Now my hair is above my shoulders, to my disappointment the ends are still straight,they did not curl at all, I now have more volume since it&#x27;s so short, so it&#x27;s super puffy, frizzy, and awkwardly straight at the bottom and wavy at the top. Hair looks a little healthier after the cut and treatment, however still does not resemble my natural hair in any way. I have another cut scheduled in 3 months, it&#x27;s going to be a long while until I manage to get rid of all the damage done. I was advised by my hair stylist to keep doing home deep conditioning every week/10 days to try and restore back its health and shine.</li>
            <li> I am writing this post to say THANK YOU to all those brave women who wrote their negative reviews about this product.  I saw the commercial recently and I was very curious about the treatment.  I have always done the \\&quot;magic\\&quot; perm and also tried the Brazilian Keratin treatment at the salon.  Results always came out well.  So you can guess my excitement when Suave came out with this product.  However, after reading all the horrific stories, I have decided not to pursue this product any furthur.  I want to say to all those people who experienced hair loss, bald spots and just a plain ole&#x27;mess on their hair that my heart goes out to each and every one of you.  Your detailed reviews have helped many others like myself, NOT want to try this treatment anymore.  I wish I could take a magic wand and bring back the beautiful hair that many have lost in this process.  I don&#x27;t know why this item is still on the shelves, but it definitely should be pulled off immediately.  For all those that have suffered crying nights (and afternoons), heartache, frustration and sheer anger, please hang in there.  Again, thank you for your candid reviews.  It has helped many in seeing what kind of product this really is- AKA- garbage for the hair.&lt;br /&gt;HUGS.</li>
            <li> I bought this product  2 weeks ago, wait 15 days after I colored it.  My hair was real healthy, I just had a dusting done... I was growing it out.  I wish I would have research this product before I did it... It melted my hair.  Had to layer it and it is still breaking. I don&#x27;t know what to do. I can not believe an OTC product would do this. I read the instructions and still got these results.&lt;br /&gt;I beg of you... DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> I have coarse,frizzy hair and this made it much more manageable. It&#x27;s soft to the touch and is much easier to straighten. Great value for the price. I really don&#x27;t understand how this product could possibly bald someone. It did nothing but make my hair look better. Not quite up to par with a salon brazilian blowout but for $8.00 with coupon I think it is a great alternative.</li>
            <li> If you want to burn your hair beyond repair, this is the product for you. I&#x27;m sorry I fell for the commercial.</li>
            <li> My hair was driving me nuts. I recently had it cut but it was still stringy and no body. I tried a vinegar/water rinse but still looked awful. I had seen this Suave Keratin infusion kit on t.v. and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see a noticable difference. It&#x27;s done wonders for my hair.  It has body again and doesn&#x27;t feel like a stringy mop on my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have any breakage or balding as I read in other reviews.  My hair is thin. I dyed it with Garnier home dye about 6 weeks ago.  My hair was healthy except for the flyaways and lack of body. This was a recent thing and I don&#x27;t know what was causing it. This kit made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I didn&#x27;t leave step 1 on for 15 minutes as recommended. I read the directions wrong and only left step 1 on for 7 minutes.  The same directions for step 2.  However I&#x27;m sure with all the combing of the product through my hair during step 1 it was on longer than 7 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forget and washed my hair the next day but it didn&#x27;t affect it any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars however, it&#x27;s not as sleek as the product stated it would be. But that could be because of my  mistake in processing time. Also the odor is bad so it only gets 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy I gave this a try. I feel like I stepped out of a salon.  My hair has body, sleek, no more stringiness, and is very shiny now.&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry for those who had bad results with this.</li>
            <li> I thank God that before making a purchase I read the reviews first. I was planning on buying this yesterday but as I usually do I researched the reviews first. I am absolutely horrified at the results and damage this product has caused to countless numbers of women. I told my daughter about the reviews and she read them for herself and was shocked and enraged that this product is still being sold.....she&#x27;s 14 and she&#x27;s decided to do something about it. She&#x27;s started a petition on change.org to get this product yanked from shelves and to warn other women of the potential hazards that await them if they decide to use this product. Please take a minute and sign her petition and pass the word along to your friends and family. This product has left too many women in tears and with feeling a hopelessness...it&#x27;s time to stop them.    [...]    Just take a minute of your time and sign and pass the word around. The only way to get this taken off the shelves is to bring the spotlight to the countless stories of women suffering hair loss, scalp burns and severe breakage to their hair. Unilever and Suave don&#x27;t seem to care...it&#x27;s time for us to FORCE them to care. Coupons and hand lotion and refunds will not fix the hair and scalps of those who were unfortunate enough to use it. Do not remain silent on this and show this company that in mass numbers there&#x27;s no escaping the damage they have created. There will be no sweeping this under the rug.</li>
            <li> I took this with me on vacation because I knew I would be going in and out of swimming pools and salt water...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say [[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]]took my damaged hair (and I have a ton of it) from horse tail to silky...I will be buying this product.</li>
            <li> I have never used an over the counter treatment or hair coloring system.  But decided to give this a try.  It said to leave on for 20 minutes for colored hair and continue to brush throughout the process.  I brushed my hair as recommended and felt like it took out half a head of hair!  After 15 minutes I felt like my hair was burning.  I finished the process and my hair ended up being completely dry, brittle, and damaged.  My ends were fried!  I ended up going to the salon and getting a deep conditioning treatment and cut which helped but my hair is still dry and damaged.  I do NOT recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the way my hair looks.  This kit was a life saver - my hair was frizzy and looked unprofessional and constantly like I&#x27;d just got done jogging in 100 degree weather.  I hated it! I read the warnings on here first and proceeded carefully.  My hair is colored frequently, so I left the mixture (which is pretty much just relaxer - you&#x27;ll definitely recognize the perm smell!) on my hair five minutes less than the directions specified.  I had a little melting scare during the come through and immediately rinsed the solution out.  It&#x27;s been a month now and I am still very happy with the end results.  It&#x27;s straight, shiny and looks a 100 times better than it did before. People have complimented me on it. The most important thing to remember is do NOT lose track of time and leave it in too long.  Way better to err on the side of caution.  I think that anyone who tries this sort of thing at home has to be aware of the possible consequences and remember that you can always do more, but that you can&#x27;t UNdo over processing.</li>
            <li> BE AWARE!!! Keratin is not for all hair types.  I had a Keratin treatment (in a salon) a while back and thought it made my hair too flat since I&#x27;m 43 and with thinning hair.  After a couple of months it went back to normal, but it was dry to the point that there was not hair mask that could fix it.. Ultimately I cut it down shoulder length.  When I saw the Suave Keratine commercial, I have to admit that my hopes were up thinking that maybe this is a product that if marketed and tested had to be good.  Not only that, it says 30 day Smoothing kit, so I was wrong assuming that it would be mild enough to use at home.  The smell of Cream 1 is so overwhelmingly strong that it lasted in my bathroom for almost 2 days (with windows opened).  It smells just like a straightening cream.  I followed the directions and used the kit.  I carefully washed away the product and used the cream for heat protection and styled my hair.  I&#x27;m not kidding you when I tell you that I had a lamp in the back and could see in the mirror as pieces of my hair were breaking and falling to the floor as I used their black comb to style my hair and detangle.  It was straight, YES, but it was dead, flaky, it broke and had no shine!!!  I literally stopped, touched it and it felt like brillo pad!!!! I stood there in the mirror crying my eyes out!!!!  I have put every mask, Argan Oil, 10 deep moisture and nothing has worked!!!!!  I cried today again thinking WHY DID I EVER DO THIS TO MY HAIR!!!!  Please read carefully their instructions and do a strand test before you put it in all your hair.  Shame on you SUAVE for damaging the hair of so many women.  Don&#x27;t you even think of replying to this message!!  What can you do me for me?  Give me my $@# 10.00 dollars back?  I want my hair back!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this product because my hair has been frizzy lately so I wanted to try something to get rid of it. My hair isn&#x27;t color treated and I met all the requirements on the side of the box, I followed the directions to a T. The roots of my hair are smooth but once I had a chance to actually look at it my ends were completely fried. The longer it has been since I did the treatment the worse my hair has become. I hate that this has completely ruined the bottom two inches of my hair. I am not suggesting it to any of my friends... DON&#x27;T USE!!!!</li>
            <li> Do not use this product. It will make all your hair break, split and fall out! I had non colored, never treated hair. I thought this would take the frizz out and all it did was ruin my hair.</li>
            <li> Had I read the reviews first, I would not have been brave enough to try this product.  Therefore, I am glad I did not read the reviews, because I had no problems at all with this product.  I am very sorry for all those reviewers who said they had all those problems.  I kinda feel bad about being able to give it 5 stars when all those other people had all those problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smoothed down my hair, like it was supposed to.  In fact, my hair looks so much better.  It did not scorch my hair or cause bald spots.  It caused no problems at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to wait until the full 30 days were up before I wrote a review.  This product is a 30-day smoothing kit.  My hair has stayed smooth the whole 30 days, and I don&#x27;t know how much longer it will continue to stay smooth, since its time is up, but I will write a followup on this review later to let you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why I had no problems, yet so many other people had horrible problems.  I carefully read the directions, and did it exactly as specified.  I was very careful with the timing and everything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did ask a hair care professional how long to wait before coloring.  I probably should have looked on the box and found an 800 number and asked the Suave people themselves, but it was just more convenient to ask my personal hair care professional, plus I trust her.  She said, if it is permanent color, to wait a week after applying this smoothing kit, but if it is temporary color, it can be done the same day (but do the smoothing kit first and then the coloring, because she said if you color first, the smoothing kit will strip out the coloring).  Anyway, I did the smoothing kit first and then the temporary color; either the smoothing kit stripped it out even though the coloring was done last, or else the coloring just didn&#x27;t take.  Therefore, I waited another week and tried the temporary coloring again, and same thing: it didn&#x27;t take.  But, I am not complaining.  The fact that the coloring didn&#x27;t take is a very small nuisance compared to the major problems other reviewers had.  I will trying coloring again since the whole 30 days is up.  I will probably try a different type or brand of temporary coloring since that just didn&#x27;t take (I don&#x27;t know if it is because of the smoothing kit in my hair or if it just didn&#x27;t take).act that the coloring didn&#x27;t take is a very small nuisance compared to the major problems other reviewers had.  I will trying coloring again since the whole 30 days is up.  I will probably try a different type or brand of temporary coloring since that just didn&#x27;t take (I don&#x27;t know if it is because of the smoothing kit in my hair or if it just didn&#x27;t take).</li>
            <li> I have very wavy, frizzy hair.  I tried this product after a friend recommended it.  She has very curly hair and it was still super straight  after a month.  I had to wait until I could set aside the time to do it as it does take some time.  Step one does have a perm solution smell to it but it wasn&#x27;t super over powering.  I was a little worried after I rinsed it out because my hair felt very dry and brittle.  I then applied step two to my hair and that  instantly went away. I waited the 7 minutes and rinsed it out. My hair felt amazing even wet.  I applied the leave in conditioner and started to blow dry my hair.  halfway through my blow dryer stopped working, so I let my hair air dry.  Well I did not end up with pin straight hair, it is definitely straighter then before and I only spent about 5 minutes with the flat iron.  My hair now looks like what I typical spend an hour doing.  I am extremely happy with the results.  I will be using this product again in 3 months.  I even recommended it to my friend who have very think wavy hair.  She is just as excited by her hair as I am by mine.</li>
            <li> This product ruined my hair. I thought this product was to smooth and get rid of frizzy hair but it completely fried my hair. I&#x27;m mortified by how terrible it looks. Every strand is cinched and stripped dry. I have been told the only thing to repair it is a deep conditioner or to chop it off. I am very disappointed with this product. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!! It should not be on the market. Suave did contact me and said they would refund my money, but $10.99 doesn&#x27;t fix the amount of damage their product caused my hair nor will it change the amount of time it is going to take grow my hair out. Like the poor girl who lost her hair above said, this product does not deserve a star, but Amazon makes you select at least one.</li>
            <li> I too should have read all of the reviews on here before purchasing and using this awful product.  I have had several salon keratin treatments over the past couple of years and the results were wonderful - shiny, sleek, gorgeous hair.  Using this product was the WORST thing I could have done to my hair.  First off, it smells absolutely terrible and my head starting burning and my hair falling out and breaking off within minutes of applying the first step.  So I freaked out and washed it out.  My hair now is completely messed up, breaking off, weird, coarse and straw-like texture, dull - pretty much everything you don&#x27;t want your hair to look like.  It&#x27;s been several weeks now and my hair isn&#x27;t getting any better despite using expensive, top-shelf conditioners to try to repair some of the damage and babying my hair.  I guess I just have to cut it all off.  Thanks, Suave!</li>
            <li> Visit [...] before deciding if the product is right for you...    I have very thin, dry, fragile, fizzy, curly hair that has always been a problem for me (I am 44).  I remember all the times I cried because my hair was so unruly.  Even after going to the hair salon and spending a fortune my hair was always a problem no matter if I let it go curly, flat ironed or professionally blew it out.  On top of that I am gray and color my hair as well which makes it even dryer..  I bought the Suave Keratin Infusion Smoothing kit after I saw a commercial and loved the girls hair.  I knew that my hair would not be like that girl on the commercial but I had hoped it would at least improve my hair.  After buying the product and doing the first step, I noticed that some hair did come out but not a lot and the dyed color was starting to go from med brown to light blond.  I didn&#x27;t panic and I moved on to the 2nd and 3rd step.  Well, my hair was never straighter and never felt as soft and smooth after I blew it out.  I was extremely impressed.  However I didn&#x27;t like some of the fumes (although hair dye is just as bad), and the way my head tingled a day later.  I was nervous and wanted to see what others thought so I read the reviews on it.  Boy do I wish I read them first because all I thought about was my hair was going to come out and I was going to bald; thankfully it didn&#x27;t.  It is now 2 weeks later, I have shampooed and conditioned my hair (using Renpure keratin shampoo and conditioner not Suave because I didn&#x27;t want to wash it with sulfates which Suave has)and my hair is great!!!  It is so easy to blow out, and its still really straight and extremely soft.  My hair has never been better. However I will not use this product again.  I wanted to write this review on the Suave website but I couldn&#x27;t find a place to write it so I figured Amazon would be the best because this is where I saw so many bad reviews and I wanted to stress the following:  GO TO THE SUAVE WEBSITE TO SEE IF THE PRODUCT IS RIGHT FOR YOU.  There is a test that will determine if you should or shouldn&#x27;t use it [...]  Don&#x27;t just look at these reviews, these other women may have just bought the product and used it (like I did) without really knowing if this product was right for their hair.  If you go to the link you will see that if you color/highlight your hair, or have brittle hair, or don&#x27;t know your hair type, you will not be recommended to use this product.  You have to answer a lot of questions to see if it right or else you will possibly break and ruin your hair.  Even though I really liked this product, I should not have used it.  I was just lucky that my hair didn&#x27;t break off.  Also I am happy with the lighter color but it just worked out this time.  I will not use it again due to the fact that I color my hair and the Suave test told me I shouldn&#x27;t use it. again I feel I just got lucky I may not be so lucky if I use it again.  From now on I will use the sulfate free Keratin products and see what happens after the infusion kit wears off.  Good luck to you all.  I really understand the stress of not having good, well managed hair.</li>
            <li> After using this product my hair was completely gummi.  Had to cut ALL of it off.  Stay AWAY from this crap.  I dont bleach my hair and I have had keratin treatments in the past and these were not the results.  Suave consumer dept tried telling me it was my fault because \\&quot;the mixture of this treatment with the keratin treatment done at a salon 8 months ago must have reacted badly\\&quot;  There was a BAD REACTION alright and it had nothin to do with my treatment from 8 months ago.  Suave is not tring to make this right for their consumers only tring to place blame somwhere else.</li>
            <li> I just used this product, thinking Keratin good for my hair, right? wrong! Ater having it in for about 10 Min  I knew something was wrong. I have done some horrible things to my hair including giving myself a buzz cut. this was the 1st time I have even cried about my hair. Once I started combing it, my hair started to fall out. Not to mention that my hair is pretty much platinum now.Thankfully for me, my neighbor is a hair dresser, and she has gotten me what I need to fix the damage this horrible product has done to my already weakened hair. This is a true form of false advertisement in my opinion. The 1st ingredient is  hair relaxer, keratin is the last... Seriously jacked up. If you buy this product do yourself a favor return it before use or at the very least read every inch of the box you can before purchasing. This for me was a case of false advertizing &amp; ignorance on my part. Lesson learned.</li>
            <li> I too used this product...yesterday. My hair.. FRIED... completely unmanagable. If I straighten it, it poofs out and if i wear it wet to air dry it dries poofy with zero curl. Iam totally sickened by this product. I have deep conditioned my hair all day multiple times and nothing is working to even smooth it out a little bit. To all of you other ladies that had the same problem what did you do for your hair after the dreadful results? Any way we can get our money back or anything?</li>
            <li> My hair was frizzy after I blow dried or air dried (actually, right when stepping out of the shower). My hair would tripled in size when it was dry (with the hair drier)it was embarrassing, not even flat ironing it would look shiny and smooth. It didn&#x27;t look that bad if I air dried it, but who wants to wait 3 hours for their hair to completely dry, then flat iron it??? OMG. It was a pain in the butt. Anyways, my hair is thick, wavy and it was dry and frizzy. I saw the kit at Target and I just had to try it. I applied and the results are just W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L!!!! After I was done, my hair felt like my 1 year old baby girl. Smooth,shiny, and light, and, healthy, and new, and I felt like my hair was born. I don&#x27;t remember EVER feeling my hair it felt (feels). I love playing with my hair and I get lot of compliments. I applied it on March 4th and I just ran out of the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion Heat Defense Leave-In Conditioner, this is a must. I ran out and I just S&amp;S. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TRY IT. YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET IT. I even thought of getting a deep conditioning at a hair salon for $150. But with this kit you will get the same results for LESS! The product is enough to apply for long hair, at waist level. 2 thumbs up!:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this item at CVS and tried it before reading all of the terrible reviews on Amazon. Those are some scary stories, wow! I spent a good hour to hour and a half on this one morning. I have coarse, wavy/curly hair and was hoping to have it as straight as the picture implies. Blow drying and straightening my hair is such a pain. I followed the instructions and did not take any shortcuts. When I blowdried my hair, I attempted to avoid using a brush just to see what the results were. It started turning into the typical frizzy mess so I used a brush and finished it with a flat iron. My hair felt smoother but a little fried. Since I have washed it though, I don&#x27;t have that fried feeling. When I washed it 2.5 days later and went to bed that night, I woke up with wavy hair. Not what I was hoping, BUT, the waves were much tamer than I would usually have. The waves actually looked nice, I thought.  So, this product did reduce the curls in my hair somewhat. I might consider using a professional next time though until I read some more positive reviews. This didn&#x27;t even come close to ruining my hair but I am a little afraid of next time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and decided to try it. I have fine hair but alot of it. I thought useing this has to be less damaging than a flat iron every day. My hair is long and colored but according to the directions safe for me to use. I also asked my stylest who cautioned me against do it yourself straightner. Stupid me thought it has to be simple otherwise it wouldent be out on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, it is simple to use. I have waves in my hair nothing huge, just annoying to me, which is why I bought this. I just did not want to pay a couple hundred to have it done professionaly. I was so wrong it isn&#x27;t even funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this and did not even leave it in the 20 mins because as i said it was just some waves. My hair is totally fried. To the point I got 2 large and handfulls out when combing it. I was to the point I was afraid to comb it. My hair is mushy. I am sitting here writing this and my hair is not even dry yet. I am afraid to dry it. I came across some of the bad reviews while looking on how to try to do something to fix  besides getting my hair cut short. its to the middle of my back. But there are places where its really damaged close to an inch from my scalpe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt the differance after useing step one but I thought it was just part of the process. I figured step 2 would fix it. I am scares to see what I am left with when it dries. I am positive it will be nothing as discribed on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also see on some of these reviews where the company is saying call them. For what? The hair is already ruined. Now I need to attempt to find something that is going to at least make it some what liveable. Ladies, save your money. Let a professional do it. You will save money and ALOT of heartache in the end.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this out by saying that I know, full well, that I&#x27;m one of the lucky ones.  I have very thick dark hair that, as I&#x27;ve gotten older (and a little grey has made it&#x27;s way in) has a more dramatic reaction to the humidity than it did when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Brazilian Keratin treatment at a salon several years ago.  And that.. to this day.. stands as the best hair day of my life.  Exorbitantly pricey, my hair came out of that looking incredibly fab, feeling fantastic, and I was able to maintain the great style my hair sylist had accomplished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I got older and the hairs on the top of my head were a bit more dry and kinked, I moved to deep conditioners and the trusty flat iron.  I have been considering getting another treatment to get it under control, because when the humidity is up.. my hair floofs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I spotted this in the store and for ten bucks?  figured why not?  Keratin is good for your hair, and so in theory there&#x27;s no way you can really damage it using Keratin. It should just smooth and weigh down the cuticles and generally make it behave better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions; and it didn&#x27;t seem too out of line with my professional experience.  The extra step I figured wasn&#x27;t a big deal. This is Keratin right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WRONG.  Let me tell you now. The Step 1 of this is a perm solution. there is no way around that.  There&#x27;s a logic to it that I get.  Just like a perm can be used to force tight curls in hair, it can be used to force them out. But it strips down the hair to accomplish that. (Natural curls in hair are actually due to a variance in thickness in the cuticle of the hair.) So a Perm basically shaves off the outside of the cuticle of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let me repeat myself here. STEP 1 IS A PERM SOLUTION.  If your hair cannot handle a perm, then this is not going to be happy ending for you.  If you&#x27;re not comfortable perming your hair at home; then Step 1 is not going to help that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m fortunate in that my hair can handle more than a bit of abuse, I just don&#x27;t abuse it regularly.  And when I smelled Step 1?  I decided not to abuse it then either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did do?  I totally skipped step 1.  I went straight for Step 2; and saturated my hair with that much more pleasant smelling cream.  Turns out THAT was the actual Keratin.  I had an accidental moment of smart.  So I let that one soak all in to my wet hair.  It actually sat in my hair for about 12 minutes.  I rinsed it out; applied the Step 3.  I&#x27;m happy with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flyaways that are normally at the top of my hair are smooth and flat now.  My hair feels great; it lays well with its layers, and so I&#x27;m okay with that.  I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s going to last anywhere near as long as the Salon version; nor do I expect it to come anywhere close to the awesome that is the Coppola Keratin treatments.  But for ten bucks?  I&#x27;m not unhappy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said. This is nothing like a salon keratin treatment. You ARE adding Perm chemicals to your hair; and hair that doesn&#x27;t handle those well is going to break; melt, and split..just like what happens when you get a bad home perm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice?  Skip step 1.  Go straight to step 2 and don&#x27;t risk your coiffure.  Maybe it won&#x27;t last a whole month; but there are other products out there that last longer.  This is Suave. It&#x27;s not meant to be perfect replacement to the pricier products they mimic.  (Seriously.. their idea of mimicking Aveda&#x27;s Rosemary Mint Shampoo and Conditioner is laughable)  But you can get good results from it; if you&#x27;re aware of what&#x27;s going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In other words, if you don&#x27;t want to perm your hair?  Skip Step 1.  There&#x27;s no reason for it. (I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s included because it should make the treatment last longer)&gt;I&#x27;m fortunate in that my hair can handle more than a bit of abuse, I just don&#x27;t abuse it regularly.

            <li> I am writing my review as I&#x27;m crying sitting at the hair salon with my hair dresser trying to figure out what to do with my hair. I read the fine print, followed the directions and thought that I would have \\&quot;smooth and silky hair\\&quot; well I have the complete opposite. My bangs if that&#x27;s what I can still call them are completely burt off. My hair is burnt and falling on the floor as my hairdresser combs it. I know I am not a hair professional but not one place on that box does it say this is a straighter that will burn your hair off. Don&#x27;t use. It took me all year to grow my hair out and I am having to have to cut it off. Shame on you Suave for selling this product that has ruined my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 2/29/12&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I was at the salon last night from 4:30-7:30 having them try to figure out what to do with my hair that was past my shoulders that is now a bob up to my ears. THANKS SO MUCH SUAVE. This was the worst $10 something I spent and is now costing me hundreds to get my hair back. I got a real Keratin conditioning treatment which I will have to go back and get more cause my hair is so dry and breaking off. When I thought that this is what this product was a Keratin conditioning treatment cause no where does it say CHEMICAL STRAIGHTENING. I just cant believe you can buy this product at a drugstore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would attach pictures if I knew how to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/5/12&lt;br /&gt;I just got off the phone with customer service. May I say that was a waste. Apparently I didn&#x27;t answer all the questions correct (sorry about that I can&#x27;t really remember how many minutes it took me to put step 1 in my hair cause its fried off and I had 2 cut it that what I know) Than they are going to refund my $10 bucks and give me a coupon. Let&#x27;s be serious Suave I never want to use anything with your name on it. What a joke.</li>
            <li> after reading article in NYTimes, that suggested home keratin treatments worked well, I tried Suave.  HORROR!!!  I am used to coloring my hair, so application is not an issue.  The product is the issue!  Now, with a part in the middle of my head &amp; wire rim glasses, I could be Lennon...  not my esthetic.  Can&#x27;t wait for product to leave my hair, as it won&#x27;t respond to conditioners or leave-ins, so I have to wear it up all the time.</li>
            <li> I used this product on my 13 year old daughter&#x27;s hair and it came out beautiful.  She has natural coarse hair n I follow the steps to the T. After washing out the product, her hair was smooth n manageable.  I blow dried it then flat ironed it and she has so much body n bounce to her hair. I would definitely use this product on her hair again.</li>
            <li> I have used keratinique last year, which was much more money, but an excellent product, very time consuming though.  So when I saw this suave product, read the box and thought this is much easier, doesn&#x27;t require flat iron, can blow dry. Well, you get what you pay for. I applied the product as instructed and within the first 5 minutes, after the product was applied, I was combing through my hair while it was processing, and clumps of hair started to come out of my head, and my hair started to shrivel up like someone lit it on fire! I panicked and rinsed it out immediately! My hair looked like a Brillo pad, I had to get my hair cut so short because it was so brittle and damaged!  So not worth using this product! It also smelled horrendous like perm cream. Now,I will have to spend more money to purchase deep conditioning treatment for my hair and will have to wait months for my hair to get back to normal! DON&#x27;T TAKE A CHANCE!  CHEAPER----definately not better! Save yourself the horror I am going through!&lt;br /&gt;A degraw</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bald spots, but my experience with this crap has been pretty bad. I went to Sallys and picked up the ion keratin smoothing system (which is a real keratin treatment, not a falsely advertised hair relaxer), which has definitely made a big improvement to the damage. It&#x27;s definitely not back to normal, but my hair doesn&#x27;t feel like cotton candy anymore and I think I can hold off on cutting it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s reviews are spot on... My hair is fried, dry, and breaking off. Worst mistake ever, and now it&#x27;s been in a bun for days: what else can I do with it?? Box specifically says it is non damaging... lies!</li>
            <li> I have just used the suave keratin treatment, i have never permed or relaxed my hair before. I have colored it once or twice but nothing like this. It is a cheap way to do a good treatment on your hair. I have asked around how much it would be for someone professional to chemically relax my hair and its over $200 dollars and the product in your local walmart is only $8.00. Well the steps are very easy , just follow directions and continue. My hair is very course , thick , and curly. During the treatment i could tell a difference right away. My hair became more easy to manage, you could comb through it without any problem and that is never happens. Well they tell you not to wash it for 48 hours and i followed as told. Today i washed it and WOW !!! The difference is so amazing. I love it , yes i still have my curls but they are more tamed. I am able to wear my hair down with less frizz. I LOVE IT !!!!!.... I have read a couple reviews about some people loosing there hair. I did not loose any at all and when i washed today , still no hair was coming out. I was very surprised though because this is the first time i used any kind of product. I will use it again in the next three months i believe it will help my frizz even more. Also i use suave shampoo and conditioner **lower sulfate and that also helps with my frizz , i have used every product on the market trying to tam the frizz and was never successful until now.. Please read all waring on side of the box because there are many cons -- everyone cant use this product. But if you can i suggest you do ..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much ,&lt;br /&gt;Satisfied Customer</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair was a mess...unfortunately she was born with her father&#x27;s uncontrollable hair and no longer wanted to look like Albert Einstein.  Product, though smelly, was very easy to put on.  She said there was a minor itching.  One hour later, glorious, long shiny hair.  She ran over to her best friend &#x27;s house and her friend, and her mom, wanted to know what miracle occurred.  It usually takes us a painful twenty minutes every morning to brush out the knots.  This morning, it took a minute.  Thank you Suave for a wonderful product!</li>
            <li> This product ruined my hair. I read the instructions clearly and follow them exactly. I leave even less time the product because noticed that the hair color had change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair result as gum, sticky and porous. I had to cut it very very short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was announced as keratin. But Keratin did not damage your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is erroneously label like keratin, but really it is a relaxer and should be applied by a hair professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use it, it&#x27;s a crap and it will damage your hair.</li>
            <li> This product made some of my hair fall out and some of it break off. It literally melted it. I had to have my hair cut short like a mans. My hair used to be below my shoulders. Suave is going to send me a prepaid envelope for expenses, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use it, bottom line is it shouldn&#x27;t have been on the market to start with, and with all the complaints it should have been pulled from the market. I am so angry, and when I look in the mirror I cry, all my hair gone.</li>
            <li> I know better than to buy store products like this, any treatment, including color should be done at the salon!!!  My hair was in very good health when i applied this product, I now have frizzy hair and burned ends. The entire texture of my hair has changed, it almost feels like there is a coating still on top of it.  (weeks after treatment)  I guess i shouldn&#x27;t complain because some poor women actually lost their hair, what a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, all is not lost though.. I have been doing Hot Oil treatments a few times a week and I just used a macadamia nut hair mask (from cvs since im desperate) and Im awaiting a Moroccan oil treatment from amazon.  For the first time im finally seeing some shine and health come back to my hair. This little box of crap has cost me a ton of money and ruined the investment I&#x27;ve put into the health of my hair for years!!!!  A good haircut will be next on my list.  Im so appalled they are still selling this product with all these horror story reviews. SHame ON YOU SAUVE!</li>
            <li> I have to be honest. I have not purchased or used this product but have been anxiously awaiting it&#x27;s release so that I could use it on my hair. I just want to express my gratitude to the Amazon reviewers who have taken the time to write about their negative experiences, they have convinced me to stay far, far away from  the Suave Keratin Smoothing kit.   The warnings on the box probably would have made me think twice about using it, but I LOVE reading hair product reviews before I try something new. Like probably 95% of potential users, I have colored, highlighted, slightly dry/frizzy hair so I guess I&#x27;m not a good candidate for the treatment either. I think I&#x27;ll stick to my argan oil and flat iron.   Again, I&#x27;m sorry for the scary and awful experiences many of you have had but I really appreciate the warnings!!!   I hope that Suave reads these reviews bc this product does not seem very safe.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time today.  I made sure that I followed the instructions regarding whether the product was right for me.  I am Caucasian and I have naturally wavy/curly hair (not tight curls).  I have used at-home single process hair color for years to cover up some gray mostly and to slightly lighten a natural dark brown color.  I have not had highlights or bleached hair or a perm since late 1980&#x27;s.  I waited two weeks since coloring my hair last before using this product.  The process was quite lengthy (but it is to be expected for what you are using the product for).  After the final rinse and applying the leave-in conditioner while my hair was still wet, I did see a dramatic change in how my hair looked wet.  It was noticeably straight.  I did blow dry my hair (it dried mostly straight) and I touched up any slight waves with a hot-iron straightener.  I did not have any more hair fall out than usual when I used this product.  So far, I am pleased.  I will wait the 48 hours as recommended to wash my hair.  I will then style my hair by letting it air dry and then update this review.</li>
            <li> I was waiting to write this review until enough time passed to really judge the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very fine, curly, frizzy hair. I had the salon Brazilian Keratin treatment done twice and paid 175.00 each time. The results the second time were not as effective and seemed to not take.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Suave keratin treatment and 3 months later my hair is still smooth and straight! Don&#x27;t think that you can just step out of the shower and let your hair air dry though. You still need to blow dry it. But it dries so fast and so straight and shiny! Also, it looks thicker all around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an athlete so I&#x27;m washing my hair after workouts 4-5 times a week. This has been such a time saver for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, before using the keratin, I would blow-dry my hair, flat iron it and if it was rainy or humid out my hair would just turn to frizzy fluff. I used to expect to look into the mirror of where I arrive to see a giant haystack! But to my surprise my hair remained sleek, smooth and shiny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did experience some breakage around my hairline. But, I also single process dye my hair from brown to red. Next time I do the keratin touch-up I will start away from my hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read all the directions carefully or have a friend help you. Oh, and open it window the stuff is very strong smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
            <li> On Tuesday, April 24, 2012, I attempted to use the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit. Upon beginning its use, I could not get my hair to comb out straight, I was barely getting a comb through my hair and once I got lucky and could actually drag the comb through my hair, the hair would snap back into curls instead of staying straight. No matter how much I left the treatment in my hair and tried to continue to comb it, larger and larger chunks of my hair was yanked out of my hair in large clumps with every attempt to comb it straight. I had to stop immediately, I thought I was going to be left bald and was sure that I had quite a few bald spots already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I headed straight for the shower to rinse out the solution and encountered the loss of more and more hair continuing to come out in clumps in the shower. I was so frightened I didn&#x27;t know what to do. I called my salon hair stylist as soon as I exited the shower because what hair I had left was stripped down next to nothing and could not be combed, brushed or even finger combed. The hair stylist told me to come to her salon immediately where we would put a conditioning treatment on my hair and to find out what shape it was in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I arrived at the salon and immediately had a conditioning treatment put on and left on for quite a while. Once the stylist rinsed it out, she could tell that I had lost a large amount of hair and when she tried, she was not be able to brush, comb or finger comb it either. With as much patience as she could, she combed through it as softly as she could using leave-in spray conditioner. No matter how hard she tried, she finally began slowly cutting away the worst of the damage of what was left of my hair after that treatment when only hours before I had extremely long, shiny, bouncy, perfect healthy, brown hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once she cut out the worst of the damage, she tried to cut layers as evenly as possible so I would look as normal as could be expected. My hair is so short and so chopped with layers that I hardly recognize myself. Even after the stylist&#x27;s best efforts, my hair continues to be damaged and fried which makes it very difficult to comb through, much less style and try to make it look half way decent in public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how long it is going to take for my hair to grow out of all the damage done to it. I suppose I can only look to both the short term and long term plans for now which is to continue to get conditioning treatments and hair cuts until everything has grown out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I BEG OF ALL THOSE OF YOU CONSIDERING USING THE SUAVE PROFESSIONALS KERATIN INFUSION 30 DAY SMOOTHING KIT to save yourself the time, trouble and heartache of going through all the destruction possible all because you want to make your hair a little more straight for a couple of months. IT IS SO NOT WORTH IT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep thinking about all of the life events that I have yet to experience this year (a graduation, a wedding, etc.) and I&#x27;m tortured by all the thoughts of the photographs that will be taken and kept for years, recording these momentous occasions with me looking like only God knows how depending on the amount of time that has passed by the time each occasion happens, all because I wanted a little extra and UNNECESSARY vanity.</li>
            <li> Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually walked into the store today to buy this product after seeing a commercial, but I&#x27;m one to research hair products before I buy them because I&#x27;m mixed black and white, and my hair can be quite difficult to maintain, as it&#x27;s both frizzy and curly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came home and read the reviews here, I&#x27;m SO glad I did. I will not be purchasing this product. Thank you all who cared enough to share your experience, my heart goes out to those who suffered from this product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS WHAT I EMAILED TO THE MANUFACTURER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a consumer,&lt;br /&gt;Very upset consumer. I purchased this item about 10 days ago and finally decided to use it last night, I followed all the instructions to the letter. I am very upset about the results, and cant even believe this item is on the market!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was so much alive and beautiful before. I decided to use this product to straighten my hair and make it beautiful and shiny so i would not have to deal with flat ironing it to calm frizz and such. I used this product for 15 mins, as I have died my hair dark brown a month ago. I followed all the directions with the keratin cuticle sealant and such. well after the first step my hair was messed up, i continued in hope that it would be better once i finish all of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY HAIR IS SO FRIED AND DEAD! I DID THIS YESTERDAY AND IT IS SO DEAD THAT MY HAIR WONT EVEN DRY- NOT EVEN WITH A BLOW DRYER! MY HAIR IS NOW 2 INCHES SHORTER, AND I CANT EVEN COMB OR BRUSH IT. I WORK FOR MARRIOTT HOTELS AND DON&#x27;T EVEN KNOW IF I CAN GO TO WORK UNLESS I DISH OUT 150 FOR A WIG!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WANT THIS TAKEN CARE OF OR IM GOING TO REPORT THIS TO BBB AND POSSIBLY LOOK INTO A CIVIL SUIT! I THINK THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE TAKEN OFF THE MARKET, AND DON&#x27;T EVEN TRY TO OFFER ME MY MONEY BACK BECAUSE THE 10.00 I PAID FOR THIS PRODUCT WONT EVEN HELP WITH THE EMOTIONAL PAIN, AND THE PAIN OF BEING EMBARRASSED IN PUBLIC! NOW I HAVE TO SPEND 100&#x27;S IN TRYING TO FIX MY HAIR OR PURCHASE A WIG SO I CAN SHAVE MY FREAKING HAIR OFF...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Victoria Lewis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am also posting this email to every website this product is on. because as i have seen i am not the only one this happened to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 4/27/12 @ 3:20&lt;br /&gt;I just got off the phone with them, they said they would mail a form and pass on my info with my dispute, but Ended the call before they could even get my Name, and Address.... really?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 4/27/12 @ 3:35&lt;br /&gt;they called back with for my information. they are gonna send me refund with coupons to use to fix my hair. also i will be sending back to them any cost receipts for everything i had to purchase to try and repair my hair, even will be refunded for a wig, if i purchase one and pictures of my hair for what happened to it./&gt;they called back with for my information. they are gonna send me refund with coupons to use to fix my hair. also i will be sending back to them any cost receipts for everything i had to purchase to try and repair my hair, even will be refunded for a wig, if i purchase one and pictures of my hair for what happened to it.</li>
            <li> I had seen this product at walmart awhile back and thought I wanted to try it but something was telling me not to. And then today I saw it again and almost bought it...and I&#x27;ll be going to Walmart again tonight so I was thinking about getting it, but I wanted to see reviews first....I am so happy I read these. I saw some review videos and those results were positive. But there&#x27;s more negative comments than positive. I will not be using this product. Just want to say thanks to everyone who took the time to write their review and that my heart goes out to y&#x27;all :( they definitely need to have this product taken off the shelf. I&#x27;m surprised no one has sued them yet?</li>
            <li> I bought this product after using a keratin treatment about 3 years ago. I followed the directions and about a minute and a half after I applied step one my hair start kinking up at a fast speed. I immediately tried rinsing it out. That did not work, It felt like there was Elmers glue in my hair. I shampooed and applied a conditioning treatment. That did not work either. My hair was then coming out in clumps. Literally clumps, about 10 of them and I did not even brush or comb it. I once again tried rinsing with baby shampoo. No change and my hair color went lighter. I tried my best to put a hat on and went to my salon. I now have 2 inches of hair. It completely fried my hair and it was not salvageable. I had blond straight hair about 3 inches below my shoulder. I now have 2 inches of blonde hair. Never touch this product.</li>
            <li> Well I just used this product yesterday. So far it looks great, I&#x27;m waiting to wash it out of my hair.  My hair type is naturally very coarse and thick and I hardly ever have done color or straiting minus the professional keratin treatments I&#x27;ve had in the past.  I&#x27;m sorry to hear so many people had such a bad experience with this product as mine turned out pretty well. I would definitely use this again as opposed to the $300 I&#x27;ve paid in the past for a professional treatment.</li>
            <li> I bought this last week and followed the instructions.  It has fried my hair!  I cannot believe this has not been taken off the market.  I wish I had read the reviews before trying.  I&#x27;ve had Keratin treatments in the past (last time 18 months ago) with excellent results.  This product has destroyed my hair!  The money I saved by buying this in the grocery store I am spending ten fold trying to repair the damage to my hair.  I have an appointment to cut most of my hair off.  I&#x27;ve had long hair most of my life -- the only way to salvage what this product has done is to cut it off and regrow it.  I&#x27;ve tried removing the glue-like substance with clarifying shampoo.  I&#x27;ve done multiple deep conditioning treatments.  It looks and feels like straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this and from all Suave products for that matter.  I am disgusted by the irreparable damage and the hundreds I&#x27;m having to pay to make my hair healthy again.</li>
            <li> After reading some of the experiences some of the woman had with this stuff, I almost hate to write a review that is praising it. I absolutely LOVE my hair after using this. It&#x27;s been about 4 months since I&#x27;ve colored my hair and overall my hair is really healthy. I have thick, curly (almost kinky) hair and straight iron it or curl it daily, until I used this product, that is. My hair tends to be extremely frizzy, especially if I blow dry it but after using Suave Smoothing treatment, I can just wash it and that&#x27;s about it. I do still use a curling iron to frame my bangs around my face but other than that it pretty much does exactly what I was looking for. I originally was looking up why I could only use it every 3 months and came across these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My heart truly goes out to the woman who had a bad experience with this... I can&#x27;t even begin to imagine....</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and hated it.  I ordered this product to try it.  I have to say that it is great.  This product worked fantastic and even if I don&#x27;t use my hair straightener my hair is still waive but not with all the curls.</li>
            <li> I should have been the perfect candidate for this.  My hair is completely wavy/loosely curled and virgin - never been colored, bleached, permed or treated before.  But when I tried to use this treatment on my hair a few nights ago, it had no effect whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions very precisely, and used a stopwatch at each interval to make sure I didn&#x27;t leave the products in for more than the recommended time.  The straightening cream had a very strong smell that lingered long after I had rinsed the cream out of my hair.  It&#x27;s been a few days, but every time I get my hair wet the smell comes back!  It&#x27;s really annoying.  It was easy to apply and non-irritating, but as far as I can tell it didn&#x27;t do anything for me, even in combination with the other products in the box.</li>
            <li> Wow... thank goodness I didnt buy this.  I am so sorry for everybody who did use it!  What could suave possibly do to change the fact that they lost their hair!  Suave, Ive always been dissappointed by your products, but this is unthinkable that youv ebeen making women bald like this.</li>
            <li> I am sorry for those who had to endure the awful experiences with this product and thankful you thought enough of others to post your reviews. You have probably saved many others from the nightmares you have experienced. I have always heard that Suave made reliable products. Apparently they no longer have the quality controls in place that they had in the past. Shame on you Suave upper management. I am so angry over their allowing this awful product on the market, I pledge to never buy another Suave product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not buy this product because of the revies and, again, I thank those of you who shared your nightmares.</li>
            <li> Shame on Suave,! I am right now in the process of trying to save a young lady&#x27;s hair who tried this at home. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair which I have not colored in at least two years. I have let it go grey. It has always been very curly so I keep the length long to help weigh it down a bit. I have a long layers hair style. However, with the grey hair it is much more course and frizzy now. I read through all the direction and didn&#x27;t find anything about grey hair having any trouble. I normally wash my hair at night, let it air dry overnight, then iron it in the morning. I was hoping this product would eliminate the ironing because I think it further dries out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I read all the directions and warnings very carefully after reading the reviews here. I felt I was a good prospect for the product. I followed the advice and smeared vaseline around the edge of where hair met skin and on my ears and neck. My step one was not nearly as smelly as others reported. It did have a slight \\&quot;perm\\&quot; smell to it. I have long hair well past my shoulders and didn&#x27;t use the entire bottle. I probably used about 2/3 of the bottle. I felt no burning or tingling on my scalp. I thought I was being so careful with all the directions, but then realized I forgot to put on the gloves. I did not have any ill effects from this. I let it process 22 minutes.  The cuticle sealer smelled better and the amount given is very generous. I used about 1/2 the bottle.  Everything else went per plan with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;The results were pretty good. Normally I cannot blow dry my hair and go out. But after using the treatment, I could do this. My hair was still pretty full (I followed directions and combed the hair back to keep the fullness on my crown per the directions) and not flat on top. I actually thought it would be straighter than it turned out. I had a little frizz towards the ends of the hair. I went ahead and flat ironed it and then it was very straight. I didn&#x27;t need to over-iron it, it was very straight with a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;I think after I wash in again in a few days, then blow dry it, I will have a better idea of the longetivity of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it four stars because my hair was still a bit frizzy although it was much better after blow drying than before I used the product. I am very sorry for the ladies that had terrible results, but for me it worked pretty well and I would try it again and maybe process for the entire 25 minutes.</li>
            <li> I can not believe how horrible this product is. I have told everyone I know to never use this ever. this product completely fried my hair and now I have to use a special conditioner and cannot do anything to it. My hair has never been this damaged. It lifted the color right out of my hair and it feels like an old broom.  I don&#x27;t want to damage it with heat but I have to flat iron it to make it look half way decent. I will be writing a letter to suave about my horrible experience. Ladies I suggest you get Nioxin scalp therapy it is working very well. I am also putting coconut oil in my hair everyday. I know that eventually I will have to get a hair cut! I hope that they realize the harm they are doing and take this off the shelves!</li>
            <li> This is not a keratin treatment. This is some sort of relaxer. I have chemical burns on my head and had to get 3 inches cut off. It even changed the color of my hair. Don&#x27;t do it. I wish I had read the reviews first.  I am adding to this review I guess 3 weeks later for those who have ruined their hair with this product... Go get the Redken extreme products they really helped salvage my God awful hair caused by Suave.</li>
            <li> I used this product a week ago. I had gone online and taken the quiz honestly and saw the product on sale so I bought it. Worst thing I could have ever done. I saw the product and thought it would be nice for me to treat my hair and give it a keratin treatment. What I did not know was that this product has a chemical straightener in it. I didnt know because it doesnt tell you on the box. No mention of relaxer or straightener. I had beautiful thick brown hair that I have always been very careful with. I try not to use any products that damage. I dont use hairspray or gel, I never blow dry and I only ever use the flat iron once a month and now I cant even brush it because it tears out. If the product works for you then great but please go into this knowing it is a chemical relaxer and by the way the part of the treatment with keratin also has large amounts of peroxide. I didnt know, I wish I had because it is costing me 420 dollars in conditioning treatments to get my hair to calm down and the cuticle to close so I dont loose all my hair. As it is I have lost enough that my hair is now thin and it has compromised the integrity of my hair. It will take years to fix this. I have filed a claim with Suave and they are going to \\&quot;see\\&quot; if they will pay the cost of my hair dresser. But I am devastated please dont use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has been 8 days. I have had my hair in a braid for 7 days and I have only used conditioner in the shower and I put in a good leave in every day. I have had two treatments of a deep conditioner and KPAX repair treatment at my salon and I have to have one more of each and then we are cutting it to my shoulders and we pray it wont break any further. Good luck to everyone who fell for the AD. Please call the number on the side of the box and open a claim the company might pay you back for any treatment you need to get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SPOKE WITH THE FDA THEY NEED US ALL TO COMPLAIN TO GET THE PRODUCT PULLED</li>
            <li> This product fried my hair. From the advertising, I thought it would be good thing--moisturizing and smoothing--but I didn&#x27;t read the fine print to see that it was basically a perm. I used the product exactly as it said I should, and overall, my hair is smoother. But I have about 2-3 inches of new split ends, and as my hair grows back, it has a kink in it so that I look like I have a buzz cut underneath the rest of my hair. I also lost a good amount of hair, and my hair was very healthy before this treatment. DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> My hair has a slight wave (and some frizz) yet is generally very healthy. I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try, since my hair gets too dry and unmanageable by using the flat iron on a regular basis. BTW&amp;lt; I followed directions very closely, since it was obvious (by the smell) that this was a heavy chemical going onto my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing, my hair was a bit sleeker (less frizz), yet as it dried it ended up looking the way it always does (!) absolutely NO difference. I had hoped that the situation would change for the better after washing my hair &amp; giving it a good conditioner (my hair is more dry than oily) but unfortunately that didn&#x27;t help either. I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in the texture of my hair, although my hair smelled just like it does after a perm (like rotten eggs) whenever it became moist (at the health club steam room, I could smell it underneath the towel I had my hair wrapped in, when I perspire after a bit of exercise, etc. I would not purchase this product again since it did not deliver what it promised. It is called \\&quot;keratin\\&quot; (which is a natural hair protein) but had NO keratin in it, that was an advertizing ploy I guess! 2 months after application, my hair is very dry &amp; a few shades lighter in color.</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;  I too have had a horrid issue with this product. I read all the warnings and did a little research. I am regretting now NOT looking here. I asked a Stylist about the product as well. Her exact words were \\&quot;It should work pretty well, I used it.\\&quot; Her hair was sleek and beautiful. I took that encouragement and ran. I bought the product and actually waited 3 days before I decided to use it. That was last night, I asked my fiancées assistance since I have never dyed my hair. Five years ago I did a straightening treatment and while it was sort of straight it wasn&#x27;t really. I assumed this would be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I read all the instructions very very carefully. I am really careful about my hair as I lost a lot of it when I was very sick as a teenager, I am vain about it now sadly. I did have some sun highlights from a summer of lots of sun and fishing on the lake. It was mostly out but I refused to dye my hair back. I do not do any sort of treatment to my hair besides conditioning as it was a tad dry. I went on and did the sample, near the crown of my head where the sun hits it and if it was messed up I could spare losing it. No issue really, was actually nice. I went ahead and did the whole head. . .  can you hear the dramatic horror music. As I was following the instructions I saw my hair was actually KINKING up. I was actually scared, to the point my hands were shaking. My fiancée assured me it will be okay. I never having done this sort of thing (or SEEN this sort of thing) trusted him (hey Suave maybe a WARNING if hair start to kink up REMOVE PRODUCT.) I, as well combed from my crown back. I was careful about not rubbing into my scalp. When it came to wash the product out it took time as my hair actually started to MAT up. I looked like a neglected DOG. I sat on the side of the tub, hands shaking. I went ahead and continued with the sealing cream thinking it would calm it. It did get the mats out of my hair and smoothed it, but only as long as the product was on my hair. I finished as instructed with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  As I was drying my hair, I saw a very scary amount of hair coming out. I stopped and really looked. ALL the hair around the top of my head, around my face and under was breaking, falling out, and felt like. . .  wet yarn. It was kinked, horrid, and crackling like tissue paper to touch. When I showed my house mate (a woman who has colored her hair many times) her jaw dropped in horror. Then and there I burst into sobs. I have, I should say HAD, beautiful shoulder length hair. I grow it out to donate to locks of love. I have done this ever since I mastered a very dangerous illness and I remember how it felt to be in school and have no hair. I donate my hair so other children do not have to go through this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  My poor fiancée had to hold me while I sobbed my eyes out and made myself physically ill over the massive amount of hair I lost. When I called the shop where I bought the kit they said I could not returned the used product and I ought to contact the company, but I cannot seem to get answers. As of today I had to go to a salon and have my hair cut. I now look like a boy. I have a huge event next week for the Veterans Medical Center and I am horrified at my look. I cannot miss the event, and have to make the best out of a bad situation. The longest part of my hair now rests at the base of my neck where before it fell to just about my shoulder blades. I not only paid for this product but had to pay the salon to repair the damage. The only way to fix the fried hair, was to cut it off. She suggested I use special healing shampoos and conditioners to keep my hair from getting worse. She did use a special shampoo and it did help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  So, ladies who work, girls going to school. Please read the advise, and don&#x27;t do this. I have lost at least 3 inches of hair, and now have a hair cut that would have been all the rage in maybe the 70&#x27;s. I guess I will have to either spendmore money to get a wig to hide the places where my hair is now thin, or wear a lot of hats. This was the biggest mistake. I doubt I have seen the last of it either. I blog, I am a writer of sorts. I am also a make up artist, I will be warning all my clients, all my readers, and anyone who will listen what this product does, and how they treat their customers. Also, as my fiancée is a photographer we will be spreading the word to all major shoots, clients, models, and other MUA&#x27;s in the industry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Also if Suave wants proof, I can send them the hair the FELL out while using their product. This was just what I got out of my brush not the clumps that went down the drain. Suave, I used to love your products, cheep, got my hair clean, and now I really am disappointed in you. I doubt I will ever use anything you make again, be it hair, body, or anything of the sort. Shame on you, shame on you.</li>
            <li> I will make this short. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. If you really want your hair straightened get it done professionally. This product is the reason I had to cut off 5 inches of my hair. I am familiar with keratin treatments as I&#x27;ve had them done before. This is NOT that. It is perm solution! I left the product on for half the time it recommended because my hair was literally melting off in chunks. When I rinsed it out and tried to comb my hair my hair started to stretch like a rubber band. I&#x27;ve never has such a horrible experience. Despite following the instructions to the very detail I literally lost half my hair. NOT WORTH THE RISK.</li>
            <li> I tried this kit for the 1st time over 3 weeks ago. It does smell like a perm. I have colored hair and it did lighten my hair - bleached out some of the color. I did re-color my hair about a week later which helped, but then the color started to bleach out again. Right after I used the kit my hair did seem pretty dry and damaged - but it sure was straight. I had mixed feelings at first because my hair seemed to be rather damaged, but that seemed to get better after a few days of conditioning. My hair has continued to dry straight and stay straight throughout the day which was my goal. During humidity my hair fuzzes, gets weird waves and curls and is frustrating - my style doesn&#x27;t last 5 minutes on a humid day. However, with this kit, when I blow dry my hair and style it - it stays how I styled it no matter the weather. I am using a round brush to shape it and the curling iron just to give it a little body and feather it back, but no more fuzzing or strange bang curls in every direction, etc.. I am finding I do not have to shampoo very often - probably every 5 days or so - I just rinse well in the shower daily and condition well. Sometimes I use the keratin conditioner, sometimes a moisturizing conditioner. I would recommend strand testing if you are concerned. My hair is fine and did dry out some at first. I am happy with the results - just wish they could find a way to make it a bit less damaging. Might use it again, but maybe won&#x27;t leave in as long. My hair is continuing to be straight over 3 weeks later, which is great - and we have been having a lot of rain and humidity. All in all pretty satisfied but may not be for everyone - depends on your hair type and your expectations I guess. Not magic, but for someone who has always wanted straighter hair it fits the bill.</li>
            <li> This product was a disaster. It completely ruined my hair, much like the other reviews here. My hair was down to my shoulders. I had been growing it out for quite some time and was actually quite proud of it. The only thing I wanted to change were the few patches of waves in the back, so I decided to use this product. I thought it would be healthier if I did not have to use my flat iron every day (ha!). The first step went fine, but as I was washing out the second I noticed my hair coming out as I ran my fingers through it. This was only after a few minutes, I did not leave it on for the full time once I noticed the damage was happening. Upon reading these other reviews I suppose I was lucky to not have a ton of hair fall out, only a few handfuls, and not enough to leave any bald spots (my hair was previously quite thick anyway). As soon as I got out of the shower, panicking of course, I saw that the hair I still had had lost all of its color, was VERY dry, brittle and breaking. It was horrible, like straw. The following day I went out and spend an obscene amount of money on professional hair care products (deep conditioners, etc). I waited a few days to see any improvement, but the hair just kept breaking. After about a week of being miserable with the mess of hair I was left with, I resigned myself to going to the salon for a substantial hair cut. The stylist was in shock over how badly my hair had been damaged and after cutting the majority of it off in a boyish style was still not able to remove all of the damage. I was left with a small tuft of dry unmanageable hair and I left the salon in tears. What I was left with was so bad that I actually went out and purchased a wig. I am NOT kidding. It has been roughly six weeks since this whole ordeal and I am still sad to wake up to my short damaged hair. It has gotten slightly softer through the use of expensive protein treatments and naturally growing out about an inch, but the overall condition of my hair is awfuland I wish I had never given this product a second glance on the shelf. I cannot believe it is still available. For a quick fix I ended up spending hundreds of dollars and completely lost my confidence with the loss of my long, beautiful hair. I don&#x27;t even want to hear from Suave if all they are going to do is send me coupons for their company. At the very least, they have definitely lost me as a customer.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before trying this product but decide to go for it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I died my hair dark brown about 6 months ago but haven&#x27;t done anything since. I was hoping this product would help cut down on my frizzies and the poofieness of my hair. I read all the warnings and instructions and then got started.&lt;br /&gt;Within 2 minutes of applying the smoothing cream my hair was fried. I applied it while looking into a mirror and saw the tiny frizzy curls starting all over my head. I rinsed my hair immediately but it was too late. My hair is completely wrecked. My hair has never been this damaged before. I&#x27;m going to have to cut it all off :( so much for trying to grow my hair out. I should have listened to all the other warnings. This product is absolutely horrible. A keratin treatment should not kill your hair 2 minutes after being applied.</li>
            <li> I own every product from the keratin line EXCEPT the 30 min boxed treatment set. Why do I not own that set? I do not own that set because it specifically states that basically if you have ever had any kind of chemical treatment on your hair EVER DO NOT USE THAT PRODUCT!! That includes: Highlights, color, perms etc. It also states to contact a... professional before using. Now you tell me why in the heck  people starting a \\&quot;class action lawsuit\\&quot; for others because their \\&quot;hair fell out\\&quot; Your hair can fall out using ANYTHING. It all depends on what you are allergic too your hair individually. Let me also state that i came close to buying it anyways but thought its not worth hurting my hair over and i will go by what the company says! Heres the kicker....I guarantee you that the people that used this and had issues have had something done to their hair already OR they left the product on too long. Seriously how many woman now days have not done some kind of chemical treatment to their hair? NOT MANY. I know they are out there ....I just hate that we live in a world were everyone wants to sue over everything under the sun. Like the 3million lawsuit with Nutella the lady said the company claimed it was healthy...she knew better! She just tried to find a way to sue adn she won! This is what im getting at..don&#x27;t ruin a companies image because you couldnt go by the directions! Now if you did go by the directions and you have never had any chemical on your head and you left it on the time stated then i would contact suave and let them know..but don&#x27;t lie about it! alright people that&#x27;s all.&lt;br /&gt;So i&#x27;ll say it again.  Suave would not put this product out there if it does not work.  You know they have tested it on peoples heads already and seen the results..they are not going to put it out there if it burned everyones heads or their hair fell out...that would be bad press...this company has been around long enough they know whats good.&lt;br /&gt;GO BUY DIRECTIONS...THEY ARE ON THEBOX FOR A REASON&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE EVER HAD ANY CHEMICALS ON YOUR HEAD SUCH AS A PERM, HIGHLIGHTS, COLOR, STRAIGHTENERS ETC&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT LEAVE ON MORE THEN TIME STATED ON BOX!</li>
            <li> I cannot believe what did this to my hair. It&#x27;s FRIED. It&#x27;s DAMAGED, BROKEN, I did not even last 10 minutes!I was supposed to leave it on for 20! As I started combing this solution i noticed my hair was &#x27;STRETCHING&#x27; with the comb provided. I then grabbed my thick detangling comb and it had a lot of hair on it whenever i tried to run it through my hair. I immediately rinsed this product out, but my hair felt weird, it was sort of rough but also really slimy feeling, in some parts. The product smells like a RELAXER. I did not need a relaxer, I wanted a smoothing treatment. This smells just like a relaxer that is being neutralized, from the get go. As I rinsed out the product there was a significant amount of hair in the drain, more than ever. I tried to blow dry it but the hair had a slimy feel to it, it was also straight looking, my hair is usually curly. I seemed to have a hard time blow drying it. It was as if the water wasn&#x27;t evaporating out of it properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am glad I did not go sit somewhere to wait out the 20 minutes because I would&#x27;ve had a bald head. This product must have a miniscule amount of Keratin in order to allow it to advertise it as a Keratin infusion, but THIS IS NOT A KERATIN TREATMENT OR ANYTHING REMOTELY LIKE IT. I was not expecting a $15 keratin treatment but I was expecting nice, smooth hair that would last \\&quot;30 days\\&quot;. Now some of us are lucky if we even have hair left. This product surprisingly does not even mention proper ventilation. My hair is looking quite frazzled. I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone except the guy in the commercial and the girl on the cover of the box, and whomever came up with this stupid thing. I&#x27;d like to see them try this concoction. It&#x27;s almost like putting a depilatory cream on your hair. You&#x27;ve been warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition the FDA can be contacted; If you have any concerns about a cosmetic, contact MedWatch, FDA&#x27;s problem-reporting program, on the Web or at 1-800-332-1088; or contact the consumer complaint coordinator in your area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you contact FDA, include the following information in your report:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the name and contact information for the person who had the reaction;&lt;br /&gt;the age, gender, and ethnicity of the product&#x27;s user;&lt;br /&gt;the name of the product and manufacturer;&lt;br /&gt;a description of the reaction--and treatment, if any;&lt;br /&gt;the healthcare provider&#x27;s name and contact information, if medical attention was provided; and&lt;br /&gt;when and where the product was purchased.&lt;br /&gt;And be sure to give the age, gender, and ethnicity of the person who had the reaction, says FDA scientist Wendy Good, Ph.D. Good, who analyzes reports about problems with cosmetics, says that information is important because it can help scientists spot trends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a consumer report is received, FDA enters the information into a database of negative reactions. Experts then look for reports related to the same product or similar ones.

            <li> I tried this product because so many salon clients were asking about it.  It is a disastrous product that damages the hair terribly and lifts your color.  My hair was very healthy and now it is so dry and frazzled no amount of oil or serum will make it look okay. It has coated my scalp with a residue that isnt coming off with scrubbing and triple shampooing.  My scalp is now sore and irritated and I know it will takes months to repair:(  Please spread the word on how harmful this product is!</li>
            <li> I tried this product, not really expecting much in terms of results, as I have fine, natural curly hair which frizzes at the smallest hint of humidity or moisture in the air. I normally use one of the \\&quot;anti-frizz\\&quot; clear gels on my hair right after I wash it, but, it is tricky to get it right--too little and there is no improvement in the frizz department, and, too much, and it can be sticky and weigh down my already fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions, and applied the Keratin treatment. It was very simple to apply. When done, I did not apply the anti-frizz gel, as I wanted to see the result from this treatment by itself. I was pleased. When it dried, my hair felt smoother, and was very shiny. I noticed less frizz, but, really did not expect miracles in that department, as mother nature can be tough. My fine hair strands felt slightly thicker and stronger. To get the results I want, I am going to go back to the anti-frizz gel, but I will probably have to use less, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a decent product that I would purchase again. Is it as good as a salon keratin treatment? I can&#x27;t properly judge, as I have never had a treatment in a salon, but my educated guess is, probably not. Still, for the price and the convenience, I would recommend that women with problem hair give it a try, as they may be surprised with the results.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking \\&quot;yeah finally a keratin treatment I can do myself\\&quot;. I&#x27;ve had professional keratin treatments my friend works at a salon but I always have to pay more than $10 so I was thinking sure why not try it..it couldnt hurt right? WRONG! I read the box I haven&#x27;t had anything done to my hair besides it being dyed a shade darker in the past well it doesnt say anything against that and I wondered why it would matter at all keratin treatments are made to help your hair regaurdless I went on to use it..then I should have noticed that it smelled horrible like perm or relaxer..hmm I&#x27;ve never had a treatment smell like that but I still keep it on for a little while I didn&#x27;t even keep it on the whole 15 minutes (for my hair type) and washed it out my hair was so tangly so not normal for me. Then I realized all of the hair that was in the shower from my hair breaking off!! My ends are so dry and split its horrible! I am so upset I called and complained because I&#x27;ve worked so hard at growing my hair out now to have it fried! And now reading others reviews I see that it actually is a relaxer for if you were to have like really cury hair or african american hair which I do not! I didn&#x27;t want to relax my hair just make it in better condition not worse, why couldn&#x27;t I have read these reviews before I did it! I&#x27;ll never buy anything again unless its from the salon!</li>
            <li> I regret using this product.  I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s just bad or if I wanted to believe something that wasn&#x27;t there.  It&#x27;s labeled all over as a \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; kit, which to me sort of means \\&quot;anti-frizz.\\&quot;  The directions did seem to imply that the product would make your hair straighter.  That wasn&#x27;t really what I wanted, but it also says it&#x27;s a \\&quot;30 day\\&quot; kit, which to me means \\&quot;temporary.\\&quot;  So I thought it was worth a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terrible results.  It killed the natural curls in my hair without smoothing anything.  The ends especially were completely brittle and more frizzy than ever.  I hoped a couple of shampoos would improve the situation, still believing that this was temporary.  Two days after using this, I decided to have about 4 or 5 inches chopped off the ends of my hair.  That helped a bit.  It&#x27;s now been about three months since I used this and my hair is still less curly than it had been, but the normal texture seems to be coming back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hated this, but I admit that&#x27;s mostly because it didn&#x27;t do what I wanted.  I&#x27;m not sure whether or not it did what it was supposed to do.  If you&#x27;re actually looking for something to straighten your hair, maybe this would work.  Based on some other reviews though, I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d risk it.</li>
            <li> I was excited about this since my hair is very thin and shows frizz easily. After using this I wanted to cry. My hair at the roots is smooth and soft for about an inch and then it turns into a frizzy tangled mess that poofs away from my face. I was pulling out clumps and clumps of hair. DO NOT BUY!!! WILL RUIN YOUR HAIR!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on Sunday and had a pretty bad experience with it in terms of scalp pain, hair breakage and hair loss.  I have long blonde hair, which I straighten but do not color treat.  Not the healthiest hair in the world, but also would not describe it as damaged.  I had a real Keratin treatment in a salon 6 weeks prior and loved the result.  Since its safe to get the Keratin treatment I received every 30 days, I thought this would be a nice transition or pick-me-up from my salon treatment.  I was wrong, it&#x27;s not the same type of a treatment, rather its a treatment meant to mimic the results of a keratin treatment.  I&#x27;m usually pretty anal about the products I buy, but didn&#x27;t really look too closely at the ingredients to confirm it was the same.  Anyhow, applied according to package directions and washed out in the same day after experiencing scalp pain.  I contacted customer service and I have to say, am very happy with their response and concern for what happened.  Anyone who has had a negative experience should contact them.</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolute garbage! What the heck were they thinking when they put it on the market? Maybe their intentions were to sabotage all womens beautiful hair or something. I should have known better as soon as I smelled the strong chemical smell of the product. I totally wish I would have atleast read the reviews.. :( now I as well am among the numerous female victims of this horrid crap. I followed the directions precisely, and none of the precautions applied to me.. So Suave please tell me why about 40% of my hair has broken off and my head is now  covered with bald spots!! I want more then just my money back, I want justice and my damn hair back! please if you&#x27;re smart enough to do what I failed to do I hope u read the reviews on this crap and do not buy it... :( it really needs to be pulled asap!!!</li>
            <li> i used this product because i knew people who had really damaged hair who used the product and their hair came out amazing, so i figured why not, my hair is really healthy. i used the product and it worked but turned my hair red. i called and complained and all the women told me was there is a warning on the paper that comes with the product(i re-read it a few times, there is not) and its the peroxide in the second step that did this to me. im a 21 year old women, my hair means everything to me. i normally have gorgeous black hair and  now im stuck with red hair. it looks horrible and being told im stuck like this for a week nearly killed me. i dont know what to do, im sick to my stomach and dont want to leave my house. this product doesnt belong on the shelf! im going to be stuck in my house for a week cause of what this product did and im sure im not the only one feeling this way right now. this product needs to go back to the factory and no longer made. save yourself the 12 bucks and dont bother. you are better off straighening it every day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY SUAVE KERATIN TREATMENT!</li>
            <li> Saw this product presented on Dr. Oz.&lt;br /&gt;My hair fit all the direction&#x27;s condition, in that it hadn&#x27;t had a perm for months, no coloring for years.  My hair is below the shoulder, white/gray.  It has always been frizzy at the shoulder and the edges of my face.  I&#x27;d use a curling iron on it to smooth it out, but that may have made my hair frizzier as time went on.&lt;br /&gt;I read the directions several times over several days, as they are complicated, and one has to be exact with the directions.&lt;br /&gt;Finally was ready to do it.  Got a timer to ensure the duration was correct.&lt;br /&gt;Followed the directions.  The few splatters I made didn&#x27;t seem to discolor the towel around my shoulders or the counter top or rugs on the floor, all which I wiped up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I had one little sore on my head, and the lotion stung it, and it lasted about a minute.&lt;br /&gt;After the first treatment, my hair felt like straw - it felt awful.  Then I put the second bottle on.&lt;br /&gt;My hair came out smooth!  It looks like the commercials of beautiful hair on tv models!  People at zumba class today commented on how nice my hair looked.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a third bottle for use with a blow dryer for following shampooings, but I don&#x27;t have a hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I used half of the first two bottles, and will use it again after September when my hair gets frizzy again.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy about the results.</li>
            <li> Horrible product. Completely ruined my hair. Followed instructions perfectly and usage resulted in hair loss and breakage. DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> I just finished using this product &amp; I followed the directions very clearly! Im done now &amp; just the front of my hair &amp; ends are brittle, wirey, &amp; falling out as I comb it! Idk what I may have done wrong or its just my hair was so damaged but the back of my hair is staying straight when it usually curls! So Im not sure what to rate it really because its doing half the job it supposed to other than my ends &amp; some strands in the front are damaged!!</li>
            <li> This product has ruined my hair.  I was so excited to try the product.  Although I color my hair it is still pretty healthy.  I thought the Suave Keratin would just improve my style.  I used the product per instruction.  I had my suspensions when the \\&quot;Keratin Infusion\\&quot; smelled like a hair permanent.  After rinsing I noticed my hair felt like it was melted.  I continued with the other steps per instruction, hoping this was normal.  My hair is now a frizzy mess.  It is very embarrassing everyone ask what the \\&quot;heck\\&quot; happened to you hair???  I am spending a fortune trying to find a products to tame the frizz.  I guess I am just going to have my already short hair cut even shorter. Very disappointed.  Wish you all the best of luck with the product.[[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]]</li>
            <li> I was really curious about this product. I get the keratin treatment or Japanese style straight perm whenever I&#x27;m in asia. The salons there are really good at those techniques. Anyway, I thought that if Suave came out with a simplified system that give similar effects as those expensive treatments, I want to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after reading other Amazonian review, it seems a lot of reviewers say this product is very damaging. Some people have broken hair. Some people are losing their hair. Alas, I love my hair too much to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say to use this product, you have to devote some time to read the instructions carefully and to understand and perform all the steps. It&#x27;s a more involved process than just an at-home hair-coloring treatmnet. Also the warnings on the directions pamphlet were enough to deter me from trying. Too scary!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m chickening out, but I wish others the best of luck!</li>
            <li> I just saw a commercial on tv for this product.  So I came here to read reviews after taking the Suave \\&quot;take this quiz\\&quot; about the Keratin kit.  It said I had to wait 14 days before using it, and I was confused.  I have untreated hair and was just looking for something to make it smoother.  AFter reading all the reviews here that had 1 star, I am beyond horrified that this product is still being marketed by Suave.  I want to thank all the reviewers who took the time to write their stories, and my heart goes out to all of them.  I have had bad experiences with salons in the past and with certain products, but nothing like what these poor people have gone through.  Suave should be ashamed to market such a product.</li>
            <li> I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing and USING this product. I read the freakish scary warnings and they did not apply to me and I thought, huh I would love to have nice smooth shiny hair so I bought it. I was very excited about the product and I got ready to use it. The first step smells awful maybe I should have stopped then and I am no newcomer to hair treatments. I followed the directions to a T and after the last step and last rinse I was excited to see how my \\&quot;new\\&quot; hair looked. I took out my round brush and my blowdryer and about a minute in I wanted to cry. Not only was my hair completely fried and ruined, puffy, unmanageable, HORRIBLE looking but it was also falling out in clumps. I has been about two weeks since I did the treatment and my hair is STILL FALLING OUT. Every time I comb my hair the comb is full of hair, like FULL of hair! When I shower lots of hair falls out then too. I can&#x27;t wear my hair down I have to put it up in a pony tail and even then I HAVE to straighten it or it looks clownish. I am so disappointed with this product I have always loved suave&#x27;s products but this should be taken off the market IMMEDIATELY.  I am so embarrassed that I don&#x27;t even want to go out in public and it will cost me a fortune to get my hair \\&quot;fixed\\&quot; if they can even fix it and I have had to chop a lot of my hair off. Terrible product, DO NOT USE!</li>
            <li> I wa thank the people who took the time to write reviews on the Suave Smoothing Kit.  I have been back and forth on deciding to use this product and have now decided against it due to the horrific stories.  That is what I was afraid would happen and I am taking your advice. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have really coarse, thick hair and this product worked well, but it felt like it weighed it down some. When I loaned it to a friend with wavy hair it worked better for her. Her hair is less coarse and not quite is thick. I think the key thing to do is to use as little product as possible. When I did this it worked better, but I still feel like my hair had too much product in it.</li>
            <li> OMG!  I put this on my hair and it completely broke off my hair!  I put it on and starting combing it as instructed and it started curling my hair (you know how you curl a bow with scissors!).  As I combed through it, my hair started breaking off and it turned some of my highlights white.  Terrible, terrible product.  I jumped in the shower but it was too late.  The damage was done!  DO NOT PURCHASE!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED. I GOT THIS TO SMOOTH OUT MY HAIR AND MAKE IT SOFT AND SHINY LIKE THE PICTURE SHOWS. MY HAIR IS SO DAMAGED NOW THAT IT IS JUST FALLING OFF. IT ALL HAS TO BE CHOPPED. ITS SO SO SO BAD. I CANT EVEN EMPHASIZE HOW MUCH THIS PRODUCT SHOULD NOT BE USED. IM IN SHOCK, ANGRY, HYSTERICAL. I HAD BOY SHORT HAIR ONE YEAR AGO AND NOW TO GET ALL THE DAMAGE OFF, I WILL HAVE TO GO BACK TO THAT. ITS NOT WORTH IT!! AND FORGET \\&quot;BLOW DRYING IT\\&quot; AT THE END! NO HEAT IS ALLOWED NEAR MY HEAD AT THIS MINUTE SO I DONT DO FURTHER DAMAGE. WORST PRODUCT IVE EVER USED.</li>
            <li> My 17 year old daughter used this produce (thinking that it was a deep conditioning treatment).  It literally destroyed her hair!  She had beautiful, full hair down past the middle of her back -- this treatment burned half of it off (up to her shoulders)... just weeks before prom and graduation!  She was beyond devastated!  Please do not use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had used Suave products for most of my life and I really trusted the brand.  When the customer service rep. said the company would refund the purchase price (whooppeee... I&#x27;ve spent hundreds of dollars on a hair weave to replace her fried hair)- and would include coupons for other Suave products- all I could do was laugh!  We won&#x27;t be purchasing Suave products anytime soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, whatever you do- don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> It ruined my hair, it was so dry and frizzy. My hair felt like a horses tail, I couldn&#x27;t even get a comb through it or even my fingers, if you care about your hair spend the money and let the professionals handle it! Do not use this product, I repeat do not use this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> ***WARNING***    ***PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT BUYING OR USING THIS PRODUCT!***    If you haven&#x27;t already read \\&quot;T. Arnold&#x27;s\\&quot; review (12.2.11) of this product here, I strongly suggest you do.  Be sure read the responses to her review starting from the newest first (using the sort function).  It&#x27;s become a discussion thread of sorts.    If you&#x27;re still not convinced that this product is **NOT SAFE** to use, I urge to visit this Facebook page (see link below) for more stories and information.  This page is an extension of the aforementioned Amazon review.  Even if you have taken the \\&quot;quiz\\&quot; that Suave has provided in order to see if this product is right for you, and the results are positive, it more than likely ISN&#x27;T!  From the information I&#x27;ve gathered, unless your hair is \\&quot;virgin\\&quot; hair, and I mean truly virgin hair - never had any processing, etc. - the chances of producing true keratin treatment results are slim.    This is marketed as a \\&quot;keratin smoothing treatment,\\&quot; but there is very little keratin mixed with the abundance of harsh chemicals - it&#x27;s one of the last on the exhaustive list of ingredients.  The chemical mixture is nothing more than an old school **RELAXER** containing similar chemicals to those found in archaic relaxers and perm kits that your mother or grandmother used from decades ago.  (Picture James Brown or Little Richard&#x27;s hair - an old \\&quot;conk\\&quot; hairstyle obtained by using those kinds of lye-based concoctions.  Or perhaps you&#x27;ve seen a scene from a movie -there are many- where a man is in a barber shop yelling and squirming in their seats with that white gunk burning their scalps begging the barber to get it off!)  More importantly, the kit is devoid of any neutralizing agent, which is one of its biggest flaws!  The description of this product is misleading at best!  To learn more about what exactly you would be putting in your hair, visit the FB page for a comprehensive list of chemicals.    You can also learn more about exactly whatall those \\&quot;concerned\\&quot; Suave/Unilever representatives&#x27; responses to the negative Amazon reviews you might have read are all about, and exactly what they have and haven&#x27;t done for the few who were able to actually communicate with them.  If nothing else, they are amusing.    The damage that has been done to hundreds of people&#x27;s hair is IRREVERSIBLE.  Once you start to feel the BURNING sensation just minutes into the application, that horrific suffocating ODOR, or when you can see your hair MELTING and CLUMPING up, and BREAKING or FALLING OUT, you can&#x27;t frantically quickly rinse or shampoo it out to make it stop - the damage is done, and it will only take minutes!  While it&#x27;s still wet you might burst into tears when you see the nasty CLUMPS of hair that you know just by looking at it are going to MELT right into your hand when you run your fingers through it (see pictures on FB).  What you might be left with once it&#x27;s dried is a ***BRITTLE, BURNT, CRISPY FRIED MESS*** .  You may have several inches of hair fallen at your feet on your bathroom or shower floor during and after you&#x27;re done, or on the floor of a salon because you had to PAY someone to cut off  the 3, 4, or for some, even 6 to 8 inches of DEAD HAIR!  And again, from what I&#x27;ve been told by professionals, the damage could potentially have a lasting effect even after your new hair does grow back.    There is A LOT of new information on this FB page!  It&#x27;s become a great resource for many, and a place to go if you just need to vent, or at the very least find a little comfort in knowing you&#x27;re not alone.    There are many new horror stories (unfortunately), and a section in which people are sharing info about what they&#x27;ve done to try and \\&quot;fix\\&quot; their hair, mitigate the damage, tips on when to shampoo, what to use (i.e. using a sulfate free shampoo!!!), what NOT to do or use, long-term aftercare, etc.  There are also some sympathetic professionals (not affliated w/Unilever) who are following the page, and contributing their opinions and advice.  Again, it&#x27;s excellent resource and people are posting daily.    Whether you are thinking of trying this product (BUT PLEASE DON&#x27;T), or you&#x27;ve been *BURNED* by it (LITERALLY!), you must go there!    If you&#x27;re still willing to take the risk, than be sure that you&#x27;re also willing to sport a bob or a pixie cut this summer, able to creatively cover up bald patches, or can afford to pay the hundreds of dollars to a correction specialist/stylist at a reputable salon.    Lastly, think about this... Keratin treatments in salons cost hundreds if dollars.  And there is good reason for the cost, not to mention why real keratin smoothing/straightening processes are done by *professionals* in salons...    WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU&#x27;LL BE GETTING FOR *TWELVE BUCKS*?!    [...] (no spaces)    [...] (no spaces)    or... Facebook search for \\&quot;Suave Keratin Infusion Kit Destroyed MY HAIR\\&quot;    No one is profiting from this page.  It exists for very simple reasons:  To sincerely express empathy and sympathy, to **SPARE YOU THE EMOTIONAL AND PHYSICAL PAIN, TRAUMA, and HUMILIATION**  they&#x27;ve endured, and to help you through it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to write a review of this product because there are so many negative reviews and I had really positive results. I think it totally depends on your hair type. I have thick, wavy hair that is very healthy (not chemically processed, dyed, regularly cut). I used this product at Thanksgiving 2011. I got so many compliments on my hair especially the month after I used it. I am a teacher and all my students were commenting on my hair as well as all the other staff at the school. It made it so easy to do my hair. When you use the product, it has a very bad smell. It is also very time-consuming. I would set aside at least one hour for this process. I feel really badly because so many people had bad experiences with it, but I&#x27;m not sure why mine would work so well and other people would have bald spots, etc. I just wanted to present a review from the other perspective because this did great things for my hair. After I used it, my hair smelled great every day for at least one month. I&#x27;m at the 3 month mark, and my hair has started returning to it&#x27;s wild state, and I just purchased this kit again to use it. Be very, very careful about the warnings on the side of the box- there are many. You&#x27;re not supposed to use it if you&#x27;re hair&#x27;s been colored, treated chemically, etc. That said, I would also follow their directions of testing it on one small spot (I tested mine on the flyaway pieces on the back of my head so that if something happened I&#x27;d be able to cover it easily).  I say proceed with caution. Ask your hairdresser if they think your hair is up to it. Mine said yes and I had better results with this $12 kit than the $35 hot oil treatment at my salon.</li>
            <li> The packaging on this product is very misleading.  As others have pointed out, it&#x27;s more of a home permanent than a 30-day \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; kit.  The \\&quot;30-day\\&quot; blurb implies that this is something that will wear off.  Well I used it a few weeks ago, following the instructions to a T.  My thin, fine hair is now dry and fried--much like after a bad perm--and permanently altered.  A bit of wave is back, but the damage remains.  When I wash it, no matter how much conditioner I add, it feels strange and stiff, and looks awful when dried.  I&#x27;ve tried a few damage repair products, but it&#x27;s pretty obvious that the only remedy will be to get a short cut and wait for healthy hair to grow back.  This should be clearly advertised for what it is--A HOME PERM.  And one that sucks, at that.  Given the overwhelming negative response I imagine that at this point Suave is waiting for what&#x27;s on the shelves to sell out, and will stop marketing it.</li>
            <li> I hesitated about trying this product. I&#x27;ve had professional keratin treatments in the past and, although I loved that I had less frizz, I still had to work to make my curly hair smooth (not stick straight). The last time I had a pro treatment was last summer, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed the directions very carefully, minding all of the warnings given. I am a natural redhead, but put in a temporary rinse 2 weeks ago making my hair a darker shade of red ( no highlighting at all). I am very happy with the final results, but still have to work at smoothing my hair with a  large curling iron. I definitely have less frizz and volume. The only real complaint I have is that this treatment totally stripped the rinse I had put in and lightened my hair a few notches. I will do another temp color next week as directions state to wait at least a week to color after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this is a decent product if your hair is in decent shape. I strongly suggest you stay away from it if your hair is highlighted or lifted - which is stated in the directions.</li>
            <li> I actually followed the first two steps. I don&#x27;t do much to my hair on a daily basis and was finding it to be a little dry so I thought I would try this product. I did the first step as directed and then followed with the second step, it was late at night so I decided to skip the third step and wait for morning. In the am I woke up to hair that was way more flatten than my normal chaotic hair in the mornings...I have thick coarse hair, a lot of it! and I usually like the flat iron look...my hair was way more manageable in the morning so I flat iron it...it looks amazing! I used the third step of the kit and my hair looks amazing and it&#x27;s so smooth I love it!! The only con is that I can&#x27;t use it again for 3 months :(</li>
            <li> I am so mad at myself for not reading these reviews before using this product.  I too read and followed the directions.  I do not have permed, highlighted or bleached hair.  This product has ruined my hair.  Completely fried it.  I applied the treatment on Thursday and immediately after drying it knew that I was in trouble.  I hoped that waiting the suggested 48 hours to shampoo would somehow magically fix it or at the very least calm the frizziness.  Nope.  So that day (Saturday) I went in search of a professional stylist for some help.  After a deep conditioning treatment and having 3 inches cut off I do not look any better.  Just shorter hair and $70.00 down the toilet.  Still looks like someone set fire to my hair.  I have been growing out my layers to have all of my hair one length and this just ruined my progress.  I can&#x27;t believe that Suave has this on the drugstore shelves.  It needs to be taken off the market asap.  I have used Suave products for a long time but they have definately lost a customer.  I will never buy anything from Suave again.</li>
            <li> I usually avoid reading others&#x27; reviews until after I&#x27;ve tried a product, but this time was an exception.  I read the instructions and got ready to try the Keratin Infusion Kit, but then I read the long lists of ingredients. . . three lists of chemicals I knew nothing about except that their names would be difficult to read aloud.  Then I read the reviews.  Clearly this is a \\&quot;use it at your own risk\\&quot; sort of product.  If you&#x27;ve colored your hair, you should skip it.  And that was only one reason to skip it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, given the bad reactions of some users and the list of unpronounceable ingredients, I&#x27;m giving this one a pass.  After all, frizzy curls beat no hair every time.</li>
            <li> When I requested this as part of the Amazon Vine Program, I was VERY excited. But between ordering it and getting it, I had a BAD experience with my normal hair dye and my hair lightened greatly, so heading the warnings, I knew I could not use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends&#x27; daughter has hair that is curlier/frizzier/thicker than mine (age has some benefit here)and it takes her FOREVER with a flat iron, so we sent it over to her, for her to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before she could use the product, we all read the reviews and decided a sample section of hair would be the best things to do. So with her mom&#x27;s help, she pulled most of her hair up, and tried a sample section that would lay underneath her normal hair, in case things went bad.After the long process, even for the section, we all waited with anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, all she really got was what a great beautician can get from her hair with a good straight blow out and great flat iron. is it less frizzy? Yes, but only if you really look close can you tell. I;m not sure how the models got their&#x27;s that way. Is it alot flatter? No. Status of her hair- DRY and nOT soft, like you get with flat ironing! How well did it last? eh. We had a healthy dose of high humidity for 3 days and you could tell the hair was trying to frizz up again. Luckily I had some great argan oil that helped alot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;End result was not worth the effort, and we were all glad we had done a trial section only. For the price you pay for the kit, I&#x27;d recommend a really good flat iron and a great oil pre-conditioner, like CHI&#x27;s Silk Infusion</li>
            <li> I put this product on my hair three weeks ago, and my hair feels like straw.  I have not stopped crying since.  I followed all of the instructions on the box and did exactly what the instructions said to.  My ends are completely burned, and my bangs are flat against my forehead.  I had to trim my ends to see if that would make it better.  It did not.  I do not want to cut my hair short, because I am fifty years old.  My hair does not grow that fast anymore.  It will take forever to get my hair back to shoulder length.  PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!  YOU WILL RUIN YOUR HAIR!!!!!  I just pray that eventually my hair will get back to normal.</li>
            <li> I am so grateful to the ladies who have taken the time to share their experiences here. I&#x27;m thankful I didn&#x27;t use the product I had bought, as a direct consequence of reading these disaster stories. But as I mentioned a few days ago, Amazon should not continue to distribute it in the wake of so much heartache. I think a zero stars option would be a move forward too for actively harmful products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know how to get in touch with Amazon to report a harmful product? I think the reviews should stay, however -  I bought my product on the high street but was confused by the instructions and a came across this site while looking for clarification. Hence I still have hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Maureen. I know it is the last thing you feel like doing right now, but I would advise taking photos of your hair before you visit a salon. I think this is going to really gain momentum and there is a very strong chance that Unilever will deny the extent of damage so I would advise making sure you have a record of it.Best of luck with your salon visit.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever.  If you are trying to save money doing your own smoothing treatment instead of spending $200+ at a salon, this product is not the answer.  You will end up spending as much money in order to correct the damage this will do to your hair, if it can even be corrected.  I had wavy to curly hair I read all the warnings on the box and did not fall into any of the categories.  I do have curly finer hair and maybe this will work for people with coarse thick hair.  I have fine hair but a lot of it, hair was almost to my waist and if I let dry naturally it was wavy curls but of course I wanted straight smooth hair without having to blow dry and straighten everyday.  I followed the directions on the box and ended up rinsing off the first step in ten minutes because everytime I combed like it said I could see clumps of hair in the comb.  I of course panicked and only left on for ten minutes instead of 15 and followed the rest of the instructions.  I now have hair that is broken off and we are not talking a few splint ends here.  This is hair that has broken off to my scalp or just completely fallen out.  It has been two weeks since I did the treatment and hair is still snapping and breaking. I am having to go in to see hair stylist tomorrow to see what she can do with this mess as I do not want to lose a lot of my length (look terrible with short hair).&lt;br /&gt;Yes I know it is hair and it will grow back but it took me a long time to get to this length and since I was laid off of work I wanted hair to look nice for interviews but also needed to save money and compared to a salon smoothing treatment of $200+ this was the better option and they made it sound so wonderful and look so easy on the ads on TV.  I am now paying the price for trying to save money and having to walk around looking like a fool and worried at an interview of how bad my hair looks.  I have never had my hair feel this bad it literally feels like I have a military buzz cut if I rubfingers by my scalp.  I have been trying to find a treatment that will help hair not feel so dry and brittle but realize I am just going to have to live with bad damaged hair until new hair grows, which cannot happen fast enough.  So now I am having to spend extra money on products just so hair will look presentable and having to pay more to a stylist to keep cutting every couple weeks as the damaged hair keeps breaking off.  But with being laid off there is only so much I can afford and if I had the money think I would just break down and get extensions till this mess could grow out.&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the extra time it is now taking in order to do my hair in the morning.  I hate to sound like such a vain person but my hair was one of my better assets and thought this product would help even more making it smooth and shinier.  Boy was I wrong on assuming that, I have completely the opposite of how my hair used to be other than it is straight and just stringy ends now because of the hair all breaking off and stray hairs poking out everywhere that have broken off.  I can&#x27;t even put in a ponytail because there are so many tiny hairs sticking out around my face and scalp where the hair has broken off to my scalp or fallen out.  So unless you have pretty coarse hair I don&#x27;t see how this product is going to make your hair look any better if you are lucky enough to still have all of your hair you started with.  Very disappointed and don&#x27;t make the mistake I made.  I should have read more of these reviews on bad experiences instead of listening to all the rave reviews on the Suave sight or the commercials.  I figured if it worked for Nicole Richie (because I am sure her hair is bleached blonde and probably coarser) then really how much damage would it do to mine especially since my hair didn&#x27;t have any of the warnings on the box.  This is a very misleading product and I doubt there is really anyone whose hair is in as good as condition as it was before they used this.</li>
            <li> i bought this and followed the directions exact. it fried my hair and in no way is my hair and different then prior other than fried and it its still burning my scalp a day later.just because it says keratin dont be fooled !!!my hair has not been colored in over a year as well so there is no reason this should of happened!!!</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever made.  On Easter we used the product on my daughter.  It actually burned the top layer of her hair off in a circle around the crown of her head.  Her beautiful long blonde hair is no more.  She had to have awlful layers added to the top of her hair and she looks like she has a mullet.  What misleading advertising, this product should be removed from the market.  Do  not use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out my hair for 5 years, and in an hour, I completely destroyed it. My best friends wedding is in a month and I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ll have to buy a wig. Suave has agreed to refunded the product, but will not pay for the damages. I will most likely end up with extensions, although I&#x27;m not sure how I will be able to cover up all the bald spots. I followed the directions and read the warning label and none of the warnings pertained to me. Do not use this product.    Update:  To all of the victims of Suave&#x27;s Keretin Infusion, I have created a facebook page titled: \\&quot;Suave Keretin Infusion Ruined My Hair\\&quot;. I encourage you all to join, share your story and post any helpful tips. Also, please make sure to report Unilever to the FDA Consumer Complaint Department. More information can be found here: [...]    I cannot believe this product is still being sold. It is nothing short of gross negligance on the part of the company. Please, please do not even consider using this product. I took the product to my salon and they will be posting an alert in their monthly newsletter about the danger associated with this product. Again, I encourage all of you to do the same.</li>
            <li> I love this product! My only complaint is that the words \\&quot;30 day smoothing kit\\&quot; were misleading. I thought that there was something in the box that I could use 30 different times (on 30 different days) so I can have straight hair for a whole year, maybe more!  I was wrong, but the treatment in the box did give me straight hair for 30 days. My hair is shoulder length with tight medium-sized curls that are very hard to keep in place and in the way I want them to be; they&#x27;re just all over the place! When the air is dry, specially during winter, my hair is actually more wavy and harder to straighten without a flat iron and leave-in treatments.  I have it professionally straightened twice a year; I can&#x27;t afford any more than that, and I&#x27;m afraid my hair will be unhealthy if I do it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is a money and life saver.  It gave me almost the same results as I get when I have my hair professionally straightened! My hair is shoulder length, so I was able to use the smoothing cream (#1 bottle) and cuticle seal cream (#2 bottle) 2 times, which means I got hair that looked professionally straightened hair for 2 months.  I waited until it was a month close to when I go for my semi-annual straightening, during which time my hair&#x27;s curl is really obvious! I followed the instructions to the letter, so I had none of the irritation, burning, or face transfer that the product warns you about. This product is so good I actually only had to blow dry my hair lightly when I did wash it. (Through experience, I find that air drying my hair a little before blow drying it, a week or so after having it straightened, helps me maintain the straight look longer.)  The heat defense leave-in conditioner (bottle #3) lasted me a long time because I only had to use such a small amount each time I needed it.  I didn&#x27;t need my flat iron for touch ups until after more than 2 months had passed since I first used the straightening cream (about the same time I would have needed it after having it professionally straightened).  The instructions did say not to re-apply the straightening cream for 3 months, so I waited until the 4th month to use up the remaining cream.  I&#x27;m currently on the 5th month and still loving my straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big disadvantage: it could get tiring while doing this treatment yourself. That&#x27;s why I still rely on other people to do it. After about 10 minutes of applying it thoroughly (maybe slightly more), then 20 minutes of constantly combing and using my hands to flatten the hair repeatedly with some slight massaging and pulling of the hair downwards to keep it straight, I got a crick in my neck and elbows the first time I used this. (I tried to avoid this the 2nd time by stretching my arms above my head after each combing/massaging/pulling action every few minutes.) I think there were some places in the back of my head that I probably missed the first time because for a while my hair looked like there was a small wedge in the back when I looked at my hair sideways. It is time consuming and should not be done the day you&#x27;re going to a special occasion where you want to wow everyone with your straight hair.  I suggest you do it on a weekend or the night before the occasion.  I bemoaned the fact that I wasn&#x27;t able to do some work on my laptop while straightening my hair, which I can do when I go to the salon to have it done. Depending on how you look at it, doing this yourself can save you time and money because you don&#x27;t have to do it professionally, but for me it sort of cost me the same because I realized how much work I am actually able to do in one hour while someone else straightens my hair for me. I only say this because I have a very demanding job that demands a lot of my time, so I really don&#x27;t have time to spend straightening my hair myself. This is only a warning to others who may think that it might be easier to do hair straightening yourself than pay someone else to do it. If you have been doing ityourself for years, then you probably have the methods and time down pat, but I haven&#x27;t done this since I left college, so it&#x27;s been a long while!  That being said, this product saved me one trip to the salon and gave me the same results. If I had more spare time, I would be buying this product twice a year and do it 4 times each year myself just because it gives amazing, professional-looking, and salon-like results!</li>
            <li> Did exactly what it said it would. My hair is strait and looks good. I really like it. I&#x27;m so sorry for all those women that it didn&#x27;t work for :(&lt;br /&gt;Now my hair is very thick and strong. Curly and some frizz that only comes with curly hair. I have no idea if that makes a difference.</li>
            <li> As many others have said I really wished I would have read these reviews before trying this product. I used this product thinking it will either work or will do nothing. I never believed that I would be living the nightmare that I am living now. I read all the conditions on not using this product and I did not fall under any of those so I assumed it was safe for me to use. I was wrong. I followed the directions just as they were stated to do. I tried brushing it straight just as the directions said to do and I could not hardly get the comb through it. I managed to finally get the comb through it and continued to comb it straight. Waited the 20 min as the directions instructed me to with my type of hair. I rinsed and rinsed till it was all out and then put on the cutical cream and left it in for the whole 7 minutes then rinsed that out. When I looked in the mirror I was horrified. My hair was so thin and flat and on top of that the top and crown of my head was bald. I dried it and thought maybe that would help. This was a Saturday night so there was no one at Suave to contact. I did call them Monday and was told to start keeping and envelope with before and after pics and any reciepts and they may reimburse me. I went to my beautician that has done hair for over 20 years and she was in as much shock as me. She had never seen anything like it. On top of all the bald spots she said that my hair was fried at the top of my head and was really worried that the follicles had been damaged and there was a possibility that it would not grow back. I was told that I needed to start taking certain vitamins and eating as much protein as possible and different hair treatments to make my hair grow as fast as possible so it would not break off at my scalp. I have been taking these vitamins, eating protein and the treatments and be as gentle with  It has been 6 days and my hair is still breaking off and I am getting balder by the day. I have been told that I look like someone that has just started Chemo and is loosing there hair. I have contacted and lawyer that is very interested in taking my case and will be meeting with him soon. I am also in the process of getting with my local news channel about advertising this product. This should not have happened with any hair product that is sold to the public. I wish all of you that is living this nightmare the best of luck.</li>
            <li> I chose to try this product simply for the convenience of it - the idea of being able to do a smoothing treatment in my home, on my own schedule, was preferable to making an appointment at the salon. While I was still in the first steps of application, my hair began to literally melt and break off - I have thick hair and shed quite a bit when I wash it but I was getting handfuls of hair out of the comb with each comb through of the product. If there&#x27;s even a chance your hair would react at all, I&#x27;d say don&#x27;t try this. I only wish I&#x27;d read reviews before I ruined my hair.... and even with several washings, I can smell the Suave product still so I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to take a team of experts to get my hair in shape again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in the store, tried it tonight and Ohhh my God! My hair is fried!&lt;br /&gt;First off, I do all my hair care at home with the exception of cutting it, so box stuff i&#x27;m used to. Within the first 4 minutes of the first step being on my head my hair began to fry. It began to curl up and fall out. I had not dyed my hair in over a month followed the directions to the letter and after my hair began to fry I washed it out immediately! This is to strong to be sold in stores. terrible, terrible, terrible! Please don&#x27;t user this product. There is a very bold hair cut in my future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...after 70$$ and 4 inches less hair, I can at least go out in public. Cut and deep conditioning helped but I have a whole layer on the top of my head that&#x27;s still completely fried.....</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product until I read the reviews. I am very sorry for the pain you have all gone through. Just so you know you have the right to sue. I have a feeling they will have a lot of lawsuits. Good luck to you all!</li>
            <li> My hair is very coarse and very curly. This product does not have enough warning labels at all. After I used this product my hair felt like gum. I could not even brush through my hair without it hurting so much. Also this product broke my hair and fried my ends. This product is terrible and i would never recommend it to anyone. My mom and I are both very lucky that we did not lose any hair or have any bald spots but it should have warning labels because this product is horrible. DO NOT USE!!! i wish i had never tried it i don&#x27;t think my hair will ever be the same.</li>
            <li> I used this product today. I AM LIVID AT SUAVE RIGHT NOW.  I am writing this review after crying for over an hour and after calling Suave to complain (they din&#x27;t help at all except reimburse me for the product and send me some free samples which doesn&#x27;t help me because I have to CUT ALL MY HAIR OFF NOW!). Please, do NOT use this product.  I beg you.  Suave is completely irresponsible for putting this on the shelves.  Chemicals like this should be handled/used by professionals only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this, my hair feels dry, frizzy, brittle, is breaking all over and literally RUINED!  Not exaggerating.  I have scheduled an appointment to get my once very long, beautiful hair cut to my shoulders next week with a deep conditioning treatment.  My 5 star salon says it is damaged and all they can do is cut it.  I followed all directions and read all warnings.  My hair is colored but not bleached so it sounded okay.  I am so angry at myself for thinking a cheap product like this would actually improve the appearance of my hair.  I am angry because my hair was beautiful and now it is disgusting and feels like straw.  I wish I could post a picture so you all could see my before and after and the damage that has been done by this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT USE THIS!  IT IS DANGEROUS.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t going to be much of a review because I couldn&#x27;t even get past the smell. The smoothing cream, smells just like an old-fashioned perm. It&#x27;s so strong I could smell it when I came into the room where the box was, so I put the entire kit in the garage. On the other hand, the cuticle seal cream and the heat defense leave-in conditioner both have a pleasant smell. I was also put off by the description. I thought something described as a \\&quot;30 day smoothing kit\\&quot; would be a deep conditioner, not a straightener. Oh, well.</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d looked at these reviews before I bought this product; however I had good hopes since I&#x27;m generally satisfied with Suave&#x27;s products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the checklist on the box about what types of hair should not have this product used on it; other than having some slightly dry ends I felt that it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell (which is disclosed on the package) was the least of my problems. The instructions state to run the comb through your hair with the first step of the product on it; I could not even get the comb through. After I was finished with the entire process, my hair is just as (if not more) frizzy as before and I still cannot get a comb (even a wide tooth one) through my hair. It looks, smells &amp; feels like a bad perm and even when I apply detangler to my hair, it kinks up &amp; breaks when I try to even gently comb it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it states not to shampoo your hair for 2 days, I did so this morning (used the product last night) in hopes of getting this out of my hair. I had to put it up wet &amp; come to work like that so at this point I don&#x27;t know what shape my hair will be in when I can get home and take it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my hair out for a long time and now that it had almost gotten to a length I like, I&#x27;m afraid I will have to get it cut short again. I&#x27;m getting recommendations from friends on products for my hair that will hopefully make a short cut unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do want to point out that Suave has a regular shampoo/conditioner with keratin; same color/design on the bottle as this product. While I have not used the shampoo I do have the conditioner and it did do well on my hair. It felt and looked better after one use so that increased my expectation for this product. Very let down, disappointed &amp; near tears....please heed the warnings and skip this item!!!</li>
            <li> *IMPORTANT* if you have had a bad reaction to this product as thousands of others please sign the petition [...]to help do your part in getting this product off the market so others do not have to suffer the same fate. Suave has been completely negligent by falsely advertising this dangerous chemical and they need to be held accountable. This is destroying not only our hair but our self esteem and confidence. No refund they offer can make up for that. They need to compensate the victims who trusted in the company and product. This has made my hair fall out, scalp constantly burn and itch, what is left of my hair is fried and disgusting. I had healthy hair before using this. The only reason I used it was because in Minnesota the summers are humid and my hair gets frizzy. After the claims I saw on the commercials I thought this seemed like the perfect product for me and I was excited for the results. Now after using it I can&#x27;t go back, it does not wash out in 30 days, it is a permenet chemical that has completely destroyed all of the hair on my head. I have to get it chopped off and start all over with expensive repairing treatments all because I wanted a little less frizz for the summer! I followed the directions to a T and none of the warnings applied to me. I am 33 years old and NEVER have I EVER experienced anything as horrific as this product. How dare they continue to make these false claims of beautifully smooth flowing hair with all of the complaints out there. You shoud be ashamed of yourself!</li>
            <li> I purchased the suave 30day keratin smoothing treatement i fol,lowed the instructions to the t. I noticed that after the first step when i was combing my hair my hair started to fall out as well as after the second step i cryed and cryed my hair is nothing but a fuzz ball and hair is still falling out i tried many different leave in masks ans conditioners and my hair continues to be so fried i cry every day i then purchase a wig but i do not have the confidence to wear it I contacted suave and complained now i am waiting to see what they can do for me . If they cannot do anything for me i am contacting an attorney right away for the false advertising of this product and what it has done to my hair I am so devestated and dont know what to do anymore i just plain sucks Please if you read this DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.............. i wake up every morning to look like a mullet that the hair fuzz is standing up what an embarresement</li>
            <li> First off, I want to say that this product is clearly NOT for everyone.  I&#x27;ve only ever died my hair once in my whole life (at home, I was 16 and it didn&#x27;t even work) and I used to get perms when I was little (10-12) I am now 25. Also, I felt more comfortable using this product because every time I get my hair cut my stylist is always raving about how healthy my hair is, which the packaging says not to use this if you have damaged hair.  That&#x27;s not me!  READ THE WARNINGS on the packaging. This product may not be for you.  Having said that, I&#x27;m 1/2 Mexican and I have VERY thick coarse wavy/always frizzy hair.  My hair is virtually un-tameable for me.  The only time I can get it completely straight (like I truly want it) is if I blowdry it, straighten it and then sleep on it for a night and usually the next day it&#x27;s nice and straight.. usually.  I used the product like it says, three steps, wash first, rinse between each step y&#x27;all know what it says if you read it too. The stuff wreaks and my hair still smells, but I&#x27;m hoping that will go away after the next time I wash it, plus it&#x27;s nothing a little product can&#x27;t cover up.  I only blow-dried my hair this time rather than straightening it right after because I was tired of messing with my hair.  The whole process took me a little over an hour, but it was worth it.  My hair which usually doesn&#x27;t feel very soft (it&#x27;s coarse) is SUPER soft and pretty straight for only being blow-dried.  I can&#x27;t say if it lasts the full thirty days as I just did all of this tonight but I&#x27;m hoping it lasts a while.  Also, this product works much better than other at home treatments I&#x27;ve tried.  Basically the pros: Your hair is straight. The product is also affordable, it was only $15 at CVS.  Cons: It stinks and takes a long time to apply.  I&#x27;m hoping it lasts the full 30 days like it says, also I wish I could do it again before 3 months but (after reading everyone&#x27;s horror stories) I will make sure to wait 3 months just to be safe.</li>
            <li> I have NEVER written a negative review about ANY product before.  Throw this product away, it was a nightmare come true for me today.  The suave \\&quot;help\\&quot; line mearly took down my information and promised me a refund, even though this is going to cost me dearly.  I look like the end of a broom.  Clumps of my hair fell out and the strands I saved from the comb were mush.  The hair that did not fall out have lost all shine and are way more frizzy than when I started.  When I started my hair was all one length, now it looks like someone took a razor and put large uneven layers in my hair.  This is the worst mistake and most terrible purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.  This product should be taken off the shelves, Suave, you should be ashamed of yourselves.  I&#x27;ll never trust your brand again.  I waited for my husband all day and his response was \\&quot;at least you have cute hats.\\&quot;  I was hoping someone would call me some advice. If it&#x27;s an alkali product or an acidic product, give me some tips to neutralize it!  If my di-sulfide bonds are being destroyed, tell me how to stop the reaction.  No advice from the assistance line, I even talked to the manager and she said she&#x27;s not a stylist.  I don&#x27;t need a stylist, I need a chemist!  Somebody wake me up!</li>
            <li> I had perfectly straight hair before using this product, but thought it would make it \\&quot;smoother\\&quot;.  OMG I can&#x27;t believe I did this to my hair.  My hair WAS is in good condition.  I get it trimmed religiously and use really good products on it.  I kept thinking I must not have rinsed it all out or something as I was trying to dry my hair because it seemed like it was sticky and wouldn&#x27;t dry and looked crinkly.  Not rinsing it out was not the problem.  It melted my freaking hair!  This product should be banned.  Now I&#x27;m afraid when I wash it it&#x27;s going to get even worse.  I did this because we were going to Puerto Rico on spring break next week and to my niece&#x27;s wedding the weekend after and I wanted my hair to look great.  Now I&#x27;m going to have to completely whacked off just to not look like the idiot I am for purchasing this product.  Do not buy this product. It will ruin your hair!!!!!!!!!!!!![[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]]</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, I decided to just do a strand test. Better to sacrifice a small portion of hair than risk losing it all.&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago, I had the keratin treatment done to my hair, and it was straight with no blow-drying, shiny, and beautiful compared to the generally frizzy but mostly ok appearance it usually has. I learned the formaldehyde and other chemicals could cause hair loss, damage to the scalp, and cancer, so I thought I&#x27;d try this product. After seeing the ingredients, I was disappointed, as many of them are equally harsh and problematic.&lt;br /&gt;The strand test didn&#x27;t yield impressive results. The hair looked quite dry and the texture was mostly the same as before--a bit straighter, but not nice and shiny like with the salon keratin treatments. Not worth doing a whole head&#x27;s worth, given the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed the box said it lasts up to thirty days but that the treatment could not be repeated again until a few months have passed...that sounds a little odd.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe some things are better left to the professionals...</li>
            <li> this product will make your hair fall out. This is NOT a KERATIN treatment, this is a reverse perm chemical straightening kit. BEWARE. my sister&#x27;s hair fell out, it burned it after 5 MINUTES of application and she immediately went to the salon for repair, after $150 in treatments later, her hair is still fried, and now falling out. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!</li>
            <li> I used this product and absolutely LOVE it!! I have bleach, color, and old perm (which i wanted out) in my hair and I ignored all the warnings for already processed hair....and it still worked great. My hair has never felt better :) and my old perm is now straight(yayyyy). i would recommend this product to anyone (I already have) Thank you, Suave!</li>
            <li> I have coarse dark hair that has natural wave in it.  I used this product as directed. It didn&#x27;t do any major damage, but it did dry my hair out a lot.  I didn&#x27;t see any major improvement either. Because of the long application process and the lack of results I saw, and the drying out of my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t use it again.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair, and no patience for spending (literally) hours blow-drying and flat-ironing it into submission after I shampoo it.  I also work out six days a week, so I really do have to shampoo my hair nearly every day, as I leave the gym drenched in sweat.  Because of this, most of the time my hair spends its life corralled in a pony tail, or just allowed to be crazy.  It isn&#x27;t that I don&#x27;t like the sleek look sometimes- it&#x27;s that there really aren&#x27;t enough hours in a day to make it worth it for me to put in all that effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when I heard about the Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit, I got excited.  Suave&#x27;s a brand I trust for shampoo, conditioner, and styling products, and I&#x27;ve heard good things about the salon keratin treatments, and this kit seems like a good matchup between the two.  Using the kit itself is pretty easy- you just wash and condition your hair like you normally would, and then comb this through, wait a while, and rinse it out.  All the instructions are included, as are the standard-issue plastic gloves as well as a wide-toothed comb.  It reminded me a lot of the process of taking a Toni Home Perm and combing my hair straight with it when I was in high school, instead of setting my hair on curlers for a perm.  The biggest challenge for me with the whole process was finding the 20 minutes wait-time to use this kit, plus the time it takes to blow out and flat-iron, and then not shampooing for a couple days after.  I wanted to be really conscientious and not even pull my hair back for the couple days after using this product- who wants a perma-ridge from a ponytail holder in their hair, even for 30 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased with the results.  I didn&#x27;t get pin-straight, but I wouldn&#x27;t want pin-straight for myself, either.  I did get very shiny, very manageable hair that wasn&#x27;t as crazy as usual, and those results did last for the whole 30 days, I think.  I didn&#x27;t keep track on a chart or calendar or anything.  I don&#x27;t feel like I got the same results I would have gotten had I had a salon keratin treatment, but I didn&#x27;t expect those kind of results.  I don&#x27;t know how this formula stacks up against the kind they use in salons, but I do know how my skills and techniques stack up against a hairdresser in a salon- they come up short-short-short in comparison to those of someone who works with hair for a living.  Therefore, I&#x27;m happy with what this Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit gave me!  It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d do on a monthly basis, though, because I kind of like my wild&#x27;n&#x27;crazy hair, and there&#x27;s that pernicious time-factor thing.  But when I do want smoother, less wavy hair for a bit, I think this&#x27;ll be my go-to kit to get the job done at home.r or anything.  I don&#x27;t feel like I got the same results I would have gotten had I had a salon keratin treatment, but I didn&#x27;t expect those kind of results.  I don&#x27;t know how this formula stacks up against the kind they use in salons, but I do know how my skills and techniques stack up against a hairdresser in a salon- they come up short-short-short in comparison to those of someone who works with hair for a living.  Therefore, I&#x27;m happy with what this Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit gave me!  It&#x27;s not something I&#x27;d do on a monthly basis, though, because I kind of like my wild&#x27;n&#x27;crazy hair, and there&#x27;s that pernicious time-factor thing.  But when I do want smoother, less wavy hair for a bit, I think this&#x27;ll be my go-to kit to get the job done at home.</li>
            <li> NO STARS!  I purchased this product to use as a keratin treatment which is how it is marketed.  Upon reading the directions and smelling the product it was evident it is a CHEMICAL HAIR STRAIGHTENER.  I called Suave and they did verify it.  Do not use if you think it is a keratin treatment.  Poor misrepresentation by Suave and I would never purchase a product of theirs again.</li>
            <li> This product totally ruined my hair. I was mortified when I looked in the mirror. It is a perm solution. If you want soft hair use any Keratin product like Coppola. After using this product my hair was blonde stripped of all its color, felt and looked like straw and was frizzy. I cried!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish I had known. Now I have no choice but to either cut it really short or wait for it to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I found a very good Keratin Rx treatment that helped bring my hair back to some normalcy but it&#x27;s not the same. And now it takes four times longer after washing it to get it looking and feeling normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not use this product.</li>
            <li> So, I was running into walgreens one night to pick up some stuff. I happen to walk down the hair section and saw the suave keratin CRAP. So I thought hmm, its a smoothing treatment, so the worst thing that could happen is---the stuff just wont do anything. Boy, was I WRONG. As I read the directions and put this P.O.S. product in my hair (btw it smells like perm) Yuck...I relized within a minute that my hair was breaking in all kinds of places. So then I rushed over to the shower to get it out- only it was too late...I ran a comb thru my hair and it was caked with my hair. Now I am left with a nappy head of hair. My mom does hair so I have always taken very good care of my hair using the highest quality of product out. However, I did try this and now I am living a hair nightmare. Please please PLEASE, do yourslef a favor and either take it back or trash it. It will corrupt your hair. AWFUL stuff...Suave is just a S**t product in my book now.</li>
            <li> After having read so many awful 1 star reviews :( I was a bit scared to try this product but I had to take a risk. My hair has been so extremely unmanageable and frizzy that I didn&#x27;t really mind the unknown results that would surprise me in the end. I took the test online to make sure that my hair was eligible for this product and fortunately it was. IF YOU HAVE EXTREMELY FRIZZY HAIR I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND IT! I feel bad for all the terrible nightmarish results and my heart goes out to you. JUST MAKE SURE TO READ THE WARNING FOR THIS PRODUCT AND TAKE THE TEST TO SEE IF YOU ARE ELIGIBLE! I wish the best for anyone who is wanting to try this product and please be smart about it! Really, it&#x27;s sad to hear all these terrible results.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the results. I followed every step, setting times for how long to leave it in, how long to rinse and so on. I think for $10 you can only expect so much. It calmed down the frizz, and I live in Texas, with humidity, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles. I was kind of scared to begin with after reading all of the negative feedback this product got.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative I would give it is the smell.  It reminds me of a home perm. And now my hair smells like that too.....and I have to live with it for 48 hours because you aren&#x27;t supposed to shampoo for that amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m pleased. It cut down my time with the flat iron, and my hair seems to be less frizzy and is laying much flatter.</li>
            <li> If you want a product that will make you lose your hair in a very scary way, then this is for you. Seriously, yesterday was the worst day ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday night I decided to try this new keratin kit. I thought it would be a good thing for my hair but instead it was the worst thing i&#x27;ve ever done to myself. As soon as i put Step one in my hair, my hair started to fall out when i began combing through. Then, my hair started to kink up and pretty, which i later learned it was burning and frying. I went through with steps 2 and 3 hoping it would fix the kinking situation. It didnt. I jumped in the shower immediately to get this HORRIBLE product out of my hair. It was too late. If i could post a picture i would. My hair was completely mushy and would not dry (my hairdresser later told me it was because it was over processed). My hair is very long and reaches to my mid back. The last 6 inches of my hair was completely fried and kinked up and then random spots in the middle of my head were kinky as well. When i tried to pull the hair straight it would just shrivel back up when i let it go. The next morning i woke up hoping it was a nightmare... it wasn&#x27;t. I went in to my hairdresser and she put many of their conditioners in my hair hoping she could save it. In the end, she had to cut off over 7 inches of my hair. My hair was the only thing i loved about my look, and its gone. My hair is now to my neck and it is still hard to manage with. The hair i still have left is still fried and kinky and wont straighten properly. Ive never experienced anything like this. I guess I trusted Suave way too much, but then again i didnt expect something that supposed to be good for you to completely ruin my hair. I will never buy another suave product in my entire life. This product is not a real keratin treatment, its a hair fryer in a box. I cant even look in the mirror without crying and on top of it all im going to have to spend over $300 on hair extensions so i can look somewhatpresentable at work, my upcoming cruise, and my college graduation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be sending a letter to the stores i know carry this product, in hopes they take it off the shelf! I dont know how a product like this is still on the shelves. I wish I had read the rest of the reviews before i used this product!</li>
            <li> 🌀🌀PLEASE PEOPLE DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!🌀🌀&lt;br /&gt;MY SISTER WAS ONLY ON STEP 1 HER HAIR STARTED FALLING OUT IN CHUNKS LITERALLY SHE IMMEDIATELY WASHED IT OUT BUT, DAMAGE WAS DONE CAME TO ME CRYING!! IM A BEAUTICIAN SO PLEASE DON&#x27;T USE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> For me, it wasn&#x27;t an easy process for many reasons:&lt;br /&gt;First, the product smells SOOO bad.&lt;br /&gt;Then, you have to wash your hair at least 3 times and if you don&#x27;t have a friend to help you (like me), then you are in trouble.&lt;br /&gt;Last, my hair look good the first 2 days, but after the first shower my hair got a little curly and my tips had lots of split ends. I think the product burned my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will use it again.</li>
            <li> I think sometimes I have the frizziest for a straight-haired girl, so I was definitely up for trying something that might tame it. And since Suave is a leader in hair care products, I thought the [[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]] just might be what I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it turns out...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit will definitely smooth and tame frizzy hair.  Overly tame in my opinion.  Following the directions EXACTLY, my hair was of ALL body.  ALL BODY.  Barrettes, hairspray, curling irons - NOTHING could hold the hair.  Hating this, although the kit instructions said not to wash for 48 hours, I did anyway.  Three days and three washes later, I finally started getting some body back.  Now, at 31 days post-use (which, if you&#x27;ll notice is more than the kit promises), I have smooth hair with the body and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I use it again?  No.  I hate how it left my hair with no body but possibly cutting the time in half or using less than recommend might change that but the smell is just too much.  Extremely overpowering.  As I said, I&#x27;m 31 days past the date I used and there is still a faint hint even after daily shampoos.  The perm-like odor is also still in the towels I used despite repeated laundering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:  3 out of 5 stars because the [[ASIN:B005SPESLY Suave Professionals Keratin Infusion 30 Day Smoothing Kit]] does indeed smooth the hair but the extreme result and overpowering smell keeps it from being a product I can&#x27;t even like much less love.</li>
            <li> DONT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! I had to have 12 inches of my hair cut off and lucky that my stylist didn&#x27;t have to shave my head due to the damage/burns from Suave Keratin Kit. I have tried to speak with someone at Suave too many times to count with no success. I was however told that this product is really intended for \\&quot;Virgin Hair\\&quot; and they need to change their labeling. YOU THINK!! Please tell everyone you know, it&#x27;s not worth the risk! I hope this helps anyone that is thinking of using this!</li>
            <li> My daughter wanted her hair straightened for her 13 birthday. She has frizz around her face that we straighten every day. We applied the product exactly as directed. It smelled horrible, took forever and we have never done anything else to her hair before. Today she said her hair feels weird in spots. Imagine my surprise when upon closer inspection I see she has breakage and stubble all along her part. Scary and true. Not a fun thing for anyone, let alone a 13 year old girl. Take this product off the shelf!</li>
            <li> After reading some online reviews, I decided to do it, but to slightly adjust the prescribed process. The \\&quot;Step 1\\&quot; of the treatment is actually a perm solution to straighten your hair, but I don&#x27;t want stick straight hair; I like my ends to curl. I just want my hair to lay down and be \\&quot;smooth\\&quot;. The directions say to leave \\&quot;Step 1\\&quot; on for about 20 minutes. I opted to rinse it out after just 10. The \\&quot;Step 2\\&quot; is the keratin treatment, so I left it on about twice as long as the directions said. The results: My hair is definitely smoother, easier to straighten, and laying nicer, plus it still holds curling iron curls very well, but it will not curl up on its own, if I let it air dry. I have to heat-style it (which I was doing every day already). If you never wear your hair \\&quot;natural\\&quot; I would suggest this product, but you CAN&#x27;T use it if you have used high-lift color or your hair is damaged or breaking, so read the box!My hair felt kind of \\&quot;tacky\\&quot; when I was styling it, but once it was dry it felt very silky and nice.</li>
            <li> During the process I got confused on one direction and looked it up here to see what people had to say. That&#x27;s when I encountered the storm of DO NOT USEs. Suffice to say I was scared out of my wits but at that point was on the last step so there was no looking back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank God I haven&#x27;t lost any hair so far! I have an art opening tomorrow and as the artist I need to look at least a little decent. HOWEVER my ends are TOAST. The rest of my hair is ok and frizz free but I dont know if thats the flat iron or the product. But again my ends...FRIED. I have to go cut at least 2 inches off. I thought my ends were dry in the past...HA! I was SO wrong. I didn&#x27;t even know what dead ends were!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the difference between a dead end were you get a little annoyed cuz you went the wrong way and have to turn the car around but really it&#x27;s not a huge deal vs. hitting a dead end in the woods on a stormy night in the middle of nowhere and your battery dies and your phone is dead and some weird guy with an axe is heading toward your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean I&#x27;m talking the way your hair gets when you accidently burn a piece and the rest of it curls up in that brittle little tangle. Except all over the last 3 inches of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that my hair feels dry and its hard to brush since, as I may have mentioned, the last 2 inches are burnt frizzy dry knotted and all together useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have super healthy hair, I never blow dry, sometimes flat iron or curl but not often, use little to no product, and do not dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the risk and the time I would say this product is not worth it at all. It has little to no affect that I couldnt get with a bit of smoothing cream and a flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please do not risk your lovely hair for this!!!</li>
            <li> I kept reading how moisturizing a keratin treatment was....well I will be headed to the salon tomorrow to cut off all of my burnt/damaged long hair.  No sooner did I put step one in, and my hair turned to curly jelly.  Rinsed it out in a matter of minutes.  Applied step two just to neutralize.  Currently sitting in a plastic cap with a deep conditioner, hoping to salvage what I can for the stylist tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I too am confused why this product is on the market.  Not a good review anywhere.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been naturally kinky curly and frizzy.  Two years ago I started going to a professional to get my hair colored, highlighted and karatin treatments.  It always worked wonderfully, but was so expensive ($400-$500), I have been looking for another way to get the same professional salon look. For the past year, I have been coloring my hair at home myself and I had just colored it about 4 to 5 weeks prior to using this product. I followed the directions to the tea.  I guess for me, having had professional treatments before, I had somewhat of an advantage because I was aware of some of the little qwirks you have to watch out for. After I applied the sealer, I placed a shower cap over my hair to keep in the heat and moisture.  I knew that when blow drying my hair, I needed to manipulate the crown and the part at my forehead to make my hair poof up or curve like I wanted it to. After blow drying, I really didn&#x27;t need to use the flat iron, but I knew it would help to seal the product into my hair.  I made sure to start as close to the roots as possible and go all the way to the ends.  I also knew not to use any kind of hair bows or hair ties or put my hair up in a ponytail, as this would put a crease in my hair.  I&#x27;m horrified at some of the stories I read and I feel very badly for those that had bad experiences.  As for me, I love this product.  I bought all the other products that go with this line and I plan to continue to use it in the future.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how devastated I am from using this product on my daughter and my hair.  Before both of our hair was a little frizzy with some damage so we had to flat iron it daily.  Now our hair is broken off and the ends are so bad that we will be getting about 2 inches cut off just to make it look presentable.  I am completely saddened and in disbelief that a 10.00 product could cause this much damage to our hair.  I don&#x27;t know what to tell my 13 year old daughter whom I convinced to let me use this product on her and now her hair is destroyed for her upcoming 8th grade formal dance.  Suave should be ashamed of themselves for ruining our hair with their false advertisements and promises of lush shiny smooth hair.  I wish to God I would not have used this product.  It will take years for our hair to return to normal if ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Devastated in Tampa&lt;br /&gt;tinatampa</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.  It burned my hair and half of it fell out.  I have a quarter inch of stubble growing back after two weeks and I have to wear a scarf on my head.  Please report this to the FDA at:  (...)  Copy and paste the link to your browser and it will take you to the page with the toll free number to call.  This product needs to be removed from the market immediately!</li>
            <li> I started reading these reviews on May 1, while this horrible sulfur was in my hair, I immediately rinsed it out as what I read scared me!! I had about 2 minutes left, so unfortunately the damage had already been done. It stripped all the color from my hair (yes, I did assess the status of my hair before using, and based on their stylist recommendations, my hair was fine for this product), left it flat on top with frizzy, fried, split ends (about 4-5 inches worth).  So I will get to the point, like many others my hair is ruined, I fell for the gimmick and since then have been emailing, phone calling with the Unilever Consumer Services, and they are sending me my money back for the product, coupons for products to help my hair-better not be Suave-and will \\&quot;look into reimbursing me for any purchases, trips to the salon\\&quot; in order to correct the damage. I encourage any of you who havent already to contact them with your complaints.  I can&#x27;t change what happened; but hopefully, others can benefit from what happened to us!  Good luck everyone, I sure hate this lesson; but I definitely learned from it!!!</li>
            <li> I gave this conditioner to my daughter to try (since being male, I don&#x27;t use such products). Her feedback was this. It did straighten her hair but it also damaged it.  Now 2 months after she used it, there is still visible damage to her hair I could see myself.  The way she put it: \\&quot;it burnt my hair off (that is some of the ends) a bit at a time.\\&quot;  Her advice: leave this kind of conditioning to the professionals.</li>
            <li> This product is a relaxer &amp; perm in disguise(contains both ingredients)Mostly Perm though. PLEASE read the ingredients and compare them to a chemical relaxer. Your hair is falling out/breaking because the chemical reaction is not being neutralized. The second ingredient in this product is Ammonium thioglycolate (perm salt)! That makes this product a full out PERM! It should be treated in the same regard. I haven&#x27;t tried this product but I will risk people complaining if it means preventing anyone else from loosing their hair. Suave should be ashamed of themselves. They are no better than the companies with hidden formaldehyde in their products. I am no hair dresser but if did use this product on myself and my hair was falling out or scalp was tingling/burning I would goto the store and buy a perm. Then I would throw out the perm and rinse my hair with the neutralizer that comes in the box. Doing this and washing with cold water should stop the action of the perm in this product. I&#x27;m sure the product burns if it gets on your scalp. Real Keratin smoothing treatments do not burn on the scalp. Very very sorry for anyone who was fooled by the deceptive marketing of this product.</li>
            <li> I received this item to test. Since I color my hair, I was going to use it on my teenage daughter who is always straightening her hair. After reading about the lawsuits, damage done to hair and recall of the product, I decided I would not be using this item at all. I have found reviewers that say the product did fine with them. So it seems like playing a game of chance if you use it.</li>
            <li> My daughter is has mixed hair, not totally black, not totally white and it is kinky, thick and frizzy, so I thought this might be interesting.  Still, after reading the fine print and realizing that she has had her hair professionally straightened with chemicals in the past, I am reluctant to give it a try.  We have already had one big issue of hair breakage, that I feel this may be pushing it.  I wish I could give more info, but just don&#x27;t feel it is worth a gamble at this time.</li>
            <li> I bought this product before reading the reviews here...after I felt burning on my head after step one i quickly rinsed it off of my head and came to read the reviews.  The only problem that I have with this product is the burning sensation that i felt.  Hours later..I still feel as if my hair is about to fall off of my head.  However, hair loss during the process was minimal.  I usually loose my hair when I comb it so I wouldn&#x27;t say that this product did any major damage to my hair.  During the process my hair felt stiff and as if it was melting together.  But by the third step, it actually felt more smooth.  After blowing it dry I noticed much less frizz and it was straighter than normal.  The ends of my hair are shiny and my hair is softer than usual.  While this product seems to have made my hair a bit more relaxed, it is not something I would use again.  The results are not worth the gross smell and the burning sensation.</li>
            <li> I used this on my long hair and it fried it. This product is horrible. I now have to cut my long beautiful hair. I  followed the instructions perfect and it is a mess. I have sat and cried over this. I&#x27;ve never used a product that was this way.  My hair is falling out on top of everything. This product is HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY!!!</li>
            <li> Since I live in a very humid climate, I have wanted to have my hair professionally straightened for years.  Since the price is like $250 to have it done in a salon, I could not afford it.  So when I saw this product, I thought it sounded like just what I needed, and the price was great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read all of the warnings and directions on the package several times.  Since none of the warnings applied to me, I thought the product would be okay for my hair.  I did everything exactly as directed.  As soon as I opened the first tube, I smelled perm solution.  That should have been the first RED FLAG, because ever since I have started coloring my hair on a regular basis, I have not been able to use perm solution on my hair.  Within seconds of applying the product to my hair, it literally melted right before my eyes!  I was horrorfied!  Since I had just gotten my hair cut a week or so before, I knew it wasn&#x27;t because the hair was badly damaged.  I could not comb through my hair at all!  When I finally got around to the blow drying stage, my hair was a frizzy, fried disaster.  I flat ironed, and ironed and ironed and still could not get the frizz under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I waited the longer than the 48 hours to wash my hair, since it took me a few days to get it to calm down.  I thought that maybe when I was able to wash it and use all of my mega conditioners and styling products that my hair would look normal.  No such luck.  It was probably worse than the first day.  I had to cut some of it off, but that is just the tip of the iceberg.  I am going to end up with a very short cut eventually, which does not make me happy.  I have always had medium length hair, because I don&#x27;t look good with short hair.  I think cutting it all off is going to be the only way to go to get rid of this mess.  My hair is crimped, but not in a good way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, to make a long story short...DO NOT PUT THIS STUFF ON YOUR HAIR unless you want to look like a mop, and a very cheap mop at that.</li>
            <li> My wife used it and says it worked great for her. Her hair is more healthier and vibrant, and not tangled. She says it was a very detailed and bit complicated procedure to use the product in the correct manner, and wishes it could be made simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we do see the bad reviews by other people here, and really feel sorry for them. And in fact hesistate to give 5 star review here for this product, fearing that it might encourage someone to buy this product and then suffer the bad fate as other folks. But in all honesty, it worked great for my wife, and she did not face this problem. But it does look like there is something which has been missed by manufacturer in the testing and research since so many other people are affected. Don&#x27;t know what to say! May everyone get well and back to health soon, my best wishes.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy this product and use it on a friend, however, these reviews made me think otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few minutes ago I reported this product to Consumer Reports AND the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).  I suggest all of you should do the same... inform them of your injuries. It sounds like this product needs to be taken off the shelves and the right people need to know. Suave is NOT going to help... they will just appease.</li>
            <li> I saw this kit at Wal-mart for 10 bucks. I have very long very thick curly hair. Its also color treated with high lights. I know and read before hand that i shouldnt use this. But i decided what tha....im a gambler. I only left the first part on for 10 min....did step two...then three. I do not blow dry my hair so I waited for it to dry. My hair normally dries in ringlets. So after about two hours out in the sun my hair was strait as an arrow. My few highlights looked a little lighter but that is the only thing I could tell different. Its been two weeks and its still coming out strait when I wash it. I don&#x27;t understand why so many are having problems. Maybe different hair types. I guess thats why suave is asking people to call them. I will use again.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I saw a commercial for this product.  With summer humidity approaching I could not wait to get my hands on this product.  Keratin would make my hair so healthy...boy was I wrong!!  I started to apply, luckily to the underside of my hair first, I noticed some hair collecting in the comb, but didn&#x27;t seem like too much.  When I got to the front section of my hair I noticed the breakage and what it was really doing to my hair.  I jumped in the shower and washed my hair 3 times, it felt gummy and weird.  Started to dry, and it seemed most of my hair survived.  I couldn&#x27;t really brush through because of the texture it created, went in shower again washed 4 more times.  I was able to blow dry but it took forever it just would not dry.  Again in the shower and washed like 5 times. My hair still has a weird texture to it when wet and there is breakage all over.  I am lucky I have a lot of hair so it is not as noticeable.  I can clearly see the breakage all over, sort of looks frizzy.  My hair is overall fried.  I will be cutting a lot of in hopes of improving and will be getting some intensive conditioning treatments this coming Saturday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, do not use!  It is not a keratin treatment, it is pure chemicals, not healthy or safe.  I plan on contacting the consumer products safety board and advise others to do so also.  I am also going to contact my congress women.  I was lucky I washed out right away, my hair mostly survived, though insanely damaged.  This is ha dangerous product!!  I really don&#x27;t understand why Suave would sell this crap and destroy it&#x27;s reputation.  Why they didn&#x27;t just offer a great smoothing conditioning treatment is beyond me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I went to my salon this morning, my appointment is tomorrow...my hair is so bad I was hoping for some help/advice in the meantime.  I walked in and immediately my stylist ran over and said \\&quot;omg, what happened!\\&quot;.  She says we will need to cut at least 4inches and do some intensive treatments biweekly.  Also I will have a color rinse done to try to fix the striping of my color.  She sent me home with $80 worth of at home treatment for damaged hair.  Shampoo, conditioner and treatment.  I am sitting with the treatment in now and my hair instantly soaked it up.  I could use the whole tube and my hair would still suck it all up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  went to salon.  Had 3 inches cut off, a Malibu(gently clarifies hair of most residue),a conditioning treatment and color(because this product lightened my hair not in a good way).  $400 and my hair is still terrible, but at least I can go out in public.  Now that my hair is somewhat presentable I am more focused on the headache and scalp pain I have since doing this treatment.  I plan on giving my head at least 4 days of rest so I am hoping the scalp heals.  As for the headache I believe it is because of the chemical smell of my hair that will not go away.  Also I notice my hands burn if I touch my hair a lot...hopefully the malibu treatment helps this side effect and help rid my hair of the chemical residue.  I filed a report with the consumer products safety commission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/1 update: I would like let you all know my hair still is a mess. The breakage is what haunts me most, I look like tweety bird!! The hair at my crown (a good number of strands) sticks straight up due to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4/9 update:  I went and got 3 more inches cut off(6 in total).  Hoping the breakage stops.</li>
            <li> So this morning I woke up early to use this stuff thinking it was a nice inexpensive keratin treatment that would fix my previously fried hair and make it silky and make it so i wouldnt even have to straighten the life out of it for awhile. Well i should have checked the ratings before because it fried my hair just as bad as a double process of 40 volume bleach. The first few inches are okay. But the ends and especially where i bleached under my bangs and in the front is crispy and feels like i senged it with a lighter. I was so sad. I thought i was gonna go to school with nice fresh looking hair and i got fried. What a great ending to the worst week ever. Don&#x27;t buy this if you have bleached your hair should be on the warning.. Its really your worst enemy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any traumatizing hair loss or damage.  I used the product as directed, and my hair is pretty smooth.  In the past, I&#x27;ve spent $300 on a Brazilian Blowout at a salon, which gave me gorgeous, lustrous hair.  I also spent $150 on a Keratin Express Blowout at a salon, which gave me smooth hair for about a month - but nothing gorgeous.  I&#x27;d say the results from the Suave Keratin treatment gave me hair that&#x27;s about a step below the $150 treatment I got from the salon.  I naturally have thick, wavy and sometimes coarse hair - which is probably why it was able to handle the product better than some of the other users.  So while my hair is smoother now after the treatment, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;WOW\\&quot; hair.  But for a price tag of about $11, I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But based off of the other reviews for this product, I&#x27;d take caution...it&#x27;s obviously not made for all hair types!</li>
            <li> I have to first of all say that I&#x27;m very fortunate to not have some of the extreme results others have had ie. hair falling out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair is a hot mess now! I did the survey and read the warnings and from all of the information provided found no reason that this product should be incompatible with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, after rinsing the product out, my hair was sooo kinky that I couldn&#x27;t even get a brush through it. It was seriously like a brillo pad. After blow drying it, I was devastated, it was nothing like I had expected or hoped for. I took the time to flat iron it and it looked nice for the two days that I couldn&#x27;t wash it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first 48 hours, I washed with the Keratin Infusion shampoo and conditioner. Same story, I was unable to get a brush through my hair again. It was back to being a brillo pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without putting more work into my hair than should be required, my hair looks like a fried mess. I switched shampoo and conditioner midway through my first week to an intensive repair product. I am now able to at least get my hair brushed, but still it looks like crap! Even when I do blow dry and flat iron, my hair is stiff/limp and lifeless! Oh how I wish I had my annoying waves back! I am seriously considering getting a haircut but from the looks of it, I will have to get 3-4 inches cut off. I keep hoping that the longer I put up with it, the less embarassing it will be and I can avoid chopping off all that I have worked hard to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others have mentioned, this is not the real deal. It smells just like a perm and is really a chemical relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product to anyone. To those who have had positive results, one word...LUCKY!</li>
            <li> I saw this product in a magazine as a &#x27;must use&#x27; and thought I would try it.  Based on the name having \\&quot;keratin\\&quot; and \\&quot;smoothing\\&quot; in it, I assumed that this was a deep conditioning product that would smooth down my fly aways.  After this product fried my hair and took away any body it ever posessed, I did some more research and found out that this is actually a straightening product that has the same ingredients as a perm.  Once I realized this, I washed my hair in hopes that it would not set, but to no avail.  I think Suave needs to repackage this as a straightening system.  I&#x27;m sorry I ever used it.</li>
            <li> The product smells like a perm because I analyzed the ingredients today, and it&#x27;s basically a temporary straight perm.  The top and main ingredient is ammonium thioglycolate.  Which is the main ingredient in perm solutions.  Use this product extremely cautiously.  It&#x27;s very dangerous and can fry, damage, and give u bald spots if u over use it or do not follow the directions and the RED CAUTION STATEMENTS on the box.  This product is meant to be used in salons by a hair professional because the general public has no idea what these chemicals could do.  Or how harmful they are.  Shame on Suave for introducing a potentially harmful product to the general public.</li>
            <li> this is a great product  keeps my curly hair manageable . and feels so soft and not as  thick. will use this all the time.no frizz  just a great product all around ..</li>
            <li> POISON!!!!!!!!!!!!!DO NOT USE THIS!!!!! NO EXAGGERATION...HALF THE HAIR ON MY HEAD CAME OUT!!!! The hair that did stay in my head looks like i got a nappy perm!!!!! I had it in for 2 min and immediately washed it out because i saw it getting nappy. I\\&quot;ve had conditioner inALL DAY and its still nappy and completely broken EVERYWHERE!!! I have long hair. Now I have to cut it into a pixie cut!!!  I am sick to my stomach,physically sick! Suave legal team will be hearing from my attorneys. NOT KIDDING!!!! I gave it 1 star because 0 wasnt an option. My hair was thick and gorgeous this morning. Now it&#x27;s disgusting! DISGUSTING</li>
            <li> Three words, WASTE OF MONEY! Thank GOd My hair didn&#x27;t fall out like the other reviewers...but it did get all cracked and thus frizzy on top....ironic for a SMOOTHING product! Yeah! ANd the rest of my hair is not even very smooth, I think the first problem is the wording it should be called a relaxer or a straightener not a smoother!!!! It seems from teh pitures on here it is meant for very frizzy hair. My hair is very straight, so it didn&#x27;t do much except apparently make it more brittle so it broke a bit on top and no I did not have any of the do not use if things going on... and I also didn&#x27;t leave it in the full 15 minutes but rinsed after 12 just to make sure it didn&#x27;t go overkill and because frankly after the smell of the stuff (REEKS LIKE RAW SEWERAGE!!! NO JOKE!!!!!) I was skeptical and nauseated! so my advice to customers, DON:T BE ONE! and to Suave, PULL THIS PRODUCT before you do anymore damage to your reputation!!!!! PRAYING it does not get worse like it did for others during the do not wash days ahead!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the amount of comments on how bad this product is.&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, I absolutely love the results of my hair! I use to have wavy, slightly frizzy, medium thickness, hair. I used to dry my hair for 30 minutes with a blow dryer, then another 15 minutes with a straighter to make it not frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I never even have to blow dry my hair! It drys beautifully and silky soft, all by itself!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I recommend if you do choose to use this product, have a professional hair dresser apply it. I believe that 99%  of the bad reviews of people saying it fried their hair, is because they did not read the directions carefully. Step 1 is the most important! Don&#x27;t leave it in your hair for any longer than 10 minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well good luck! And hope you have the same amazing results I did!! :D</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and thought I would try this to get rid of some of that humidity friz for the summer. I now have what looks like a bald spot coming in. Layers from my hair breaking in half and a rats nest that can&#x27;t be combed! I read the reviews and thought to myself: Self, Your hair is healthy and you won&#x27;t have those problems..... NOT the case!! Please stay away! It&#x27;s not worth the risk! Now i have to cut my long hair off and pay a stylist to do some kind of conditioning treatment so i dont have to wear a hat all summer!!! :(</li>
            <li> I took a stab at trying this product because I \\&quot;thought\\&quot; it was just a smoothing \\&quot;vitamin\\&quot; type treatment. WRONG. I should have figured it out right away when I opened the tube and it smelled like perm solution. What was I thinking? I followed the instructions perfectly, and now my hair is stringy in some sections and breaking in others. I feel for the woman from Pennsylvania because I know what she must be feeling. I have never had an issue with Suave products. They&#x27;re not great, but just ok. This product is horrible, and should be removed from the market. My hair is still wavy, it didn&#x27;t smooth it at all. Just made some spots damaged and others seem unchanged. What a waste, and good thing I didn&#x27;t spend much. However, the damage it does to your hair isn&#x27;t worth any amount of money! It takes years to mend the damage stuff like this can do. Stupid Suave, get a clue.</li>
            <li> After putting this Suave product on my hair, within less than 5 minutes, my hair was falling out in clumps. It was awful. I jumped in the shower crying and praying that I wouldn&#x27;t lose all of my hair. Although I feel hair is a luxury, I did not want to be bald. I am blessed with thick hair and lost about a third of the volume of my hair. I am pleading with anyone that reads this .....do not use this product! I now see that others actually have bald spots ....just find a way to be thankful with what God gave you ....even if it is curls...</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what is said it would.  I have thin fine hair naturally straight but the last few years it has been super frizzy, unruly, and unmanageable.  This completely took the frizzy out 100%.  I have used so much products for frizz and nothing but this has worked. My hair is soft, sleek, silky and shiny.  I am waiting 30 days to see if it lasts.  So if you like very straight silky hair this is the product!</li>
            <li> God I wish I had read these reviews before I bought this product.  What a disaster!  My hair feels like straw and is breaking off all over.  When I run my hands through my hair little tiny pieces constantly fall to the ground.  The ends are fried bad!  I followed the directions precisely.  But what concerned me was the smell.  I&#x27;ve done and had done keratin treatments before but this smelled like a perm and I remember experimenting years ago with a chemical straightener (which also turned out badly) and it smelled the same way.  Other keratin treatments have a different smell.  I don&#x27;t believe this is keratin at all but simply chemical straightening.  Keratin treatments leave your hair soft and smooth and more manageable.  This had the opposite effect and I hope to God its not permanent.  My only hope is to cut as much off as possible and hope the new growth comes in normally.  I also remember being told that virgin hair does not usually respond as well to keratin treatments because chemically treated hair is more porous and absorbs the keratin better.  Needless to say my hair did not absorb any keratin at all but is literally fried.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!I</li>
            <li> I thought that I had the ideal hair for this product. I tried the strand test and everything appeared to work just fine but when I applied it to my whole head, tragedy struck! The last 5-6 inches of hair died completely! Everywhere! It could not be flat-ironed, blow-dried smooth, or even combed! I had to schedule an emergency appointment at the salon and get it all whacked off. Now I am sporting a Hillary Clinton hairstyle. It&#x27;s not the end of the world, but it could have been. If you want to keep your hair, dont use this product!</li>
            <li> I like many others writing a review for this product have had a horrible horrible experience with this product, if I could give it no stars I would. I&#x27;ve only cried 2 times from what i&#x27;ll call a \\&quot;hair disaster\\&quot;, and this one is definitely the one I cried more about. I color my hair on occasion but not within several months before using this product. I followed the instructions to the T and it just is awful. By the end of it my hair was more frizzy than it was originally and my hair which originally was just wavy is now straight till about half way down where it then frizzes out into a big poof. The last 5 inches of my hair literally looks like someone tried to pick out a fro and nothing I can do can help it. I spend more than an hour yesterday trying to blow dry and straighten my hair out and by the end it looked almost exactly the same. The tips of my hair are now a tight curl that constantly feels sticky and damp, I cant even brush it. The few time sI have been able to get a comb or brush through it ive lost lots of hair that breaks off and comes out in clumps. There was just nothing good that came out of my using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not softer or smoother after using this product, in fact its the opposite. Please any one reading this review dont take the chance with this. Its not worth the gamble!! Pick something else with a better rating or just spring for an in salon treatment.</li>
            <li> Add me to the list of ladies who sat crying in my room after doing this \\&quot;treatment\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Ruined my hair so bad I had to get 4 inches of \\&quot;dead\\&quot; hair cut off!! I was so embarrassed to walk into the Salon to get this \\&quot;fixed.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;After the cut and deep conditioning, I still have \\&quot;dead\\&quot; hair and my hair is short now. Short and dead. You can visualize just how nice THAT looks! Can&#x27;t out it up in a pony since its too short. I can&#x27;t do anything about it now so I&#x27;m trying to style it the best I can so it doesn&#x27;t look like crap. Can&#x27;t wait to have to start explaining myself to my friends and family. They haven&#x27;t seen my new \\&quot; look\\&quot; yet.&lt;br /&gt;My stylist says my hair is very damaged and it&#x27;ll take a long time to get all the \\&quot;dead\\&quot; hair gone and get it back to the way it was before the treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Spoke to a representative at Suave today. I&#x27;m getting a refund for the product plus a coupon for a Nexxus treatment. She told me to send them all of my receipts and a \\&quot;review-board\\&quot; will decide if Suave will reimburse me for my haircut and deep conditioning treatments I purchased. They want before and after pics but unfortunately didn&#x27;t take any pics of myself right after I did the treatment. I wish I had.&lt;br /&gt;What a disaster!!!!! How I wish I had read all of these negative reviews before doing this to myself.</li>
            <li> For some reason my hair has changed yet again and tends to get frizzy now. I&#x27;m not a fan of this new trial. I tried the Keratin Infusion 30 day Smoothing Kit and have to say I was pleasantly pleased with the results. I will definitely use again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend reading the item details carefully to see if you can actually use this product.  I color my hair about twice a year and, even then, it is not recommended that I use this.  I have wavy hair, especially in the summer, and I had hoped to use it to calm the curls on humid days.  However, I am not able to use it and I plan on coloring my hair again, so I don&#x27;t see myself using it anytime soon.  A salon can treat color-treated hair and may be worth the $.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I tried this kit - she has hair that&#x27;s almost straight naturally and I have wavy.  Neither of us saw marked improvement in straightening, as we have with other products.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a three star review because I can not make an honest determination about ths product.  My box did not come with any directions for use. I have not been able to secure the product in stores or online so that in the hope I could get a box with directions.  I could possibly write to Suave, but The reviews I remember run the gamut from works great to my hair fell out, and the product seems to have been pulled from shelves so I am disclined to subject myself to the testing of this one.</li>
