            <li>I went on a &amp;#34;mission&amp;#34; to find the oils that helped restore my hair, and of the many brands I tried, this one is the best for my medium-textured long hair.</li>
            <li>This Argan oil easily matches the hair-nourishing benefits and quality of much more expensive/exclusive brands.  </li>
            <li>Would like them better if they were truly chemical free.</li>
            <li>Love it, have been using it daily for s6 months and my hair has a great restored shine to it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This oil works great on my very long, very fine hair.</li>

            <li>I like that it is chemical free.</li>
            <li>Smooths hair yet light and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>And while claiming to be chemical free, they do have silicone in them.</li>
            <li>i have a freezy hair most of the time especially if i dont use iron straightening to my hair and this product really help my hair into the style i want, it gives volume to my hair and makes it look shiny and beautiful in style.</li>
            <li>The Renpure Originals Argan Deep Penetrating Oil is Amazing!</li>
            <li>I love my hair now and will honestly say that this is a God Sent because unlike never before, I actually Enjoy and look forward to all of the time and effort I&#x27;m putting into developing and maintaining my natural hair thanks to the Renpure line of hair products.</li>

            <li>I highly recommend and will forever be a dedicated customer to this company :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light, natural scent.</li>
            <li>An extra plus is the nice smell.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else now either and the price is right.</li>
            <li>If I use it at night after I shower and sleep on it, my hair looks pretty and tousled in the morning.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of the Ren-Pure hair care products now and love them all.  </li>
            <li>Not this one- soaks in nicely and softens my curls, makes them looks shiny without looking greasy, and doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair or weigh it down.</li>
            <li>Even with fine hair I find this does not weigh it down and keeps my hair smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I have curly, very frizzy prone hair</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much on my hair and it&#x27;s medium length.</li>
            <li>i have been using bottles and bottles of argan oil treatment for my hair for over years now and somehow this product really work on me.</li>
            <li>and so it cannot really moisturize the hair.</li>
            <li>And the other pluses are that it has No sodium chloride, salt, dyes, sulfates, parabens or gluten, it is a&lt;br /&gt;Color safe formula</li>
            <li>Very soothing, making skin very soft!</li>
            <li>and I put a dimes worth on my wet hair and style as usual and my hair is very shinny and easy to manage and frizz free.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for my fellow curly haired folks.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend this oil as this is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for all the girls out there</li>
            <li>My dried out and over-worked hair became more supple, hydrated and substantial.</li>
            <li>I found it on Amazon a few months ago and my ends are healthy again.</li>
            <li>Turns dry into smooth instantly.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li>put a whole bunch of goop into your hair, only to rinse 99.5% of it out in the shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have straight hair not thin, not thick and believe anyone could use this,,,,,,, as it helps condition it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>The lower third of my long hair was drying out and becoming extremely lifeless.  </li>
            <li>This oil treatment has really helped both mine and my mother&#x27;s hair to eliminate the dry and course feeling.</li>
            <li>It made my hair very poofy and dry.</li>
            <li>It tames my hair like no other product I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I put this on the other day and after one use my hair feels so much softer, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily at all.</li>
            <li>tried one other brand of Argan Oil and it was much heavier than this brand.</li>
            <li>I have color-treated hair, and I live in a desert dry climate.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve already written such a long and informative review on the Renpure Coconut Milk wash that I can&#x27;t even think of any other ways to describe how these products have been the miracle for my natural 3C/4A hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Moroccan and Argon oil brands for my curly hair which can get very dry in the winter (and dyeing it probably doesn&#x27;t help it).</li>
            <li> while at the lake every weekend) has been feeling very dry and not very soft.</li>
            <li> It helps if your hairs are dry and have split ends</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy hair</li>
            <li> I use this everyday out of the shower and on occassions throughout the middle of my day when my hair is a little extra out of control and frizzy.</li>

            <li> I have thick hair, so I was surprised when other brands don&#x27;t absorb well and looked greasy.</li>

            <li> And we currently live in England where the water is very hard.</li>
            <li> It is the least expensive of the chemical free brands that I have found.</li>
            <li> But my hair has never been silkier, in less than a month the shampoo, Coconut Co-Wash, and Argan Deep Pentetrating Oil has allowed me to have VERY LITTLE to NO SHEDDING or BREAKAGE after years and years and YEARS of throwing handfuls of hair in the trash with every wash, brush, or combing of my hair.</li>
            <li> It lets my hair be silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I use it after showering on slightly damp hair as instructed.</li>
            <li> And it does not have a heavy fragrance.</li>

            <li> I have thick curly/wavy hair 3a-3c.</li>
            <li> even after hair dried, it still had faint plastic odor.  </li>
            <li> Very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> sorry.</li>
            <li> My hair was unable to keep in any moisture because that is what silicone does.</li>
            <li> If it starts getting expensive, I&#x27;ll have to move on though.</li>

            <li> One of my favorite hair products. Makes my hair feel so soft.</li>
            <li> oaky so far, I ma most impressed by the fragrance of the oil. I am not at home too often to use it but when I am I  use it quite often.</li>
            <li> This brand Argan oil is different. I have used morrocon (good), Amazon only organic brand (smelly), but this is wonderful, smells awesome and is very think and not at all greasy.</li>
            <li> This oil treatment has really helped both mine and my mother&#x27;s hair to eliminate the dry and course feeling. We put it in just after showering and it does not feel oily at all.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and have tried a lot a products. This is the best. My curls love it!</li>
            <li> Very soothing, making skin very soft!</li>
            <li> The Renpure Originals Argan Deep Penetrating Oil is Amazing! My hair which is color treated &amp; blow dried and in the hot sun (while at the lake every weekend) has been feeling very dry and not very soft. I put this on the other day and after one use my hair feels so much softer, it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily at all. It has a very nice light scent which by the way smells wonderful. I met up with my friends after using this and the Renpure shampoo and my friends all were like you smell so good! I am so glad i decided to try this oil for my hair and will most definitely, will be purchasing this again. And the other pluses are that it has No sodium chloride, salt, dyes, sulfates, parabens or gluten, it is a&lt;br /&gt;Color safe formula and it&#x27;s Made in the U.S.A</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several Moroccan and Argon oil brands for my curly hair which can get very dry in the winter (and dyeing it probably doesn&#x27;t help it).

            <li> Smells great and feels great going through the hair. I use it after showering on slightly damp hair as instructed. Hair feels pretty good! will buy again</li>
            <li> I have very dry frizzy hair and I am always looking for something to tame the fro. I use this everyday out of the shower and on occassions throughout the middle of my day when my hair is a little extra out of control and frizzy. It does the job!</li>
            <li> This product is great, I use it 2 to 3 times a week, between washings. I have straight hair not thin, not thick and believe anyone could use this,,,,,,, as it helps condition it without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this oil from 4 months now. It helps if your hairs are dry and have split ends and I leave no oil residue. I like this oil and I would highly recommend this oil as this is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful! I have curly, very frizzy prone hair and I put a dimes worth on my wet hair and style as usual and my hair is very shinny and easy to manage and frizz free.</li>

            <li> This Argan oil easily matches the hair-nourishing benefits and quality of much more expensive/exclusive brands.  I have color-treated hair, and I live in a desert dry climate. The lower third of my long hair was drying out and becoming extremely lifeless.  I went on a &amp;#34;mission&amp;#34; to find the oils that helped restore my hair, and of the many brands I tried, this one is the best for my medium-textured long hair. My dried out and over-worked hair became more supple, hydrated and substantial. I use the oil daily because it soaks into the hair. As a bonus, the price makes it a great value.</li>
            <li> tried to use --  not even one week.  could not take the plastic odor when on wet hair and even after hair dried, it still had faint plastic odor.  threw out.  sorry. i do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for your hair did and beard.</li>
            <li> i have been using bottles and bottles of argan oil treatment for my hair for over years now and somehow this product really work on me. i have a freezy hair most of the time especially if i dont use iron straightening to my hair and this product really help my hair into the style i want, it gives volume to my hair and makes it look shiny and beautiful in style. Highly recommend for all the girls out there</li>
            <li> This oil works great on my very long, very fine hair. I like that it is chemical free. And we currently live in England where the water is very hard. So this oil helps keep my hair healthy and shiny! It is the least expensive of the chemical free brands that I have found. And it does not have a heavy fragrance. On the subscribe and save it ships to APO addresses which is another plus for me.</li>
            <li> There is a ton of silicone in this and so it cannot really moisturize the hair. I used this after to seal my wash and go. It made my hair very poofy and dry. My hair was unable to keep in any moisture because that is what silicone does. It is a barrier. I have thick curly/wavy hair 3a-3c. Not a good product for naturally curly girls!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; conditioner. This is faster and nicer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why put a whole bunch of goop into your hair, only to rinse 99.5% of it out in the shower?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, try using some of this oil once you&#x27;re out of the shower and your hair has been washed. It&#x27;s a nicer conditioning effect and you don&#x27;t waste a whole bunch of goop, water, and time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells nice too. It&#x27;s a very light, natural scent. The scent is so light that it&#x27;s fine for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried one other brand of Argan Oil and it was much heavier than this brand. I like this brand better.</li>
            <li> I have my highlights done every two months. When I was using this my hairdresser didn&#x27;t  ask me about when we will cut my ends. Awhile back my local store stopped selling it and I went without. My hair dresser was pushing to cut my hair each time. I found it on Amazon a few months ago and my ends are healthy again. An extra plus is the nice smell.</li>
            <li> Love it, have been using it daily for s6 months and my hair has a great restored shine to it.&lt;br /&gt;Not heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Best Product for my damaged hair! Can&#x27;t believe the extra growth and healthiness. Will purchase again so I never run out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff ! Turns dry into smooth instantly. I can&#x27;t find it anywhere else now either and the price is right. If it starts getting expensive, I&#x27;ll have to move on though. But for now, I love it.</li>
            <li> it works great on my hair !!!!</li>
            <li> Smooths hair yet light and non-greasy. Very subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already written such a long and informative review on the Renpure Coconut Milk wash that I can&#x27;t even think of any other ways to describe how these products have been the miracle for my natural 3C/4A hair. But my hair has never been silkier, in less than a month the shampoo, Coconut Co-Wash, and Argan Deep Pentetrating Oil has allowed me to have VERY LITTLE to NO SHEDDING or BREAKAGE after years and years and YEARS of throwing handfuls of hair in the trash with every wash, brush, or combing of my hair. I love my hair now and will honestly say that this is a God Sent because unlike never before, I actually Enjoy and look forward to all of the time and effort I&#x27;m putting into developing and maintaining my natural hair thanks to the Renpure line of hair products. I highly recommend and will forever be a dedicated customer to this company :)</li>
            <li> I love the Renpure cleansing conditioner, and would probably like this product more but I feel the company is deceiving. They have the same photo on this one as they do the cleansing conditioner for their &#x27;before&#x27; and &#x27;after&#x27; photos. Sketchy if you ask me. And while claiming to be chemical free, they do have silicone in them. Would like them better if they were truly chemical free.</li>
            <li> not what i was looking for</li>
            <li> I have tried several of the Ren-Pure hair care products now and love them all.  Even with fine hair I find this does not weigh it down and keeps my hair smooth and moisturized.</li>
