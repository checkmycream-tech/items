            <li>No bueno..no good.</li>
            <li>Why not?&amp;#34; they fit perfectly the liner and the diamonds were a dream as well as the magnum tips.</li>
            <li>over all they came quick best part.</li>
            <li>These tips were excellent for all my needs real high quality.</li>
            <li>I have alot of background in CNC machining and this kind of quality</li>
            <li>They are a lot more sturdier than my old tips which I threw out and the box they came is perfect.</li>
            <li>Love this set.good quality.</li>
            <li>OK LET&#x27;S START WITH</li>
            <li>so I was really satisfied with everything.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m glad that the set from this seller came in</li>
            <li>and I am glad I came across these.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon prime</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you have my 20 words now.</li>
            <li>and I would probably be somewhat satisfied....</li>
            <li>Anyone is better off with the 1x time use tubes.  </li>
            <li>I was happy to get these fast and they were packed good as well can always use extra stuff :)</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend them for anyone looking for a tremendous deal on some very good quality tips.</li>
            <li>these are super cheap made, I will not be able to use the tips for magnums and flats at all.</li>
            <li>and since I wanted to make sure they were the right size I thought, &amp;#34;what the hell?</li>
            <li>Im not sure how I can get one perfect set and then get........</li>
            <li>Plus they rusted when i tried to clean them.</li>
            <li>I tried to clean the 3RL with a</li>
            <li>Will be returning for full refund if not....</li>
            <li>The first set I ordered was exactly what it should be, so I ordered 2 more sets.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it...!!!</li>
            <li>these are great made very well solid stainless steel</li>
            <li>I now have 3 of this exact set.</li>
            <li>First time tattoo&#x60;r</li>
            <li>Normally I am pretty generous when it comes to rating my reviews....</li>
            <li>product was exactly as decribed.</li>
            <li>and I strongly advise you to order a different set from a different seller cuz the extra dollar or 2 is more than likely deffinately worth it!!!</li>
            <li>The tips do not have double etched slots for easy cleaning</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t spit out much or too much ink can never be consistent.  </li>
            <li>Real oganized set.</li>
            <li>Seller had fast shipping</li>
            <li>im am very upset about this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a very picky person and if these tips would actually fit in my grip or if they didnt seem like they will instantly destroy perfectly good needles, I probably would take the time to sort through them and find the correct size to give them a shot</li>
            <li>the magnum tips 5,7,9,11,13,15,17 as they are not really in the picture and most s</li>
            <li>this came fast exatly what i wanted no complaints here at all.</li>
            <li>I will be getting more soon for my other atrests</li>
            <li>the tips are cheap looking and look like an antique, they just pour ink out everywhere and wont hold a vaccum unless you go down a size on tube, example 5rl in 3rl tube.</li>
            <li>I use these frequently, have had no problems.</li>
            <li>Only problem is that they don&#x27;t have the size engraved on the tip but as long as I keep them in the right order it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t fit the needles due to poor machining and didn&#x27;t drill the holes to proper size to fit the standard tattoo needles.</li>
            <li>these so called stainless steel tips were not worth the money nor the wait.</li>

            <li> the round tubes seem okay, other than a few burrs.</li>
            <li> The sizes are not accurate or consistant,  most definately not made out of stainless steel, inside these tips appear to be dirty, very sloppy craftsmanship, appears to have been welded or soldered and these spots actually look like super glue or maybe even hot glue</li>
            <li> The flat tips are uneven,and the liner tips are entirely too big, and in at least one case,not even straight.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple.</li>
            <li> might like this product but if your in the game already highly suggest you dont</li>
            <li> I refuse to waste a single needle or a drop of ink on these to even try it out.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these, once received just poor poor quality.  </li>
            <li> is something a manufacturer should get shut down for on the grounds of incompetence.</li>
            <li> amazon did refund half our monies and of course applied that to another tip kit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disapointed there is no option for anything less than 1 star.</li>
            <li> The flats/mags are flat metal rolled into a flat/mag and have a slit through the entire tip making it nearly impossible to tighten on the grip.</li>
            <li> Ordered these a week or so ago and well to say the least What i received in the mail is not even close to this picture.</li>
            <li> But if I must: Tips are VERY poorly machined,from what is NOT stainless steel,and the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t even bother to grind off the burrs.</li>
            <li> but these tips are no good.</li>
            <li> POOR POOR</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re machined poorly, burrs all over them, rust spots, not centered at all.</li>
            <li> explanation of the tip use was poor</li>
            <li> Wtf?</li>
            <li> The tips I actually recieved are very poorly manufactured!!!</li>
            <li> its going in the trash along with my money spent on this crap!!!</li>
            <li> I am very angry about the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> The seller needs to reevaluate their association with whoever it is they get these from because this gives the seller a bad name too.</li>
            <li> I am a beginner myself and this set is useless!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use these frequently, have had no problems. I like the variety that comes in this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again, quality is great.</li>
            <li> Love this set.good quality. Still lasting to this day 3 years later!</li>
            <li> these are great made very well solid stainless steel i dont think you would use all these diff tips but there are alot to choose from</li>
            <li> these so called stainless steel tips were not worth the money nor the wait. I am very angry about the quality of this product. Some of the tips were bent. Plus they rusted when i tried to clean them. Wtf?</li>
            <li> These tips were excellent for all my needs real high quality. Real oganized set. Seller had fast shipping</li>
            <li> OK LET&#x27;S START WITH THE PICTURE IS NOT WHAT YOU WILL GET!!!!!!!. Ordered these a week or so ago and well to say the least What i received in the mail is not even close to this picture. The tips do not have double etched slots for easy cleaning it&#x27;s standard with one open hole. Secondly the outlining tips have issues the 7RL and 9RL won&#x27;t fit the needles due to poor machining and didn&#x27;t drill the holes to proper size to fit the standard tattoo needles. The flats/mags are flat metal rolled into a flat/mag and have a slit through the entire tip making it nearly impossible to tighten on the grip. POOR POOR MADE PRODUCT. amazon did refund half our monies and of course applied that to another tip kit hopefully we get what the pic shows.</li>
            <li> I now have 3 of this exact set. The first set I ordered was exactly what it should be, so I ordered 2 more sets. They arrived 3 days after i placed the order here, which is awesome but these tips are no good. Im not sure how I can get one perfect set and then get........whatever you want to call this. They&#x27;re machined poorly, burrs all over them, rust spots, not centered at all. I have alot of background in CNC machining and this kind of quality is something a manufacturer should get shut down for on the grounds of incompetence. The seller needs to reevaluate their association with whoever it is they get these from because this gives the seller a bad name too.</li>
            <li> The purchase was great the product was what it was supposed to be so I was really satisfied with everything.</li>
            <li> No bueno..no good. My DT wear off an need some filing ..over all they came quick best part. First time tattoo&#x60;r might like this product but if your in the game already highly suggest you dont</li>
            <li> I bought these and they came almost instantly within 2 days of me actually just ordering them. I tried the sizing on some needles that I wasn&#x27;t going to use and since I wanted to make sure they were the right size I thought, &amp;#34;what the hell? Why not?&amp;#34; they fit perfectly the liner and the diamonds were a dream as well as the magnum tips. They are a lot more sturdier than my old tips which I threw out and the box they came is perfect. Only problem is that they don&#x27;t have the size engraved on the tip but as long as I keep them in the right order it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem. Definitely recommend them for anyone looking for a tremendous deal on some very good quality tips. Bought a set like this months ago and they never came in and I emailed the seller and they said they sent another set but that one did not come in either. So I&#x27;m glad that the set from this seller came in and they blew me away in price, speediness of the delivery and overall satisfaction. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Like the set. It has everything I need all in one place. This has served me well and I am glad I came across these.</li>
            <li> Great products.  Love Amazon prime</li>
            <li> Garbage. Plain and simple. I&#x27;m supposed to write a 20 word review,but I don&#x27;t need to. Garbage says it all. But if I must: Tips are VERY poorly machined,from what is NOT stainless steel,and the manufacturer doesn&#x27;t even bother to grind off the burrs. The flat tips are uneven,and the liner tips are entirely too big, and in at least one case,not even straight. I&#x27;m sure you have my 20 words now.</li>
            <li> the tips are cheap looking and look like an antique, they just pour ink out everywhere and wont hold a vaccum unless you go down a size on tube, example 5rl in 3rl tube.</li>
            <li> I was happy to get these fast and they were packed good as well can always use extra stuff :)</li>
            <li> these are super cheap made, I will not be able to use the tips for magnums and flats at all. the round tubes seem okay, other than a few burrs. Had I known this was this low quality I would not have purchased.</li>
            <li> It was just what it said it was and everything I needed. I would rec amend to anyone who is doing tattoos.</li>
            <li> the shading tips are JUNK. im am very upset about this product.</li>
            <li> Good!! excellent items, its perfect and work excellent this is best good and I think buy more again thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Normally I am pretty generous when it comes to rating my reviews.... with this product I&#x27;m disapointed there is no option for anything less than 1 star. These are definately not the same tips that are in the picture. The tips I actually recieved are very poorly manufactured!!! The sizes are not accurate or consistant,  most definately not made out of stainless steel, inside these tips appear to be dirty, very sloppy craftsmanship, appears to have been welded or soldered and these spots actually look like super glue or maybe even hot glue thats been chrome plated... I am a beginner myself and this set is useless!!! I refuse to waste a single needle or a drop of ink on these to even try it out. I&#x27;m not a very picky person and if these tips would actually fit in my grip or if they didnt seem like they will instantly destroy perfectly good needles, I probably would take the time to sort through them and find the correct size to give them a shot and I would probably be somewhat satisfied.... I regret to inform you this is not the case and I strongly advise you to order a different set from a different seller cuz the extra dollar or 2 is more than likely deffinately worth it!!! I ordered this set and I wished I didn&#x27;t! Will be returning for full refund if not.... its going in the trash along with my money spent on this crap!!!</li>
            <li> tips broke off of a couple and had to throw them away</li>
            <li> the magnum tips 5,7,9,11,13,15,17 as they are not really in the picture and most s*** of this world is that I&#x27;m in Venezuela and I can not return ... I think I lost part of my investment... thx for f... me</li>
            <li> I´m from Costa Rica, my family in California received the items on time...highly recommend it...!!!</li>
            <li> product was exactly as decribed. loved the box the tips came in!!! I will definitely recommend this to anybody!!. it was a great deal also!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these, once received just poor poor quality.  They don&#x27;t spit out much or too much ink can never be consistent.  The 3RL is so incredibly scratched and hasn&#x27;t been smoothed out.  Inside you could see pieces of metal hanging from the interior hole.  I tried to clean the 3RL with a but the brush can&#x27;t even fit all the way in!!!  Anyone is better off with the 1x time use tubes.  Don&#x27;t spend your money on this, I made the mistake and you shouldn&#x27;t have to either!!</li>
            <li> explanation of the tip use was poor</li>
            <li> this came fast exatly what i wanted no complaints here at all. I will be getting more soon for my other atrests</li>
