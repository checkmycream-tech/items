            <li>ITS GREAT!!</li>
            <li>These worked perfectly for my daughters school project and were inexpensive too!</li>
            <li>My daughter is happy!</li>
            <li>The hand was purchased to display rings and has been doing ths wonderfully since purchased - delivery and price great</li>
            <li>I purchased the hands to practice acrylic nails, and they do the job just fine!!!</li>
            <li>no offense if you do lol),</li>
            <li>Oh, it works great for doing acrylic nails too.</li>
            <li>My two youngest granddaughters were happy the two oldest won&#x27;t be using their nails for practice.</li>
            <li>GREAT SIZE AND WORKS WELL</li>
            <li>but it works great...</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This is a great idea for someone who is trying to learn to do nails.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this item and the price is great too.</li>
            <li>I love it because it is perfect for the rings and bracelet that I display for photo shooting and also for sizing.</li>
            <li>She is loving it!</li>
            <li>the hand had some running marks on it, but I am sure it will do the job, just does not look very good when I am giving it as a gift.</li>
            <li>I bought this thinking it might be a good display hand for jewelry.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good model to display my rings and bracelets for photos.</li>
            <li>Good price too.</li>
            <li>Products in good order.  </li>
            <li>Good purchase, I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I tried to find a hand that was easier to clean but this is the best one I could find.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>The hand is a nice size and the quality appears to be good.</li>
            <li>Nice texture and a bit rubbery.  </li>
            <li>Life size hand, wish it would bend at the fingers and stay in the bent position and a stand/holder would&#x27;ve been nice to have.</li>
            <li>(Maybe it would be better for somebody more experienced...)</li>
            <li>I bought this to use to practice (as the name suggests) nail art and to prep nails to put on my own hands.</li>
            <li>I do nails much better and it ended up being a good tool to keep my lil cousins away from all my stuff</li>
            <li>LOL, it looks cool too.</li>
            <li>NO negative comment from me :D</li>
            <li>but it would be very easy to purchase and apply them...</li>
            <li>Nail polish removes very easily allowing someone to practice painting/nail designs over and over.</li>
            <li>I bought this mannequin hand hoping that it would be suitable to use for taking pictures of jewelry that I might have for sale.</li>
            <li>Very lifelike and a good color that will show them off well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably good for its original intention.</li>
            <li>It is very well made and makes a beautiful display for rings, watches or bracelets.</li>
            <li>But its OK for girls play.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my grand daughter</li>
            <li>This will be better for me, and can also let my grandaughter practice her fingernail painting when I&#x27;m not using it.</li>
            <li>But for the most part, it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>I just love my hand</li>
            <li>she love it</li>
            <li>and it was the best $6 I&#x27;ve ever spent.  </li>
            <li>The polish did not come off the nails that easy</li>
            <li>Polish goes on and comes off easily.</li>
            <li>Nail polish cleans off easily to reuse as well.</li>
            <li>and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li>I just painted the nail bed and it looks just fine that way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a hand to practice on which is fine for that</li>
            <li>The fingers don&#x27;t bend, which is fine.</li>
            <li>She has had more fun with this than I ever imagined.  </li>
            <li>For the inexpensive price this practice hand is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used nail tips and trimmed them to fit.</li>
            <li>The item itself is of fine quality and shipped quickly</li>
            <li>The material is very nice, but I think that to make it really complete, must have nails already attach to the hand, so the person really can use it to practice with polish.</li>
            <li>The way the nail wells are designed is not really that great, I would rather they just make it hand-shaped and let you stick on the nails with putty.</li>
            <li>I would really like to have more information on how to use it.</li>
            <li>But since it was such a good price</li>
            <li>Iam ready to order more</li>
            <li>nail tips fit right into the nail beds...</li>
            <li>The hands are of a nice realistic weight for something such as this and lay nicely on the table surface.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly also.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly and packaged well, just as described, would recommend to buyers who would like to practice nail art or hand massage</li>
            <li>Forget about flexing the fingers into a more natural pose.</li>
            <li>She thought it was fun, after she was done using it her</li>
            <li>Not too good product, the nail hole are very deep and acrylic nails are very raised.</li>
            <li>It is good to practice different designs on it, but it isn&#x27;t exactly like a real fingernail.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item specifically because it was advertised as a &amp;#34;left&amp;#34; hand, but it was delivered as a right.  </li>
            <li>Another option that would be nice to have is different skin tones - not everyone is this particular shade of beige and polish takes on different hues on nail beds of different ethnicities, so it would be cool to have the option to choose the one that more closely matches your own or have one of each to get a feel for how the polish will look on your clients if you have a shop/are an aspiring nail tech.</li>
            <li>I would much prefer to see this remodeled to have the nails done more like a realistic nailbed where the cuticles are flat and more in line with the skin of the finger.</li>
            <li>It came very fast and was exacty as advertized.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be more of an average-sized female hand...</li>
            <li>The hand I though it was different in the pictures seem more  manageable  </li>
            <li>It is exactly as stated.  </li>
            <li>This hand is heavy and of good quality.  </li>
            <li>Very realistic looking.</li>
            <li>The length is right, but the whole thing is way too slender to approach a normal woman&#x27;s hand, fingers or wrist.</li>
            <li>The actual hand is fine.</li>
            <li>Thanks Clayre</li>
            <li>and i did, thanks to this hand.</li>
            <li>As also mentioned, it would be a bit nicer if they bent somewhat and stayed in position instead of just lying straight, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her terribly much.</li>
            <li>It just bothers me sooo much.</li>
            <li>It was cheap enough that I do not regret the purchase.</li>
            <li>Originally got this to see if my bird would perch on it like a regular hand since she is so bitey and it did not work for that.</li>
            <li>Other than that I suppose it&#x27;s an okay hand...</li>
            <li>The fingers are very long which works well for a child who isn&#x27;t accustomed to gripping like an adult would be, so I don&#x27;t count this against the model.</li>
            <li>She is a nail polishing fiend and as others have mentioned, I got tired of offering up my own nails to be &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;, so I purchased two of these mannequin hands for her to practice til she ran out of polish or enthusiasm!</li>
            <li>It is very realistic as far as the nail size,etc.</li>
            <li>these are perfect for my 5 year old to practice painting nails, she is always begging to do mine, a little hard to remove polish</li>
            <li>Not a hard plastic.  </li>
            <li>funny accent to my teen daughter&#x27;s room.</li>
            <li>the jokes never get old about lending a hand, or the old classic of pulling your hand off when greeting another person.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 12 year old grandaughter to practice nail polishing and nail art on.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter for her birthday.</li>
            <li>This hand is like the size of a five year old.</li>
            <li>Gave one to my 7 yr old granddaughter for her birthday.</li>
            <li>I was doing direct sales for Jamberry and got nails to put on this hand and put Jamberry wraps on it...</li>
            <li>I mean, I&#x27;m sure some women have this size/shape</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s certainly not an average life-size.</li>
            <li>As other reviews have mentioned and you can even tell in the picture the cuticle bed is very high.</li>
            <li>a little bit longer to arrive than other items in our order, however the online tracking was accurate and the product arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty heavy.</li>
            <li>Recently got a black velvet model for that, but found that when taking the pictures, that the black velvet shined and reflected the light so much that it took away from the jewelry and made a glare in the picture, also showed up every little piece of lint that attached</li>
            <li>I would likely not purchase this particular hand again due to the deep nail edge issue.</li>

            <li> I would likely not purchase this particular hand again due to the deep nail edge issue.</li>
            <li> The biggest &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the cuticle or nail edges/beds are SO deep and inset that it is extremely difficult for her to polish to the edges and clean them completely.</li>
            <li> (although it took USPS a long time to deliver it).  </li>
            <li> It was not clear what I was ordering.....</li>
            <li> A little creepy :)</li>
            <li> ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS THE CUTICLES ARE WIDE BUT OTHER THAN THAT</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of disappointed.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;fingernails&#x27; on it are a little creepy, but the hand itself is actually quite cool.  </li>
            <li> It is made from soft rubber like stuff, and I like that rather than hard plastic.</li>
            <li> This is a fun little creepy hand that she practices on after spending 1/2 hour on Pinterest looking at different nail designs.  </li>
            <li> Because it was so inexpensive, I was afraid that it would be flimsy and look cheap...</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>

            <li> I needed a mannequin hand for taking my state board to get my cosmo license and it did the job. It doesn&#x27;t come with nails so I glued some on that I already had from school and it worked just fine.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for her birthday and it was the best $6 I&#x27;ve ever spent.  She has had more fun with this than I ever imagined.  I thought she would just sit it on her dresser and put rings on it, but she carries it around with her and shows it to everyone and plays tricks with it.  The &#x27;fingernails&#x27; on it are a little creepy, but the hand itself is actually quite cool.  Nice texture and a bit rubbery.  Not a hard plastic.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> probably would not purchase again</li>
            <li> I used this for a theater prop. It did it&#x27;s job. LOL, it looks cool too. It has a hole in the inside of it so someone could hold into it from inside a sleeve.</li>
            <li> It came in the condition it said, and was shipped in a timely manner. NO negative comment from me :D</li>
            <li> The hand was purchased to display rings and has been doing ths wonderfully since purchased - delivery and price great</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves this!</li>
            <li> I bought this mannequin hand hoping that it would be suitable to use for taking pictures of jewelry that I might have for sale. Because it was so inexpensive, I was afraid that it would be flimsy and look cheap...boy was I wrong! It is very well made and makes a beautiful display for rings, watches or bracelets. It does not come with artificial nails but it would be very easy to purchase and apply them...I just painted the nail bed and it looks just fine that way.</li>
            <li> fingers are not moveable and nailbeds are too long, this is not a good product to learn to do nails on</li>
            <li> these are perfect for my 5 year old to practice painting nails, she is always begging to do mine, a little hard to remove polish</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the hand as of yet. I would really like to have more information on how to use it. It will help me out alot. Thanks Clayre</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it might be a good display hand for jewelry. The length is right, but the whole thing is way too slender to approach a normal woman&#x27;s hand, fingers or wrist. It&#x27;s on the anemic, anorexic side. Forget about flexing the fingers into a more natural pose. They are solid, and no amount of heating, short of actual melting will allow you to reposisiton the fingers. It&#x27;s probably good for its original intention.</li>
            <li> I like the product and the idea of it but in the review it states that this practice hand will come with a set of ten practice nails.  However, I failed to receive the practice as they were not sent with this hand.</li>
            <li> Originally got this to see if my bird would perch on it like a regular hand since she is so bitey and it did not work for that. I gave it to my niece to practice painting nails with. She thought it was fun, after she was done using it her and my nephew used it for pranks........</li>
            <li> Not too good product, the nail hole are very deep and acrylic nails are very raised. But its OK for girls play.</li>
            <li> El producto me llego en tiempo y forma, todo bien, estoy dispuesto a comprar nuevamente,completamente satisfecha, se los recomiendo, gracias</li>
            <li> Life size hand, wish it would bend at the fingers and stay in the bent position and a stand/holder would&#x27;ve been nice to have.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my grand daughter so she could practice doing nails. It came very fast and was exacty as advertized.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really not too much to say about a fake hand...except that this one is too small.I thought it was going to be more of an average-sized female hand...but it&#x27;s really narrow and oddly shaped...the hand as well as the fingers are super skinny but extremely long...just very awkward. The nails are, naturally, the same way, which makes it difficult to practice nails on. I mean, I&#x27;m sure some women have this size/shape hand,(and no offense if you do lol), but it&#x27;s certainly not an average life-size. Other than that I suppose it&#x27;s an okay hand...I can&#x27;t use it though. I am looking into another brand to buy to replace it.I&#x27;m a beginner and I find the awkward shape and size of the nails too difficult for me. (Maybe it would be better for somebody more experienced...)</li>
            <li> Got this for my 11-year-old who loves to do nails. She uses it all the time. Great item for the price!</li>
            <li> Nailbeds are too deep and thin, making it unrealistic to practice with. Acrylic application ends up being way to thick to make level with the nail and then if applied correctly, looks retarded when taking pictures because your work and designs are like 2cm below the mannequin&#x27;s cuticle.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a hand to practice on which is fine for that but nail beds are so embeded making the cleaning such a pain.</li>
            <li> The material is very nice, but I think that to make it really complete, must have nails already attach to the hand, so the person really can use it to practice with polish.</li>
            <li> I bought this to transform it into a gorey severed hand for a Halloween party. With a bit of time, paint, makeup, fake blood, and an exacto knife, it really came together.</li>
            <li> this item was supposed to come with 10 removable nail tips. it didn&#x27;t and I am disappointed I didn&#x27;t want to have to use the nails I bought for clients but it seems I shall have to.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a good model to display my rings and bracelets for photos. This was just what I was looking for. Very lifelike and a good color that will show them off well. Recently got a black velvet model for that, but found that when taking the pictures, that the black velvet shined and reflected the light so much that it took away from the jewelry and made a glare in the picture, also showed up every little piece of lint that attached it&#x27;s self to it. This will be better for me, and can also let my grandaughter practice her fingernail painting when I&#x27;m not using it. It is made from soft rubber like stuff, and I like that rather than hard plastic. Arrived quickly also. Very satisfied. Good price too.</li>
            <li> This thing is creepy. the fingers are long and skinny like an alien&#x27;s dismembered hand. the jokes never get old about lending a hand, or the old classic of pulling your hand off when greeting another person. Oh, it works great for doing acrylic nails too.</li>
            <li> The hand I though it was different in the pictures seem more  manageable  but it&#x27;s I little hard to work with</li>
            <li> I got four of these for my granddaughters they have been practicing painting and decorating nails since Christmas. This was the best purchase. My two youngest granddaughters were happy the two oldest won&#x27;t be using their nails for practice.</li>
            <li> The actual hand is fine. It stated in the description that a set of nails were included. They were not! All I received was the hand!</li>
            <li> I wish the nails were longer.... but It&#x27;ll work. The hand is a nice size and the quality appears to be good.</li>
            <li> It is exactly as stated.  It arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  I was disappointed that they don&#x27;t make this item in both a right and a left hand.</li>
            <li> the hand had some running marks on it, but I am sure it will do the job, just does not look very good when I am giving it as a gift.</li>
            <li> I use these for fingerless glove displays. A bit small to use for adults but works well for a youth size glove</li>
            <li> its too hard .....you cant move the fingers or nothing</li>
            <li> I ordered this item specifically because it was advertised as a &amp;#34;left&amp;#34; hand, but it was delivered as a right.  I planned to display a specific piece of jewelry that requires a left hand, so the item is useless for that.  The item itself is of fine quality and shipped quickly (although it took USPS a long time to deliver it).  I probably won&#x27;t bother returning it...maybe just use it for a halloween prop?  Dissappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty heavy. But it&#x27;s long and thin. Middle finger is about like my pinky, and I don&#x27;t have have big hands. I&#x27;m kind of disappointed. I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll keep it or not. But since it was such a good price and I have it, I might try to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has slots to put artificial nails into. But again, you&#x27;d be using all the same size tiny nails.</li>
            <li> It was not clear what I was ordering.....I expected something else</li>
            <li> i bought this specifically for a friend who is a big dexter fan, so i could re-create the ice truck killers prosthetic hand.  and i did, thanks to this hand.</li>
            <li> This hand is heavy and of good quality.  It is good to practice different designs on it, but it isn&#x27;t exactly like a real fingernail.  It works for me though.</li>
            <li> GREAT SIZE AND WORKS WELL FOR A NAIL TECH STUDENT OR SOMEONE IN THE NAIL BUSINESS!! ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS THE CUTICLES ARE WIDE BUT OTHER THAN THAT ITS GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I love it because it is perfect for the rings and bracelet that I display for photo shooting and also for sizing.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 12 year old grandaughter to practice nail polishing and nail art on.  She uses it alot but you do have to just dig out the glue and polish with cuticle clippers.  I tried to find a hand that was easier to clean but this is the best one I could find.</li>
            <li> Rather than practice, I use these for my jewelry displays at craft shows. Very realistic looking.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand alone. Return.</li>
            <li> Delivery was promptly.  Products in good order.  Would shop again.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly and packaged well, just as described, would recommend to buyers who would like to practice nail art or hand massage</li>
            <li> A little creepy :) but it works great...nail tips fit right into the nail beds...I use it often to practice my nail art.</li>
            <li> The polish did not come off the nails that easy</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to practice (as the name suggests) nail art and to prep nails to put on my own hands. I use poster putty to hold the fake nails on. The way the nail wells are designed is not really that great, I would rather they just make it hand-shaped and let you stick on the nails with putty. Since there are nail wells, I have had some fake nails shift and have uneven side edges. But for the most part, it does what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> My preteen daughter loves painting nails!  This is a fun little creepy hand that she practices on after spending 1/2 hour on Pinterest looking at different nail designs.  Polish goes on and comes off easily.</li>
            <li> My girls are crazy about doing nails. This practice hand has come in &amp;#34;Handy&amp;#34; with helping them come up with design before painting on themselves.</li>
            <li> funny accent to my teen daughter&#x27;s room. She has painted the nails and put her rings on it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the hands to practice acrylic nails, and they do the job just fine!!! Iam ready to order more</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 yr old daughter for her birthday. She is a nail polishing fiend and as others have mentioned, I got tired of offering up my own nails to be &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;, so I purchased two of these mannequin hands for her to practice til she ran out of polish or enthusiasm! The hands are of a nice realistic weight for something such as this and lay nicely on the table surface. As also mentioned, it would be a bit nicer if they bent somewhat and stayed in position instead of just lying straight, but this doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her terribly much. The fingers are very long which works well for a child who isn&#x27;t accustomed to gripping like an adult would be, so I don&#x27;t count this against the model. The biggest &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the cuticle or nail edges/beds are SO deep and inset that it is extremely difficult for her to polish to the edges and clean them completely. Even I have difficulty polishing them well, and I am what I would consider myself to be an intermediate home manicurist/polisher. I would much prefer to see this remodeled to have the nails done more like a realistic nailbed where the cuticles are flat and more in line with the skin of the finger. Another option that would be nice to have is different skin tones - not everyone is this particular shade of beige and polish takes on different hues on nail beds of different ethnicities, so it would be cool to have the option to choose the one that more closely matches your own or have one of each to get a feel for how the polish will look on your clients if you have a shop/are an aspiring nail tech. I would likely not purchase this particular hand again due to the deep nail edge issue.</li>
            <li> This hand is like the size of a five year old. It is to hard to work with because of the size.</li>
            <li> The hands help me display the sweatshirts with built in half gloves I was trying to sell.  Everyone got the idea off jow they worked.</li>
            <li> I hate it how it has those indents at the cuticle part. It just bothers me sooo much. Somehow I just cant like practice painting &amp;#34;other peoples&amp;#34; nails. Its just unreal. I know I know its a fake hand but you shouldn&#x27;t have those indents on it. I don&#x27;t know about some people but it just gets annoying to me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend this product for only some reasons that i have. if this stuff doesnt bother you, then i would recommend this to someone.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 of these to give to my granddaughters so they could practice painting nails. Gave one to my 7 yr old granddaughter for her birthday. She is loving it!</li>
            <li> These worked perfectly for my daughters school project and were inexpensive too! Nail polish cleans off easily to reuse as well.</li>
            <li> My daughter is happy! She loves doing nails and we were all polished out so I ordered this for her and now she can do nails all day!</li>
            <li> I just love my hand I do nails much better and it ended up being a good tool to keep my lil cousins away from all my stuff a hand lol but over all it works how I thought it would</li>
            <li> This hand is very small, which for acrylic nail practice is less than desirable unless you will be putting acrylics on lots of children or small aliens. As other reviews have mentioned and you can even tell in the picture the cuticle bed is very high. I didn&#x27;t think this would matter to me while practicing nails but it made it very difficult to file. It was cheap enough that I do not regret the purchase.</li>
            <li> The fingers look creepier than other practice hands.  Otherwise, it does it&#x27;s job of being a plastic hand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t use this hand yet. If you are looking for a Practice Mannequin Hand this will answer your need.</li>
            <li> I was doing direct sales for Jamberry and got nails to put on this hand and put Jamberry wraps on it... in the end it was decided it was just creepy looking!</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my daughter, so she can practice before doing my nail... she love it</li>
            <li> Very firm, doesn&#x27;t come with nails like stated not good for state boards</li>
            <li> For the inexpensive price this practice hand is a fantastic deal. Nail polish removes very easily allowing someone to practice painting/nail designs over and over. The fingers don&#x27;t bend, which is fine. The nails are outlined and slightly indented which helps with application of polish or nail designs and allows for practice of applying acrylic nails. The round base allows the hand to stand up for storage or display.&lt;br /&gt;Took a little bit longer to arrive than other items in our order, however the online tracking was accurate and the product arrived undamaged. Good purchase, I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea for someone who is trying to learn to do nails. It is very realistic as far as the nail size,etc. I do recommend this item and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> The only problem I had was the nail bed is very long and regular artificial nails are too short.  I&#x27;ve used nail tips and trimmed them to fit.</li>
