    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent deal for what Im using it for.  </li>
            <li>He loves it and it works great as a distraction!</li>
            <li>Very good in all aspects.</li>
            <li>This paper is great for waxing.  </li>
            <li>Very nice and meets my needs</li>
            <li>so I knew I had to get him some of his own to play with at home!</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>When we went to his doctors office, he LOVED the paper on the table</li>
            <li>The roll makes it very easy to trace, or just cut out your own pattern pieces, and just roll out more as you need it.</li>
            <li>I thought would be more paper in this package but</li>
            <li>I use it to draft sewing patterns, it is pin able for fittings and also as a barrier on my craft table to keep glue, paints, inks etc.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better in bulk.</li>
            <li>Good price fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is easy to trace through it.</li>
            <li>I think a marker would work fine, but I can&#x27;t say about bleeding through, and I&#x27;d prefer a finer line for pattern work.&lt;br</li>
            <li>roll I received did not have a label as pictured (nothing to confirm the yardage on the roll), nor was it factory wrapped in plastic or anything to keep it clean as I thought/expected it to be.</li>
            <li>Very good for tracing sewing patterns and making alterations without destroying the original pattern.</li>
            <li>excellent product, but it arrived late</li>
            <li>Quick delivery, will use again.  </li>
            <li>its Ok, for the purpose of waxing its ok.&lt;br /&gt;nothing major</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Certain I am the coolest mom now.</li>
            <li>I bought this paper to trace patterns and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient for making patterns, because it&#x27;s a thin paper, and it&#x27;s nice not to have some huge paper to wrestle with.</li>
            <li>It is a great, economical tool for tracing patterns and for stabilizing slippery fabrics for cutting.</li>
            <li>Decent paper for the price.</li>
            <li>and I believe it is of decent quality for the price.</li>
            <li>essential, must have for work at the right price.</li>
            <li>I switched to a pencil, but that barely showed, and wasn&#x27;t making much of a mark, either.</li>
            <li>I can see through it enough to transfer pattern markings to the copy and at the same time its strong enough to use over and over again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I like it, but just know it is tough to write on, and keep a pad handy, to scribble on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s about the same thickness/sturdiness as pattern paper (maybe a bit thicker, but not much), and it&#x27;s wide enough that you won&#x27;t have any trouble fitting most pattern</li>
            <li>so pretty with the pink ribbons, also as a survivor I appreciate the efforts made in Breast Cancer awareness</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing worse than using the original pattern more than once and it becomes a ripped mess.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because a place I have been going to receive medical treatment puts sheets down on their work/massage tables and I am allergic to the detergents used to clean the sheets.</li>
            <li>I used a ball point pen, and it would write fine some of the time, other times not at all, and it kept quitting after half the line was drawn.</li>
            <li>using for my niece to draw on / or putting down a sheet to protect surfaces if she wants to make an art project</li>

            <li> Just what I wanted. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Excellent deal for what Im using it for.  Quick delivery, will use again.  AAA*+++ seller</li>
            <li> Very good in all aspects.</li>
            <li> I thought would be more paper in this package but its Ok, for the purpose of waxing its ok.&lt;br /&gt;nothing major</li>
            <li> Not really what I expected. I use this paper to cover the facial table when we are doing waxing treatments for clients. The paper is to short however it gets the job done</li>
            <li> I bought this paper to trace patterns and it works very well.  I can see through it enough to transfer pattern markings to the copy and at the same time its strong enough to use over and over again.</li>
            <li> My wife needed semi-transparent paper to trace some fabric patterns. This was the only seller that I could find offering a single roll. Would buy again, but I&#x27;ve got a feeling I won&#x27;t have to for about 30 years.</li>
            <li> Decent paper for the price. I use it to draft sewing patterns, it is pin able for fittings and also as a barrier on my craft table to keep glue, paints, inks etc. off the surface.</li>
            <li> Very nice and meets my needs and I believe it is of decent quality for the price. I would reccomend</li>
            <li> I bought this to use to trace sewing patterns. It&#x27;s what I was looking for and should work well.</li>
            <li> so pretty with the pink ribbons, also as a survivor I appreciate the efforts made in Breast Cancer awareness</li>
            <li> This works for sewing pattern making but there are a bunch of folds in the paper as you unroll it.  It&#x27;s not a big deal though and you can still use it. Iron out the folds or just leave them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very convenient for making patterns, because it&#x27;s a thin paper, and it&#x27;s nice not to have some huge paper to wrestle with. The roll makes it very easy to trace, or just cut out your own pattern pieces, and just roll out more as you need it. It&#x27;s about the same thickness/sturdiness as pattern paper (maybe a bit thicker, but not much), and it&#x27;s wide enough that you won&#x27;t have any trouble fitting most pattern pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did find it difficult to write on. I used a ball point pen, and it would write fine some of the time, other times not at all, and it kept quitting after half the line was drawn. I needed to keep going to the pad of paper I had nearby, to scribble, and get the ink flowing again. I switched to a pencil, but that barely showed, and wasn&#x27;t making much of a mark, either. I think a marker would work fine, but I can&#x27;t say about bleeding through, and I&#x27;d prefer a finer line for pattern work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This paper has a smoother side, and a rougher side. I found it equally hard to write on either side. Might be I just had an iffy pen, but it worked like a charm on the pad of paper - every time, so I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the pen. Some papers are just hard to write on, especially if there&#x27;s no padding beneath it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like it, but just know it is tough to write on, and keep a pad handy, to scribble on.</li>
            <li> excellent product, but it arrived late</li>
            <li> My initial order was lost and they resent me a replacement ASAP. This was exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Good quality. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because a place I have been going to receive medical treatment puts sheets down on their work/massage tables and I am allergic to the detergents used to clean the sheets. I decided to buy a roll of medical exam paper to put down instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The roll I received did not have a label as pictured (nothing to confirm the yardage on the roll), nor was it factory wrapped in plastic or anything to keep it clean as I thought/expected it to be. It was just the roll with a piece of masking tape keeping it closed and shipped with a plain wrapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The paper suits the purpose I purchased it for, plus I can already see a few other uses for it including:&lt;br /&gt;- drafting sewing patterns&lt;br /&gt;- using as a pressing sheet when ironing delicate fabrics&lt;br /&gt;- using for my niece to draw on / or putting down a sheet to protect surfaces if she wants to make an art project&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a very thin paper that can tear easily. Anybody who has ever been to a doctor&#x27;s office with a paper covering will probably remember the wrinkles and possible tears that result from sitting or moving around on the exam table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the roll I received was a bit dirty and the price was a bit high considering the thinness of the paper and the yardage I am deducting a couple of stars from my rating.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a work supply.&lt;br /&gt;An essential, must have for work at the right price. Being a Skincare Specialist I simply can&#x27;t work without it.</li>
            <li> I also bought this to make sewing patterns. I haven&#x27;t used it yet but it looks like it will work well.</li>
            <li> I use this to make patterns for sewing garments.  It is easy to trace through it.</li>
            <li> Hahah, I actually bought this for my 10-month-old for Christmas. When we went to his doctors office, he LOVED the paper on the table so I knew I had to get him some of his own to play with at home! He loves it and it works great as a distraction! Certain I am the coolest mom now.</li>
            <li> It was a blogger who mentioned using this paper to create or copy sewing patterns so I had to try it. There&#x27;s nothing worse than using the original pattern more than once and it becomes a ripped mess. Trace them onto this paper, which is also the same as the paper the doctors&#x27; office uses on the table in the cold exam room, and the pattern can be used over and over again.</li>
            <li> I am using this as a sewing tool. It is a great, economical tool for tracing patterns and for stabilizing slippery fabrics for cutting.</li>
            <li> Very good for tracing sewing patterns and making alterations without destroying the original pattern.</li>
            <li> Good price fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This paper is great for waxing.  It&#x27;s easy to use and but the only this is that is was expensive.  It&#x27;s better in bulk.</li>
