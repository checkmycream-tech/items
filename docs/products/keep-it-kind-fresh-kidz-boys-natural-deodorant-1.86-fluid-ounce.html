            <li>All I can say is I love it...</li>

            <li>Love this deodorant for my son.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is a bit overwhelming after application but as soon as it dries</li>
            <li>Both of my boys love this deodorant.  </li>
            <li>I like it so much more than having him spell like a &amp;#34;MAN&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>will tell better after he&#x27;s been running around all day.</li>
            <li>I prefer this scent better and have used it myself many times.  </li>
            <li>It works all day and smells better than most deodorants.</li>
            <li>Upon researched, noticed most healthier products are either not scented, or scented with &#x27;herbally&#x27; fragrances that didn&#x27;t agree with my son.</li>
            <li>This one has fit the bill!</li>
            <li>In my opinion, the deodorant smells like Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Waters cologne (...and I LOVE that scent!)</li>
            <li>It is not too &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t smell like an older man, but instead has a very nice scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is fine although I wanted a more boyish smell rather than a spicy smell.</li>
            <li>Works great for my 8 year old boys.</li>
            <li>But over all its a great natural deodarent.</li>
            <li>They Loved the smell and it really helps.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply since it&#x27;s a roll-on</li>
            <li>(it&#x27;s a great morning laugh; he&#x27;s very tickleish).  </li>
            <li>This one has a very mild scent.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting or smell too strong..</li>
            <li>The bottle is perfectly shaped/sized for little hands and the product goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 and 11 year old boys and they Loved it.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>Just used it today on my 8yr old it smells good waiting to see if it works.</li>
            <li>It kept my 9 year old athlete smelling good all day.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the perfect size for their small</li>
            <li>The perfect formula for the budding Teen</li>
            <li>It smells so good that his older sibling wants to use it.</li>
            <li>This product works well without having to go full force.</li>
            <li>Fragrance was nice but was ineffective as a deodorant for my 9 year old.  </li>
            <li>far it&#x27;s been effective,  </li>
            <li>This has been safe and very effective he needed it at only seven years old.</li>
            <li>It is cool looking, and mild.</li>
            <li>Had a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li>Seems to be mild for kids.</li>
            <li>The Fresh Kidz smells better and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li>My son loves having his very own, I love the lack of icky chemicals going on his skin</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d prefer their first venture into the world of deodorant be one that isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals.  </li>
            <li>it really work for my nephew, I love it very much</li>
            <li>Fragrance is mild and fresh like soap, and he doesn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li>It keeps him dry all day and smelling good.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I did; this is a gentle deodorant but really does the job at keeping him smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>It works through the whole day!!</li>
            <li>Smell really good and keep my kid fresh and dry, will recommend</li>
            <li>My 8.5 year old son loves the smell of this deodorant, and it seems to be working just fine!</li>
            <li>My son also preferred the Fresh Kidz to the Jr Varsity Naturals.</li>
            <li>I had to fight with him to put on the JV, but with the Fresh Kidz he likes to wear it and puts it on without me telling him too.</li>
            <li>It is nice to find a safer alternative to traditional otc varieties.  </li>
            <li>think we will try another option when this runs out, as I&#x27;m not crazy about it</li>
            <li>They stopped making fun of him at his school since he started using this product.</li>
            <li>They use in the morning before school and despite gym and recess (sometimes dressed in uniform layers), they still come home smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li>His mom had him using regular men&#x27;s deodorant, but I set out to find him aluminum-free deodorant and landed on Keep It Kind.</li>
            <li>I originally wanted to find a solid that fit my criteria, including being free of harsh chemicals which this one is, but I find this product works just as well and has great staying power.  </li>
            <li>Like another reviewer said, my nephew was hesitant at first because of it being a roll-on instead of stick deodorant - but he quickly got over that.</li>
            <li>Works well to keep my 8 year old from becoming stinky.  </li>
            <li>My eight year old recently discovered the need for deodorant and so far this has been great.  </li>
            <li>The only think that would make it better would be of</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a roll on too which he likes more than the traditional stick of deodorant.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future and will probably be trying out the girls version as well.</li>
            <li>He now smells fresh the whole day.</li>
            <li>They love feeling like big boys and</li>
            <li>Dad and I LOVE not smelling their stinky pits anymore after a long day of boy fun and activities.</li>
            <li>I used it first . .</li>
            <li>Nice fresh scented deodorant for my two young boys 7 and 8, who are starting to work up a sweat.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;m not a kid, but I&#x27;ve used nearly every natural deoderant out there with zero luck..</li>
            <li>Most of the natural deodorants I found were lavender or patchouli scented which wasn&#x27;t really 10 year old boy.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a fresh, clean male scent.</li>
            <li>This has a nice-but-not-too-strong , masculine scent, so my 10 year old feels super cool wearing it.</li>
            <li>Controls my young son&#x27;s under arm odor, which is mild at this point.</li>
            <li>I wish the smell weren&#x27;t quite so strong, but it definitely works!</li>
            <li>FAST shipping👌👏</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My boys really like it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really fights odor in my Tweens.</li>
            <li>My 8yr old likes the smell and sensation of fresh</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t ready for the Axe products or &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Smell was so strong that I&#x27;m not surprised there was something in there that cause this reaction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really not too strong.</li>
            <li>Works really well for my 7 year old!</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 10 year old son and he loves the &#x27;manly&#x27; smell, as most of the other non-creepy deodorants smell like lemons or tea tree.  </li>
            <li>This works really well for my almost nine year old.</li>
            <li>Does work to keep him smelling fresh all day (even when he has lots of physical activities).</li>
            <li>I had to make a decision on deodorant quickly when one day I realized my 9 year old was starting to smell!</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and it works as long as they use it every day.  </li>
            <li>I only write reviews if I feel strongly one way or the other about a product</li>
            <li>I was a bit mortified when my 7 year old son began to stink.</li>
            <li>My son is starting to get that boy funk smell, but doesn&#x27;t really like deodorant.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something natural that didn&#x27;t smell like he bathed in body spray.</li>
            <li>I am the mother of a 13-year old son.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my 6 year old and he loves it.</li>
            <li>My 5 yr old son loves it.</li>
            <li>I thought it was too soon for him to use adult deodorant</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s it an all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li>needed something to help my young son as he was beginning to get some BO.</li>
            <li>I would purchase again for my sweaty and  smelly 6 year old.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li>my 5 year old loves it.</li>
            <li>I bought this deodorant for my 9 year old son and the Sport A Boy Kids Deodorant for my 12 year old.  </li>
            <li>My 7 year old likes it.</li>
            <li>A little bit of the deodorant in the morning goes a long way and he smells good hours later when he gets back from school</li>
            <li>They think they are big stuff; just ages 6 and 5 but my 6 year old needs it.</li>
            <li>I am not ready for him to grow up that much yet.  </li>
            <li>Really works for my young boys who are very active.  </li>
            <li>I was not sure about a roll-on style, but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>the scent wasnt so strong could be a little less fragrant for kids.</li>
            <li>9 year old son is ready for deodorant and was leary of lead and other ingredients in &#x27;conventional&#x27; products.</li>

            <li> It smells so good that his older sibling wants to use it.</li>
            <li> This product works well without having to go full force.</li>
            <li> Fragrance was nice but was ineffective as a deodorant for my 9 year old.  </li>
            <li> far it&#x27;s been effective,  </li>
            <li> This has been safe and very effective he needed it at only seven years old.</li>
            <li> It is cool looking, and mild.</li>
            <li> Had a fresh, clean scent.</li>
            <li> Seems to be mild for kids.</li>
            <li> The Fresh Kidz smells better and lasts much longer.</li>
            <li> My son loves having his very own, I love the lack of icky chemicals going on his skin</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d prefer their first venture into the world of deodorant be one that isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals.  </li>
            <li> it really work for my nephew, I love it very much</li>
            <li> Fragrance is mild and fresh like soap, and he doesn&#x27;t mind it.</li>
            <li> It keeps him dry all day and smelling good.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I did; this is a gentle deodorant but really does the job at keeping him smelling fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> It works through the whole day!!</li>
            <li> Smell really good and keep my kid fresh and dry, will recommend</li>
            <li> My 8.5 year old son loves the smell of this deodorant, and it seems to be working just fine!</li>
            <li> My son also preferred the Fresh Kidz to the Jr Varsity Naturals.</li>
            <li> I had to fight with him to put on the JV, but with the Fresh Kidz he likes to wear it and puts it on without me telling him too.</li>
            <li> It is nice to find a safer alternative to traditional otc varieties.  </li>
            <li> think we will try another option when this runs out, as I&#x27;m not crazy about it</li>
            <li> They stopped making fun of him at his school since he started using this product.</li>
            <li> They use in the morning before school and despite gym and recess (sometimes dressed in uniform layers), they still come home smelling fresh.  </li>
            <li> His mom had him using regular men&#x27;s deodorant, but I set out to find him aluminum-free deodorant and landed on Keep It Kind.</li>
            <li> I originally wanted to find a solid that fit my criteria, including being free of harsh chemicals which this one is, but I find this product works just as well and has great staying power.  </li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, my nephew was hesitant at first because of it being a roll-on instead of stick deodorant - but he quickly got over that.</li>
            <li> Works well to keep my 8 year old from becoming stinky.  </li>
            <li> My eight year old recently discovered the need for deodorant and so far this has been great.  </li>
            <li> The only think that would make it better would be of</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a roll on too which he likes more than the traditional stick of deodorant.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future and will probably be trying out the girls version as well.</li>
            <li> He now smells fresh the whole day.</li>
            <li> They love feeling like big boys and</li>
            <li> Dad and I LOVE not smelling their stinky pits anymore after a long day of boy fun and activities.</li>
            <li> I used it first . .</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scented deodorant for my two young boys 7 and 8, who are starting to work up a sweat.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m not a kid, but I&#x27;ve used nearly every natural deoderant out there with zero luck..</li>
            <li> Most of the natural deodorants I found were lavender or patchouli scented which wasn&#x27;t really 10 year old boy.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a fresh, clean male scent.</li>
            <li> This has a nice-but-not-too-strong , masculine scent, so my 10 year old feels super cool wearing it.</li>
            <li> Controls my young son&#x27;s under arm odor, which is mild at this point.</li>
            <li> I wish the smell weren&#x27;t quite so strong, but it definitely works!</li>
            <li> FAST shipping👌👏</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My boys really like it.</li>

            <li> It really fights odor in my Tweens.</li>
            <li> My 8yr old likes the smell and sensation of fresh</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t ready for the Axe products or &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Smell was so strong that I&#x27;m not surprised there was something in there that cause this reaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really not too strong.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my 7 year old!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 10 year old son and he loves the &#x27;manly&#x27; smell, as most of the other non-creepy deodorants smell like lemons or tea tree.  </li>
            <li> This works really well for my almost nine year old.</li>
            <li> Does work to keep him smelling fresh all day (even when he has lots of physical activities).</li>
            <li> I had to make a decision on deodorant quickly when one day I realized my 9 year old was starting to smell!</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and it works as long as they use it every day.  </li>
            <li> I only write reviews if I feel strongly one way or the other about a product</li>
            <li> I was a bit mortified when my 7 year old son began to stink.</li>
            <li> My son is starting to get that boy funk smell, but doesn&#x27;t really like deodorant.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something natural that didn&#x27;t smell like he bathed in body spray.</li>
            <li> I am the mother of a 13-year old son.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 6 year old and he loves it.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old son loves it.</li>
            <li> I thought it was too soon for him to use adult deodorant</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s it an all natural deodorant.  </li>
            <li> needed something to help my young son as he was beginning to get some BO.</li>
            <li> I would purchase again for my sweaty and  smelly 6 year old.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 year old.</li>
            <li> my 5 year old loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant for my 9 year old son and the Sport A Boy Kids Deodorant for my 12 year old.  </li>
            <li> My 7 year old likes it.</li>
            <li> A little bit of the deodorant in the morning goes a long way and he smells good hours later when he gets back from school</li>
            <li> They think they are big stuff; just ages 6 and 5 but my 6 year old needs it.</li>
            <li> I am not ready for him to grow up that much yet.  </li>
            <li> Really works for my young boys who are very active.  </li>
            <li> I was not sure about a roll-on style, but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> the scent wasnt so strong could be a little less fragrant for kids.</li>
            <li> 9 year old son is ready for deodorant and was leary of lead and other ingredients in &#x27;conventional&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t last very long so would need to be reapplied 2 x per day.</li>
            <li> The only draw back is that it is extremly wet</li>
            <li> Got this for my very active 8 year old.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old nephew who works up quite a stink whenever he&#x27;s running around for hours (aka everyday).</li>
            <li> It does go on wet, but dries quickly enough.</li>
            <li> This takes a long time to dry which makes my son not want to use it.</li>
            <li> He has not experienced BO, but he certainly can get stinky from running around and playing football.</li>
            <li> My sons eyes gleam a little bit when he briskly twists it open in his morning routine.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 7 year old son who unfortunately needs some odor control at his young age.  </li>
            <li> A little seems to go a long way.</li>
            <li> whet on very wet and the kids I purchased for did not like this at all!n</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product caused an immediate underarm rash in my 9 year old and we had to discontinue its use after the 2nd use.</li>
            <li> My son is just learning and forgets to turn it upside down so no deodorant gets applied.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s much less</li>
            <li> He smells like a little man now.  </li>
            <li> He complained that other deodorant stung his underarms.  </li>
            <li> no more underarms wetness/odor...</li>
            <li> I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals!</li>
            <li> I like the absence of questionable chemicals like aluminum and parabens.</li>
            <li> He would prefer a stick over roll-on, but has used this without complaint.  </li>
            <li> It is a little wet when it rolls on, and I thought he might complain because he is finicky about that sort of thing, but he didn&#x27;t say anything bad about it.</li>
            <li> He uses this regularly and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Bullying is bad people and small chilldren</li>
            <li> almost 8 amd stinks after basketball.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> After about 2 days they both got a terrible rash on their armpits from this stuff.</li>

            <li> The perfect formula for the budding Teen</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 9 and 11 year old boys and they Loved it. They Loved the smell and it really helps.</li>
            <li> This product works great, my boy is always playing sports and sweating, this deodorant controls the sweat under the arms And takes care of the odor as well!!!!!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  My eight year old recently discovered the need for deodorant and so far this has been great.  Easy to put on, pleasant smell, and seems to be working.</li>
            <li> I was a bit mortified when my 7 year old son began to stink. We tried this deodorant and it works and smells good. The only think that would make it better would be of they offered it in stick form instead of roll on. My son is just learning and forgets to turn it upside down so no deodorant gets applied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a &amp;#34;crunchy&amp;#34; mom. My kids eat cereal with marshmallows and they probably spend more time playing Minecraft than I&#x27;d like to admit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I&#x27;d prefer their first venture into the world of deodorant be one that isn&#x27;t filled with chemicals.  Both my kids NEED deodorant and they both love this.  It smells fresh and it works as long as they use it every day.  It&#x27;s easy to apply since it&#x27;s a roll-on and it&#x27;s the perfect size for their small hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started them on a fragrance-free Tom&#x27;s deodorant, but they wanted something &amp;#34;cooler.&amp;#34;  This is the perfect solution for all of us.  I like the scent-- it&#x27;s much better than the alternative!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 10 y.o.  He loves the smell and feel of it.</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Controls my young son&#x27;s under arm odor, which is mild at this point. Only wish it can in a solid vs roll on.</li>
            <li> All I can say is I love it...my son loves it...no more underarms wetness/odor...FAST shipping👌👏</li>
            <li> My son is starting to get that boy funk smell, but doesn&#x27;t really like deodorant. I was looking for something natural that didn&#x27;t smell like he bathed in body spray. This is a nice smelling beginner deodorant.  The only draw back is that it is extremly wet &amp; my son doesn&#x27;t like that fact. I&#x27;ve used roll on before &amp; I have to agree with him.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is very effective and my son loves it.  He actually looks forward to wearing it every day and he gets a kick out of putting it on (it&#x27;s a great morning laugh; he&#x27;s very tickleish).  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Works great but overpriced</li>
            <li> My son loves this deodorant!  It works well, and his underarms smell great!  In my opinion, the deodorant smells like Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Waters cologne (...and I LOVE that scent!)</li>
            <li> I am the mother of a 13-year old son. The scent of this product is PERFECT for a teen boy! It is not too &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; and doesn&#x27;t smell like an older man, but instead has a very nice scent. If I was a teen boy, I would definitely wear this, and I was one who had to be in the &amp;#34;in crowd&amp;#34;! Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My Grandson loves this product.....</li>
            <li> Seems to be mild for kids.</li>
            <li> Just used it today on my 8yr old it smells good waiting to see if it works.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 8 year old boys.</li>
            <li> I wish the smell weren&#x27;t quite so strong, but it definitely works!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my 6 year old and he loves it. Definitely would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Great for a tween boy.  He complained that other deodorant stung his underarms.  He uses this regularly and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.</li>
            <li> Works great for my 9 year-old. Fragrance is mild and fresh like soap, and he doesn&#x27;t mind it. I like the absence of questionable chemicals like aluminum and parabens.</li>
            <li> whet on very wet and the kids I purchased for did not like this at all!n</li>
            <li> Really works for my young boys who are very active.  Also a good smell to it.</li>
            <li> My son loves having his very own, I love the lack of icky chemicals going on his skin</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old son loves it. It keeps him dry all day and smelling good. He say his armpits smells like a big boy with this deodorant... Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I had to make a decision on deodorant quickly when one day I realized my 9 year old was starting to smell! I thought it was too soon for him to use adult deodorant so I looked at reviews and ordered this one. I am so glad I did; this is a gentle deodorant but really does the job at keeping him smelling fresh and clean. It is a little wet when it rolls on, and I thought he might complain because he is finicky about that sort of thing, but he didn&#x27;t say anything bad about it. He uses it every day and we are both happy with it! It smells really good, too. :)</li>
            <li> My boys really like it. They think they are big stuff; just ages 6 and 5 but my 6 year old needs it. Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Son loves it!!!  He smells like a little man now.  I like that&#x27;s it an all natural deodorant.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> The Amazon service is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The item is still under test as my son alregic to most of deodarant. He just need time to see if there is any reaction. Thanx for Amazon</li>
            <li> My son loves the deodorant. He smells good and hasn&#x27;t had any reactions to it. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  It has a very pleasant scent.  It really fights odor in my Tweens.</li>
            <li> Smell really good and keep my kid fresh and dry, will recommend</li>
            <li> needed something to help my young son as he was beginning to get some BO. This has been safe and very effective he needed it at only seven years old.I would recommend this to any parentlooking for something for their child.</li>
            <li> My son love it, thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> Received the boys deodorant. Smelled great! Had a fresh, clean scent. It kept my 9 year old athlete smelling good all day. We had tried Junior Varsity Naturals Citrus Sport prior to trying this. Didn&#x27;t care for the smell of it and it needed to be reapplied periodically. The Fresh Kidz smells better and lasts much longer. My son also preferred the Fresh Kidz to the Jr Varsity Naturals. I had to fight with him to put on the JV, but with the Fresh Kidz he likes to wear it and puts it on without me telling him too.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product caused an immediate underarm rash in my 9 year old and we had to discontinue its use after the 2nd use. Smells nice but we could not use.</li>
            <li> My 8yr old likes the smell and sensation of fresh, it&#x27;s affordable and I got it delivered in 3 days. Highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> It is nice to find a safer alternative to traditional otc varieties.  The smell is boyish but not overly offensive. I would purchase again for my sweaty and  smelly 6 year old.</li>
            <li> Great presentation, nice smell, appealing to pre-teens, good control of sweat production.</li>
            <li> I realized that the time had come for my so to wear deodorant...  for the sake of all his teachers if nothing else.  I wasn&#x27;t ready for the Axe products or &amp;#34;for men&amp;#34; products.  Most of the natural deodorants I found were lavender or patchouli scented which wasn&#x27;t really 10 year old boy. This has a nice-but-not-too-strong , masculine scent, so my 10 year old feels super cool wearing it.</li>
            <li> Thank you for making this safe product for kids!</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant for my son. It smells so good that his older sibling wants to use it. Does work to keep him smelling fresh all day (even when he has lots of physical activities).</li>
            <li> Amazing smelling!  I bought this for my 9 year old. Oh my gosh!  It smells so good. As soon as he walks in the room after putting it on I can smell it. It&#x27;s a roll on too which he likes more than the traditional stick of deodorant. Honestly, a man could use this deodorant as well. It&#x27;s that good. I will be buying more in the future and will probably be trying out the girls version as well.</li>
            <li> Works to keep BO at bay.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is a bit overwhelming after application but as soon as it dries it&#x27;s much less obvious.&lt;br /&gt;I think we will try another option when this runs out, as I&#x27;m not crazy about it</li>
            <li> My son feels like he is a grown up now that he uses deodorant.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son hes almost 8 amd stinks after basketball. My obly thing is i wosh the scent wasnt so strong could be a little less fragrant for kids. But over all its a great natural deodarent.</li>
            <li> my 5 year old loves it. They stopped making fun of him at his school since he started using this product. He now smells fresh the whole day. Bullying is bad people and small chilldren dont know the difference.</li>
            <li> Both of my boys love this deodorant.  It smells like dad&#x27;s without having all the chemicals that are in the antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 7 year old son who unfortunately needs some odor control at his young age.  The smell is great, kind of manly, which my son likes and no chemicals or aluminum.</li>
            <li> I only write reviews if I feel strongly one way or the other about a product and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I bought this for my 10 year old son and he loves the &#x27;manly&#x27; smell, as most of the other non-creepy deodorants smell like lemons or tea tree.  He would prefer a stick over roll-on, but has used this without complaint.  And I love that the shirts he wears for playing hockey do not stink anymore!</li>
            <li> Nice fresh scented deodorant for my two young boys 7 and 8, who are starting to work up a sweat. They use in the morning before school and despite gym and recess (sometimes dressed in uniform layers), they still come home smelling fresh.  The bottle is perfectly shaped/sized for little hands and the product goes on smoothly. I originally wanted to find a solid that fit my criteria, including being free of harsh chemicals which this one is, but I find this product works just as well and has great staying power.  They love feeling like big boys and Dad and I LOVE not smelling their stinky pits anymore after a long day of boy fun and activities. What a blessing!</li>
            <li> We have searched in stores for deodorant for boys but have had no luck.  This one has a very mild scent.  I like it so much more than having him spell like a &amp;#34;MAN&amp;#34;.  I am not ready for him to grow up that much yet.  This product works great.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m not a kid, but I&#x27;ve used nearly every natural deoderant out there with zero luck.. I tried thousand actually kind of like it. It doesn&#x27;t sting or smell too strong.. I meant to buy the girl scented one, but got the boys instead, but that&#x27;s ok! It&#x27;s really not too strong.</li>
            <li> Great first DEODERANT for kids. It is cool looking, and mild. My sons eyes gleam a little bit when he briskly twists it open in his morning routine. Fits kids hands. Inexpensive. I like it. We will probably need to graduate to something stripinger in a few years when his hormones start really raging. He&#x27;s 10. Haven&#x27;t had any odor issues using this.</li>
            <li> Very effective!! It works through the whole day!! I also got the girl one for my daughter and we are so satisfied!!</li>
            <li> Works great.  My son likes it and the smell isn&#x27;t overbearing, it&#x27;s a fresh, clean male scent.</li>
            <li> This works really well for my almost nine year old. He has not experienced BO, but he certainly can get stinky from running around and playing football. This product works well without having to go full force.</li>
            <li> Bought 2 bottles of it. Broke my sons arm pits out after only 3 uses. But he didn&#x27;t stink!!!</li>
            <li> Works well to keep my 8 year old from becoming stinky.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any nasty chemicals!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my 7 year old nephew who works up quite a stink whenever he&#x27;s running around for hours (aka everyday). His mom had him using regular men&#x27;s deodorant, but I set out to find him aluminum-free deodorant and landed on Keep It Kind. Like another reviewer said, my nephew was hesitant at first because of it being a roll-on instead of stick deodorant - but he quickly got over that. The smell is great and my nephew loves using it! A little bit of the deodorant in the morning goes a long way and he smells good hours later when he gets back from school</li>
            <li> My 8.5 year old son loves the smell of this deodorant, and it seems to be working just fine!</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  Fragrance was nice but was ineffective as a deodorant for my 9 year old.  I helped him apply it, so I know it was done correctly, and within hours his armpits were stinky.</li>
            <li> Got this for my very active 8 year old.</li>
            <li> My nephew likes it. It would be 5 stars if a solid or option to have a solid.&lt;br /&gt;So far it&#x27;s been effective,  will tell better after he&#x27;s been running around all day.</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant for my 9 year old son and the Sport A Boy Kids Deodorant for my 12 year old.  I prefer this scent better and have used it myself many times.  It works all day and smells better than most deodorants.</li>
            <li> it really work for my nephew, I love it very much</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my boys . . I used it first . . .and I loved it . . better protection than Tom&#x27;s of Maine!! Highly recommend this product! Oh, and the fresh scent is great, too! I was not sure about a roll-on style, but it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old likes it. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Works Great and  he loves the scent!</li>
            <li> 9 year old son is ready for deodorant and was leary of lead and other ingredients in &#x27;conventional&#x27; products. Upon researched, noticed most healthier products are either not scented, or scented with &#x27;herbally&#x27; fragrances that didn&#x27;t agree with my son. He wanted one that smelled like cologne like dads. This one has fit the bill! He loves the fragrance. It does go on wet, but dries quickly enough. A little seems to go a long way. The price is fair and I can keep it in stock with the click of a button. Happy customers. I recommend!</li>
            <li> This takes a long time to dry which makes my son not want to use it. It also doesn&#x27;t last very long so would need to be reapplied 2 x per day. The scent is fine although I wanted a more boyish smell rather than a spicy smell.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my 7 year old! Has a great scent and is safer than store bought products. Good price as well...</li>
            <li> Son likes it.. smells good and light.</li>
            <li> I bought 1 each for my 2 boys. After about 2 days they both got a terrible rash on their armpits from this stuff. Smell was so strong that I&#x27;m not surprised there was something in there that cause this reaction.</li>
