            <li>Good seller: premium quality at a fair rate.</li>
            <li>but I can imagine good results</li>
            <li>the lotus stamens are seriously good and went beyond my expectations...</li>
            <li>Good herbs.</li>
            <li>feels good after working out to loosen muscles.</li>
            <li>For the karma, one imagines that lotus stamens are fairly good stuff, if you&#x27;re a Buddhist like</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>The taste isn&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li>good shipment ...just not my thing .</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as a tea, but was good otherwise.</li>
            <li>This stuff is actually really good.</li>
            <li>I got a good buzz when I mix it with mugwort.</li>
            <li>As soon as I opened it, I smoked some and experienced a strong pleasant effect.</li>
            <li>I have used this quite a bit and am very pleased.</li>
            <li>The quality of the product is very good, the best blue lotus I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li>All my friends love lotus now because of me!</li>
            <li>Amazing calming &amp; clearing effect.</li>
            <li>On their own, these aren&#x27;t that fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Ah this stuff is wonderful to make in tea, it has very relaxing qualities to it.</li>
            <li>was packaged nice.</li>
            <li>Nice smoke.  </li>
            <li>good to have for a chamomile type tea with a bit more than chamomile.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant for herbal tea, (produces a very nice floral aroma and taste,) but definitely does not produce sedative-like effects.</li>
            <li>I find this to be a light and pleasant mood enhancer with an aphrodisiac-like quality.</li>
            <li>great in tea, mild flavor, i like it</li>
            <li>cousin, Nymphaea caerulea, would be VERY easy to begin with.</li>
            <li>Excellent natural tea that calms and helps me sleep,</li>
            <li>I have found them to be the best vendors on amazon, as far as quality, variety, and costliness is concerned.</li>
            <li>fimented in alcohol seems to be the most effective method.</li>
            <li>I am now steeping them in some wine and am confident that it will turn out nice based on the effectiveness of the smoke.</li>
            <li>good quality, they even included a free extract sample.</li>
            <li>yeah, and it will give you the most amazing dreams for a night or two after you take it.</li>
            <li>Again no truly strong pharmacological impacts with this product however it is very pleasant and positive.</li>
            <li>Very satisfying, smooth and pleasent aroma</li>
            <li>I was very fortunate to try this sacred plant.</li>
            <li>The vapor given off in this users vaping equipment was very pleasant with no odd flavors or scents.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this product more than I do.</li>
            <li>When using in a tea infuser you may want to use more than an ounce.</li>
            <li>and then I just felt slightly more relaxed.</li>
            <li>I would have been more satisfied if I took the money and threw it away</li>
            <li>But I love the effect of this stuff.</li>
            <li>i wish more people were like mood and mind.</li>
            <li>you feel serene :)</li>
            <li>mixed with lotus leaves, these are awesome!</li>
            <li>It works well â€” I love making sacred lotus wine with this.</li>
            <li>but i imagine with filters they would be ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;Smoking out is smooth and its effects are relaxing not song but relaxing like a warm tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more so we followed it up with some sativa herb.</li>
            <li>I tried smoking it and as a tea, I think the tea worked better.</li>
            <li>have heard it is best steeped in wine for several days</li>
            <li>I also enjoyed it with the calming effects of California Poppy.</li>
            <li>Worked much better than I hoped.</li>
            <li>It seems fresh and good quality, as described.</li>
            <li>and I always love when that happens..</li>
            <li>And on top of all that they included a sample that I did not expect.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast product was great, just ordered 2 more oz.</li>
            <li>Im glad I bought this</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recomend it to others</li>
            <li>It was nicely and securely packaged.</li>
            <li>Packaging was phenomenal.</li>
            <li>best mixed with a flavored tea...</li>
            <li>it can most assuredly be smoked, steeped.</li>
            <li>Gonna get a lot more.</li>
            <li>Interesting stuff</li>
            <li>makes a bit sleepy, nothing more</li>
            <li>I received the product lightning fast, it was of good quality, had a nice smell to it, and it lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>Plus, came with a free sample!</li>
            <li>Interesting stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s uses are so varied that there are many volumes of literature for their usage.</li>
            <li>It did not appear to be smoke able</li>
            <li>Decent smoke on its own, not to strong but good taste.</li>
            <li>Smoking seems to give the most effect, although I made a wine with it and it was quite strong</li>
            <li>but it was just as smoke able as tobacco, and it was very mild with a relaxing effect.</li>
            <li>it was everything i wanted and more it was packed well and had a free sample witch i may buy some because i like it.</li>
            <li>In combination with something like Cannabis, the effects are very synergistic, good for bowls before bedtime.</li>
            <li>Good buy and fast service .</li>
            <li>We smoke this  with other herbs and its the best.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, fresh, and a great herb.</li>
            <li>Decent resealable packaging, good quality product.</li>
            <li>The product itself is average at best.  </li>
            <li>Super cute.</li>
            <li>For a National Flower of India &amp; Vietnam we are lucky to be able to try this ancient flower.</li>
            <li>Great product, they even gave me a free blue lotus extract sample.</li>
            <li>I filled my tea infuser ball up halfway and steeped for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Smooth stamens.</li>
            <li>I read a great deal of web-lore regarding Nelumbo nucifera prior to my purchase of a quantity of its stamens.</li>
            <li>I received my package within the week of ordering, which was fabulous.  </li>
            <li>it came with a free 5g bag of Kratom.  </li>
            <li>This product along with lotus leaves gives me a calm feeling I will order more</li>
            <li>The stamens are by far the most effective</li>
            <li>I blend it with other herbs for my pipe, nice and smooth, also good by itself.</li>
            <li>well Great Value&lt;br /&gt;Creates sense of euphoria, calming, and is quite nice before bed due to its calm relaxing</li>
            <li>Since it is legal, I packed a bowl and hit these - pretty good smoke.</li>
            <li>this stuff gets you a relaxed amazing high if you smoke 4 bowls of it in a pipe.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for a nice feeling, relaxing smoke.</li>
            <li>It was well worth the two week wait!</li>
            <li>But well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>have yet to ferment Lotus Beer (my original intention for ordering the stamens) or use</li>
            <li>(remember alkoloids usually work best with a catalyst)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nelumbo Nacafera is quite unique.</li>
            <li>-&lt;br /&gt;By itself, the stamens taste sorta sweet, smoke is very smooth and enjoyable, harshness is nearly non-existent.</li>
            <li>Taste is ok but kind of sticks with you in an almost gross way.</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and airtight plus it came with a free sample of another organic extract.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>This is more effect when taken with other herbs, I prefer kanna as a good pairing.</li>
            <li>good mixed with mugwart</li>
            <li>Good for people who are trying to cut back on smoking or switch to a healthier alternative.</li>
            <li>Perfect for when your running low on supply and don&#x27;t wanna roll a toothpick, fatten that sucker up with lotus and your good to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very light and pleasant and not strong at all.</li>
            <li>OK product and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>smell is sweet and is generally mild when inhaling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The user found it to be a very pleasant product and will hope to enjoy including and personal pain management and wellness regimens in the future.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Tea-&lt;br /&gt;The stamens make an excellent herbal tea with subtle euphoria and sedation, attributable to the alkaloids aporhine and nuciferine.</li>
            <li>As a tea it was a mild relaxant, I prefer mugwort tea over this if that&#x27;s the effect you are looking for.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The lotus seems to give a nice mind shift, giving a general feeling of relaxation.</li>
            <li>product works amazingly well, but if you are expecting to use it to get a \\&quot;legal\\&quot; high... granted it will, in large quantities.</li>
            <li>This Item arrived quickly, and is extremely fresh.</li>
            <li>I brewed it as a tea with a unique taste, no sugar at first but then added a bit.</li>
            <li>Gives a very enjoyable high when smoked alone and if enough is smoked you get some very mild visuals.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing, smooth blend</li>
            <li>I would have given this product 5 stars but the package I received had a dead bug in it, aside from that this truly is a 5 star product I&#x27;m writing this review now mellow, happy, and relaxed after smoking some of this.</li>
            <li>One thing that I did notice however is when I did fall asleep, I had a very deep and nice sleep.</li>
            <li>its worth noting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>A very warm fuzzy relaxed feeling but still clear headed enough to function normally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great product, just takes a little time to ship!</li>
            <li>This takes my anxiety down better than most benzodiazepines.</li>
            <li>buzz is mild but is there, better when mixed.</li>
            <li>Best blue lotus product I&#x27;ve tried, just use a couple grams in with my other herbs for a night tea and it has noticeable benefits and even a bit of a positive mood boost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleased with this vendor in general.</li>
            <li>I partook in the smoking of cannabis upon my first trial with the stamens nonetheless had a more clearness and vibrant high.</li>
            <li>Really did have some kind of neuropathic pain reduction, and possibly anti-inflammatory properties.  </li>
            <li>The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li>I have smoked some and found it somewhat harsh, but the effects beyond the harshness were pleasant and relaxing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall decent product, fantastic price, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all for free international shipping.</li>
            <li>I first used this in a joint and that did nothing but burn my throat and tasted like a camp fire.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing!</li>
            <li>This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s ok overall.</li>
            <li>:) even came with a blue lotus sample!</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li>The contents of the pouch of stamens smelled fresh, and were obviously very viable given the amount of pollen collected on the inside walls of said pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rolled a cigarette the evening of the product&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li>Mixed it with my favorite herb ;) and blended well.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>first experience with this type of product.</li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re soothing when used with a few grams, tastes good with chamomile, too.</li>
            <li>Very clean smoke, easy, slightly flowery.</li>
            <li>They were ok while I had them and, as far as legal smokeable herbs go, they&#x27;re pretty decent.</li>
            <li>This user also recommends the participation of the user in positive meditation or prayer being able to work with the product and improving the  overall outlook  of the user.</li>
            <li>ill order more soon all though i am not a wine drinker you can steep it in wine for 2 weeks and it would be good also from what i have heard.</li>
            <li>though, doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of a buzz and is probably a good waste of money.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any EXTRA side effects other then this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Vaporizing didn&#x27;t seem to do much, and research on it seemed to show a rather lower vape temp, but even at higher temperatures, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very nice opening feeling subtle in my head</li>
            <li>well honestly similar to a cannabis high except more controllable and relaxing.</li>
            <li>I have used a few different methods, with great results regardless.</li>
            <li>I make filtered cigarettes with it and the smoke is smooth enough to tear off the filter.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to do another batch.  </li>
            <li>Then I used it as tea and that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t tell much of any difference or calming effects.</li>
            <li>Very generous portions and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Smoked it straight with nothing else in a home made pipe.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***Many of the &#x27;absolute oils&#x27;</li>
            <li>Fast shipping item as described</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>No head buzz really.</li>
            <li>very relaxing smoke</li>
            <li>i dont really care about it but</li>
            <li>Are natural and Fresh Thank You</li>
            <li>I went back inside and drank my tea and just felt quite comfortable.</li>
            <li>it was packaged very well</li>
            <li>kratom sample worked very well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do much</li>
            <li>I use it for anxiety and it really helps.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works way better than expected!</li>
            <li>With MJ it really enhances the high and you don&#x27;t feel as stuck, really helps with the paranoia too.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect anything too dramatic, but it&#x27;s great for what it is.</li>
            <li>Has a potent blue lotus effect, I&#x27;ve been told the effect is similar to zanex</li>
            <li>We were quickly pepped back up.</li>
            <li>and smoked with another \\&quot;herb\\&quot; has quite a positive and unexpected effect.</li>
            <li>It is nothing like k2 so if you want to get high</li>
            <li>It did not get me high</li>
            <li>The last order I received, the stamens were so fresh</li>
            <li>but it sure beats tobacco and being such a sacred long living plant</li>
            <li>as this is a first use of this type of product this user cannot say whether it is akin to the average experience with this type of herb while overall it would seem very positive and while  there is a possibility of some placebo effect this user believes that impact was real and positive and helpful with the desired effect that this user was seeking.</li>
            <li>A seasoned pot smoker won&#x27;t likely notice the effect, but if one is a newbie to psychoactive herbs, Nelumbo nucifera, as well as</li>
            <li>Definitely has some affect, more of a clear headedness, or empty headedness.  </li>
            <li>After an extreme clean of my home</li>
            <li>and I was mellow, relaxed, and stress free for like an hour and a half.</li>
            <li>This reviewer would recommend this product for anyone who wishes additional assistance with pain management or positive emotional enhancement.</li>
            <li>It was mild, the harshness was minimal, and after half a cigarette I was very well calm.</li>
            <li>I can never remember my dreams, but with this tea they are vivid and crystal clear.</li>
            <li>I bought lotus stamens several years ago and they worked very well and were not dried out like the pack I received from wiccanherbmaster.  </li>
            <li>This herb has been very helpful to me -- and because it is available at a sale price, I&#x27;m actually able to use it regularly despite my meager retirement income.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this from rattakorn online ( through amazon of course ) and they shipped it directly from thailand.</li>
            <li>though I don&#x27;t know because I&#x27;ve only tried zanex once and didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li>It took nearly 4 months for this to ship to me when the estimated time was just a week.  </li>
            <li>Smoking it left my friend and I with a very mellow relaxing sensation.</li>
            <li>Mellows you out when smoked and not harsh when smoked.  </li>
            <li>Really surprised.  </li>
            <li>not as noticeable as wild dagga, either smoked or in a drink.</li>
            <li>well packaged (professional) and looks just as pictured.</li>
            <li>it appeared to give a mild sense of positive feelings that is difficult to explain other than something that should be experienced and this may have also had A small additional assistance to pain control and pain management which is important to this review or who has the history of musculoskeletal accident related long term pain management needs.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t get you &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;, so don&#x27;t waste time if you are that kind of person but does add effect to other herbs and even alcohol.</li>
            <li>No buzz, no high, still talkative and social but calm.</li>
            <li>and i dont think it was human, 1-2 inch black on top, white on the bottom</li>
            <li>I heated up after about 20 minutes and felt like I had at church prayer services where I&#x27;ve had some profound answers to prayer.  </li>
            <li>Definitely buying again from @Mood&amp;Mind and definitely a high quality product</li>
            <li>Taste when smoking is slightly harsh but not bad</li>
            <li>An individual Lotus can live for 1000 year.</li>
            <li>Makes for a great smoke, mellows you out for hours and doesn&#x27;t even taste bad.</li>
            <li>I think this is going to be something I order on a regular basis as I am trying to work with my doctor to find natural treatments for my conditions.</li>
            <li>I have steeped it in wine, made a tea and smoked it and absolutely no effects, no matter how much I use.  </li>
            <li>the effect is small but there such ass a small relaxed physical sensation not to intense but nice.</li>
            <li>No, it will not give you a buzz, but if you have anxiety of any kind (gad, sad, hangover induced, weed induced etc.)</li>
            <li>Less harsh than the leaves, for sure.</li>
            <li>I think what I received was very old or was dried too much.  </li>
            <li>I took 2 oz every night for 3 noghts and had the same profound heat show up.  </li>
            <li>the little stamens are both a bit too long to make a good cigarette and just a little too short and thin to grind down effectively.</li>
            <li>The package has broken english, but is more or less understandable and quite funny.</li>
            <li>Smells weird but its great for everyday smokers like me.</li>
            <li>Ive tried a few types of lotus so far (whole flowers, leaf material, etc.).</li>
            <li>very relaxing smoking was too epeciallh when mixed with other herbs.</li>
            <li>My suggestion is to steep in a sweet wine for at least a couple hours.</li>
            <li>The oldest recorded Lotus germination being from seeds 1300 years old recovered from a dry lake bed in North East China.</li>
            <li>This will get you a high only if you smoke a lot and not very noticeable if you smoke weed regularly.  </li>

            <li> Good herbs.</li>
            <li> feels good after working out to loosen muscles.</li>
            <li> For the karma, one imagines that lotus stamens are fairly good stuff, if you&#x27;re a Buddhist like</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t good at all.</li>
            <li> good shipment ...just not my thing .</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as a tea, but was good otherwise.</li>
            <li> This stuff is actually really good.</li>
            <li> I got a good buzz when I mix it with mugwort.</li>
            <li> As soon as I opened it, I smoked some and experienced a strong pleasant effect.</li>
            <li> I have used this quite a bit and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The quality of the product is very good, the best blue lotus I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> All my friends love lotus now because of me!</li>
            <li> Amazing calming &amp; clearing effect.</li>
            <li> On their own, these aren&#x27;t that fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Ah this stuff is wonderful to make in tea, it has very relaxing qualities to it.</li>
            <li> was packaged nice.</li>
            <li> Nice smoke.  </li>
            <li> good to have for a chamomile type tea with a bit more than chamomile.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant for herbal tea, (produces a very nice floral aroma and taste,) but definitely does not produce sedative-like effects.</li>
            <li> I find this to be a light and pleasant mood enhancer with an aphrodisiac-like quality.</li>
            <li> great in tea, mild flavor, i like it</li>
            <li> cousin, Nymphaea caerulea, would be VERY easy to begin with.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural tea that calms and helps me sleep,</li>
            <li> I have found them to be the best vendors on amazon, as far as quality, variety, and costliness is concerned.</li>
            <li> fimented in alcohol seems to be the most effective method.</li>
            <li> I am now steeping them in some wine and am confident that it will turn out nice based on the effectiveness of the smoke.</li>
            <li> good quality, they even included a free extract sample.</li>
            <li> yeah, and it will give you the most amazing dreams for a night or two after you take it.</li>
            <li> Again no truly strong pharmacological impacts with this product however it is very pleasant and positive.</li>
            <li> Very satisfying, smooth and pleasent aroma</li>
            <li> I was very fortunate to try this sacred plant.</li>
            <li> The vapor given off in this users vaping equipment was very pleasant with no odd flavors or scents.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product more than I do.</li>
            <li> When using in a tea infuser you may want to use more than an ounce.</li>
            <li> and then I just felt slightly more relaxed.</li>
            <li> I would have been more satisfied if I took the money and threw it away</li>
            <li> But I love the effect of this stuff.</li>
            <li> i wish more people were like mood and mind.</li>
            <li> you feel serene :)</li>
            <li> mixed with lotus leaves, these are awesome!</li>
            <li> It works well â€” I love making sacred lotus wine with this.</li>
            <li> but i imagine with filters they would be ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;Smoking out is smooth and its effects are relaxing not song but relaxing like a warm tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more so we followed it up with some sativa herb.</li>
            <li> I tried smoking it and as a tea, I think the tea worked better.</li>
            <li> have heard it is best steeped in wine for several days</li>
            <li> I also enjoyed it with the calming effects of California Poppy.</li>
            <li> Worked much better than I hoped.</li>
            <li> It seems fresh and good quality, as described.</li>
            <li> and I always love when that happens..</li>
            <li> And on top of all that they included a sample that I did not expect.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast product was great, just ordered 2 more oz.</li>
            <li> Im glad I bought this</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recomend it to others</li>
            <li> It was nicely and securely packaged.</li>
            <li> Packaging was phenomenal.</li>
            <li> best mixed with a flavored tea...</li>
            <li> it can most assuredly be smoked, steeped.</li>
            <li> Gonna get a lot more.</li>
            <li> Interesting stuff</li>
            <li> makes a bit sleepy, nothing more</li>
            <li> I received the product lightning fast, it was of good quality, had a nice smell to it, and it lived up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> Plus, came with a free sample!</li>
            <li> Interesting stuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s uses are so varied that there are many volumes of literature for their usage.</li>
            <li> It did not appear to be smoke able</li>
            <li> Decent smoke on its own, not to strong but good taste.</li>
            <li> Smoking seems to give the most effect, although I made a wine with it and it was quite strong</li>
            <li> but it was just as smoke able as tobacco, and it was very mild with a relaxing effect.</li>
            <li> it was everything i wanted and more it was packed well and had a free sample witch i may buy some because i like it.</li>
            <li> In combination with something like Cannabis, the effects are very synergistic, good for bowls before bedtime.</li>
            <li> Good buy and fast service .</li>
            <li> We smoke this  with other herbs and its the best.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, fresh, and a great herb.</li>
            <li> Decent resealable packaging, good quality product.</li>
            <li> The product itself is average at best.  </li>
            <li> Super cute.</li>
            <li> For a National Flower of India &amp; Vietnam we are lucky to be able to try this ancient flower.</li>
            <li> Great product, they even gave me a free blue lotus extract sample.</li>
            <li> I filled my tea infuser ball up halfway and steeped for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Smooth stamens.</li>
            <li> I read a great deal of web-lore regarding Nelumbo nucifera prior to my purchase of a quantity of its stamens.</li>
            <li> I received my package within the week of ordering, which was fabulous.  </li>
            <li> it came with a free 5g bag of Kratom.  </li>
            <li> This product along with lotus leaves gives me a calm feeling I will order more</li>
            <li> The stamens are by far the most effective</li>
            <li> I blend it with other herbs for my pipe, nice and smooth, also good by itself.</li>
            <li> well Great Value&lt;br /&gt;Creates sense of euphoria, calming, and is quite nice before bed due to its calm relaxing</li>
            <li> Since it is legal, I packed a bowl and hit these - pretty good smoke.</li>
            <li> this stuff gets you a relaxed amazing high if you smoke 4 bowls of it in a pipe.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for a nice feeling, relaxing smoke.</li>
            <li> It was well worth the two week wait!</li>
            <li> But well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> have yet to ferment Lotus Beer (my original intention for ordering the stamens) or use</li>
            <li> (remember alkoloids usually work best with a catalyst)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nelumbo Nacafera is quite unique.</li>
            <li> -&lt;br /&gt;By itself, the stamens taste sorta sweet, smoke is very smooth and enjoyable, harshness is nearly non-existent.</li>
            <li> Taste is ok but kind of sticks with you in an almost gross way.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and airtight plus it came with a free sample of another organic extract.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and it&#x27;s a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> This is more effect when taken with other herbs, I prefer kanna as a good pairing.</li>
            <li> good mixed with mugwart</li>
            <li> Good for people who are trying to cut back on smoking or switch to a healthier alternative.</li>
            <li> Perfect for when your running low on supply and don&#x27;t wanna roll a toothpick, fatten that sucker up with lotus and your good to go.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very light and pleasant and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> OK product and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> smell is sweet and is generally mild when inhaling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The user found it to be a very pleasant product and will hope to enjoy including and personal pain management and wellness regimens in the future.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Tea-&lt;br /&gt;The stamens make an excellent herbal tea with subtle euphoria and sedation, attributable to the alkaloids aporhine and nuciferine.</li>
            <li> As a tea it was a mild relaxant, I prefer mugwort tea over this if that&#x27;s the effect you are looking for.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotus seems to give a nice mind shift, giving a general feeling of relaxation.</li>
            <li> product works amazingly well, but if you are expecting to use it to get a \\&quot;legal\\&quot; high... granted it will, in large quantities.</li>
            <li> This Item arrived quickly, and is extremely fresh.</li>
            <li> I brewed it as a tea with a unique taste, no sugar at first but then added a bit.</li>
            <li> Gives a very enjoyable high when smoked alone and if enough is smoked you get some very mild visuals.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing, smooth blend</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but the package I received had a dead bug in it, aside from that this truly is a 5 star product I&#x27;m writing this review now mellow, happy, and relaxed after smoking some of this.</li>
            <li> One thing that I did notice however is when I did fall asleep, I had a very deep and nice sleep.</li>
            <li> its worth noting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> A very warm fuzzy relaxed feeling but still clear headed enough to function normally.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great product, just takes a little time to ship!</li>
            <li> This takes my anxiety down better than most benzodiazepines.</li>
            <li> buzz is mild but is there, better when mixed.</li>
            <li> Best blue lotus product I&#x27;ve tried, just use a couple grams in with my other herbs for a night tea and it has noticeable benefits and even a bit of a positive mood boost.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleased with this vendor in general.</li>
            <li> I partook in the smoking of cannabis upon my first trial with the stamens nonetheless had a more clearness and vibrant high.</li>
            <li> Really did have some kind of neuropathic pain reduction, and possibly anti-inflammatory properties.  </li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast</li>
            <li> I have smoked some and found it somewhat harsh, but the effects beyond the harshness were pleasant and relaxing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall decent product, fantastic price, fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all for free international shipping.</li>
            <li> I first used this in a joint and that did nothing but burn my throat and tasted like a camp fire.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing!</li>
            <li> This stuff really works!  </li>
            <li> but I guess it&#x27;s ok overall.</li>
            <li> :) even came with a blue lotus sample!</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> The contents of the pouch of stamens smelled fresh, and were obviously very viable given the amount of pollen collected on the inside walls of said pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rolled a cigarette the evening of the product&#x27;s arrival.</li>
            <li> Mixed it with my favorite herb ;) and blended well.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> first experience with this type of product.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re soothing when used with a few grams, tastes good with chamomile, too.</li>
            <li> Very clean smoke, easy, slightly flowery.</li>
            <li> They were ok while I had them and, as far as legal smokeable herbs go, they&#x27;re pretty decent.</li>
            <li> This user also recommends the participation of the user in positive meditation or prayer being able to work with the product and improving the  overall outlook  of the user.</li>
            <li> ill order more soon all though i am not a wine drinker you can steep it in wine for 2 weeks and it would be good also from what i have heard.</li>
            <li> though, doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of a buzz and is probably a good waste of money.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any EXTRA side effects other then this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Vaporizing didn&#x27;t seem to do much, and research on it seemed to show a rather lower vape temp, but even at higher temperatures, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very nice opening feeling subtle in my head</li>
            <li> well honestly similar to a cannabis high except more controllable and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I have used a few different methods, with great results regardless.</li>
            <li> I make filtered cigarettes with it and the smoke is smooth enough to tear off the filter.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to do another batch.  </li>
            <li> Then I used it as tea and that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t tell much of any difference or calming effects.</li>
            <li> Very generous portions and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Smoked it straight with nothing else in a home made pipe.</li>
            <li> /&gt;***Many of the &#x27;absolute oils&#x27;</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item as described</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> No head buzz really.</li>
            <li> very relaxing smoke</li>
            <li> i dont really care about it but</li>
            <li> Are natural and Fresh Thank You</li>
            <li> I went back inside and drank my tea and just felt quite comfortable.</li>
            <li> it was packaged very well</li>
            <li> kratom sample worked very well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much</li>
            <li> I use it for anxiety and it really helps.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works way better than expected!</li>
            <li> With MJ it really enhances the high and you don&#x27;t feel as stuck, really helps with the paranoia too.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect anything too dramatic, but it&#x27;s great for what it is.</li>
            <li> Has a potent blue lotus effect, I&#x27;ve been told the effect is similar to zanex</li>
            <li> We were quickly pepped back up.</li>
            <li> and smoked with another \\&quot;herb\\&quot; has quite a positive and unexpected effect.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like k2 so if you want to get high</li>
            <li> It did not get me high</li>
            <li> The last order I received, the stamens were so fresh</li>
            <li> but it sure beats tobacco and being such a sacred long living plant</li>
            <li> as this is a first use of this type of product this user cannot say whether it is akin to the average experience with this type of herb while overall it would seem very positive and while  there is a possibility of some placebo effect this user believes that impact was real and positive and helpful with the desired effect that this user was seeking.</li>
            <li> A seasoned pot smoker won&#x27;t likely notice the effect, but if one is a newbie to psychoactive herbs, Nelumbo nucifera, as well as</li>
            <li> Definitely has some affect, more of a clear headedness, or empty headedness.  </li>
            <li> After an extreme clean of my home</li>
            <li> and I was mellow, relaxed, and stress free for like an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> This reviewer would recommend this product for anyone who wishes additional assistance with pain management or positive emotional enhancement.</li>
            <li> It was mild, the harshness was minimal, and after half a cigarette I was very well calm.</li>
            <li> I can never remember my dreams, but with this tea they are vivid and crystal clear.</li>
            <li> I bought lotus stamens several years ago and they worked very well and were not dried out like the pack I received from wiccanherbmaster.  </li>
            <li> This herb has been very helpful to me -- and because it is available at a sale price, I&#x27;m actually able to use it regularly despite my meager retirement income.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this from rattakorn online ( through amazon of course ) and they shipped it directly from thailand.</li>
            <li> though I don&#x27;t know because I&#x27;ve only tried zanex once and didn&#x27;t really like it.</li>
            <li> It took nearly 4 months for this to ship to me when the estimated time was just a week.  </li>
            <li> Smoking it left my friend and I with a very mellow relaxing sensation.</li>
            <li> Mellows you out when smoked and not harsh when smoked.  </li>
            <li> Really surprised.  </li>
            <li> not as noticeable as wild dagga, either smoked or in a drink.</li>
            <li> well packaged (professional) and looks just as pictured.</li>
            <li> it appeared to give a mild sense of positive feelings that is difficult to explain other than something that should be experienced and this may have also had A small additional assistance to pain control and pain management which is important to this review or who has the history of musculoskeletal accident related long term pain management needs.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t get you &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;, so don&#x27;t waste time if you are that kind of person but does add effect to other herbs and even alcohol.</li>
            <li> No buzz, no high, still talkative and social but calm.</li>
            <li> and i dont think it was human, 1-2 inch black on top, white on the bottom</li>
            <li> I heated up after about 20 minutes and felt like I had at church prayer services where I&#x27;ve had some profound answers to prayer.  </li>
            <li> Definitely buying again from @Mood&amp;Mind and definitely a high quality product</li>
            <li> Taste when smoking is slightly harsh but not bad</li>
            <li> An individual Lotus can live for 1000 year.</li>
            <li> Makes for a great smoke, mellows you out for hours and doesn&#x27;t even taste bad.</li>
            <li> I think this is going to be something I order on a regular basis as I am trying to work with my doctor to find natural treatments for my conditions.</li>
            <li> I have steeped it in wine, made a tea and smoked it and absolutely no effects, no matter how much I use.  </li>
            <li> the effect is small but there such ass a small relaxed physical sensation not to intense but nice.</li>
            <li> No, it will not give you a buzz, but if you have anxiety of any kind (gad, sad, hangover induced, weed induced etc.)</li>
            <li> Less harsh than the leaves, for sure.</li>
            <li> I think what I received was very old or was dried too much.  </li>
            <li> I took 2 oz every night for 3 noghts and had the same profound heat show up.  </li>
            <li> the little stamens are both a bit too long to make a good cigarette and just a little too short and thin to grind down effectively.</li>
            <li> The package has broken english, but is more or less understandable and quite funny.</li>
            <li> Smells weird but its great for everyday smokers like me.</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few types of lotus so far (whole flowers, leaf material, etc.).</li>
            <li> very relaxing smoking was too epeciallh when mixed with other herbs.</li>
            <li> My suggestion is to steep in a sweet wine for at least a couple hours.</li>
            <li> The oldest recorded Lotus germination being from seeds 1300 years old recovered from a dry lake bed in North East China.</li>
            <li> This will get you a high only if you smoke a lot and not very noticeable if you smoke weed regularly.  </li>
            <li> Try it in two presentations, the first was steeped initially in approximately a half an ounce of very clean tasteless vodka and then added to a regular sized cup of herbal tea</li>
            <li> it did not give any negative what one might state as elicit medicinal factors however when vaped and a standard retail herbal vaporizer hit it again appear to have some additional pain control capability and perhaps the same ability to enhance feelings of wellness or positive emotional state.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never tried it before, so I&#x27;m not sure of the quality etc, but the whole bag didnt seem to have any effect.</li>
            <li> This is not a strong or in any way overwhelming hErb no more than half teaspoon was used at any time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve yet to see the big names in aromatherapy stock the essential oil of Lotus, which is disappointing considering there is a mass of evidence, both scientific and anecdotal affirming that Nelumbo nucifera is a highly effective herbal sedative/relaxant with little to no detrimental effects on consciousness.</li>
            <li> the taste was so bad it was hard to keep from vomiting, overall this is worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li> I had several other bags of herbs next to it and no bugs were eating them, or any of the food in my pantry.</li>
            <li> I felt a small body high for like 3minutes</li>
            <li> Mind altering drugs have been used by almost every culture for centuries, and now because of misuse it is hard to find anything legal.  </li>
            <li> 4 months is too long a time to wait for a below par product.</li>
            <li> Ships from Rattakorn, Thailand and arrived earlier than the expected date.</li>
            <li> Stuff is pretty weak but it may just be me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relaxing, but not that different from other relaxing herbs.</li>
            <li> dry and filler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mixed with cannabis in my bong, effects are soothing with an odd floral taste.</li>
            <li> a pleasant taste though i hated the taste</li>
            <li> It arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> This was as expected, well packaged.</li>
            <li> You will likely need a pipe to smoke the stamens, as they do not grind up well at all when put into an herb grinder, joints can be used but will need to be packed very tightly to hold a cherry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Felt like a message from the other side.  </li>
            <li> They can also cause Ptosis, cataplexy, and other intresting effects, reproductively speaking, to those who do not know to treat this substance with the respect it deserves.</li>
            <li> Experiment with other herbs</li>
            <li> I would recommend smoking this, alone or in conjunction with other medicinal herb.  </li>
            <li> I never felt any of the mood altering effects that the packaging and other people here talk about</li>
            <li> Of course, I&#x27;ve also been away from other herbal remedies for 2 years, so</li>
            <li> or any other method you can think of.</li>
            <li> I smoked 1 bowl and it was very rough to inhale.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical given my only experience with Lotus was with the petals, but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I have friends who come over for a cup of this (and some free therapy) when they are having a bad day.</li>
            <li> I have yet no notice negative effects from sporadic use, but I have heard headaches and nausea are possible if one is exorbitant in</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that there was a hair in the bag</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like grinding down some straw and smoking it.</li>
            <li> I found half of the bag of lotus stamens had turned to dust and holes in the bag and a bunch of maggots underneath.</li>
            <li> It has a sourish taste and seems to be a slight anesthetic.</li>
            <li> Slight relaxing feeling</li>
            <li> and I felt a slight relaxing of my vascular brain</li>
            <li> I also purchased the loose Mugwort tea, mix half a tablespoon of each wrapped/ tied in cheesecloth, add two small flavored green tea bags, add honey, seep in glass pitcher of hot water from the kettle, then keep in it the fridge and drink it cold.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like because they are little sticks.</li>
            <li> Smoked alone and with a little MJ.</li>
            <li> had to boil it in a pot with a little seeping</li>
            <li> net.added a little sugar and apple juice</li>
            <li> wayy to harsh on my lungs and makes me cough until i puke my guts out.</li>
            <li> I had it stored away in a plastic bag in my closet for a few months.</li>
            <li> What I received looks like dried out straw; not A+ by any stretch of the imagination.  </li>
            <li> Literally, the color of dried straw, not the color in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Has a very subtle calming effect that seems to last a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Came</li>
            <li> Not strong</li>
            <li> The alkaloids within are cardioactive, usually prolonging the Q-T interval, and ocasionally causing SVT.</li>
            <li> Not many complaints, but no reason for praise.  </li>
            <li> Have ordered a few times and probably will again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen on online smartshops are actually preparations of Nymphaea caerulea, or even simply fragrance in an oil base.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel anything for at least 2 hours</li>
            <li> , felt really thick, probably from a horse or something.</li>
            <li> The product itself is a bit annoying to use, and I won&#x27;t be using much do to the amount needed to inhale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any effects from it other than I had a nasty aftertaste in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the taste unpleasant at all, would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> I will say It&#x27;s very difficult to smoke in a joint though as it goes out constantly and</li>
            <li> The smoking of it reminds me of pumpkins in a subtle way.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a tense day and need to just relax a tea brewed with these will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Tastes a little weird.</li>
            <li> They would occasionally bite and I was getting really bad sleep because of it.</li>
            <li> Felt nothing but tired.</li>
            <li> I had a weird experience with songs playing on my ipod twice that were not on my music app.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Toss&#x27;d into Angry Orchard Elderflower cider, quite lovely.&lt;br /&gt;Smoked,</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as I&#x27;m newer to lotus botanicals.</li>
            <li> It was the worst couple of dollars I have ever spent.</li>
            <li> For all of those who may not know it, this can be a particularly dangerous plant if you don&#x27;t know what your doing.</li>
            <li> You are not going to hallucinate or go on a bad trip with this, but it did something.  </li>
            <li> Quality and in expensive!!</li>
            <li> Hate it .  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband likes this product more than I do. When using in a tea infuser you may want to use more than an ounce. Someone had said they smoked it, I never tried that as I do not smoke. When I drank  it in tea I filled my tea infuser ball up halfway and steeped for 10 minutes. I didn&#x27;t feel anything for at least 2 hours and then I just felt slightly more relaxed. One thing that I did notice however is when I did fall asleep, I had a very deep and nice sleep. That&#x27;s why I am giving this product a 3 because it isn&#x27;t quite calming, however, it does help you stay asleep and wake up feeling refreshed.</li>
            <li> Got as a package deal. Didn&#x27;t like because they are little sticks.</li>
            <li> good mixed with mugwart</li>
            <li> It was the worst couple of dollars I have ever spent. Don&#x27;t listen to these people who give it good reviews. I would have been more satisfied if I took the money and threw it away</li>
            <li> I ordered this from rattakorn online ( through amazon of course ) and they shipped it directly from thailand. It only took 15 days to get here! Not bad at all for free international shipping. The quality of the product is very good, the best blue lotus I&#x27;ve ever had. I haven&#x27;t made tea with it as I ordered it for smoking. I make filtered cigarettes with it and the smoke is smooth enough to tear off the filter. Has a potent blue lotus effect, I&#x27;ve been told the effect is similar to zanex though I don&#x27;t know because I&#x27;ve only tried zanex once and didn&#x27;t really like it. But I love the effect of this stuff. I highly recommend this for a nice feeling, relaxing smoke. It was well worth the two week wait!</li>
            <li> it was everything i wanted and more it was packed well and had a free sample witch i may buy some because i like it. they know how to make a person happy. i dont know if people take this stuff to get \\&quot;high\\&quot; but i take it because i know a lot about it and i know how it makes you feel and i brew beer and know how to use it and i know that you cant buy blue louts beer.. so i know what i am doing.  i wish more people were like mood and mind. thanks</li>
            <li> All my friends love lotus now because of me! Lotus makings you feel serene :) Lifts your mood and calms at the same time! We smoke this  with other herbs and its the best.</li>
            <li> I mixed these with some wine and waited.  After a week I drank about 2 oz and meditated.  I had a mandala show up.  I heated up after about 20 minutes and felt like I had at church prayer services where I&#x27;ve had some profound answers to prayer.  I took 2 oz every night for 3 noghts and had the same profound heat show up.  I had a weird experience with songs playing on my ipod twice that were not on my music app.  Six months later I have never had the ipod do that before or since.  Felt like a message from the other side.  Mind altering drugs have been used by almost every culture for centuries, and now because of misuse it is hard to find anything legal.  You are not going to hallucinate or go on a bad trip with this, but it did something.  I made some for family members, but have no feedback from them yet.  I am getting ready to do another batch.  If you want a spiritual experience I would definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> great but took months to get here</li>
            <li> For all of those who may not know it, this can be a particularly dangerous plant if you don&#x27;t know what your doing. The alkaloids within are cardioactive, usually prolonging the Q-T interval, and ocasionally causing SVT. They can also cause Ptosis, cataplexy, and other intresting effects, reproductively speaking, to those who do not know to treat this substance with the respect it deserves.</li>
            <li> Smooth stamens. Since it is legal, I packed a bowl and hit these - pretty good smoke. Less harsh than the leaves, for sure.</li>
            <li> On their own, these aren&#x27;t that fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;But mixed with lotus leaves, these are awesome!</li>
            <li> I first used this in a joint and that did nothing but burn my throat and tasted like a camp fire. Then I used it as tea and that didn&#x27;t do much. I felt a small body high for like 3minutes</li>
            <li> It works well â€” I love making sacred lotus wine with this. Great for couples (;</li>
            <li> It took nearly 4 months for this to ship to me when the estimated time was just a week.  The product itself is average at best.  Not many complaints, but no reason for praise.  4 months is too long a time to wait for a below par product.</li>
            <li> wayy to harsh on my lungs and makes me cough until i puke my guts out. i rolled these into cigarettes without filters but i imagine with filters they would be ok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOT a pleasant taste though i hated the taste</li>
            <li> Great smoked or in tea. Experiment with other herbs</li>
            <li> Shipped from Thailand which is so incredible&lt;br /&gt;Smoking out is smooth and its effects are relaxing not song but relaxing like a warm tea&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smoking it left my friend and I with a very mellow relaxing sensation. No buzz, no high, still talkative and social but calm. Shared a one shotter, felt maybe a second packing would probably sedate us more so we followed it up with some sativa herb. We were quickly pepped back up. As a tea it was a mild relaxant, I prefer mugwort tea over this if that&#x27;s the effect you are looking for. Taste when smoking is slightly harsh but not bad, as a tea it had a flowery scent and taste. Very light and pleasant and not strong at all.</li>
            <li> I had it stored away in a plastic bag in my closet for a few months. I started getting a bug infestation in my bedroom and had no idea where they were coming from. There were a lot of really tiny flying beetle-like insects. They would occasionally bite and I was getting really bad sleep because of it. After an extreme clean of my home I found half of the bag of lotus stamens had turned to dust and holes in the bag and a bunch of maggots underneath. I had several other bags of herbs next to it and no bugs were eating them, or any of the food in my pantry. It was all centered around this product.</li>
            <li> Kinda like eating/drinking straw. Couldn&#x27;t tell much of any difference or calming effects.</li>
            <li> Just WOW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works way better than expected! Smoking or as a tea.... Very relaxing!</li>
            <li> Decent resealable packaging, good quality product. Works well for anxiety/depression without getting too drugged feeling. Helps some with pain as well. I tried smoking it and as a tea, I think the tea worked better. A very warm fuzzy relaxed feeling but still clear headed enough to function normally.&lt;br /&gt;I have heard it is best steeped in wine for several days but I have not tried it yet.&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t go wrong for the price. I think this is going to be something I order on a regular basis as I am trying to work with my doctor to find natural treatments for my conditions.</li>
            <li> Very generous portions and fast shipping.  I have used this quite a bit and am very pleased.</li>
            <li> loved the stamens. ill order more soon all though i am not a wine drinker you can steep it in wine for 2 weeks and it would be good also from what i have heard.</li>
            <li> Quality and in expensive!!</li>
            <li> Ah this stuff is wonderful to make in tea, it has very relaxing qualities to it. I don&#x27;t find the taste unpleasant at all, would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> Great product, just takes a little time to ship! But well worth the wait! Have ordered a few times and probably will again!</li>
            <li> Really did have some kind of neuropathic pain reduction, and possibly anti-inflammatory properties.  I would recommend smoking this, alone or in conjunction with other medicinal herb.  I also enjoyed it with the calming effects of California Poppy.</li>
            <li> Does have a noticeable effect. Not strong but it is relaxing.</li>
            <li> Excellent natural tea that calms and helps me sleep, and I feel balanced/ centered during the day. I also purchased the loose Mugwort tea, mix half a tablespoon of each wrapped/ tied in cheesecloth, add two small flavored green tea bags, add honey, seep in glass pitcher of hot water from the kettle, then keep in it the fridge and drink it cold.</li>
            <li> Good brand.  This stuff really works!  Mellows you out when smoked and not harsh when smoked.  The smoking of it reminds me of pumpkins in a subtle way.</li>
            <li> This lotus is great. Good potency. My suggestion is to steep in a sweet wine for at least a couple hours.</li>
            <li> Taste is ok but kind of sticks with you in an almost gross way. I never felt any of the mood altering effects that the packaging and other people here talk about but I guess it&#x27;s ok overall. I will say It&#x27;s very difficult to smoke in a joint though as it goes out constantly and the little stamens are both a bit too long to make a good cigarette and just a little too short and thin to grind down effectively. 3 stars at a push. They were ok while I had them and, as far as legal smokeable herbs go, they&#x27;re pretty decent. Probably won&#x27;t buy them again though.</li>
            <li> It has a sourish taste and seems to be a slight anesthetic.</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time. The Stamens are in good shape. I have used a few different methods, with great results regardless. I find this to be a light and pleasant mood enhancer with an aphrodisiac-like quality. I have also found that it helps with having pleasant dreams.</li>
            <li> Worked much better than I hoped. Smoked it straight with nothing else in a home made pipe. Going to try to roll it next. Hope it wasn&#x27;t a fluke cause I only took three hits and I was mellow, relaxed, and stress free for like an hour and a half.</li>
            <li> The stamens make for good tea and they&#x27;re soothing when used with a few grams, tastes good with chamomile, too.</li>
            <li> I read a great deal of web-lore regarding Nelumbo nucifera prior to my purchase of a quantity of its stamens. Since then, I have had the pleasure to explore the use of &#x27;Lian xu&#x27; as it is called in TCM, in several mediums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smoking -&lt;br /&gt;By itself, the stamens taste sorta sweet, smoke is very smooth and enjoyable, harshness is nearly non-existent. In combination with something like Cannabis, the effects are very synergistic, good for bowls before bedtime. You will likely need a pipe to smoke the stamens, as they do not grind up well at all when put into an herb grinder, joints can be used but will need to be packed very tightly to hold a cherry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tea-&lt;br /&gt;The stamens make an excellent herbal tea with subtle euphoria and sedation, attributable to the alkaloids aporhine and nuciferine. A seasoned pot smoker won&#x27;t likely notice the effect, but if one is a newbie to psychoactive herbs, Nelumbo nucifera, as well as it&#x27;s cousin, Nymphaea caerulea, would be VERY easy to begin with. Taken before bed, the tea acts as an oneirogen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to ferment Lotus Beer (my original intention for ordering the stamens) or use it&#x27;s essential oil***. I have yet no notice negative effects from sporadic use, but I have heard headaches and nausea are possible if one is exorbitant in it&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Many of the &#x27;absolute oils&#x27; I&#x27;ve seen on online smartshops are actually preparations of Nymphaea caerulea, or even simply fragrance in an oil base. I&#x27;ve yet to see the big names in aromatherapy stock the essential oil of Lotus, which is disappointing considering there is a mass of evidence, both scientific and anecdotal affirming that Nelumbo nucifera is a highly effective herbal sedative/relaxant with little to no detrimental effects on consciousness.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing, smooth blend</li>
            <li> This herb had no noticeable benefits for me. I tried consuming it in a couple of different ways and amounts. Your experience may differ. It seems fresh and good quality, as described. Arrived quickly. I&#x27;ve been pleased with this vendor in general.</li>
            <li> I like it. I blend it with other herbs for my pipe, nice and smooth, also good by itself. I also make tea with it. It arrived before expected. I would definitely buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Good buy and fast service .</li>
            <li> Fast shipping item as described</li>
            <li> Ive tried a few types of lotus so far (whole flowers, leaf material, etc.). The stamens are by far the most effective no matter what  you use them for.</li>
            <li> Great product! Fast shipping</li>
            <li> I am happy with my purchase, as I am with all of my purchases from wiccanherbmaster. I have found them to be the best vendors on amazon, as far as quality, variety, and costliness is concerned.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant for herbal tea, (produces a very nice floral aroma and taste,) but definitely does not produce sedative-like effects.</li>
            <li> Good seller: premium quality at a fair rate.</li>
            <li> Stuff is pretty weak but it may just be me.</li>
            <li> A+ shipping.. this stuff gets you a relaxed amazing high if you smoke 4 bowls of it in a pipe. It made me quit tobacco and well honestly similar to a cannabis high except more controllable and relaxing. Smells weird but its great for everyday smokers like me. Haven&#x27;t brewed into a tea or something but I can imagine good results :) even came with a blue lotus sample! Definitely buying again from @Mood&amp;Mind and definitely a high quality product</li>
            <li> Great product, they even gave me a free blue lotus extract sample.</li>
            <li> I bought it to smoke. Slight relaxing feeling I guess? Tastes a little weird. No head buzz really. Got what I paid for.</li>
            <li> Felt nothing but tired.</li>
            <li> The shipping was super fast and I always love when that happens..the lotus stamens are seriously good and went beyond my expectations...very relaxing smoke but I will add them to wine soon and see how it goes.  Just opening the bag and taking in the aroma I knew it was a quality product... And on top of all that they included a sample that I did not expect.</li>
            <li> Very satisfying, smooth and pleasent aroma</li>
            <li> Smoking seems to give the most effect, although I made a wine with it and it was quite strong the taste was so bad it was hard to keep from vomiting, overall this is worth the money for sure.</li>
            <li> Good herbs. Smoked alone and with a little MJ. Both experiencs where great. Gives a very enjoyable high when smoked alone and if enough is smoked you get some very mild visuals. With MJ it really enhances the high and you don&#x27;t feel as stuck, really helps with the paranoia too. I&#x27;d give this seller and product 6 out of 5 stars if I could. Shipping was fast product was great, just ordered 2 more oz.</li>
            <li> Best blue lotus product I&#x27;ve tried, just use a couple grams in with my other herbs for a night tea and it has noticeable benefits and even a bit of a positive mood boost.  Won&#x27;t get you &amp;#34;high&amp;#34;, so don&#x27;t waste time if you are that kind of person but does add effect to other herbs and even alcohol.</li>
            <li> Great tasting as a tea or smoked, add some warrior herb and ganja it makes your body feel tantric and your mind at ease. Im glad I bought this</li>
            <li> This is great for making tea, it gives a flavor you cant get anywhere else, and it also makes a most wonderful dye for fabric.</li>
            <li> Tasted so good.but I&#x27;m a tea drinker.no kettle had to boil it in a pot with a little seeping net.added a little sugar and apple juice it was great.felt the pain in my back melt away</li>
            <li> Hate it .  It was so gross.  I don&#x27;t want it.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars but the package I received had a dead bug in it, aside from that this truly is a 5 star product I&#x27;m writing this review now mellow, happy, and relaxed after smoking some of this. The product arrived quickly and airtight plus it came with a free sample of another organic extract.</li>
            <li> product came on time. was packaged nice. buzz is mild but is there, better when mixed. feels good after working out to loosen muscles. my only complaint is that there was a hair in the bag and i dont think it was human, 1-2 inch black on top, white on the bottom, felt really thick, probably from a horse or something. i dont really care about it but its worth noting.</li>
            <li> For the karma, one imagines that lotus stamens are fairly good stuff, if you&#x27;re a Buddhist like me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toss&#x27;d into Angry Orchard Elderflower cider, quite lovely.&lt;br /&gt;Smoked, dry and filler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> These work for relaxation. I and my son have anxiety. If you&#x27;ve had a tense day and need to just relax a tea brewed with these will do the trick. I haven&#x27;t experienced any EXTRA side effects other then this.</li>
            <li> I smoked 1 bowl and it was very rough to inhale. The taste isn&#x27;t good at all. It&#x27;s like grinding down some straw and smoking it. I didn&#x27;t really notice any effects from it other than I had a nasty aftertaste in my mouth. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you like inhaling campfire smoke.</li>
            <li> Nice smoke.  Like to smoke this while I relax.</li>
            <li> Gives me a &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; feeling. I make it as tea mixed with ginger.</li>
            <li> Are natural and Fresh Thank You</li>
            <li> Came as Described, On time shipping&lt;br /&gt;Worked well Great Value&lt;br /&gt;Creates sense of euphoria, calming, and is quite nice before bed due to its calm relaxing effect.&lt;br /&gt;If it stays affordable i will be a costumer for life!</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and it&#x27;s a fantastic product. Will definitely buy more.</li>
            <li> product is as advertised</li>
            <li> I use a combination of this, lavender, and organic tobacco in my hand rolled cigarettes. Amazing calming &amp; clearing effect. Good for people who are trying to cut back on smoking or switch to a healthier alternative.</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recomend it to others</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical given my only experience with Lotus was with the petals, but I was pleasantly surprised. I received my package within the week of ordering, which was fabulous.  It was nicely and securely packaged. The contents of the pouch of stamens smelled fresh, and were obviously very viable given the amount of pollen collected on the inside walls of said pouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rolled a cigarette the evening of the product&#x27;s arrival. It was mild, the harshness was minimal, and after half a cigarette I was very well calm. I went back inside and drank my tea and just felt quite comfortable. This is a great product. Of course, I&#x27;ve also been away from other herbal remedies for 2 years, so my tolerance is very low. This probably won&#x27;t work as well for others as it did for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff relaxed my muscles.&lt;br /&gt;I have muscle lockage from a medication and every time I took a hit, I could relax a bit.&lt;br /&gt;Still though, doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of a buzz and is probably a good waste of money.</li>
            <li> Makes for a great smoke, mellows you out for hours and doesn&#x27;t even taste bad.</li>
            <li> Decent smoke on its own, not to strong but good taste. Mixed it with my favorite herb ;) and blended well. Perfect for when your running low on supply and don&#x27;t wanna roll a toothpick, fatten that sucker up with lotus and your good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and you can&#x27;t beat the price ! Will definitely be getting more.</li>
            <li> it was packaged very well but i smoked it and tried it in a tea and it was discussing and gave me a head ache every time i used it.</li>
            <li> This will get you a high only if you smoke a lot and not very noticeable if you smoke weed regularly.  I received this on time, smelled great. Packaging was phenomenal. Super cute. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> great in tea, mild flavor, i like it best mixed with a flavored tea...relaxing, does what it purports</li>
            <li> Great Quality very pleased</li>
            <li> I dont know what to use this for, but i like it.</li>
            <li> good shipment ...just not my thing .</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture.  What I received looks like dried out straw; not A+ by any stretch of the imagination.  Literally, the color of dried straw, not the color in the picture.  I have steeped it in wine, made a tea and smoked it and absolutely no effects, no matter how much I use.  I think what I received was very old or was dried too much.  I bought lotus stamens several years ago and they worked very well and were not dried out like the pack I received from wiccanherbmaster.  I will have to find another source for lotus stamen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kratom sample worked very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relaxing, but not that different from other relaxing herbs.</li>
            <li> This is more effect when taken with other herbs, I prefer kanna as a good pairing. This was as expected, well packaged.</li>
            <li> product works amazingly well, but if you are expecting to use it to get a \\&quot;legal\\&quot; high... granted it will, in large quantities. but that isnt the inteded purpose. fimented in alcohol seems to be the most effective method. it can most assuredly be smoked, steeped. or any other method you can think of. steeping in a sweet...ish wine is best. and smoked with another \\&quot;herb\\&quot; has quite a positive and unexpected effect. (remember alkoloids usually work best with a catalyst)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;walk in peace.&lt;br /&gt;deadmandave</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do much</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as a tea, but was good otherwise.</li>
            <li> Really surprised.  This stuff is actually really good.</li>
            <li> Mixed with cannabis in my bong, effects are soothing with an odd floral taste. Tastes somewhat of pumpkin or squash when made into a tea. Ships from Rattakorn, Thailand and arrived earlier than the expected date. The package has broken english, but is more or less understandable and quite funny.</li>
            <li> Great quality! Wish I lived closer to you!</li>
            <li> not as noticeable as wild dagga, either smoked or in a drink. good to have for a chamomile type tea with a bit more than chamomile.</li>
            <li> It actually works. As soon as I opened it, I smoked some and experienced a strong pleasant effect. The effect only lasted about an hour, however. I was quite impressed with the swiftness of the delivery and the care taken in the packaging.</li>
            <li> Very nice opening feeling subtle in my head&lt;br /&gt;I get migraine headaches and I felt a slight relaxing of my vascular brain</li>
            <li> If your looking for blue lotus this is the stuff to get. Great effects. Great to add to hookah. Gonna get a lot more. If you&#x27;re thinking about getting some don&#x27;t hesitate! Ships from Florida got to me in a day</li>
            <li> OK product and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Interesting stuff, I make tea out of it. Has a very subtle calming effect that seems to last a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Came well packaged (professional) and looks just as pictured. Taste good too!</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as described. Good Job!!</li>
            <li> I partook in the smoking of cannabis upon my first trial with the stamens nonetheless had a more clearness and vibrant high. the effect is small but there such ass a small relaxed physical sensation not to intense but nice.</li>
            <li> It is nothing like k2 so if you want to get high this is not what u need.</li>
            <li> makes a bit sleepy, nothing more</li>
            <li> I received the product lightning fast, it was of good quality, had a nice smell to it, and it lived up to my expectations. The lotus seems to give a nice mind shift, giving a general feeling of relaxation. You can&#x27;t expect anything too dramatic, but it&#x27;s great for what it is.</li>
            <li> Definitely has some affect, more of a clear headedness, or empty headedness.  Downside is you have to have a LOT, to get the effect.  But what you do get is very good for meditation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is sweet and is generally mild when inhaling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaporizing didn&#x27;t seem to do much, and research on it seemed to show a rather lower vape temp, but even at higher temperatures, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall decent product, fantastic price, fast shipping.  The product itself is a bit annoying to use, and I won&#x27;t be using much do to the amount needed to inhale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also it came with a free 5g bag of Kratom.  I&#x27;ve never tried it before, so I&#x27;m not sure of the quality etc, but the whole bag didnt seem to have any effect.</li>
            <li> This Item arrived quickly, and is extremely fresh. I have smoked some and found it somewhat harsh, but the effects beyond the harshness were pleasant and relaxing. I am now steeping them in some wine and am confident that it will turn out nice based on the effectiveness of the smoke.</li>
            <li> Making this into tea was incredible. I was skeptical as I&#x27;m newer to lotus botanicals. Has an effect that washes stress and depression away. Plus, came with a free sample! Just ordered from them again, awesome shipping awesome quality.</li>
            <li> Great quality at an affordable price</li>
            <li> good quality, they even included a free extract sample. suppose to be the best part of the plant sellers site is legit</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, fresh, and a great herb. I like this herb, I mix it with mine smoking herbs. Like mugwort and or herbs. You can also mix it into tea. I like to smoke it. I got a good buzz when I mix it with mugwort.</li>
            <li> No effects when seeped with wine. Created a batch an let soak with wine for two weeks. No effects. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Very good stuff. I use it for anxiety and it really helps. It&#x27;s not placebo. This takes my anxiety down better than most benzodiazepines. No, it will not give you a buzz, but if you have anxiety of any kind (gad, sad, hangover induced, weed induced etc.) It&#x27;s worth a try. I have friends who come over for a cup of this (and some free therapy) when they are having a bad day. I always keep some on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, and it will give you the most amazing dreams for a night or two after you take it. I can never remember my dreams, but with this tea they are vivid and crystal clear. Interesting stuff.</li>
            <li> Was a great addition to my &#x27;routine&#x27;. Very clean smoke, easy, slightly flowery.</li>
            <li> GREAT SALE!  RE-ORDERING NOW...  This herb has been very helpful to me -- and because it is available at a sale price, I&#x27;m actually able to use it regularly despite my meager retirement income.  The last order I received, the stamens were so fresh they were still a bit waxy.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Nelumbo Nacafera is quite unique. It is the National Flower of both India &amp; Vietnam. The seeds can remain viable for ages. The oldest recorded Lotus germination being from seeds 1300 years old recovered from a dry lake bed in North East China. The lotus is an aquatic perennial. An individual Lotus can live for 1000 year. It&#x27;s uses are so varied that there are many volumes of literature for their usage. I purchased a pouch and read that some reviewers smoke it. It did not appear to be smoke able but it was just as smoke able as tobacco, and it was very mild with a relaxing effect. It did not get me high but it sure beats tobacco and being such a sacred long living plant I was very fortunate to try this sacred plant. I brewed it as a tea with a unique taste, no sugar at first but then added a bit. For a National Flower of India &amp; Vietnam we are lucky to be able to try this ancient flower.</li>
            <li> for the time i had this product it was great until it some how vanished from my room and i cant find it now.</li>
            <li> Loved the tea it was delicious very relaxing smoking was too epeciallh when mixed with other herbs.</li>
            <li> This product along with lotus leaves gives me a calm feeling I will order more</li>
            <li> first experience with this type of product. Try it in two presentations, the first was steeped initially in approximately a half an ounce of very clean tasteless vodka and then added to a regular sized cup of herbal tea it appeared to give a mild sense of positive feelings that is difficult to explain other than something that should be experienced and this may have also had A small additional assistance to pain control and pain management which is important to this review or who has the history of musculoskeletal accident related long term pain management needs. it did not give any negative what one might state as elicit medicinal factors however when vaped and a standard retail herbal vaporizer hit it again appear to have some additional pain control capability and perhaps the same ability to enhance feelings of wellness or positive emotional state. This is not a strong or in any way overwhelming hErb no more than half teaspoon was used at any time. The user found it to be a very pleasant product and will hope to enjoy including and personal pain management and wellness regimens in the future. The vapor given off in this users vaping equipment was very pleasant with no odd flavors or scents. as this is a first use of this type of product this user cannot say whether it is akin to the average experience with this type of herb while overall it would seem very positive and while  there is a possibility of some placebo effect this user believes that impact was real and positive and helpful with the desired effect that this user was seeking. This reviewer would recommend this product for anyone who wishes additional assistance with pain management or positive emotional enhancement. This user also recommends the participation of the user in positive meditation or prayer being able to work with the product and improving the  overall outlook  of the user. Again no truly strong pharmacological impacts with this product however it is very pleasant and positive.</li>
